Chatting with guests upon check in lets me not only tell them what a great city Boston is and how much it has to offer but to also listen to stories of where they live or have been to. That's what makes Airbnb such a great community builder in my mind - connecting people from all parts and walks of life.,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just like all of the travelers that I've hosted,I am a traveler myself - having been to a number of countries in Central Asia,Europe,I make sure to find a local connection to tell me about places off the beaten path that a tourist guide might miss,and if all else fails - I just enjoy seeing where my feet (or a local bus/train/subway) take me.

Our December 14 concert fades in. It was just after the senseless deaths of NewTown CT school children. Reuben,our director,"introduced us singing Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah and I don't remember his exact words but they went something like... \"\"Today people asked me how we could be singing at a time like this",singing Hallelujah. Cohen's,Hallelujah,"a song of praise. A song that has more than 100 verses.\"\" He went on. \"\"A song that needs so many verses because Cohen's asking...

Chatting with guests upon check in lets me not only tell them what a great city Boston is and how much it has to offer but to also listen to stories of where they live or have been to. That's what makes Airbnb such a great community builder in my mind - connecting people from all parts and walks of life.,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just like all of the travelers that I've hosted,I am a traveler myself - having been to a number of countries in Central Asia,Europe,I make sure to find a local connection to tell me about places off the beaten path that a tourist guide might miss,and if all else fails - I just enjoy seeing where my feet (or a local bus/train/subway) take me. So if you're looking for the best Ethiopian food in Boston or a little known museum (a whole room of the most realistic glass flowers hand blown in the 19th century),I can definitely point you in the right direction.,,No description,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,
