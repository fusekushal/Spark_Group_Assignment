9107357,95978202,2016-08-21,5450766,Chris,"Kevin is an excellent host. Everything was well-communicated from start to finish. He arranged for a professional B'n'B caretaker service to drop off our keys on our night of arrival. His friendly neighbor, Thomas, was on hand to let us into the apartment after an accidental lock-out a few days later!"
The apartment itself is very tastefully decorated. Every type of mod con is provided - towels,soaps,cutlery,bowls,plates,toaster
The neighborhood is also second-to-none. Kevin's place is right in the heart of Beacon Hill. We were pleasantly surprised that such a modern,well-kept,"centrally located AirBnB didn't cost an absolute fortune. It was a truly fantastic introduction to Boston; we would certainly stay here again and recommend to friends or family in the near future. \"",,,

13081090,92435115,2016-08-08,28495923,Tracey,"The location was perfect! We walked a lot, but it was nice having everything in walking distance. Cafe Nero is just down the street and is a great place to get breakfast. My husband and I travelled with another couple and we loved having our own bathrooms right off our bedrooms. The couch could have been a little comfier, but we were rarely at the condo because there was too much to do and see in Boston. Definitely would go back!"
13081090,95329963,2016-08-19,76277991,Deborah,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
13081090,95981278,2016-08-21,85742985,Yuanxi,"The listing was accurate to the description. Located near Boston Commons, just a few minutes walking distance from Boylston/Park station (a huge plus!). Self check-in and check-out: instructions were emailed promptly and easy to follow. Kitchen and bathrooms are fully equipped. There were plenty of space for our group of 4 people."
13081090,97521159,2016-08-27,15750254,Kurt,My colleague and I had a great time. The location is really amazing if you have an office in downtown Boston or are looking for a hub to venture out to explore the historic city center of Boston.

Die Lage ist zentral,wenige Minuten zu Fuß zum Boston Common und in die Altstadt. Das Haus und die Straße waren ruhig. Wenige Häuser weiter gibt es im Supermarkt alles zu kaufen,was man im Urlaub braucht,außerdem Gastronomie. Wer mit dem Auto anreist,kann sein Gepäck in die Wohnung bringen und dann in ein Parkhaus fahren. Patrick hat uns gute Tipps gegeben.,
Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt.,,,,,
Wenn wir nochmal nach Boston reisen,würden wir versuchen,"wieder bei Patrick zu wohnen.\"",,,

"The location is perfect for discovering Boston by foot.\"",,,,,
6677640,88486938,2016-07-24,73922604,Simon,"We had everything we needed and even more. There was a folder in which we were given tips for groceries, restaurants, shopping and sightseeing, as well as where to find what in the apartment. There even was a little welcome treat. The apartment was very nice and flooded by sunlight. The highlight was the terrace. Shops for food and drinks were very close by, restaurants were too. I would love to go there again."

She checked on me the next day and was very kind in allowing me to stay past the official check out time.,,,,,
The room is clean with plenty of storage and as beautiful as in the pictures.,,,,,
The shared bathroom is not that great but ok.,,,,,
"Location is very good on a quiet street close to Boston University west campus.\"",,,,,
13415816,87698769,2016-07-21,42231193,Danny,The bedroom is nice and the desk is really helpful for those who need to work on the laptop. There is plenty of storage in the closet. The shared bathroom is good but could be cleaner. Chole was very helpful with some advice to get a cab from the apartment. The neighbourhood is really calm and close to some restaurants and supermarkets. It was also good to be close to a branch of the Metro Green Line.
14536322,99937705,2016-09-06,91680905,Alexander,Great room in a clean house!

4107959,31153361,2015-05-02,23404943,Manolis,"I stayed to Paul’s place overnight with a friend. Paul was a great host! Very polite, discreet and very nice person. The room is nice and clean in a two bedrooms apartment. The queen size bed was comfortable. Also the apartment is not far from the maverick tube station, which is convenient from and to the Logan airport but also to get downtown."
I would definitely stay again at Paul’s when I visit Boston.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
4107959,32845984,2015-05-22,20952699,Ajit,"Paul is an excellent host, truly concerned about the guest comfort. Apartment is in a location which very convenient for downtown Boston.

"Merci \"",,,,,
4107959,33385058,2015-05-27,32020552,Brett,"This was my first time using AirBnB, and it was great.  The room was exactly as described.  Paul was a great host, and did all kinds of little things like have fresh soap in the bathroom, and a water carafe by the bedroom.  He was very polite, and accommodating.  My girlfriend and I were only in Boston for 2 days and 1 night, and spent most of the time touring around the North End and Cambridge.  The location was perfect in that it was incredibly easy to get from the airport to the apartment, and then to downtown, all through the Blue metro line.  In fact after we did the Freedom trail, we went back to the apartment to shower, and then back downtown for an Italian dinner in the North End, which took less than an hour and a half."
If you plan on staying in the apartment most of the time,then you might think it's small,and you should look for something else.,,,
"I would definitely stay here again.\"",,,,,
4107959,33757200,2015-05-31,6304694,John,"It was an absolute pleasure of a stay at Paul's apartment. Situated in East Boston, it is very close to the airport, while also only one T stop from downtown Boston."

4107959,35875645,2015-06-22,35610786,Andrei,"I stayed at Paul's for a week in late June 2015, and I couldn't have been happier. Paul's flat is very conveniently located, within 5 min. walk to Blue line and 5 min. ride to downtown Boston, and it's very close to the airport (but you won't hear much air traffic noise as planes come in from east, and south east)  The neighbourhood is quiet, there's a shop and a laundry just across the road, as well as a pizza place and a nice pie shop within 5-10 min. walk. Paul is a great host and made me feel very comfortable."
4107959,38470478,2015-07-15,27178606,Leslie,This place was awesome! Paul was an incredible host. He was very flexible with my arrival time and was quick with communication. He provided me with a great tour and detailed information on his home. Paul's place is so clean and the bed was very comfortable. He graciously offered to take me to the airport (this was even after I told him my flight left at 5:30am!) and had coffee ready and waiting for me when we left. I would highly recommend booking with Paul and I definitely will again when in the Boston area.

4107959,39465721,2015-07-23,8651260,Beth,Paul is a warm and gracious host and his place is lovely. He went out of his way to make me feel welcome.

A special touch was water by the bedside table. He helped us with the T and gave us a little history on the East End.  Would definitely recommend his place especially if you want to be close to the airport!  And a HUGE BONUS... Paul likes air conditioning!!  :)"
4107959,45539746,2015-09-03,28567273,Thomas,Stellar experience again.  Paul is the perfect host.
4107959,45958267,2015-09-07,5924102,Christoph,We had an awesome stay at Pauls place in Boston. He has been exceptionally generous and was super helpful when giving us advice where to go and what to see in the city.
The place is exactly as described,"very clean and in a great shape. The location is absolutely perfect to explore the city. The metro station is a quick 5min walk away and downtown Boston is just one stop away.\"",,,,
4107959,46579612,2015-09-12,30850895,Bob,This is only our second Airbnb experience & it was quite enjoyable.
The listing details are quite accurate as are the photos.  Paul was unable to greet us in person due to an out-of-town commitment but we spoke over the phone several times. His friend Rob met us at the apartment and even helped carry our luggage to the second floor apartment.  Our room was spacious & the bed comfy.  The neighborhood is nice & we felt perfectly safe walking to the shipyard (1/2 mi to the east) for a meat pie & a pint at KO's an Aussie pub.,,,,,
Maverick MBTA (or just The T) station is a 5 block walk and was our gateway to exploring Boston. (We bought a week-long T pass ($19 ea) which paid for itself in three days.),,,,,
This is close to the airport so there is a little noise in the morning,especially if they are taking off to the west.,,,,
All in all,"this is a nice apartment in a nuce neighborhood.  Paul was a great host and kept in touch via msg to address any & all concerns we had.\"",,,,
4107959,47754968,2015-09-21,16283281,Bryan,"Quiet, clean room near Logan Airport.  Waling distance to the subway that takes you all over Boston.  The host gave me a ride to the airport for my super early flight the next day.  A+ service."
4107959,47777309,2015-09-21,21616287,Robert,"We had a great experience with Paul; everything worked out perfectly.  Paul's place is a short 5-10 minute walk from the T and 10 minutes from the airport.  His street is literally the name of the T stop so the apartment was very easy to find.  A convenience store is across the street.  The T, which was very easy to use even for us first time Boston visitors, connected easily and cheaply with everything downtown.  Paul's room, and the entire apartment, was very comfortable and clean, and the price was great, particularly compared to prices in Boston.  Paul was extremely helpful throughout all parts of the visit to make sure everything went well.  We had a great time in Boston and Paul and his place helped make it so.  We highly recommend staying with him."
4107959,48201531,2015-09-24,12589248,JoAnnn,We had a great experience with Paul.  It is a cute and quaint place in East Boston.  We loved the neighborhood and Paul was quite accommodating.  Paul offered some great recommendations.  I would definitely stay there again if I make my way to Boston again.
4107959,48698348,2015-09-28,13320943,Mei,"Paul is a sweet heart. He is a fine young man with a gentle loving spirit. He picked us up from the airport when we arrived and on the day we were leaving Boston, he delivered our luggage to the NorthEnd Metro station so we didn't have to drag them thru different Metro transfers. His apartment is very tastefully decorated. The apartment is just a few minutes walk from a Metro Station, so is very convent. I would recommend anyone who needs a place for few days while in Boston to stay with Paul."
4107959,49137351,2015-10-01,42950011,Ebrahim,Paul wins the title of 'Host of the Year!' He is my first AirBNB host and yet I don't hesitate one single bit in saying he's the best host I'll have for a LONG time! I only stayed with him for one night and it felt like I was staying with a friend that I've known for a while. I arrived to Boston on a business trip around 6:30 A.M. in the morning and he was kind enough to come and pick me up. My flight the next day was around the same time and Paul - of course - dropped me off at the airport even though he went to bed after midnight. I didn't even have to ask  for a ride!
From the first conversation we had,Paul was so kind and hospitable. He made me feel like I was home and provided everything I asked for. His apartment is cozy and cute. My room was just perfect. The bed was comfy and the shower was amazing. I didn't spend much time at the house as I was really busy,and I wish I had the chance to connect more with Paul. Maybe next time when I am in Boston!,,,
"I am SO  glad that I didn't stay in a hotel (I easily could since work pays for it) and ended up with Paul. Highly recommended!   \"",,,,,
4107959,49444676,2015-10-04,39891073,Lisa-Marie,"Paul was a great host. He picked us up from the airport and made us a perfect start in Boston.

4107959,50518883,2015-10-12,44788462,Megan,Paul is the best. The place was super clean. The bed was comfortable. Paul was easy to reach before and during our stay to address any concerns. We got a great deal on a place close to downtown Boston. Walking distance to the T and 1 stop from Boston proper.  I would highly recommend.
4107959,50687156,2015-10-13,45207336,Andrea,Paul was amazing! We couldn't have asked for a better place or a better host. Great at communicating.. Nice location.. And he even drove us to the airport. We would definitely go back!

The location is really convenient as it is only a 5 minute walk to the train into downtown (another 5-10 minute ride.) Would definitely recommend a stay at his place in the future!
4107959,52434967,2015-10-29,30497019,Branden & Tiffany,Paul was very welcoming and kind. Place we immaculate. He checked in via text to ensure everything was great. Soft bed with plenty of pillows. Great Wifi. Everything was fantastic. Absolutely would stay with Paul again.

The apartment is exactly as it looks in the photos and very clean! I would definitely recommend staying here if you have a trip to Boston especially if you are flying into Logan as his place is very close to the airport! Paul himself was a very personable host and went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable and coordinate arrival times.
4107959,53582821,2015-11-09,16938043,Mags,"Paul is undoubtably the perfect host. His home is warm, comfortable and welcoming.

4107959,55802330,2015-12-06,34691568,Angela,"Paul was absolutely endearing - he was so warm and welcoming and made us feel right at home on our very first trip to the United States. He not only patiently answered all our queries and provided us with helpful tips, he went all the way to make us feel comfortable, well taken care of and even gave us a lift to the airport on the last day. Everything in the apartment was as described, and we had a really cosy stay. We are glad to leave Boston with not just an amazing Airbnb experience, but a new friend found. Thank you so much again Paul for the warm hospitality, we can't wait to bring you around Singapore if given a chance! :)"

His home is just as pictured, clean and comfortable. Paul is so easy to talk to. He spent time helping us plan a walking tour, he gave us directions on how to use the subway and how to easily get back to the airport (which is a quick subway ride and a free bus shuttle that takes you right to your terminal).  We have already talked about planning another trip to Boston and staying with Paul again!  Thank you for everything Paul!!"

4107959,72946363,2016-05-05,25909247,Madelyn,"Paul was a great host! Very responsive to questions and requests and attentive to detail. The apartment is very attractive, clean and comfortable, quite welcoming after a long day sightseeing or on business. The location in East Boston is very convenient to Logan Airport and not far from the Boston waterfront downtown. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in the apartment."
4107959,76484917,2016-05-27,32186039,Liu,"Paul is an awesome host, friendly and amiable.  The room and apartment are extremely neat and tidy. He is very helpful and gave us many suggestions on where to go in Boston. We had a great conversation. He is always reachable and really cares for our itinerary. The neighborhood is quiet and the apartment is 5 min walk from train station and really close to the airport - great location! It has been a really awesome stay and I would highly recommend this place."
4107959,77246824,2016-05-30,66885101,Brandon,Paul's place was exactly as described and meticulously detailed. He was a gracious host that made our stay simple and easy. The apartment is a 5 minute walk to the subway and a 15 minute walk to the airport. His personal local food recommendations were some of the best we experienced in Boston!

4107959,80140015,2016-06-16,56309756,Leanne,Paul was welcoming and extremely helpful during our stay in Boston. He helped us with finding restaurants and getting around town. The location is so convenient to the airport and a simple T ride to downtown. His apartment was neat and clean and provided us with a perfect base to explore Boston. I would definitely stay here again.
4107959,80694140,2016-06-19,43124004,Philipp,"I stayed 2 nights with Paul. He was a great host, accommodating all of my needs, even my unfortunate late arrival time of 2:30am was not a problem. The room and apartment were clean and comfortable. The location is great if your flying into Boston and want a place in an up and coming neighborhood that is just one subway stop away from all down town attraction. Would highly recommend."
4107959,81185380,2016-06-21,78662408,Kara,Our host Paul was extremely accommodating with our short notice of stay; he was knowledgable about the area and he was very friendly and place was exactly what was posted which was very comforting!!!!

4107959,82239551,2016-06-27,30565258,Emmarie,Our stay at Paul's place was one of the reasons we enjoyed our Boston trip. The neighbourhood was lovely and the room was very clean and cozy. Paul was a magnificent host. He was there to converse with us but made sure we had enough privacy. I will definitely book his place again!
4107959,85367292,2016-07-11,1404792,Anneliese,Paul is an absolutely wonderful and charming host!  His cozy place is a great for our short stay in Boston.  We were able to take the free shuttle to the subway stop and then walk on a pedestrian path to his building.  Paul went way above and beyond by waking up at 4am to take us to the airport.  Our only wish is that we had been able to spend more time chatting with him.
4107959,86259584,2016-07-15,70391215,Ben,"My wife and I are happy to say that our first AirBnB experience was an overwhelmingly positive one. The accommodations were very cozy and yet fashionable, the location was perfect (right off a stop on the subway blue line) and, above all, the host Paul was delightful and friendly to work with. He clearly concerned himself with making sure we were comfortable and made us feel right at home. Thank you Paul, you're the best!"
4107959,86592581,2016-07-17,29019657,Tom,Thanks to Paul for a wonderful stay in a charming little apartment. He is very welcoming and personable.
The room is a very good size and bed is very comfortable.,,,,,

"Thanks Paul!\"",,,,,
4107959,87714949,2016-07-21,78608039,Karla,The private room apartment was located in an up and coming neighborhood and there were numerous restaurants within walking distance.  We enjoyed walking to Piers Park and seeing Boston Harbor.  Paul was very communicative and the process was very smooth and easy.
4107959,88212067,2016-07-23,34324014,Andrew,Paul was a great host and we loved his place. Looks just like the pictures and is super clean. Easy to get to from the airport and a quick metro ride into the city from his flat. Thank you so much for being a wonderful host Paul! Had a great time in Boston!!!
4107959,88432201,2016-07-24,15145174,Loran,"Paul was a wonderful and accommodating host. His apartment is great. I really liked the décor, which was a really cool blend of modern and classical. Bed was very comfortable and the room had its own AC, which was very helpful. Visitor parking was available right on the street outside."
4107959,90578265,2016-08-01,4785101,Tabris,"Very comfortable stay in a quaint neighborhood close to Boston downtown. The place is next to the airport and just a few minutes walk from the subway that takes you anywhere in Boston, very convenient."

4107959,91036987,2016-08-03,11978097,Achref,"Paul is a fantastic person and very hospitable. His apartment is comfortable, well decorated and within walking distance of the T blue line. I highly recommend staying with him."
4107959,91441859,2016-08-05,64592117,Nick & Rick,Perfect for staying close to the airport. Paul was very friendly and the accommodations were comfortable.
4107959,92336167,2016-08-08,18171857,Jess,"Paul is a wonderful host and I highly recommend him! Friendly, helpful and responsive with all our questions, Paul goes out of his way to make our stay smooth and enjoyable, even after flight delays and schedule changes. Apartment is nicely decorated, neat and clean, comfy chic-- accommodations and amenities didn't lack anything a traveler might need. Great location, next to the airport and only 5 minute leisure walk to the T, which is only one stop away from city proper (airport-Paul's-Aquarium). We both travel frequently around the world and our weekend stay with Paul was fantastic! 10/10 would recommend."
4107959,92694003,2016-08-09,40524705,Ron,Paul's hospitality went way beyond the norm. I loved the East Boston experience and the location of Paul's apartment to public transportation as well as the closeness of a short walk to Piers Park with an unbelievable view of the City of Boston.
4315439,54463194,2015-11-20,35883584,Alessio,"Nice place where to stay, close to the T station, good value for the price payed."
4652263,98117278,2016-08-29,79990710,Sat,"Host is very welcome and very helpful for my arrival. We went there because it close to Boston College.  The place is perfect for that purpose, especially for a dedicated car park. Have BC shuttle bus stop in front."
12103501,75684105,2016-05-22,68976405,Lucas,Marie is a nice host. She provides water and fruits and maintains the place clean. I've had a good stay and have nothing to complain.
12103501,83039201,2016-06-30,64403506,Steven,Really enjoyed my time in Boston. The location was perfect for my archive visit to JFK and the subway got me into the city centre in no less than 12 minutes. Awesome stuff. Cheers!
12103501,90582828,2016-08-01,80386594,Vivek,House is located at a very nice place if you are looking for public transport to downtown. Just 5 minutes walk to redville commuter line which takes you to south Boston station in just 15 minutes and T-redline a 15 minutes walk. Also walgreens is next to it.
"Marie is a very nice host. She is very helpful and always provided quick response whenever I had queries. I lived in the house for a month and it was a nice experience.\"",,,,,

13000520,75107925,2016-05-19,71315328,Daniel,"I had an amazing experience at Zoe's.  The bed is the most comfortable thing I've slept on, ever.  She was very accommodating and made me feel at home, offering coffee and bread.  I was going to a concert at the Citi Performing Arts Center, and her place is close enough to that part of downtown to get to quickly, but far enough away from the noise so you can get a good night's rest."
"I will definitely stay here again.  I highly recommend it!\"",,,,,
13000520,79245617,2016-06-12,71604637,Jonathan,"Zoe was very friendly,  accommodating, and helpful! She was easy-going and genuinely interested in meeting people. Quick responses too. The place was nice and clean, really good value. Nothing fancy but had everything you need! Shower, shampoo etc, basic breakfast stuff (toast, cereal) and coffee. Area is a quiet residential zone, not many things to do but the Green Line is very close so it's easy to get to the city. Also quite close to green areas like jamaica pond and the emerald necklace, and Brookline. Convenient if you're going to the Longwood area ~ 15mins on foot."
"I can definitely recommend staying here.\"",,,,,
13000520,88615076,2016-07-25,56931858,Lydia,The room was absolutely wonderful and matched the description perfectly. Zoe was a wonderful host and made sure I was accommodated fully even though we never got the chance to meet. Great location and very easy access.
13000520,89870075,2016-07-30,73258665,Omar,Zoe was amazing and very accomodating of my schedule. I was able to work remotely while living comfortably in her home. Across the streets there's a closed stairwell that serves as a great shaded chill spot if you want to smoke or relax. Overall great experience and very appreciative of Zoe!
13000520,91035412,2016-08-03,58094047,Alexander,"This apartment looks exactly like it does in the photos. The bed is very comfortable, sheets feel nice, and it's in a pretty quiet neighborhood. The apartment is fantastic and Zoey is a great host. She left bananas and cookies, milk and orange juice in the fridge which was very considerate. The only thing that might bother you if you don't have a car is that there really aren't many restaurants in walking distance from the apartment. Otherwise a 10/10 experience!"
13000520,91461022,2016-08-05,86582615,Timothy,Zoe was really responsive in her communications and the room was just as it was advertised - clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was fairly quiet and felt safe - with a few hilly streets for exercise!
13000520,92406957,2016-08-08,73557836,James,Zoe was a very responsive host and answered all my questions before my stay. Room was what I expected based on previous reviews. I was only there to sleep and shower. The area was a little questionable. I wouldn't walk around there at night by myself. But it was a 10 minute Uber to Fenway and a 15 minute ride to the lakefront and downtown tourist area. This was a great alternative if you don't want to pay the high prices for downtown Boston! I had a great stay and would stay again if I was in Boston.
13000520,93471458,2016-08-13,47003403,Ezra,"The apartment and room are simply designed and quiet, the perfect place to relax after a day of meetings and walking around Boston."
13000520,94369572,2016-08-15,73758113,Edward,"My only issue was that I never got to meet and thank her in person. Other than that, her hosting was exactly as it was advertised, and everything was prepared for my arrival. Very clean, very comfortable, good location from public transit and from the city center. I would not have a problem coming back here."
13592,126503,2010-10-25,237439,Anne,"\"We originally had booked a spot in Back Bay, but somehow our reservation was keyed in the wrong year.  Thus, a week before, Kitty called to say she'd placed us instead in the Fenway neighborhood, \"\"right by the other unit!\"\" and for our inconvenience we would be reimbursed $50 (it actually was $46).  Furthermore"
13592,126979,2010-10-25,259019,Benedict,"A great, last minute, no hassle deal!! Really nice and available everytime on the phone. Great location, tidy and pleanty of space. Thanks for everything!"
13592,592171,2011-10-03,973756,Christine,"Very easy to use, and we were able to store our luggage at an offsite location easily for the day.  Great experience!"
13592,990112,2012-03-12,798615,Nathan,"\"The apartment is swanky. Everyone was impressed when they first walked in. It has an interesting layout with lofted bedrooms overlooking the living room. The living room has nice high ceilings, the only ones in the apartment. In the bedrooms, no one over 5' 10\"\" can stand straight. It's not unusual for the layout"
So you'll want to spend most of your time in the living room,and if the pullout sofa is being used you would need to put it away during the day. We were in town for a conference and spent few waking hours in the apartment,so that didn't matter. There is a giant flat-screen television which we never turned on; it contributes to an overall bachelor pad feel of the place,but not offensively so.,,
Outside the apartment is less nice. The neighbors were noisy and the lobby is surprisingly shabby. Beacon St. itself is practically a highway,"with cars racing down wide lanes and button operated pedestrian signals that make sure a hundred autos can zoom by before you are able to cross. Also there's one of those unfortunate \"\"Cheers\"\" themed bars on Beacon. The good thing is","you are less than 10 minutes from Charles St. (It would be 5 minutes with more humane signaling: petition your unfriendly Boston DOT.)\"",,,
13592,1354734,2012-05-27,589393,Timothee,"Very convenient place, beautiful and very central."
"A little darker than in the pictures but a great experience\"",,,,,
13592,1599879,2012-07-01,1749705,Lisa,"The house was lovely.  The furnishings were quite nice, the place was clean and it is located in a great neighborhood which is close to all the action.  Unfortunately, when we arrived at check in time weary from travel, the cleaning crew was still there and had not yet finished.  This was inconvenient. There were 6 of us and from the photos of the place we thought there would be plenty of space but it turns out that not all the photos are actually of this specific rental. Beyond that, it was hot.  The one and only downstairs A/C unit did not stay on consistently which left the bedrooms very hot! This did not make for a great night's sleep. I would come back here but not in the summer and not with 6 people."
13592,3162008,2012-12-27,2559021,Tom,Fabulous location for an apartment that. Was very well equipped and quite comfortable.
13592,3744718,2013-03-11,4643429,Stephanie,"This was a great stay! The apartment was clean and cozy, and the kitchen was stocked with cooking utensils which we used in order to save money on eating out all the time. The kitchen had a dishwasher, which made clean-up easy. The bathrooms and bedrooms were tiny, city apartment sized, but very comfortable. We were in town for a convention, so we packed in the maximum six people, and didn't feel overly cramped. All in all we found this to be a great value and a fun place to stay. They were doing construction on the front of the building, and the front door to enter the building was propped open all night for three of the four days we stayed. I asked the property manager if they could do something about that, as it felt like it could be a safety issue, and they didn't get back to me. Other than that, they were very accommodating, and they even let us check in early. I would definitely book again."
13592,4942954,2013-06-03,2015003,Justin,"Room was clean and as described. Great location next to the park. Probably better suited for two couples than 5 individual guys, but we just used it to sleep so the size wasn't an issue. Excellent keyless entry system worked perfectly and was so much easier than having to deal with a key exchange."
13592,5242808,2013-06-20,5935221,Lindsay,"We were so pleased with the accommodations.  The unit was clean, modern, and comfortable.  We had everything we needed, from towels, to toiletries and clean sheets.  The unit is located in a PERFECT location for exploring Boston, in a beautiful neighborhood with plenty to do.  Seamless made the experience tremendously simple for us.  They provided plenty of detail prior to our trip and made the check in process so easy with electronic key code access to the building and the suite itself."
13592,6896302,2013-08-29,7667767,Diane,"Great location, appartement was clean when got in, decoration was nice but it was NOT looking like the pictures at all. All the blinds were half broken, bathroom was very small, you could not even open a window. It was an expensive deal compare to was we had expected : it was a 1.5 bedroom (second bedroom below staircase could not accomodate people taller than 5 foot - with nearly np blinds) with 1 very small bathroom and additional guest WC). Thle company was helpfull on the way in because I had forgotten my entry code. They had a book with tips and info that was helpful.  Great appartment if it was not for the price, that was prohibitive for the actual product"

13592,76878116,2016-05-29,60209194,Gerard,communication for access to property was easy. Perfect area to visit

13592,87585851,2016-07-20,42627035,Jodi,This was a comfortable Back Bay Apt that was perfectly located to the many attractions of Boston. Everything was in good working order. We liked being close to the park.
13592,92887491,2016-08-10,29026652,Joshua,"\"I cannot recommend this place. The two bedrooms have half height ceilings which means you have to bend your head in order to get in. It's crazy. I've never stayed anywhere like it. It'll make a great pad for hobbits but normal sized people beware. \"\"Architecturally unique\"\" indeed! Seamless have simply cut in half a regular property and created a most ill-suited conversion as a result. Frankly"
The location is good,but that's the only redeeming feature because you can't wait to leave this cramped apartment.  If they had described this place accurately there's absolutely no way we would have booked it. I suspect the same would be true from some of their other guests.,,,,

It did get a bit noisy on Friday night (as advertised, and also unsurprising, since it's above a bar), but not to the point where it bothered me. I would definitely stay here again."

It is well located near public transport, some highlights places for tourist and a lot of restaurants and pubs. The size is excelent and fully equipped even though the bed is small for two."
The main problem is the noise. We couldn't sleep until 2 am in the weekend's nights because of the music alive,the flat is above a bar,"and the people screaming and having fun on the street. We tried with  earplugs but didn't work.\"",,,

It's right off the Freedom Trail and close to the T line, making it one of the most accessible locations in Boston. The apartment is clean, the shower is great, and there's a small kitchen for some basic cooking. A blowout mattress was included in case guests want a bigger bed (both were very comfortable). Overall, I thought this was a much better choice than a hotel."
2547075,40341113,2015-07-30,34950735,Winnie,Elyne was a great host. We had minor troubles during our stay and she was quick to respond. The apartment was kept tidy and well equipped with appliances and cookware. The only negative thing was the loud live music from the bar beneath. Earplugs did not work so we usually went to bed after the bar closed. The location definitely made up for it; living literally steps away from Faneuil Hall was more than convenient to explore Boston. We would recommend the place to those who are planning on a short stay.

From there we would only have to walk a few blocks to be somewhere. The apartment was lovely, despite the bar being underneath, it wasnt a big deal to us. Most the time after walking miles in one day you fell asleep as soon as you hit the bed. The bathroom is very nice, the kitchen is cute. We didn't use much of the tv but there is stuff to watch and unwind. I highly recommend this apartment and do plan on coming back for a longer stay."

Our bed was immediately above the tavern which played lively music til about 2am on both Friday and Saturday nights. Fortunately we are good sleepers,but this may be a problem for some.,,,,
Overall,"good value.\"",,,,
2547075,81357987,2016-06-22,45455216,Maria Del Mar,Location is excellent
2547075,94509574,2016-08-16,26441020,Brian,"Great location and very comfortable.  Very noisy from Thurs - Sun night with heavy bass music, but otherwise a great experience."
2547075,97865066,2016-08-28,11513541,Patrick,"We came separately due to a work trip. Thankfully the cleaning crew was done early so my wife was able to drop her things off at the apartment since she got there earlier than me. It was easy for my wife to get to from public transportation and access to the apartment was easy (she was a little worried)! When she arrived, there was a packet of info about the area, emergency contact, etc.  Between that and the location, she was easily able to find a place to eat/drink while she waited for me. The apartment was exactly as described, and definitely a modern one in a historic location. The area was fantastic. We only stayed for a long weekend, yet were able to fit so much in because it was all nearby. We did everything we wanted to - Quicy Market, Faneuil Hall, most of the Freedom Trail (and all the amazing sites with it), history pub crawl, oldest continually operating bar and restaurant, history trolley tour and harbor tour, Fenway (the farthest we walked - 2.5 miles through Beacon Hill), and I could keep going. Great location, great apartment, great host. Couldn't have had abetted experience."
2189086,9947948,2014-01-20,4888359,Rubina,Jeffrey was a great host! He is very kind and patient.
The apartment is in a great location,a few minutes away from the Hynes Convention center. And the apartment is in a great condition.,,,,
"I would definitely stay for my next visit.\"",,,,,
2189086,10465324,2014-02-20,11275962,Nilo,Jeffrey is a very friendly person and his hospitality was very welcoming. I highly recommend his place to anyone.
2189086,72428365,2016-05-02,68863728,Maureen,Jeffrey was waiting on the corner when I arrived to make sure I found the correct address easily. He took time out of a busy weekend to make sure I had everything I needed and could work all the keys (I'm bad with keys.) The location was fabulous and a terrific value.
2189086,75118382,2016-05-19,19926406,Jan,"Jeffery was a great host.  He communicated quickly and was kind enough to accommodate my changing schedule.  His flat is secure and as advertised located right in the middle of the Back Bay neighborhood.  Public transportation to Cambridge is less than five minute's walk from Jeffery's front door.  Access to the T is less than 10 minutes walk.  The apartment is cozy, but quiet and clean."
2189086,77574016,2016-06-01,69594887,Tara,Jeffrey was super helpful from the minute I arrived. He met me outside his place and was always happy to help orient me in a new city. The location could not be beat. Thank you!
2189086,81107935,2016-06-21,71304595,Chad,Jeffrey was very courteous and responsive. I always felt like I knew what to expect so there were no big surprises.  His roommate was friendly also but neither ever seemed intrusive.  Over all a nice stay.
2189086,88413450,2016-07-24,7251605,Jane,Jeffrey was very welcoming and he has a small basement apartment in a nice part of Boston.  The room I stayed in is very small but adequate for one person.
2189086,90055715,2016-07-31,78419757,영수,Jeff was very kind person. He responded everything I asked immediately.
2189086,90841311,2016-08-02,83561309,Scott,"Host was accommodating in opening apartment for a late night arrival. However, room was much much smaller than anticipated. The apartment did not feel very livable (curtains simply separated all of the rooms). Bathroom and kitchen were not very dirty, but not clean either."
2189086,91077040,2016-08-03,14924594,Paul,"The reason to stay here is the location, just off the Boston side of the Mass. Ave. Bridge. Practically all of Boston and Cambridge are within 30 minutes' walk. Jeffrey was responsive to messages and met me outside the building to ensure an easy arrival."
The great location and friendly host are balanced out by a VERY basic room: it's a converted closet or storage room with no windows,and no doorknob on the inside (so I never closed the door all the way,being unsure if I'd be able to open it again). That said,the room was clean and freshly painted (in a white that brightens it up a lot),and there is a good fan that gives the illusion of fresh air. The lack of a window actually made the room very quiet and dark at night,so I slept well.
The shared spaces in the apartment were cluttered,crowded,and uninviting,and the bathroom was QUITE dirty,and cluttered with previous guests' discarded toiletries. The shower looked and smelled mildewy,and although Jeffrey offered a pile of shower shoes
Overall,if you can tolerate the bathroom and don't plan to hang out in the shared areas,the room itself is fine for a night,"and the location can't be beat.\"",,
2189086,93963089,2016-08-14,23242426,Elizabeth,"Jeffrey was very helpful with everything and willing to adjust my time of arrival without it being a problem.  The location is amazing--and the space is a good basic accommodation in an excellent neighborhood close to transportation everywhere.  Easy walking distance to Berklee College of Music, Newbury Street, the Hynes Auditorium, etc.  Everything was convenient."
2189086,95993228,2016-08-21,29472266,Tong,"The listing is accurate, the place is very good, its just across the bridge from MIT and the area around it is very lively. The price that they charge is also reasonable."
9809914,57084487,2015-12-21,42146325,Rob,"\"The location of the condo was PHENOMENAL - easy walking distance to restaurants, shopping, & the \"\"T.\"\"  The place was as advertised"
9809914,58477433,2016-01-02,41289462,Sascha,It was everything plus more.  Thank you for a wonderful stay.
9809914,62408757,2016-02-14,31945096,Victorine,The location is great! It is very clean. Everything is quite comfortable. Paige is very responsive and nice.
9809914,63132544,2016-02-20,52645611,Jianping,"The location is best, and the room is comfortable. Paige is s a efficient girl."
9809914,65481971,2016-03-14,4237670,Litty,"We needed to make a last minute switch, and Paige was very quick to respond and set us up in her gorgeous apartment in less than a couple hours. It was clean, big, and in a great location that was close to everything. Loved it!"
9809914,66181096,2016-03-20,20114461,Alex,"Apartment was in a great location in Back Bay for our 3 night stay. Newbury St was great for shops and Boylston St was great for food and drink. Check-in was very simple. Only complaint would be the bathtub surround needs updating. Other than that minor concern, our stay was very good and would stay again!"
9809914,68353676,2016-04-04,16679965,Merry,"This is a great place to stay in Boston, especially for Boston Uni, and the Hynes Convention Centre are really close by.  This is a small apartment but fine for two, and has everything you need and good local shops and restaurants.  We liked the original features of the old decor, the bed was very comfy and we had everything we needed."
9809914,68396803,2016-04-04,46671720,Jeffrey,Paige was great I texted her when i arrived and she got back to me within a minute and the apartment was set up great and very clean. Great price for the location can't beat downtown Boston!
9809914,71890628,2016-04-29,51989975,Nixie,Good location! Charming apartment. Host is easy to reach. Few issues were promptly addressed. Clean enough and with basic needs provided.
9809914,75377796,2016-05-21,72275797,Bridget,loved everything
paige super helpful,,,,,
"great place\"",,,,,
9809914,75905037,2016-05-23,54896763,Yuhan,Paige is a great host. She is very responsive and makes sure that our stay was perfect. The apartment is located in an awesome location of Boston. It's close to so many shops and restaurants. The internet isn't that great though.
9809914,76837213,2016-05-29,66005436,Tyson,Description of the unit was great.  It was definitely a cozy place.  We loved the location and it's proximity to shopping and great food.  It does look as if the place is in the process of being remodeled but everything works just fine.
9809914,77671044,2016-06-02,52885239,Julia,Paige was great to work with and the setting was perfect for our family. Close to everything we walked to great food and fun. The room was clean and comfortable. This spot is great for large parties since Paige has two units across the hall from each other. We reserved both and moved freely back and forth as we vacationed with 8 of us. We would highly recommend Paige and this location.
9809914,81568079,2016-06-23,19471421,Ibrahim,The location is amazing in Boston. You have pretty much great access to everything you need with a 5-10 minutes walk.
Paige is very responsive and quickly resolved an issue I had with the Internet access.,,,,,
The furniture is nice and the bed was comfy. The bathroom could use some renovation,"but it's nothing major.\"",,,,
9809914,82235653,2016-06-26,15347412,Kelsy,"I stayed in the Back Bay with my parent's and my best friend for three nights. I never met Paige but she was very communicative and had her assistant Amber greet us. We also used Amber/Paige as our realtor as we are moving to Boston, which was super helpful!! Amber reached our goal of finding a spot which was awesome! The place itself is nice, overall was clean and had plenty of linen and towels. I loved the blue tile in the bathroom! The location was the best apart about it, it's a great spot to stay in while visiting the city. Paige had clear directions for the apartment, answered quickly and had many suggestions for things to do and places to eat etc. I would certainly stay with her again!"
9809914,86973037,2016-07-18,79544800,Jacob,I was very close to the convention center. Very safe and clean neighborhood. Nice apartment is was well suited to our needs.
9809914,87776075,2016-07-21,74166227,Vince,Paige was a great host. She provided quick feedback and timely responses throughout the entire process. The location was great and was within comfortable walking distance to Fenway Park and shopping along Newbury Street. I would highly recommend this listing and would love to stay here again in the future.
9809914,90762062,2016-08-02,691845,Xin Dee,We had a smooth stay at Paige's property. The apartment is located in a beautiful and central area of Boston. It was just a bit small for three people with full size luggage (took some valuable walking floor space) but it worked.
9809914,92396066,2016-08-08,82831173,Rachel,The neighborhood couldn't have been cuter or in a better location. The market below the building was a godsend when we realized we'd forgotten razors and provided easy access to bottled/gallons of water.  There was easy access to the T and Newbury Street and the Common were within minutes walking distance.
The hostess was extremely communicative and responded to any further questions within minutes.,,,,,
The apartment was very small,but that was to be expected in Boston. One thing to know when coming from a central ac community,you should definitely read all of the settings on the window ac unit,haha.,,
I highly recommend this listing,"the only things to look out for is that the pull out mattress was very dirty and not to be slept on and there is peeling paint everywhere.\"",,,,
9809914,95967067,2016-08-21,14906813,Jessica,"As a fairly frequent visitor to Boston, I have experience renting Airbnb's, particularly in the Back Bay and South End neighborhoods, so I feel like I have a good sense of fair value. This apartment, which is totally average and certainly serves it's purpose, was very underwhelming for the price. The location is super convenient, being just on the fringe of the Back Bay, close to Newbury Street and the T, and I guess that is what you're paying for here."
The furnishings look like they all came from Walmart and there is no real decor or warmth to speak of. There is peeling paint and barred windows. The kitchen is tiny,and I had to wash almost every dish I used before using it. There are no basic provisions such as salt,pepper,oil,etc. provided for cooking which is something I feel is a pretty easy add even if it's an apartment that is used solely as a rental as opposed to being someone's home.,
My stay was during the hot,humid summer weather and the only air conditioning was a small window unit in the bedroom. There's a fan in the living room but no AC. That made the apartment uncomfortably warm during daytime hours when I had to be there to tend to work.,,,,
As far as Paige,the host,is concerned,I did find her to be very responsive and communicative,which is great. Arrival was pretty seamless as the keys are in a lock box and some very simple instructions are left in the apartment. We did not have any intention of meeting,though we did briefly cross paths when I let her know that there was graffiti on the front door. She faulted the cleaners for not communicating this to her
11579622,65711398,2016-03-16,61941959,Davey,"Jess and Will were great at making us feel welcome. They were fun to hang out with, and at the same time they respected our privacy. We were very happy with our room and the amenities that were offered. Definitely would stay here again!"
11579622,65920980,2016-03-18,28976972,JeongYun,Jess and Will are so nice and kind couple! Jess welcome us and the house has orientalic style. Really great host!!
11579622,66122722,2016-03-19,62995495,Joshua,"Awesome place.  I really enjoyed the décor and overall feel of the apartment.  While I never actually met the hosts (schedules never overlapped), they seemed very friendly. Communication was very open.   Overall a great experience."
11579622,68151056,2016-04-02,59460224,Kaarel,"Jess and Will are the coolest! Their place is nice and cosy. Just book it, hang around with them, share your stories and get the true East Boston experience. In the end it's not where you are but who you are with that matters. I loved it!"
11579622,68768784,2016-04-06,58702952,Wataru,素敵なホスト、素敵なお部屋☆
この度は大変お世話になり有難う御座いました。今回の旅では初めてのBnBの利用でしたが、到着前・滞在中ともに非常に親切・丁寧にご対応頂き、お陰様で異国の地ながらも存分に安全に安心して滞在する事が出来ました。,,,,,
"お部屋はメトロ徒歩圏内で、付近にはバーやファストフード、レストランなどもあり、降雪後・夜遅くの時間帯でも大変便利でした。今回帰国フライト前の1泊だけでしたが、空港へのアクセスも非常に良く、何よりもホストの流暢な日本語には感服いたしました、また機会があれば是非ともお世話になりたいと思います。お会いできる日を楽しみにしております、感謝♪\"",,,,,
11579622,70279866,2016-04-17,24857120,Alessia,We really enjoyed our stay in Boston also thank to Jess and Will.
Their place is really nice and comfortable,great location (just 10 mins walking distance to the T train),and quiet neighborhood.,,,
Jess and Will are so nice and during our stay they made us feel at home. It was nice to hang out with them and they gave us great suggestions about the city.,,,,,
"Really great host! Absolutely would stay here again.\"",,,,,
11579622,70810209,2016-04-21,58320842,Joan,The host canceled this reservation 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
11579622,70864753,2016-04-21,11616196,Leticia,"Jess and Will's place was great,  close to transportation, good eats and a great bar.  You can get to any place in Boston from the station just 5 minutes from their place.  They were great hosts and came out to have a drink with us and also gave us or space.  Definitely recommend it!"
11579622,71311578,2016-04-24,47308413,Kerwyn,"These two have a wonderful home. It was clean, close to the transit and plenty of space for parking. Check it out if you are ever in East Boston."
11579622,73730806,2016-05-09,11953752,Barbara,"The flat was exactly like on the pictures, Jess and Will was such amazing hosts! Thank you so much!"
11579622,74712283,2016-05-16,63261346,Christina,Jess & Will are a very nice couple. We unfortunately have a short stay so we couldn't spend much time together. Communication before arriving was very good. The apartment was like on the picture. The location is near to the metro and the airport so that traveling is very easy.
11579622,75189610,2016-05-19,25606720,Dan,Great spot and fantastic hosts. The room was nice and exactly as expected. You will be two stops from downtown with a train station right around the corner making it extremely convenient to get around. The hosts were very helpful making sure that I had everything I needed and advising me on how to get around and enjoy the sites. Highly recommended.
11579622,76232665,2016-05-25,64569700,Garrett,Both Jess and Will were very nice and approachable; they made my girlfriend and I feel at home.
Even though they had already gone to sleep by the time we arrived checking in was very simple and easy; they gave us very detailed instructions for how to find the keys and get into our room.,,,,,
The room was clean,but felt like a home at the same time. The bed was very comfortable (even split between two people),and the nights were quiet.,,,
As shown in the pictures on their listing,there were towels and toothbrushes provided on the bed,as well as a friendly message (which also included the WIFI name and password for their apartment).,,,
The room is just a short (5-10 minute) walk to the subway station,so getting around is very easy. The neighborhood has several authentic Mexican restaurants (several are conveniently right by the subway station,which is very convenient).,,,
They weren't home when we checked out,but it was still very easy. We simply left the keys on their coffee table and went on our way.,,,,
"Jess and Will were very hospitable; I would definitely stay here again if I'm ever in Boston!\"",,,,,
11579622,77634976,2016-06-02,3648477,Moritz,Jess und Will sind freundliche und kommunikative Gastgeber. Die Unterkunft liegt nahe des Flughafens im lateinamerikanischen Viertel. Beim Check-In gab es leider ein paar Missverständnisse. Dennoch geeignet für eine Nacht vor Hin- oder Rückflug.
11579622,77955295,2016-06-04,63731073,Sara,"Jess and Will were great hosts. They were hospitable and very interesting to talk to! They were great also sources of information about Boston and its more recent history. I would definitely stay with them again. The neighborhood is vibrant and conveniently located right between the North End and the airport (we got in some great meals even though we had a short time in town). Also, they have a great shower :)"
11579622,78421230,2016-06-06,52564058,Eva,"Room was as described. We only stayed the night and had to leave super early for a flight the next morning, which was a VERY convenient 3 minute drive away! Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a place close to the Boston Airport."
11579622,80027470,2016-06-15,61437997,Alessi,"If you're looking to enjoy Boston from a cheaper but convenient location, this is it! Close to East Boston harbor views, the blue t line, local eateries and convenience stores. Space as described- big enough bed for two, small couch, lamp, bright room with plenty of books. Jess and Will gave us some good tips and answered any questions we had."
11579622,80558571,2016-06-18,18112097,Jacob,Jess and Will were great hosts!  They were both very friendly and welcoming.  The communication before arrival was very good.  Check-in was very easy.  The apartment was very spacious and the room was exactly as described.  I got a very good night sleep there after a long flight.  The apartment is very close to the airport.  I would recommend this apartment to others and would love to stay there again.
11579622,80997895,2016-06-20,12330946,Megan,"We needed a quick pit-stop near the airport for an overnight layover - this was the perfect place! It's super simple to ride the metro for one stop to get to the area, and two blocks later you're at Jess and Will's place. Jess was lovely, relaxed, and made us feel welcome in her home."
11579622,81334802,2016-06-22,78030564,Julie,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
11579622,81389687,2016-06-22,79126363,Laura,"I really appreciated them taking us in last minute! We had some cancelled flights and needed a place to stay. Jess was very friendly and it was a nice room. The only thing I wasn't aware of that maybe should be added to the listing is that there is not air conditioning. It wasn't too hot, but a fan to move air around would be a nice addition for the future. We are thankful that Jess and Will for let us stay with them!"
11579622,82893448,2016-06-30,42105,Aaron,The location was very convenient and easy to find. The hosts were very easy to reach and communicate with. After a long flight a nice comfortable bed was all I wanted and thats what I got. Will was there waiting for me when I arrived and showed me my room and the rest of the house. He was friendly and made me feel at ease.  There are eating joints nearby and even a grocery store. I had a pleasant stay.
11579622,84828580,2016-07-09,72761044,Larry G,"Will and Jess were fantastic! Although I didn't get a chance to chat , Will was able to accommodate my arrival time and was very helpful to my girlfriend . Location was very close to airport and one stop away from downtown Boston."
11579622,86188579,2016-07-15,11803950,Lara,Jess and Will were great hosts for our overnight layover in Boston! They were on point with communication which was especially helpful when my travel haggard brain was making the simplest things confusing haha. The room was comfortable and location is great for proximity to the airport and strolling around.
11579622,86564789,2016-07-17,5352323,Adeline,"Just a one night stay, but jessie was really nice and the room perfect!"
11579622,87152693,2016-07-18,4262655,Erin,"We had a nice stay at Jess and Will's place. They were very friendly and were there to welcome us right when we arrived. The bedroom was comfortable, and the convenience of their place to the airport and train line worked out great for our short trip. We would definitely recommend staying here."
11579622,89080041,2016-07-26,61157362,Jeff,"As I recovered from an exhausting week and enjoyed exploring Boston, Jess and Will were great hosts. I somehow managed to lose my keys soon after arriving and they were very gracious (and I thankfully found them). The room was good and in a great location."
11579622,89485706,2016-07-28,81080057,David,"Room was exactly as listed.  Jess had excellent communication.  A previous reviewer indicated there was no air conditioning, but Jess & Will have installed a window unit which worked just perfectly.  Great location in a safe, vibrant neighborhood right near BOS airport."
11579622,90110540,2016-07-31,42478527,YuanYuan,"只住了一晚,房东还不错沟通比较顺畅,位置也较近,缺点是房间在二楼没有电梯,需要上楼取钥匙再上二楼开门,来回搬动任务重."
11579622,90606916,2016-08-01,39958805,Daniel,"Jess and Will are great, communiction was easy and the gave us different suggestions to explore the area around. It is located very well - close to the airport and easy and fast to go to boston city(only one station by train). The area around is friendly - lot of different possibilities to eat or drink ... and it is close to the sea - only a a few minute walk.  // Jess und Will sind super Gastgeber - gaben uns einige Tipps und haben unsnett unterhalten. Die Wohnung liegt super von der Lage, man benötigt ca. 15 Minuten vom Flughafen und ca. 15 Minuten nach Boston Downtown(eine Station mit dem Zug) - also super um die Stadt zu erkunden. Die Gegend wirkt sicher und es hat rundherum einige Möglichkeiten um essen zu gehen. Ca. 10 Minuten benötigt man an den Strand - kann dort schön spazieren. Die Küche haben wir nicht benutzt - scheint aber alles zu haben."
11579622,91401404,2016-08-05,5214301,Maureen,"Will & Jess were communicative hosts before & during our stay. The room is very spacious, and looks as described in the listing. Convenient location to Logan airport."
11579622,91781398,2016-08-06,78342420,Eric,Jess and Will's place is a great option for staying in Boston. Great location that is only a few blocks from the train that puts you right in downtown in 5min. Will met us out front as we arrived and gave us several suggestions of where to eat dinner. Had a great stay and will be staying there next time we are in Boston!
11579622,92666647,2016-08-09,58862515,Andrés,We have a good experience at Jess and Will home. Close to the airport and well connected to downtown taking Metro at meverick station.

11579622,94720711,2016-08-16,18534271,Marc,"Zeeer vuile en vettig appartement, vriendelijkheid was ondermaats, blijkbaar alleen maar om het geld te doen. Eigenlijk zouden dit soort verhuurders van de lijst moeten geschrapt"
11579622,95635516,2016-08-20,4051625,Johanna And Jake,Jess and Will are great! They were easy to communicate with and quick to help. The location is very convenient.

The location so close to the airport was wonderful. Not sure the sheets were washed before we came, but over all great location and good stay!"

We would definitely stay there again.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
3615760,19341258,2014-09-10,20700951,Sasha,"Richard made us feel welcome by providing his phone number to contact him if we needed anything, as well as, providing us with water bottles and magazines/tourist/map pamphlets left in the room. He supplied us with clean linen and towels and the room listing description was accurate. The location is great for the price. It is a working class neighbourhood and provides many services such as Laundromats and Dunkin Donuts! The best thing is that it is one metro stop away from the many attractions Boston has to offer such as the Aquarium and Quincy Market."
3615760,19604941,2014-09-15,18762945,Kresimir,The room is very close to downtown and the metro. It's really close to Logan as well. The room was clean and Richard was very helpful with giving us directions and providing us with towels.
3615760,19754115,2014-09-17,6267,Michael,I had a great time staying at Richard's place. It's close to the airport and one of Boston's best pizzerias is right down the street.

3615760,20194457,2014-09-25,8557550,David,Richard is very nice! The room is clean & quiet! Very close to the Mavrick train station! We enjoyed our stay!
3615760,20543505,2014-09-30,9177013,Justin,"Richard was a truly excellent host. The room was exactly as described and the whole apartment was very clean. Richard couldn't have been friendlier and guided me to a nearby restaurant. Also, the apartment was extremely close to the airport."

3615760,20753971,2014-10-05,1801231,Cristy,"Convenient location to the East Boston Pier, the T to Boston, and the airport.  Clean and comfortable accommodations and good communication with Richard.  We'll plan to stay longer next time we are in town."
3615760,20837708,2014-10-06,3580843,Denise,This apartment is just a few minutes walk from the airport away and few minutes from downtown Boston. There is also a metro couple minutes away from this apartment which brings you directly to the city.
Richard send me a lot of information per mail,that I didn´t have any problems to find his house.,,,,
Check in time was flexible and he also offers us to leave our suitcases in his apartment  after check out until we are done with sightseeing.,,,,,
Our room was clean,the bed comfortable and he offered us towels and shampoo. We also got coffee in the morning.,,,,
"I would recommend this apartment to everyone who wants to join Boston and who wants to get to know a very nice person. Richard is very kind and he helped us as much as he could.\"",,,,,
3615760,20925249,2014-10-07,14606762,Gina,"I could not wait to get the chance to review our stay at Richard's apartment in East Boston. My friend and I had such a positive experience. Richard was very flexible and quick to communicate with. As soon as we arrived, he showed us around and had clean towels laid out for us. Bathroom had a hair dryer (ladies, no need to lug more weight). The place itself was very clean with a little balcony, filtered water in the kitchen, and he was even nice enough to share his Grappa with us :)"
The apartment was super close to the T train and as he suggested,we took photos of the skyline from the entrance to the train which had an INCREDIBLE view. If you're looking for some quick eats,there's definitely a variety of options steps away.,,,
I couldn't be happier with our experience at this apartment. I recommend anyone stay here if you're looking for convenience. Super close to Logan Airport,too!,,,,
"I will keep Richard in mind the next time I travel to Boston.\"",,,,,
3615760,20951294,2014-10-08,15337537,Sandy,"The room is very clean and comfortable and location is great as well. Richard is also very helpful and nice. If I visit Boston next time, I will definitly stay here again."
3615760,21470794,2014-10-18,7549139,Johanka,The biggest advantage of this apartment is its proximity to the airport. You can easily walk from the airport metro station and save yourself spending money on cabs or buses. First impression from walking through the neighborhood was a bit dodgy but after spending there a couple of days we discovered it was quite safe. The apartment is also very accessible for downtown - only 1-2 metro stops away.
The building doesn't have a lift so bear in mind you'll have to carry all your luggage upstairs.,,,,,
The apartment was very nice. The room was arranged differently then on the photo with no TV - which was a relief for me as I'm not a fan of huge screens anyway. Also,the room is rather on the small side but it didn't matter as much as rest of the apartment is quite spacious.,,,,
Everything was very clean.,,,,,
Richard was a good host,"that accommodated our feedback regarding noise levels.\"",,,,
3615760,21790001,2014-10-24,21345869,文文,"Richard is so nice, we feel comfortable at his apartment, and it is really convenient to go to the airport. We had a great time."
3615760,21852884,2014-10-25,19755507,Than,"Richard was an excellent host. Friendly and warm, with a great suggestion on where to eat locally."
We were only there for one night,but Richard really made sure we were comfortable.,,,,
Location to the airport,made the stay convenient for us,as we had to fly out early the next morning.,,,

3615760,21934970,2014-10-26,11415746,Ross,"Richard is an awesome host and his place is great.  It Has everything you need, is extremely comfortable and he makes you feel super welcome. We had an amazing time in Boston and staying at Richards was a big part of that. We couldn't recommend it enough. 10/10"
3615760,43324650,2015-08-18,41110568,Chaell,"Richard's apt was a perfect location for me. 5 min walk to the subway station and one stop to the airport.  Even though I didn't meet Richard, he was very helpful from the time I booked to the time I checkout. He's apt was very clean and pleasant, with everything I needed."
3615760,43699813,2015-08-21,20985378,Carla,"The location was great and the apartment was very cozy. It was very convenient to the airport and to a T line.  I wasn't in the unit often, as I spent most of my time exploring Boston."
"The bathroom had some mildew issues. The shower area had an odd window that was rusty and always open. \"",,,,,
3615760,44269339,2015-08-24,42158081,Will,"This apartment was just as described. Perfect location, a minutes walk to the subway station. Clean, modern and with everything you need for the perfect city break. Rich was a great host and although we didn't meet, he was very helpful with recommendations and easy to get hold of for any questions we may have had."
3615760,44506035,2015-08-26,42322838,Yardena,"Richard was extremely nice, and very helpful with all the questions we had. The neighbourhood was really well located to downtown Boston; it was so great that it was just two subway stops!"
3615760,44867885,2015-08-29,34723589,Emma,"Richard's apartment was exactly what we were looking for in Boston. The apartment is clean and well decorated, just as shown in the photos. The bed is comfortable and shampoo and soap in the bathroom were a nice touch. The neighbourhood has places to eat and grocery stores and is only a few minutes walk to the subway. Richard was out of town but always responded quickly to us and made sure his friend was in town to help us check in. Would love to stay again if I'm in Boston!"
3615760,45178075,2015-08-31,30810995,Jaime,Both my girlfriend and I enjoyed our stay at Richard's listing. Although he was not in town when we came in his friend communicated with us all of the arrival information that we would need. We would highly recommend following the recommendations that Richard left on his guestbook page. We took some amazing pictures of the city from the park that is a five minute walk from the apartment and tried the best pizza in town from the pizza place that is a 1.5 blocks from apartment. The apartment was one stop from downtown Boston and a $7 Uber or Lyft ride to the city and a 15 minute walk from the airport.
3615760,45525459,2015-09-03,17300201,Borislav,"The neighbourhood is two metro stations away from down-town and in walking distance from the airport, which is very convenient. The neighbourhood was quite different from the other ones we visited in Boston and we did not feel as safe."
Richard was not in town,but he was always reachable via phone and email,which was nice. We were welcomed by a friend of Richard. He told us that there was no hot water in the apartment and that he is expecting the plumber to arrive in 10 minutes. He tried to leave us with the plumber and skip,but we insisted he stay. Everything was fixed in one hour. Richard apologized many times for the inconvenience,but the hot water was only till next morning when we woke up and we had only cold water till the end of our stay there (2 days).,
The hot water I understand,things break,you cannot anticipate that. We did not research the neighbourhood,it’s our fault,can’t complain about that. One thing that really pissed me off is that there was cleaning fee included in the price,but unfortunately the apartment was very dirty - dirty dishes
"\"",,,,,
3615760,46002143,2015-09-07,26793336,Rachel,"Everything was great! The place was clean and welcoming and just what we needed. The T is just a couple blocks away, not a far walk at all. Convenient little markets, liquors store, laundromat, small restaurants all within waking distance. Richard was wonderful and responsive, if we needed anything at all we knew we could reach out to him or his friend who would respond almost immediately. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks Richard!"
3615760,47798784,2015-09-21,30345936,Olivier,"The apartment is in an ideal location. The view on the city from the river side, which is 5 minutes away, is great. The blue line is also next door and you're 1 station away from the historic Boston. Although I read some comments about the neighbourhood which is indeed quite different from downtown, I found it very nice. Richard was not around but was very responsive through e-mails. I've been taken in charge by his neighbour, a very nice guy. I would definitely go back to Richard's place if I had to visit Boston again. Very good value for the price."
3615760,48045077,2015-09-22,34027760,Reni,"Richard was a great host in responding to all our messages quickly and even tried to accommodate a last minute request to stay a few hours  longer.  The only problem we had was with the cleanliness of the apartment: the bedding wasn't very clean and the bathtub looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while.  Also, the Brita pitcher was dirty so we wound up buying water to have during our stay.  The restaurants in the area had great food & the view of the Boston skyline from the park nearby was as good as Rich promised."
3615760,48575334,2015-09-27,43048099,Eric,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Richard's apartment for three nights, and we were very happy. The living room/kitchen look just like the pictures. In the bedroom there is no TV and the bed has no comforter and only two pillows, so those things are different from how it is shown in the pictures. Richard was gone so we communicated with his neighbor who was a really nice guy."
It is a short walk to the Maverick T stop,and a $5 uber ride to the airport. Piers Park nearby will give you the best view of Boston that you can find. Be aware this apartment is in East Boston  (blue line),so you will probably have to make a couple subway transfers to get to where you need to be in Boston or Cambridge.,,,
"Overall it was a great experience for the price we are very satisfied with our stay. We will try to stay at Richard's again if we need to come back to Boston!\"",,,,,
3615760,49517138,2015-10-04,44605783,Jennie,"I booked this place for my parents because they had an early flight and wanted to stay near the airport. The place is extremely old and run down. The floor boards creak, and the window in the bedroom cannot be closed all the way. I did not stay over night, but my parents said it's extremely creepy at night - the wind blows and the window makes noises. I would not book nor recommend this place, (at least not for older folk). If you just need a place to crash before a flight, the location is pretty decent."
3615760,50138750,2015-10-09,20014418,超,"房东人还不错,但房子的入住体验真不怎么样."
1.对于地址房东标注不够清楚,我按照地址好不容易到了,结果到了切尔西城的这个地址了,怎么都找不到房子,后来是房东所谓的墨西哥邻居把我接过去的(房东一直不在家),还要了我20刀
2.房子卫生真不敢恭维,,,,,
3.卧室没有被子,连个毯子都没有!你没听错!结果第一晚穿着刚买的羽绒服睡得,还好在奥莱买了羽绒服。。。。,,,

3615760,53414233,2015-11-08,4930923,Sherry,"We had a great trip to Boston and enjoyed staying at Richard's. It was easy to get downtown via the Maverick T, and the park a few blocks away was a bonus. We discovered some great eating venues within walking distance as well. Unfortunately, the apartment seemed only surface cleaned. When looking through the DVDs for a movie, dust was flying everywhere. Other than that, the apartment was just as pictured. Very comfortable."
3615760,54004352,2015-11-15,9979205,Mazin,"Rich was a great host. My GF and I loved our stay at Rich's house. It was clean, private and also has a very convenient location. Will definitely revisit using Rich's house."

I could walk to the train station and the airport is super close. It's a quiet neighborhood but there's food within walking distance."
3615760,55510282,2015-12-01,4675800,Hope,"Buyer beware - poor service, no actual stay, unclean, no refund. We had an unfortunate and very short stay at Richard's apartment. When we arrived at the apartment, if smelled strongly of cigarette smoke and air freshener. We had to leave after 10 minutes and book a hotel."
When we contacted Richard,"he refused to cancel the room and refund our payment. He told us he checked with the previous guest and his cleaning person who both insisted there was no smoking - too bad we didn't take a picture of the cigarette butts on the balcony. His comment in his email: \"\"You can go ahead and give me a bad review...This is a business for me\"\"",,,,
We regularly use airbnb and have always had good to great experiences,this was our worst. We love that the comment and rating system works to weed out bad actors from the system; we're hoping this review helps in that process.,,,,

Richard has been fantastic to deal with.  Professional  friendly in general just an amazing person  thank you. Richard for everything and I am sure this won't be the time I stay at your place

3615760,62864580,2016-02-17,6085000,Romain,"Great place, large and clean. Host is super available and reactive. Only negative aspect: the Internet is slow."
3615760,63959532,2016-02-28,29524098,Temitope,Richard's apartment was comfortable and looked as described. There were logistical difficulties in getting me the key to the apartment that he could have been avoided with better planning. I got into the building by sheer luck because the guy who was supposed to give me the key was not available when I arrived and he was not the best at communicating over the phone because of english is not his first language. The TV also didn't seem to function properly despite following the instructions on the listing. The internet connection was not solid either. Other than that the stay went well. Just a note  that the apartment is on Chelsea Street in East Boston NOT Charlestown so make sure you inform whoever is driving of the difference.
3615760,64678141,2016-03-06,1165589,Lee,"Richard was on-top of getting in contact with me throughout the trip, which was important, as he was out of the country.  I did have to wait on a friend of his to bring the key, but we were able to coordinate that without too much trouble.  Overall, I'd say I was satisfied with the space but was expecting more.  The pictures were accurate once upon a time, but the space seems somewhat shabbier at this point.  It would seem that Richard might not have spent much time there lately, as DVDs, magazines, etc. are strewn about."
It is a basic space overall.  The lamp in the living room didn't seem to work.  The information for the WiFi was not accurate,as I could never connect.  The TV system is quite difficult to figure out overall (and I'm pretty knowledgeable when it comes to technology).  The bed did not have a flat sheet on it - only a thin comforter - and no fitted sheet on top of the foam padding.  For those of us not from that area of the country,the baseboard heating could use some explanation.  Even small things stood out,like how plugs won't stay in the electrical socket just next to the bed.,,
This is a spot for a very quick stay,if you're more interested in the sights and sounds of Boston then where you lay your head.  It is a good deal,relatively speaking,and not too far from downtown.  It would also be useful if you had a quick stopover on the way to the airport,"as that is nearby.\"",
3615760,65278331,2016-03-12,23048708,Hazel,"This house is great! They have anything I needed, and it is a really safe area. It is about 10 mins away from downtown Boston. Richard is a good host, he was really helpful and he usually replied me in a short time. It is a good place to stay for the trip!"
3615760,65955566,2016-03-18,55055971,Travis,"Richards home was in a great location in East Boston. Just a short walk from the T and 1 stop from downtown. When I first arrived there were some issues with the Internet, but Richard was quick to address the issue and correct it. The kitchen and bathroom were as advertised. However, there was minimal bedding available during my stay and the Cable didn't appear to work. Overall I had a great experience staying with Richard. It's a great spot for the price."
3615760,66473291,2016-03-22,59403093,Luke,"Overall great experience. Richard was very quick to answer questions and was very helpful. His guidebook was very nice and complemented our trip perfectly. The apartment was clean and his house rules were easy to follow. The space works perfectly for 1-2 people and is so close to the train station that the entire weekend, I never needed to use a cab/uber/car for transportation. Otherwise it was a great first experience, and I would recommend this place to anyone. Pro-tip the MTBA ends their night train service at 12 during some periods of the year, so plan accordingly."

The apartment was as shown in the pictures, nice place and comfortable couch and bed. Kitchen was well stocked as well. The location near the airport was a great Plus and the subway took us into Manhattan in a short time as well."
Communication with Rich was good,he asked if we got there OK and if we needed anything else. Since Rich wasn't around though,the neighbor got us the key and had to be contacted by Rich or us,which wasn't as easy. He also asked us to leave before check-out time because he had to clean. That was not a problem for us,as we had early plans anyway,but the time check-out time should be set to earlier from the beginning The apartment was not very clean.
"Other than that the apartment was good to sleep in for 2 in a great location.\"",,,,,
3615760,80518280,2016-06-18,38673620,Roosmarijn,"Richard was very responsive and the location is perfect, close to the airport and blue line to visit Boston. The apartment was clean and has everything available. Place to recommend!"
3615760,90395107,2016-08-01,17894481,Michelle,"Our stay was brief at this apartment since we only needed a room for 1 night before flying out of Boston. Rich was easy to get a hold of and was in communication with us days before we arrived to ensure things went smoothly. His neighbor met us and let us into the apartment but we could reach him via text or phone when we needed help with WiFi. The neighborhood has some good, affordable food options and had available parking for our car rental (read the signs as the parking rules change from street to street). Overall, we had a great stay!"
3615760,90578597,2016-08-01,7501268,Robin,"East Boston is so close to the airport and downtown. Just a couple blocks from the T-station. Richard's place is in a lively neighborhood, and he has a small balcony to stand out on to watch the world go by. I really enjoyed staying there!"
3615760,91420746,2016-08-05,4941845,Krista,"Completely as advertised in terms of convenience to both airport and public transit toward downtown Boston. Perfect for our short-term needs (arriving around dinner and leaving by 5:30am the next morning) but if we were staying longer I would have wished for a sturdier bed and the shower door got stuck open, leaving the floor a bit wet (no bathmat). Additionally, the electrical outlets turn off with the light switches- a fun surprise when our phones were as low-battery as we'd left them the night before. Easy to solve if you leave the switch on and turn the lamps off directly; we just didn't notice. Clean enough. 15 minutes from door to downtown via train, which made dinner easy. All in all very good for our needs, with minor improvements that would have made a longer stay more comfortable."
3615760,92114753,2016-08-07,29166010,Scott,"The apartment was everything as advertised.  It was convenient to the airport and the T, in a decent neighborhood.  Was more than enough space for 2 people.  The neighbor was very helpful at getting everything set up and the price was right.  Would definitely consider staying again on the next trip to Boston."
3615760,92515580,2016-08-08,46478272,Chris,"Great experience with Richard's place.  Very near the airport.  Marverick T station is only 2 blocks away.  Richard was very available with advice, etc."
3615760,96642298,2016-08-23,25981003,Jack,We had a fantastic stay at Richards place. It is well located and only a short walk from the subway which takes you into the Quincy Market area within minutes. The apartment itself is exactly as described and although Richard couldn't meet us his neighbour was so accommodating as was Richard via mobile. We would definitely stay here again if we visit Boston in the future.
3615760,98389747,2016-08-30,58239860,Reba,Richard's place was pretty much exactly as he describes. It was a couple blocks from the Maverick stop on the blue line which we took into the city everyday. The woman who let us in was awesome and so helpful!! Both her and Richard were very quick to respond and accommodate to any request.

11122394,68403297,2016-04-04,13950797,Ashley,"This unit is in a perfect location and is so beautiful and luxurious! It's located within blocks of the Boston Common/Public Garden and Newberry Street, which has great restaurants and shopping! The apartment has state of the art kitchen appliances and a great bathroom and living area! The bedrooms are comfortable and spacious, and everything was very clean! The best part is there's a great rooftop deck that has amazing views and is great to hang out on! Florence and Paulina are very kind and attentive and provided us with a lovely welcome gift on our first day there! They were very flexible with checkin/out times, which was also nice!"
Full disclosure: there are some very steep stairs,so if you're not fully mobile it can be challenging! We did not mind them at all,"but it's something to consider! Worth climbing them for the views though! \"",,,
11122394,69482757,2016-04-11,28779856,Marc,"Great place, so great I want to give it a bad review so it's still available next time I go to Boston.  Couldn't have been happier."

Location is absolutely perfect, walking distance to Newbury Street and Boston Commons. I would love to return in the future and highly recommend for all travelers passing through Boston with a group of four. 5 stars."

11122394,80020320,2016-06-15,22375401,Sebastiaan,We staid with 3 people in this apartment. The roof deck has spectacular views. The apartment is very spacious and is well equipped. We felt very welcome and would definitely stay here again!
11122394,81018415,2016-06-20,5804455,Tomi,"Our stay exceeded all of our expectations.  The apartment, the rooftop terrace and the location are absolutely perfect.  The apartment is clean, spacious and safe with modern appliances and super comfortable beds/linens/towels.  The terrace has high-end lounge furniture and a gorgeous view.  The apartment is located on a high-end and quiet brownstone residential street 100 feet from Boston Commons and within a short walk to many restaurants.  From here we walked to the Waterfront, North End, MIT and even Fenway Park for a Red Sox game."
We got an authentic feel of what living in Boston is like.,,,,,
Florence and Paulina were also very welcoming.  Both are readily accessible and accommodating.  We were greeted by Paulina,who showed us the workings of the apartment and who was helpful in explaining how to get around the city.  Florence left an unexpected welcoming gift and had prepared a package orienting us to the apartment and the neighbourhood.,,,,
The apartment is great for a family travelling with children.  Boston Commons offers many children's activities and there's a fantastic playground along Charles River called Espalande Playground.,,,,,

11122394,82189315,2016-06-26,13996304,Wei-Jen,The place is really nice and clean as shown in the picture. The location is very convenient to all the restaurant and subway station.
11122394,84445684,2016-07-07,34430692,Rebecca,"Our family had a wonderful stay in Boston.  Everything in the apartment was just as pictured.  It was spacious and we loved having the roof deck for relaxing in the evenings, especially for watching the fireworks on Independence Day.  The location is fantastic for exploring the city and our hosts were great at accommodating us and making us feel welcome."
11122394,84911999,2016-07-09,57172230,Annie,"My family (one sibling, two parents) had a wonderful stay at Florence's place. Sky lights and lots of windows shower the apartment in natural light. It's a beautiful place in an excellent location (steps from the public gardens, Beacon Hill, Comm ave). Paulina greeted us and had made sure the place was clean and very accommodating. Florence left us a note of places to see and enjoy in the area, as well as a lovely housewarming present which we enjoyed on the roof deck. They are experienced so all of our needs were anticipated. We are low maintenance so no issues came up. We spent our time in Boston enjoying all the sights in close proximity, and finishing out evenings enjoying the gorgeous view from the roof deck. The pictures show the place exactly as it is - no surprises, really - although my 72 year old father wasn't thrilled about the walk up (they're a largely unavoidable fact of life in a big city. I wouldn't recommend to someone with serious mobility issues for that reason.). Fun fact: He did enjoy the pillows so much, he bought two of his own."
11122394,87032674,2016-07-18,36164151,Jefferson,Felt very welcome. Very clean. Accurate description. Would definitely recommend.

The service was fantastic,the apartment size is great and the rooftop area was an added bonus.,,,,
Apartment induction was provided as soon as we arrived by Paulina and she didn't have an issue with us arriving late due to the traffic.,,,,,
The cooking facilities and dining arrangements were great and the bed is the most comfortable I have slept on through air bnb.,,,,,
Conclusion,"if you are looking for a two bed apt in Boston you will have to look very hard to beat this one.\"",,,,
11122394,95759875,2016-08-20,11863438,Diane,"Wonderful appartment, very sunny, clean, and with very confortable furnitures. The roof top is amazing and the location in Boston could not be better. Perfect place for a family with two kids."

11122394,99199575,2016-09-04,18464826,Stephane,Very beautiful place ideally situated
The place by itself is wonderful and the roof terrace is a splendor,,,,,
Nothing was missing and we were really welcomed with a bottle of bubbles,,,,,
The owner has someone to welcome you but had someone else as this person wasn't there but it was a very charming person and everything went smooth,,,,,
Definitely would go back and recommend the place,,,,,

10524612,62738003,2016-02-16,12939061,Chris,We had a great time at this apartment. Shawn was accomomdating and helpful. We were there on the coldest weekend of the winter (-2 degrees) and the hot water had stopped working. I reached out to Shawn and he immediately sent a plumber over to fix the issue. Thanks for Shawn! I would recommend this place to anyone. Close to the subway if you don't have a car.
10524612,63234395,2016-02-21,13379277,Kathi,Shawn is an excellent host and communicator!  He answered all my questions right away.  The condo is exactly as described in the listing.  It was extremely clean and comfortable.  The kitchen appliances are top of the line and easy to use.  The location is perfect for traveling to and from the airport and/or downtown Boston.
10524612,64907986,2016-03-09,27715481,Yujie,Very good living place! Exactly the same as the picture posted! Shawn is very helpful!
10524612,65396763,2016-03-13,45109778,Yifan,Shawn gave clear instructions on how to get into the house and they were easy to follow. He was very willing to help when the toilet was plugged and couldn't flush quickly. He brought the toliet-plunger and helped us solve the problem. The house was spacious and my friends and I enjoyed cooking in the kitchen.

L'appartamento è ordinato e funzionale con due camere da letto - la prima ha un letto king mentre la seconda queen ma ad ogni modo ci si può dormire in due."
La zona è ok,prettamente residenziale senza troppi ristornati. Per raggiungere il centro però basta davvero una fermata di metro - necessaria però perché occorre passare sotto al mare (ci troviamo infatti in un'altra penisola). Per andare alla fermata occorrono meno di 5 min a piedi.,,,,

His home is nice and clean, he was fine with us coming and going whenever, and he made us feel very welcomed. His place is only a few minutes from the airport and just across the bridge from downtown Boston, so it's pretty convenient. He even offered to give us a lift to the airport at the crack of dawn, which was exceptionally kind of him. Bonus: His pets are super lovable."

He was super helpful with suggestions of places to eat in the neighborhood. We walked to one place for dinner our first night stopping at a lovely waterfront park on the way and traveling through a fun art filled boat yard. We tried an old Italian pizza place another night and an Italian bakery in the morning. All had great food. One block to the subway that takes you easily into downtown Boston. One stop to the aquarium, 2 or 3 to get to the start of the Freedom Trail. Everything was neat and clean and the bed was really comfortable.

He went above and beyond to make us feel as comfortable as possible by picking us up and dropping us off at the airport, having great guides and information packets in the room, and just generally being available and ready to help. I will definitely keep him in mind if I find myself in Boston again!"

He has really thought through the space for his guests and the little touches like a toothbrush kit, all the tourist brochures and the guides he provides make you feel welcome. His place is absolutely gorgeous and I loved having his pets there. Whilst I was happy to have them around he made it clear should I not want to interact with them, they would keep to themselves. The neighbourhood is very easy access to the centre of Boston via the T which is only a few minute walk. The walk by the Piers Park along the riverfront to the Hyatt is lovely for a quick morning run. I loved the Italian Express pizzeria for a local dinner and would have liked to try more East Boston places."

The bedroom was perfect and full of lots of small thoughtful touches to make it comfortable.  The bathroom was large and spacious that both my husband and I could get ready at the same time.  If you are tall you will love the shower!  Jim left out breakfast treats for us and makes a great pot of coffee.  Definitely a great experience!"

Less than 5 mins walk from the blue T line, the accomodation has been perfect for our needs, and it has a wonderful view of boston skyline. Jim has been very kind picking us up from the airport and providing a very good breakfast all our three days of stay.

We have 2 boys 5&3 and the house was perfect for them also. The neighborhood is quaint and everything you need is in walking distance.  If traveling downtown by car is really easy and close too.

Kasia and her husband are incredibly accommodating and made me feel right at home during my stay. I was in and out a lot for a conference I was attending, but they made it easy to come and go as I pleased."

I stayed for 2 nights to attend a conference at BCEC.  The location of the room so close to the Andrew Red line T shop was very convenient to get to and from the conference.  The bedroom and bathroom were clean and well prepared.  The house is well equipped with automatic locks with touch pad entry so coming and going was simple.  Wifi was great with password prepared for me."
Nothing but compliments for Kasia and Adrian for my first airbnb experience.  I can recommend them as hosts without hesitation.,,,,,

8274008,48604538,2015-09-27,44104872,Boyd,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and Kasia and Adrian were wonderful hosts and they made me feel very welcome in their home. They were great with travel tips and couldn't have been more helpful. The room was as described with a security lock for privacy.  The Andrew T station was only a 2 minute walk away for easy access to Boston city centre and all attractions. A 1 day pass with unlimited train/bus travel was only $12 so made the location perfect. In summary, a great stay and an experience I would be willing to do again. Many thanks guys."

8274008,50962438,2015-10-16,12678394,Amy,"One of the things I love about traveling is all of the interesting people you will meet, and they were no exception! They made me feel welcome, the room was comfortable and location was convenient to public transportation.  They were helpful with information for around town and access to the house/room was also convenient and secure.  I enjoyed the conversations we had in passing and the commonalities in foreign travel.  I enjoyed my stay and would stay with them again."
8274008,51338578,2015-10-19,622790,Matthew,"Katarzyna (Katia) was an absolutely fantastic and helpful host when I stayed with her for a long weekend. She is kind, friendly and makes a lovely cup of green tea! You will feel at home and like a friend staying with her. The room is lovely and bright with a private bathroom next door. Katia has thought of really trying to make you feel at home - there is a small kettle, fridge and a television with netflix in the bedroom also. The apartment was very close to the metro, red line, and thus minutes from downtown Boston. Katia shared food with me on several occasions and was very inclusive when I was in the house, inviting me to join her and her friends for tea and nibbles. I can't wait to go back again to this warm and friendly house in a convenient location for exploring the lovely city of Boston!"
8274008,51984701,2015-10-25,46493418,Shae,"Katarzyna's home is conveniently located near Boston public transit, hardly a 5 min walk to Andrew Station, which can easily get you downtown and to Logan Airport. The room is cozy and had everything I needed for my stay, including wifi. Despite Boston's cold weather, the room is comfortably heated too. Having a clean, private bathroom was also great!"
The hosts are friendly,accessible,and easy to talk to. If you're not busy with travel plans,sit down and have a conversation with them!,,

Communication was fast and excellent prior to my visit. They were very helpful and welcoming, made me feel like I was staying with family (even including me at dinner one night ). Apartment was quiet, clean, and as described. Easy 20 minutes to convention center by public transportation or $7 uber ride.  Was my first airbnb experience, would recommend this room"
8274008,52515803,2015-10-30,44188447,Arindam,"Kasia and Adrian were amazing - friendly, helpful, caring, excellent conversationalists.

The house is very beautiful and the room is extremely comfortable. I had an excellent stay at their home and they made me feel like family.  Adrian is an amazing artist - his wood work and paintings are out of the world.  This was the first time I used Airbnb, and this experience definitely makes me want to use this service more."
8274008,53362820,2015-11-08,26598804,Nancy,Katarzyna and her partner Adrian have a very quiet and clean place. They were amazingly considerate and made me feel welcome. I wasn't expecting to be fed but she made me apple pancakes on the second morning and offered me apples they had just picked. They have a small Maltese dog but she is well-behaved and did not get in the way at all. Don't forget to notice the wooden carvings in the back yard - that's all Adrian's artistry!

I really enjoyed conversation with them. The place was very clean and quite. They cared about the guest room very much in detail so that guests feel comfortable.

Everything is the same as you can see from the pictures. And the house location is very convenient for tourists, only 5 mins walk. And all main places can be easily reach in a short time. Airport is also easy to go. If I visit Boston again in the future, I will take the same choice."

The room and restroom were perfectly neat, and the room is steps from public transport and a quick walk to anything else you might need during your stay. I had a chance to sit and chat with Katarzyna over coffee, and really enjoyed getting to know her!"
8274008,74873510,2016-05-17,4759103,Jill,"Katarzyna and her boyfriend were the most warm and welcoming hosts ever.

Very close to the T which is great whe coming to Boston. I would stay there again."
8274008,75716825,2016-05-22,69706619,Tushar,"This is my first AirBnb stay and I am quite happy with it. Katarzyna was really a great host. Very warm welcome with a great smile. The room was neat and clean and arranged as exactly as shown in the posting. The place has a really nice backyard with great wooden arts. The neighborhood was really quiet and also has nice restaurants nearby. Her place is in 4 mins walking distance from Andrew T-station as described in the post. The best place to stay if you are attending an event at BCEC (20 mins in public transportation, 6-8 mins in car). She made me feel like a home. She took me to the really good Vietnamese restaurant for a dinner and also drop me off to BCEC on one morning. I will definitely stay at her place again and highly recommend others for the same."
8274008,77043868,2016-05-30,70297658,Umut,This was a great find!
First off,Katarzyna & Adrian are amazing people. Rest assured that you will be treated very well and it will feel like home.,,,,
When I first arrived tbh I was a bit hesitant about the location,but it turned out fine. As described on the listing,it is close to the T stop. I preferred walking via Dorchester Av. instead of Preble street,it seemed safer to me.,,
The room was spacious,tidy and well equipped. Airco is a great plus,especially in warm humid Boston summer days. Bathroom was very clean and you have everything you need.,,,
So in short,a very comfortable place to stay,especially if you don't mind using transportation to get to downtown. I had a fantastic experience staying here & visiting Boston,I hope you will,"too. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.\"",

I felt like I was staying in a home away from home, which is exactly what I needed. The room was comfortable and clean. Everything about my stay was easy. The neighbourhood is safe and friendly and very close to the centre of Boston, but perhaps a little more plain than I imagined."

It has a beautiful little backyard, the inside is clean, and the room was great. (It's also a treasure trove for Boston Guidebooks)"
She was very understanding of my needs,especially the time when happily accepted two last minute extensions to my stay when I was house-hunting,and even cooked a couple of Polish dishes for me on the occasion! If you're looking for a comfortable home,warm hosts,and a well connected locality,this is the place you want to be.

She was excellent at communicating and even went out of her way to set up a parking spot for me. It felt as though she was genuinely invested in making sure I felt at home and that my stay was as nice as possible. The apartment is in a nice area of Southie with very convenient access to the red line and even a short walk to the beach.

2246959,22051284,2014-10-28,5450648,Paris,"This apartment was really lovely and the location was great! It's also near public transport and a taxi rank. Decor was all brand new (in fact it looked quite a bit different to picture on here). However it's not really an airbnb type of place, it's more like a chain and run by a big company. E.g we had problems with the internet and had to call an international company in order to speak to someone who could send someone out. There wasn't direct contact with the owner. Plus if you have a car it's $40 per day and you have to pay by cheque or go to a shop nearby and ask for a money transfer order. Bit of a pain... But very nice place."

The apartment was neat,cosy and well furnished. Loved having a walk in closet to hang our clothes and store the luggage. Didn't cook at all while we were there so did not need the kitchen. Why would one cook anyway when cafes and restaurants are plentiful and closeby. Apartment is centrally located and an easy walk to major tourist attractions and shopping. Loved it!!,,,,

Maggie was very easy to communicate with and check in went easily and smoothly.We were shown how everything worked and where to find the laundry, how to operate it & where to put the rubbish.  The apartment is in a wonderful position, very central and we were able to walk to every thing we wanted to do in Boston. Although the studio is small it was adequate for our needs. We noticed a bit of street noise at night and found the airconditioning to noisy to have on while sleeping. Overall a good experience."
586994,14768980,2014-06-26,11443791,Judy,"Apartment was ideally located in the centre of Boston, with easy access to transportation, although we found we could walk to most places.  Facilities were great and provided everything you could want.  Host was particularly accommodating as our flight was delayed and we didn't arrive until very late at night."
586994,15141818,2014-07-03,5237553,Jason,Very nice clean apartment in an excellent location. Great host. No issues! Highly recommended.
586994,15388729,2014-07-08,9622037,Amy,"We enjoyed our 5-night stay from July 2 to July 7.  Apartment is small but very convenient and within walking distance of most of what we wanted to see and do.  Maggie was very generous in letting us check in early and drop our luggage even though there was someone checking out the day we checked in.  Rooftop view of the city is fantastic!  Our only issue was that we only had two bath towels and two hand towels for the duration of our stay, which was alternately hot and humid then terribly rainy with the tropical storm.  We would have washed them with the available washer and dryer on the floor, and also would have taken care of some of our wet clothes from the horrible rain, but we had used the dryer once to fluff up some of our clothes that were wrinkly from packing and there wasn't enough credit to do a full wash and dry.  I tried contacting Maggie twice to ask if there was a way (at our expense) to recharge the card but she did not contact us back.  It was a holiday weekend so maybe she was unavailable.  Other than that, it was a great time, and I would recommend this listing!"
586994,17668262,2014-08-16,10847226,Thomas,"Small, but really nice flat with a great rooftop. The  view over Boston is fantastic. Also the location of the flat is great as it is situated in the heart of Beacon Hill with the Common (park) close nearby."
586994,18537096,2014-08-28,16725612,Hongying,"Very friendly and gracious host , because the train we took was late ,we arrived after 1:00 a.m , Maggie waitted for us so late and taught us how to use laundry and charge the card etc. .the flat is great location ,just next the state house and Boston Common ,very convenient to go anywhere! the first floor of the building there are  a convenience and an Italian restautant and a Japanese restaurant ,really very convenient .the neighbourhood of course is very safe. the room is clean and there are anything you may need ,the bed is also very comfortable , my daughter and I enjoyed our stay very much ."
586994,20178316,2014-09-25,13000576,Susan,Great apartment in a fabulous location.  Maggie was very accommodating and the apartment couldn't have been cleaner.  Well recommend for anyone
586994,21025195,2014-10-10,9703570,Beatrice Anna,"We felt safe.the studio was clean,very good located and we had a great time in Boston.we suggest the studio for a single person-the bed is small.make sure to have earplugs-there is noise from the street."
586994,21509659,2014-10-19,19555382,Anthony,"Maggie was very friendly and did a great job at handling communication with us. She was very flexible with check in and check out. Apartment is situated in a convenient central Boston location, easy walk to shops, restaurants, sites, and major train lines. Apartment was clean, right size for one person, a little cosy for two. If you are a light sleeper, please note apartment is a little on the noisy side and morning sun will flood the apartment even with the blinds closed."
586994,21885129,2014-10-26,15486275,Graham,Never met Maggie in person but her emails were prompt. The apartment while small is well equipped and in a great building. Location is among the best in Boston and the roof deck is a wonderful treasure. Apt had everything 2 people needed for a week in Boston.

586994,27650078,2015-03-09,26493990,Nicole,Lovely apartment in a great building.
586994,28577465,2015-03-26,23971366,Joe,Fine stay in Beacon Hill.  A bit warm because you can't really adjust the heat; would recommend opening the windows. Just know it gets a bit noisy downtown.  Otherwise the space was perfect and obviously centrally located.
586994,31028354,2015-05-01,24070000,Stefan,"Der Kontakt zu Maggie war sehr freundlich, informativ und angenehm. Sie antwortet meist umgehend. Vor Ort hat mich ein Bekannter von ihr in Empfang genommen und die Wohnung gezeigt, der ebenfalls freundlich war."
"Das Appartment liegt in einem gediegenen Appartmentbuilding in perfekter Lage am Boston Common in Beacon Hill. Man ist quasi Gast im Boston State Haus. Die U-Bahn-Station \"\"Park Street\"\" ist 250 Meter entfernt. Im Haus nebenan ist ein kleiner Supermarkt. In direkter Umgebung sind mehrere Restaurants",Bars,Kaffees und weitere Supermärkte.,,,
Zum Fenuil Markt sind es z.B. gut 10 Minuten zu Fuss,zum New England Aqarium keine 20 Minuten.  Zu Macy's dauert es gut 5 Minuten,zum Beginn der Newburry Street - einmal durch den Park und damit etwa gute 10 Minuten. das Prudential Center oder die Public Library dürften keine 20 Minuten entfernt sein.,,,
Das Appartment besteht im wesentlichen aus einem Raum,dazu Abstellkammer und Bad. Es hat wertigen Parkettboden. Überhaupt ist das gesamte Gebäude in gutem,wertigem Zustand und verfügt über einen Portier/ Sicherheitsdienst. Im Appartment ist ALLES (selbst Bügeleisen/-brett,Wasserkocher,Kaffeemaschine,Toaster
Das Appartment ist für 1 Person oder 1 Pärchen geeignet,wenn es auch nicht viel kleiner sein dürfte.,,,,

586994,31641531,2015-05-08,28815352,Magda,"El lugar era perfecto, queda muy bien ubicado, a una cuadra de la estación de metro, y caminando se llega a varios lugares de interés al lado del Boston Common, el Public garden, Quincy market, Faneuil Hall, y caminando hasta a 20 min de Prudential. El espacio es de un tamaño ideal para 2, limpio, es verdad que esta en la ciudad pero de noche es muy silencioso. Maggie fue muy amable y nos dejo poner nuestro equipaje antes de la hora de check in, solo estoy muy apenada, porque yo olvide la instrucción final que ella me dio a la hora del check out./ The place is perfect for 2, the location is great, 1 block from subway station, and you can walk to a lot of nearest places like boston common, public garden, faneuil Hall, quincy market, copley square, 20 min walking to prudential center. etc.The apartment was very clean and confortable. We arrived before the check in hour and Maggie was waiting for us. i´m just so sad, because i forgot the instruction that she gave us for the check out. We are very sorry but that."
586994,32879040,2015-05-23,26209476,Miguel Elías,"Me estaban esperando a la hora acordada. Excelente trato y paciencia. La publicación se corresponde con la realidad. Es un monoambiente con todas las comodidades (Cocina, ropa blanca, utensilios). Apto para dos personas. El lugar es céntrico. El condominio es seguro y tranquilo. Excelente opción."
586994,33643644,2015-05-31,7078237,Trevor,This apartment was in the best part of Boston with easy walking distance to most attraction and very close to train station
586994,34519472,2015-06-09,27616305,Mike,"We had a  very good stay at Maggie's place.  It was exactly as she described and she was responsive to any requests.  The studio was a good size for two people.  It was very clean.  The location is outstanding, only steps from Boston Common."
586994,35204718,2015-06-16,27497453,Maria,"Thanks Maggie you were awesome.  You were very flexible with check in time which was helpful. Your promptness with the key was efficient.  The place could not be in a better location.  Loved the safe neighborhood and convenience of market next door.  The places to eat around town were perfect.  Close to the T, what more can one ask for?  Boston was a HIT!!!  Thank you again!"
586994,35903059,2015-06-23,25600562,Jiyon,"Maggie was most welcoming. She took her time showing us the room, laundry room and the outside terrace. Everything was exactly same as it was described."
"\"",,,,,
586994,40074953,2015-07-28,4862379,Flora,"Me and my boyfriend had an amazing time at Maggie's studio. The location couldn't be better and the place itself is very cosy, clean and well organized. Maggie was very welcoming and nice, and took her time to show us the amazing view from the top of the building. Everything was flawless."
586994,41305197,2015-08-07,4226825,Heather,Maggie was so easy to communicate with and she made sure our arrival was organised even though she couldn't meet us herself. The apartment was just perfect for seeing and walking Boston...you couldn't get a better location.
586994,42819283,2015-08-16,7151609,Aleks,"Maggie's apartment was perfect for our 5-night stay in Boston. It's located right next to the Statehouse and only a short walk or T ride from everywhere. The apartment is just one-room but it's fairly large (and clean). The closet was large enough for all of our luggage. It was also nice to hang up our coats and more formal attire. The kitchen is small but perfect for making small meals. It was nice to have breakfast here before heading out for the day. The windows face other buildings so there's not much a view, but there is a roof deck. Most of the time we had the windows open but we did use the air when it got too muggy. Maggie was easy to communicate with via text for check-in and check-out. We had no problems during our stay so didn't contact her other than that. She graciously allowed us to store our luggage when we arrived before check-in. I think that says it all. Still a little jet-lagged so I may be forgetting something. Oh, wi-fi was awesome. We both needed to do some work so we definitely used it. And there were washers and dryers in the building. Loved our stay and recommend for anyone looking for a clean, low-key place in a great location."
586994,43901122,2015-08-23,28685387,Raena,"Fabulous condo location. A market for conveniences next door, train just blocks away for my husband completing residency at Boston University and Charles street for shopping. Cozy studio with all the conveniences for our week stay. Perfect for one person, two for some may be tight coo riders with a full size bed but for us was perfect due to our schedules. Our visit at the peak of summer high temps glad the room was air conditioned. Maggie and her husband greeted us and gave tour of building. A wonderful stay in Boston."
586994,45234232,2015-09-01,27013443,Liliana Silvia,"Me senti muy comoda porque era tal cual lo que yo (URL HIDDEN) ubicacion era excelente y la entrega del depto. fue tal cual lo habiamos planeado.Todo en el depto. funcionaba ,la vigilancia estuvo alli todo el tiempo aunque el vecindario era sumamente seguro."
586994,45750407,2015-09-05,43075133,Theresa,We had a great stay! The room was clean and self sufficient. You can't beat the location as it is within walking distance to all popular sites as well as restaurants and shopping. Very safe and love the building and rooftop terrace!!
586994,48980254,2015-09-30,27397869,Ulrike,"Wir hatten zu zweit einen sehr schönen dreiwöchigen Aufenthalt in Boston. Die Lage des Apartments war ideal für Stadtspaziergänge zu Fuß und Ausflüge etwa mit der U-Bahn. Wundervoll war die Dachterrasse mit Blick über die Parkanlagen und die Skyline. Das Haus ist sehr gepflegt, die Nachbarn sind freundlich distanziert. Uns wurde trotz verspäteter Ankunft am Abend alles freundlich erklärt und gezeigt. Die Wohnung enthielt alles nötige - ein zweiter Stuhl wäre nicht schlecht gewesen, etwa beim Essen am Tisch."
Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt und werden uns gern an unsere Zeit in Boston erinnern.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
586994,49425523,2015-10-04,2707434,Renee,"Location is absolutely the best. Right on Boston Commons, near main attractions & main transit line. I love fresh air, and there are 3 windows that open."
The unit is quite small,and a bit of challenge if you want to eat,since there is no table. Great kitchenette with all necessities.,,,
"Maggie was easy to communicate with. Thank you for a great time in Boston. \"",,,,,
586994,50157991,2015-10-10,6386205,Tim,"We were welcomed on our arrival, and were able to leave our luggage early, prior to cleaning after a previous tenant.  The location is very central for tourist purposes, and in a good neighbourhood.  If Maggie reacts favourably to our constructive comments, this apartment will be a very useful base for 2 persons touring Boston, self-catering when preferred, and was pretty much as described."
586994,50830014,2015-10-15,9973653,James,Place was very convenient and clean. Easy to find her place and a short walking distance from Park St station. Will use again if in Boston.
"Air con was a bit noisy into the night\"",,,,,
586994,51697944,2015-10-24,20589695,Ross,"Can't beat this fantastic central Boston location. So easy to walk or catch the subway to the many places we wanted to see. The studio is in such a beautiful building, it was quiet and very secure. A wide selection of great eating places nearby. The studio was neat, clean and tidy. Furniture & bedding is a little dated, another comfortable chair would have been handy. Although we didn't meet Maggie personally, communication and check in went very smoothly."
586994,52552851,2015-10-30,23615772,Martin,"We were welcomed by Henry and Maggie in the lobby of the building, which seemed very secure with a security guard at a desk in front of the doors 24/7."
Henry was helping out Maggie by showing us around the building from the room to the rooftop,which was an absolute amazing view of the city. He also went to the trouble of sending us possible transportation to Salem.,,,,
The room itself is quite small,and set up differently to the photos shown,where they have placed the bed and furniture to make it seem like quite a large room. This did not affect us since we were staying for 4 nights,it may feel too cramped for anything over that.,,
The building was in a great location,one block down from the Massachusetts State House,very close to the Boston Common and Public Transport.,,,
We had a problem with the old heater in the room,it was way too hot,we weren't able to adjust the temperature by ourselves and were told to open the windows which let it quite a bit of noise pollution but seemed to help at least a little. They did say that plumbers were going to come fix it the next day,however the problem was not fixed for our stay.,,
"Overall it was a great central location.\"",,,,,
586994,57421827,2015-12-26,39482297,Zoe,"The apartment is great and is in an ideal location to explore the main areas of Boston. Maggie promptly answered any questions we had and even though we missed our flight that had us arriving at night but instead arrived at 6am the next morning, Maggie was still able to arrange for us to get the keys once we landed."
586994,59213671,2016-01-08,26830813,Fiona,"Very nice neighbourhood - excellent location, safe & convenient. Great roof garden! Some of the facilities, eg shower could be upgraded"
586994,64967077,2016-03-09,50748055,Howard,This is a great location.  Close to restaurants and Boston Commons.  Even a deli steps away.  The building has a concierge and was well maintained.  The apartment was small but suited my needs just fine.
586994,68278795,2016-04-04,3449224,Hugh,"We arrived at about 10 pm and the hosts were there to welcome us and explain the roof garden, front door and apartment keying, laundry, garbage and extra towels and blankets."
The location was great for visiting Boston which is a very walkable city. The apartment was comfortable and had all necessary equipment although my wife labelled them as a Barbie stove,etc. We only used the fridge.,,,,
"Hot water temperature and water pressure in the shower was marginal but there is nothing that Maggie could do about it as it a building utility (and we didn't bother her about it).\"",,,,,
586994,70681142,2016-04-19,33362975,Brenda,The unit was small but fine. The proximity to the Boston Common was great! I would stay here again.
586994,71652277,2016-04-27,5800398,Joanne,Maggie responded to me very quickly when I was looking at booking and replied to every other email I sent. She was ready outside the building to welcome me into the apartment and gave me a quick tour of the building. Before leaving she made sure that I had everything I needed and assured me that she was available for me if I needed anything through my stay (I didn't).
The room was large enough for my needs,it has been changed a little from the picture but the bed is spacious and the TV adequate for the size of the space. There was plenty of storage space too.,,,,
I ended up not using the kitchen,apart from the refrigerator,as every lunchtime I found something I really liked so never bothered to have dinner,however it was fully stocked with both a traditional oven and a microwave/toaster.,,
The flat was very clean and the neighbours were very quiet. The room does not face onto the street but being in the city there were sirens etc... which you would get anywhere.,,,,,
The location was absolutely perfect. I would like to say walkable from everywhere but as I was ill,I didn't walk TOO far - but Boston Common,the Prudential Centre and the Aquarium/Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market are all walkable,I even managed it with bronchitis - although the nearest train stations are great options and the fares aren't expensive if you pick up a Charlie card from a worker at one of the major stations.,,
Nearby are some great eateries,all the shops you can think of and so much history... I'm talking 5 minute walks for that.,,,,
"I would definitely consider coming back to Maggie's flat if I am fortunate enough to get back to Boston.\"",,,,,
586994,72580014,2016-05-03,12200553,Trisha,The apartment is based in a great location. Close to everything! It's clean and good sized perfect for a couple looking for a little base around Boston. The building itself it's beautiful and very safe'
586994,74296582,2016-05-14,10433773,Natalie,"Maggie met me outside and gave a quick tour of the building.  I didn't really use the amenities (washer/dryer down the hall, rooftop deck) because I was in town for a conference, but it's nice that they're provided.  Was very glad to have an iron/ironing board, as well."
Pros:,,,,,
Starbucks down the street,,,,,
Comfy bed,,,,,
Very clean,,,,,
Location is superb,,,,,
Subway and historic sites are very close,,,,,
Big windows,,,,,
Fast internet,,,,,
Big fridge,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
Garbage truck (or something) woke me up nearly every morning at 5 a.m.,,,,,
Sink stopper was broken (it wouldn't lift up to drain water,just plugged up the sink),so I ended up taking it out and trying not to drop things down the drain for the rest of my stay,,,
Unfortunately,a pipe in the building burst the first morning,and there was no water--I ended up having go to the convenience store next door and purchase several large bottles of water,and it was not what I needed on the first day of a conference.  Obviously that wasn't the landlords' fault,but it would have been nice if they had offered to pay for a day pass at a local gym or something--they just said 'Thanks for letting us know.',
It's a good little studio spot if you don't plan on spending much time in the apartment,"but could definitely stand some improvement.\"",,,,
586994,76660996,2016-05-28,44962654,María,We honestly couldn't think of a better place to have spent our time in Boston.
The location is unbeatable,just across the street from the Boston Common,the Massachusetts State House and the beginning of the Freedom Trail.,,,
The place itself is beyond nice. It's a studio apartment but spacious enough for a couple. Big closet,kitchen,fridge,microwave and everything you could possibly need.,,
"We'll definitely stay here again next time in Boston!\"",,,,,
586994,77776160,2016-06-03,57888333,Anne,Maggie est une hôte très agréable; la prise de contact avec elle a été très facile. L'appartement est très propre et correspond en tout point à la description sur le site. La terrasse qu'on aperçoit sur les images n'est pas mentionnée dans le descriptif alors que c'est un atout incroyable avec une vue magnifique sur Boston et la State House ! La situation est très central ce qui nous a permis de tout faire à pied. J'y retourne demain.
586994,78748402,2016-06-08,20609905,Erin,Maggie was a great host! She was helpful and easy to work with. Her studio in Beacon Hill is the perfect location for exploring the city--just steps from Boston Common!
586994,80682680,2016-06-19,53944437,Brent,"Great location, nice apartment, and helpful hosts!"
586994,82981166,2016-06-30,5844309,Rick,Maggie met us to give us the key and introduce us to the apartment. She was very easy to communicate with and flexible about our departure arrangements. The apartment was as described and had everything we needed. The location is fantastic. Thoroughly recommended.
586994,84534357,2016-07-07,28978111,Lauren,"Maggie's apartment was a great choice for our stay in Boston! The location is ideal. It is right on the Common, close to the T, and walking distance to tons of great bars/restaurants/historical sites. The rooftop was amazing. We went up there almost every night, and we watched the 4th of July fireworks from there."
Maggie was very easy to communicate with and made checking in a breeze.,,,,,
The only problem we had was that the tv/cable had a bad connection. But we were there for 6 days,so that's not typically something I even use on shorter trips.,,,,
Overall,"this place is a great option for staying in the heart of Boston!\"",,,,
586994,85508165,2016-07-11,28471755,Corey,"Overall our stay was great - we knew the apartment/condo would be small since it was a studio. It was in such a great location though! We felt extremely safe in the building, the rooftop view is incredible and Maggie was nice about communication overall."
Pickier travelers may not like that the water takes 20+ minutes to warm up,there's no fan in the bathroom,the toilet takes a couple flushes to get it right,if you plan on being in the condo a lot the BASIC cable is extremely spotty. I also think we lucked out a bit because it was unseasonably cool while we were there,otherwise the unit may have been really hot due to the Window AC and no Central AC.,
Overall - a great choice to stay! I would certainly stay here again.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
586994,86445897,2016-07-16,5342832,Frances,"Maggie's place was great. The location was unbeatable, in the middle of everything! The park, the subway and plenty of food options less than 5 mins walk away. The room was spacious and had great aircon. The bed was a little bit small for my boyfriend (he's 6'3) but that is the only criticism. Would stay again for sure!"
586994,88027485,2016-07-22,50673365,Jascia,Our stay at Maggie's place was great. We were met by the host and given a helpful tour of the building. Fantastic location and the room has everything you need. Beautiful view from the rooftop patio. Highly recommended!
586994,89069138,2016-07-26,18466484,Victoria,"We had a great time in Boston and Maggie's flat is truly in an excellent location, right next to the Statehouse and a really short walk from everything we wanted to see. The roof terrace at the building was a lovely treat and we watched some exquisite sunsets (and thunderstorms!) from there. Though the studio is small, it has everything needed for a short stay - because of the great location it can be quite noisy but that is to be expected when you're in the heart of a great city! Earplugs however would be recommended. Maggie was a great host and was ready to meet us with a smile even though we were delayed arriving from the airport. He showed us around and answered any questions we had. Would definitely recommend!"
586994,91807728,2016-08-06,69399569,Grainne,"It was smaller then we thought, but it was a simple good accommodation, in a great location. And all basic amenities where provided."

Die Wohnung war etwas kleiner als erwartet (1 Raum plus Badezimmer) jedoch sauber und praktisch eingerichtet. Maggie hat stets sehr schnell und hilfreich kommuniziert und alles dafür getan, dass unser Aufenthalt gut wird. Wir können die Wohnung sehr empfehlen."
586994,96434485,2016-08-22,9505857,Annie,"Maggie's place was great for my husband, toddler and myself. Of course, a full bed is a wee bit small for cosleeping with 2 adults and a toddler, but we made it work :)"
Location could not have been better. We were attending a wedding at the Boston Harbor Hotel,and it was an easy 12-minute walk to the hotel. We used the T to get everywhere else far away and it was maybe a 5-minute walk to get to the subway station from Maggie's (URL HIDDEN) easy!,,,,
I had a lot of questions about getting from the airport to her condo (and how we would transport our toddler) and Maggie was super helpful in letting me know the best public transit options. We had a great time,"thanks!\"",,,,

She is awesome. Actually,  we were her first guests, so lucky! Also, Liz is a really fun person to talk with. We had really great time with her and Lavryn (her roommate), sharing a lot of fun stories and experiences. Hope we could spend more time with her."

The location is fine if you have a car,a bit of a walk to the several bus stops,but there are buses going everywhere about 7/10 minutes away on foot.,,,
The place is simple,clean,comfortable,and properly equipped. There are no bad surprises.,,

13584884,90622530,2016-08-01,73794694,Yajaira,Elizabeth was a wonderful host and really friendly. I felt very welcome in her apartment. She was kind enough to have some toiletries available as well as making some awesome banana bread. The room was nicely adorned and comfortable. Definitely enjoyed my stay here!
13584884,93632110,2016-08-13,71747320,Kabir,Had a lovely stay. Liz's place was very well equipped. The room was as advertised and the AC was a lifesaver in some of the hottest weather of the summer. Liz was always willing to help and her roommate was also very kind. Third floor apartment also made me feel very safe. I was allowed to cook in the kitchen and Liz even set aside some space in the fridge for me to keep groceries. All in all a lovely stay.
13584884,94417404,2016-08-15,80552103,Sven,"Nice room with air con in a shared flat. Very easy communication and check-in with Liz. The distance to the next subway station was about 20 minutes walking, might be easier to take a bus if you don't want to walk that long."

Die Lage ist auch toll,mit dem Bus ist man in 10 Minuten beim Harvard Square,wo es Geschäfte und nette Restaurants und Cafés gibt, sowie eine U-Bahnstation. Wir hatten eine tolle Zeit bei Liz und haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Vielen Dank!"

Only thing is it really possible to hear everything from other rooms but people weren't making a lot of noise . I had to leave before because of other personal problems ."
12233285,70653210,2016-04-19,37092003,Trenton,"Looking for a great affordable place to stay that is only a couple blocks from the blue line? Are you looking for a host that is always there willing to help and talk to you no matter the time or day?  This place definitely fits the bill. Ricardo was there when we first were making our way into the hostel, he was extremely informative and great to talk to. The areas were extremely clean and beautiful views of the city. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a great casual experience of Boston. Ciao"
12233285,72406128,2016-05-02,58255969,Katie,Ricardo was a great host. The place was nice and clean and right beside the metro stop which is very convenient to get to all the main attraction parts of Boston. It was also located right beside a dock that looked out on the Boston skyline and had a great view to take in.
I would highly recommend staying here if you aren't planning on spending much time in the actual room.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
12233285,74816095,2016-05-16,10982982,Erick,"Ricardo was a great host. Whenever I had a question, I would just send him a text and he responds within minutes. The location was perfect. The T was literally a 5 min walk from his place. Getting to the hostel was very easy especially flying into Logan. The airport is 1 stop away so you don't have to hail a cab or grab an Uber. The bed was comfortable and he kept the community spaces clean. We stayed there for almost 2 weeks and felt very comfortable the entire time, even when walking back from the T late at night. There are great restaurants, convenience stores, and even laundromats within walking distance. If you need to grab a car, there is a ZipCar lot 2 blocks away."
Make sure to stop by Italian Express Pizzeria. Their food is excellent and the portions are huge. But make sure to bring cash and call for reservations as its a small place and are usually packed.,,,,,
"We also tried the Mehak Halal restaurant while over there. The food was also delicious but make sure to bring cash.\"",,,,,
12233285,75514877,2016-05-22,51284573,Marina & Nicolas,"Perfect place to stay if you are spending a couple of days in Boston! Very easy access to all part of town, the Maverik T Station being 3 min away! 10 min from the airport, 10 min from everywhere in Boston...just perfect. Relaxing little neighborhood in east Boston, we loved this place!"
12233285,75976231,2016-05-23,33832924,Emilie,The place was perfect for our week-end. Close to the metro and the center of Boston. The place was clean and Ricardo always available.
12233285,76971410,2016-05-30,31871520,Jessica,"This is a very convenient, clean and affordable place to stay. I don't think I ever saw Ricardo but he was quick and responsive by email."
We had a few issues with noise. We woke up to major construction noises around 5 in the morning our first night there. The third night was a sleepless night for me with people walking and slamming doors from 2-5am. At 4am,girls were screaming in the halls and I woke up to a girl passed out in front of our door. It felt like being in college dorms again.,,,,
I realize the noise is totally out of Ricardo's control but need to be fair and mention it.,,,,,
Overall,"you just can't beat the price. It's conveniently located near the metro and airport.\"",,,,
12233285,77606085,2016-06-02,24394910,Sara & Scott,"We loved this page place so much we came back twice! The rooms are very nice, bright and good beds and storage! The kitchen got everything you need and the pictures are very accurate!"
great communication with ricardo before and during our stay,"he is very helpful and friendly! would recommend this place!\"",,,,
12233285,78166616,2016-06-05,13219332,Shannon,Ricardo's place was just what we needed for three people for a few nights. He was very helpful with booking as we needed two rooms for two different lengths of stay. His place isn't fancy but it was clean and it was great that we had access to the fridge because we purchased a lot of beer that needed to be kept cold to bring back with us. We saw a few other people during our stay but most of the other guests kept to themselves. Self check-in was a breeze and when we ran into Ricardo cleaning he was friendly and asked how we were doing.
12233285,78561295,2016-06-07,58923561,Corinna,"Ricardo and our stay was great. If you are looking for a no nonsense budget stay easily within reach of anything in Boston, this is the perfect place. Everything was clean, check in was easy, it was nice to be able to drop our bags early and the house is suoer conveniently located by the blue line - getting in and out and connecting to any of the other lines is insanely easy."
"Sadly we had to leave early but Ricardo was understanding and next time we are in the city I would definitely stay here again!\"",,,,,
12233285,79219284,2016-06-12,4015361,Luke,Ricardo's place was just perfect. The room we were staying at was bright and had good Wi-Fi; the bed is just insanely comfy.
Ricardo's dad was very kind and helped us whenever we needed him.,,,,,
Excellent location,just a subway stop from downtown,in a very quiet and pretty neighborhood.,,,
"Hope we can visit again soon!\"",,,,,
12233285,80448358,2016-06-18,72551761,Émilie,"Ricardo wasn't there when we arrived, but the instructions to get in were clear and we were able to find our way without too much trouble. There was a lot of construction going on while we were there and it was quite warm (no A/C, but there was a fan), but no one can control that! The room was clean and the kitchen and bathroom were practical. We didn't have any trouble in the neighborhood, the station to downtown Boston is really close, so we were very happy in terms of that. Thanks Ricardo!"
12233285,81700059,2016-06-24,47623607,Jennifer,Great value for money!
Place is exactly as advertised. Nice clean and bright rooms. (Pro tip: bring your own towel and some flip flops for trekking around in the house). A bit noisy from the wood floors and shared space,but quiet,polite neighbors.  The place is in no way sexy. Just cheap and cheerful.,,,
"The best part was Ricardo's dad. He ran interference for us all week sorting out little things here and there. Just great!! :)\"",,,,,
12233285,82411644,2016-06-27,4085683,David,"The room is very functional but there is no intimacy; we were wake up by the other room guy that was making very small noise.  There is only a window and a curtain that separate the chambers, so it's more like a dorm."
12233285,83134738,2016-07-01,3980529,Pavel,"Although Ricardo was not available, he gave us clear instructions for check-in. The place is in great location, 250m from subway station (just in the middle of the airport and the Boston downtown). I can  recommend to others."
12233285,85099212,2016-07-10,59674364,Sydney,I am thankful for Ricardo and his team for showing superb hospitality during my two night stay.

12233285,87312732,2016-07-19,80560106,Azuri,"Let me say Ricardo is very informative with his instructions, very nice and very quick with inquiries. His place was very quiet. The guests who were there helped navigate my guest and I to our room. They were also very nice. All in all it was a pleasant and relaxed stay. I would recommend staying here if you're looking for something affordable and peaceful. I would definitely be booking another trip in the future."
12233285,87922740,2016-07-22,45774822,Jessica,"Ricardo was a great host. Very responsive and easy to access. The location was great, right near the Maverick T Stop. Very happy with my stay"

12233285,89227129,2016-07-27,76898825,Robert,"Hatten nur Kontakt über Airbnb. Alles wurde per Mail besprochen und hat sehr gut geklappt. Hatten ein Zimmer und den Rest zur Mitbenutzung mit den anderen Gästen, also eigentlich keine komplette Unterkunft."
"Soweit war aber alles gut und gut organisiert. \"",,,,,
12233285,89431820,2016-07-28,2042370,Jerald,"Really grateful to Ricardo for approving my stay on short notice; the place is clean, and a few minutes walk with my luggage from Maverick station, which is one stop from Airport station and can be reached by the airport shuttle."
Checked in after midnight as my flight was delayed and I was stuck in immigration for a long time,but was able to enter smoothly as the door uses a code lock,and Ricardo had already given me directions on how to reach my room in the building.,,,
The bathroom and kitchen are outside of the room,but clean and easily accessible. Ricardo also kindly allowed me to hang around in the common area after the checkout time at 11am,as there was still some time before I had to head off.,,,
Overall,a pleasant stay,and I would recommend this place to those in between flights,"and/or wanting to stay near a subway station.\"",,

12233285,95135282,2016-08-18,88383309,Chloe,The stay was very pleasant and the discription and photographs were very accurate. It was really convenient location for us to go into boston city via the tube which was a 5 minute walk and the place was kept very tidy.

12233285,97231193,2016-08-26,58767680,Milena,"The pictures of the apartment are true to what the place actually looks like. It is about 15 min outside of the main part of Boston, however the subway (the T) is a 5 min walk from the apartment and only $2.75 one way. Therefore the apartments are still conveniently located. Check in and out is very simple. Free parking is provided, which is GREAT for Boston. The only things we did not like is that there were no blinds in the bathroom, so construction workers could easily look inside the whole time. Also there is no AC and it gets pretty hot in the bedrooms, but there is a fan. Overall pretty standard for a few days' stay."
12233285,98736356,2016-09-01,91605465,Jan,Nice house in close proximity to the city. All in all a good decision.

3842286,19549715,2014-09-14,20315674,Meredith,"What an incredible weekend in Boston! Matt and Ashley's home is incredible. It has an urban chic feel and stunning architectural accents that make it feel like you're staying in a scene from a home decor magazine. The location is unbeatable as well - steps from EVERYTHING you could want in the South End/Back Bay area. Yet you don't have to compromise privacy for a superb location - the brownstone is set back on a quiet, treelined street with a peaceful outdoor patio space that was perfect for soaking in a beautiful September day."
Matt and Ashley were excellent hosts - even though we didn't have the pleasure of meeting them in person,our check in/out was seamless and they were available to be contacted the entire weekend. They even left us coffee to make with their french press to get us going on a busy day in Boston.,,,,
Without hesitation I would strongly recommend this listing for anyone looking to stay in Boston that appreciates a beautiful home in an amazing location. I'd love to stay with Matt & Ashley again in the future,"as I could not have asked for a better Birthday weekend escape. \"",,,,

The location is amazing: right in the heart of South End, close to restaurants and transportation. The apartment was lovely, clean, quiet, light-filled, comfortable, and the back patio was such a treat!  We had a great visit."

3842286,25550965,2015-01-19,4114126,Joe,"Matt and Ash worked very hard to make my trip seamless and welcoming well before my arrival date.  Matt thoughtfully emailed and checked in a few times before I was scheduled to arrive at his loft.  Check-in was extremely easy and efficient, and Matt generously left a nice selection of local craft beers and snacks to greet me after my 4+ hour Amtrak journey from NYC.  The loft was very clean, comfortable and was an amazingly unique experience.  The location was absolutely perfect.  The loft is on a quiet block, but a very short walk to some of Boston's highest-rated restaurants.  Strong recommend!"
3842286,26525852,2015-02-15,3598396,Rachel,"Matt is a very gracious and nice host.  We weren't able to make it up to Boston because of the insane amounts of snow, and he was very understanding.  We're looking to get back up to Boston soon, when the onslaught of snow stops, and we'll definitely try to stay with Matt!"
3842286,31162851,2015-05-03,25799650,Morgan,"3 of my friends and I stayed here for a long weekend trip and it was fantastic! Matt and Ash were super responsive and accommodating, which made the whole process really easy. Their home is beautiful and definitely lives up to the photos shown. Just a side note, the pull out couch is super comfortable, so 4 people can stay here without any issues. We all also loved having the patio so we could sit outside and enjoy the nice weather. Matt also gave us some great recommendations for bars/restaurants in the area, and there is a lot to do that's easily within walking distance. The neighborhood is really pretty, so we all enjoyed walking around and checking things out. Staying here was a blast and I would highly recommend it!"
3842286,33227680,2015-05-26,9432024,Dale,"We were welcomed by Matt and Ashley like friends from out of town. They were very flexible with our arrival time and allowed us to come by early in the morning to drop off our bags. Their charming loft was just as it appears in the photos. Everything was very clean and ready for our visit. If you decide to eat at home the kitchen is fully stocked and the patio is a great place to relax right in the heart of the city. The location is fantastic! We were just a couple of minutes to the Back Bay T station (orange line) and just a couple minutes further was the Copley T station (green line). We purchased a three day transit pass and this worked out great for us to see the sites. It's a short walk to Newbery Street, Boston Commons, Copley Square, Public Library, Boston Ballet, and Tremont Street is right around the corner. Fenway Park is not far away either, we went to a game and walked home in about 20-25 minutes. On Sunday we went to the South End Open (EMAIL HIDDEN) was about a 15 minutes walk and a cool way to act like a local. They have areas dedicated to a farmer's market, crafts, vintage goods, and food trucks. Allow a good half day for this great activity. All in all, you should feel very fortunate if you can schedule some time in Matt and Ashley's wonderful home."

3721095,19837078,2014-09-19,20629085,Jay,"This was my first and Airbnb, and in some ways, it's a bad thing, as it means any future host will have to live up to the high bar that Robert sets. He is extremely welcoming, and I almost hesitate to say that's probably priced too reasonably for what guests receive."
3721095,20162148,2014-09-24,17977283,Lawson,"Bob is a fantastic host and he has a lovely place that worked perfectly for 2 work colleagues and me, but I would eagerly return with my family in tow. I've done 5 AirBnB rentals in the last 6 months and his property takes the cake.  Immaculate, spacious, and great location for our needs. Highly recommend."

3721095,20747278,2014-10-05,5434682,Becky,Robert's place was perfect for our family! We stayed over a long weekend for a wedding and everything was either walking distance (15-20 minutes to North End/Downtown) or a short cab ride. The beds are very comfortable and having two bathrooms was perfect for our group.
Charlestown is very nice and quiet,but close to shops and a Whole Foods,which is great if you plan to cook at all. Robert was very accommodating with our arrival and departure times. He called to make sure we were all settled and offered to help with any questions we had about things to do. All in all,"a lovely trip! \"",,

Robert was very helpful from very beginning: answering all the emails, questions etc. He helped us to get to the place when we arrived to Boston. Everything was ready: keys and instructions, an informational binder, maps, snacks, and basics in the refrigerator- more than anybody would expect. Robert was answering our questions immediately during our stay. The apartment is very clean, spacious and very comfortable. Two bathrooms made our stay much easier:) Kitchen is well equipped and we found everything what we needed."

Robert was amazing even though the snow made it hard to find a parking space he made sure we had a place to park and he was very patient waiting for us to arrive and was accessible. He had snacks and drinks for us what more can a person ask for. Everything was just there. He had a binder with information about places that are close by, taxi number and menus to order food :). I would definetly recommend this place to someone and would definetly go back. Keep up the good work Robert you sure do know how to host. From a scale of 1-10 I would rate your place a 10."

After a day of travel, it was nice to be greeted with snacks and drinks. We had no problems finding the home or gaining access. Robert was prompt with his response to our questions and was easily reached by phone. We did not have a car and used the T or Uber for transportation around the Boston area. Whole Foods was a 10-minute walk and a liquor store just around the corner. Robert also had a nice binder of local eateries and attractions. We were very comfortable and pleased with the accommodations and would highly recommend this home for your stay in the Boston area!"

It was well located, clean, and charming. Bob went above and beyond. There was a lot of food in the kitchen upon our arrival. He answered any questions and got us anything the house didn't already have."
3721095,29750459,2015-04-12,27559933,Ben,What a nice place. Robert is a fantastic host and his house is incredible.
It is the perfect size for three couples,with good sized bedrooms and a large living room with a couch and dining table. The kitchen has everything you need to cook a big dinner at home or just make breakfast.,,,,
Everything is also very nicely appointed. The beds were very comfortable with clean linens,towels,etc.,,,
Location is great. A bit off the normal tourist route,but literally a 2 minute walk to Bunker Hill Monument,and from there you can follow the freedom trail to all the sites - 5 minutes to the USS Consititution,20 minutes to the North End,30 minutes to Fanueil Hall,etc.
Check out the grasshopper cafe for a solid greasy breakfast.,,,,,

Robert's home was incredible. Everything was so clean,put together and the place felt really cozy. Each bedroom was amazing; the beds were super comfortable and each room was quite big,which was really nice.,,,
He stocked the fridge with water,soft drinks,milk and snacks for our arrival and had a guide that answered all of our questions and had great recommendations for cafes,restaurants and tourist attractions in the area.,,

Robert was fantastic from the very start, accommodating an early check in with no questions asked. Robert asked what snacks I would want to prepare for the race and had those things and much more waiting upon arrival. He was so personable and chatted with us upon arrival and was available through out if we needed him but left us on our own otherwise."
The apartment was perfect for our group and had everything we needed and more.,,,,,

3721095,31184080,2015-05-03,28838694,Lynne,"Robert was very friendly and welcoming. Condo was as listed, 3 BR on 2nd & 3rd floor in Charlestown.  Large open living/ dining area. Nicely furnished, Keurig coffee maker, toiletries. About half mile walk over hill to get to/from Subway, which was fine for us and kids, but could be difficult for others. A few blocks from Bunker Hill & Constitution, walking distance to North End and fabulous Italian food. We had a great time with our 5 & 3 year olds."

Tiene todo lo que puedas necesitar para tu estancia en Boston. Excelente ubicación para conocer la ciudad caminando. Bob es el mejor anfitrión que he conocido de mis experiencias con otros anfitriones. Muchas gracias Bob y muchas gracias Hannah, aquí tenéis a vuestros amigos españoles que seguro volveremos en próximas ocasiones a hospedarnos en vuestra maravillosa casa. Mi valoración es un 10."
3721095,32049098,2015-05-13,27113194,Richelle,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it definitely will not be our last.  The apartment was exactly as described and Robert (Bob) was as friendly, accommodating and friendly as you could want. My son was graduating from college and we wanted a place convenient to the TD Garden, where the ceremony was held, and to Boston's many visitor sites.  We also needed enough space for the grandparents and our other son.  All three bedrooms were nicely furnished and everyone said that their bed was very comfortable.  Both bathrooms had showers and one also had a tub.  There were plenty of fluffy towels, toiletries and a hair dryer in each. The kitchen was modern and well equipped. The living room/dining area had more than enough seating for everyone.  The apartment is a wonderful mix of historic charm and modern convenience, on a quiet street.  If you have a car there seems to be a limited amount of street parking. We did not, we purchased 7 day visitor passes at the airport that let us ride the T, buses and some ferries...definitely worth looking into.  There is a bus stop at the corner which takes you either downtown, across the bridge or to the T (subway system), from which you can get almost anywhere in Boston. Within walking distance (about 1/2 mile) we saw or visited several small restaurants, a large market, dry cleaners, liquor store, sandwich shop, etc. It's a lovely neighborhood.  We positively would stay here again and recommend it to friends and family.  The only caution might be to families with very small children or individuals with limited mobility.  It is a 2nd and 3rd floor apartment with two of the bedrooms on the 3rd floor.  The stairs are relatively steep and narrow.  That said, grandpa was 83 and we managed just fine."

My husband and I came to Boston with our two year old son and both sets of our parents. We all had plenty of room throughout to be comfortable at all times. Bob is a fabulous host! He was available for any and all questions I had prior to arrival. At our arrival, he met us and helped with all of our baggage. He also provided so many things to help make our stay comfortable and convenient, including plenty of snacks and drinks. Each bathroom was equipped with a hair dryer and plenty of toiletries. The street felt safe and the location was close to several restaurants and attractions. For an added convenience, I recommend using an uber or taxi for travel into the main city of Boston. I will definitely plan to stay here again for our next visit to Boston. I can't imagine a better location!"

We enjoyed the walk into Boston but also loved taking the boat from Charlestown across to Boston harbour. Bob was very welcoming and gave us lots of useful information on our arrival. Would highly recommend him as a host.
3721095,38987855,2015-07-20,13664978,Charles(Charlie),"Everything positive you have read in the previous posts, and then some, are true. The check in and welcome went off like clockwork. The apartment is evn more beautiful when you are actually in it. It was stocked with enough amenities that we never had to go to the grocery store. There were more thn enough towels for the 6 of us. As homeowners know things can always go wrong and that has to be expected also with rentals. To us , it is not will things go wrong , but how they are dealt with. On a warm weekend in Boston I let Bob know on Saturday morning that the AC system did not seem to be working and the very hot forecast for the next 24 hours was very concerning. Although out of town, Bob had a repairman at the apartment early Saturday afternoon, to rectify the problem. This was a great rental experience."

Robert was an excellent host and provided great bathroom amenities, drinks, snacks, games and tourist information to make our stay very enjoyable. This beautiful 3 BR, 2 full bathroom home was located in a quiet neighborhood and within a few blocks of the train, shopping and historical points of interest. We paid far less than we would have paid for a comfortable hotel room in Boston but we gained so much more room and enjoyment. The upper floor outdoor patio was wonderful for relaxing after a day of sightseeing. If we travel to Boston in the future, we will see if Robert's home is available before considering any other accommodations."

The only issue is parking.  We found a place one block down of Terminal Drive where we could leave the rental car for the duration of our stay.  Public transit is plentiful and within close proximity.   We took ferries, subways, buses.  We were advised to start our visit with a  \"\"Duck Tour\"\".

There is a bus stop at the end of the street that connects with the T stops. You can walk a short distance to Bunker Hill if you'd like or take longer walks along the Freedom Trail to many other areas if you feel ambitious. There is a Whole Foods not far from the apartment, along with a CVS, liquor store and restaurants. Be sure to have breakfast at Grasshopper at the corner, it's great!

Bob met us on arrival and was very helpful with suggestions on restaurants and things to do during our stay. The apartment was very spacious and the beds were fantastic. The snacks and drinks very a lovely surprise. The location  was great and we were able to walk into the city centre each day. We would definately recommend  Bob's apartment to anyone visiting Boston.

Bob responded to my emails promptly and had left welcoming snacks for our arrival. His home was perfect and we loved it from the start to finish. When I next go to Boston this will be the first place I check to see if it's available as would definitely stay here again.

3721095,79192632,2016-06-11,10440338,Julie,"We had a wonderful time in Charlestown. It is a short bus trip from the centre of town, however the bus leaves from the end of the street regularly. Charlestown itself is very picturesque and lovely to walk around. Robert's apartment was extremely comfortable for 5 friends travelling together. It had everything we needed and Robert also left plenty of snacks and some supplies in the fridge. We arrived early and were allowed access. I would highly recommend this apartment to friends and family and would certainly stay here again."

Easy to ballpark, airport, and other surrounding areas."
3721095,83391731,2016-07-02,68132912,Megan,"This Charlestown home is absolutely adorable and very comfortable.  Plenty of room for the five of us. The kitchen was stalked with drinks, milk, coffee, bagels and fruit.  Very appriciative for that generous touch.  Only small draw back was the AC did not cool the space adequately; causing the upstairs room facing the street to be on the warm side and stiffling at night. (reason for the four star and not five) With that said, we enjoyed our five nights and would definitely stay again.  Thanks Robert."
Note: Easy access to downtown Boston as well,"using the ferry boat from Navy Yard.  \"",,,,

Robert is very easy to communicate with. When we called he answered and helped immediately. Parking is a bit tough since its a residential area and there is no assigned spaces. If you're planning on being in the city all day this is perfect location. Its 15 mins max away from all your destinations.

1724900,8355194,2013-10-27,8973187,Quentin,Nous avons loué cette maison pour 6 jours et 4 personnes.
Fiona est une très bonne hôte. Pour nous Accueillir chaleureusement,une bouteille de vin nous attendait à notre arrivé. Par ailleurs,elle a regroupé une grande quantité d'informations utiles (connexion internet,commerces proches,adresses de restaurants / bar dans les coin,possibilités de transport) dans une gros classeur
Sa maison est très cosy. La cuisine est très bien équipée (sauf lave-vaisselle) et il y est agréable de cuisiner. Les chambres sont grandes et chaleureuses,à l'image du reste de la maison. Les lits étaient fait et Fiona nous a fourni serviettes de bain et torchons.,,,,
Seul bémol : il faut compter 30 à 40 minutes pour arriver à downtown crossing avec bus+orange line. Un peu long.,,,,,
"A recommencer sans hésitation.\"",,,,,
1724900,12128887,2014-04-23,2607911,Jennifer,"Cute, very homey little house in Boston, comfortable beds, clean towels, pretty much everything you hope for in accommodations. Our hostess made us very welcome with a bottle of wine and fresh coffee beans from the area, but she was also extremely responsive when we had trouble with the lock. She was there in 5 minutes and set us up right."
We were visiting someone in Cambridge during our stay,and at first we thought we would need to rent a car as it was so far,but actually with public transportation we never needed one. There's a bus stop around the corner,with busses every 5 minutes,that will take you to the metro station,and you're near the Boston Symphony in 20 minutes. Even coming home pretty late at nights
1724900,13136226,2014-05-20,7989650,Jaclyn,"We had a great stay in Boston and in this house! Fiona was a very thoughtful and considerate host who went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. She left plenty of information, an extra key, wine, subway cards and even offered to pick my sister up from the airport since she was available. She was very easy to communicate with and always replied quickly to emails. We were all very impressed with her as a host and her beautiful home that we stayed in.

1724900,21602711,2014-10-20,21506291,Maria,"Our stay in FJ's cozy home in the Roslindale section of Boston was terrific. She welcomed us into her home with very clear instructions about access, a lovely bottle of wine, flowers and a binder full of information about the home and the local area. I traveled to Boston with my elderly parents who easily navigated her comfortable home. I was very careful to select places they would be mobile and safe in and this home fit the bill. Roslindale had easy access to highways, the center of Boston and many local stores. We used a rental car so I cannot speak to public transportation but will say that parking on the street was never a problem. FJ's home is bright, warm and a happy place to relax in between day trips to see the local sights. I would definitely return and recommend considering this home if travels take you to Boston!"
1724900,22570952,2014-11-09,23414982,Shirley,"There were detailed instructions about the house and area, fresh flowers, apples, orange juice, baguette and coffee and tea so didn't have to worry about breakfast the first morning. House is very comfortable and homey. Fj was very responsive in addressing our concerns as there was a scheduling issue because we reserved at last minute and a last minute extra guest."

Fiona has lots of information about the surrounding area and Boston.,,,,,
The apt is close to Roslindale village and the train station.Train takes about 30 mins to downtown Boston.,,,,,
We found it  very convenient as we were visiting family.,,,,,
The arboretum is a beautiful place to walk if one likes to get out for a bit of exercise and only 10 mins away.,,,,,
I would highly recommend this apt. Roslindale is a lovely old world village with lots of little shops and restaurants.,,,,,

1724900,35088262,2015-06-15,14154588,Richard,"Fj is the best host.  Always wine for us, water and flowers. Her place in Roslindale is near our grandchildren so walk over and spend all day with them, walking back home after they are asleep.

Our six years old son like to play on a playground no far from the house. Where are many shops, cafe and restaurants around."

1724900,49873954,2015-10-07,6118062,Erica,My friend and I had a lovely stay at Fj's house. The space is comfortable and more than adequate for a stay of a night or longer. We were there 6 nights. We arrived in the evening and were able to get in easily with the instructions Fj had sent beforehand. She emailed us the complete handbook for the house so we knew what to expect - very helpful. We loved the beds which had great comforters and pillows for cooler nights . Our only contact with Fj was via texting but she was very quick in responding to any questions/concerns. Roslindale center is very close and has good places to eat/shop. We also discovered Jamaica Plain in our search for gluten/dairy free options for meals and there are a number of restaurants there that were accomodating. Lovely walks near Jamaica Pond and in the Arboretum.  Two delicious meals in Roslindale at Sophie's Grotto and Birch St. Bistro. We had a car and only used public transportation once to go into downtown Boston. Very easy. We really enjoyed being in a more relaxed neighborhood - people were very friendly and helpful. Had a great time!!!

Great location - 5 minute walk to the downtown Roslindale square and commuter rail.,,,,,

1724900,68779736,2016-04-06,27836149,Karen And Bob,"Just got home from a 7 night stay at Fiona's home in Roslindale. This is the third time we have used airbnb in Roslindale. Two other times with different properties.  Her home is charming. The space was very comfortable. And she was a great host. Very easy to communicate with. The neighborhood was quiet and close to Roslindale squaree. We were visiting our son, his wife, and new baby, who leave a short distance away from Fiona's home. She left lots of extras; coffee, tea, fruit and wine"
1724900,70612705,2016-04-19,45982250,Facundo,The description of the home was very accurate. Is a cute cozy 2 bedroom house about 30min away from downtown Boston via public transit - Orange line for 15 min and pretty much ANY of 5-6 bus lines after that for another 15min). House is older -its BOSTON!- but was clean and everything worked fine.
The host had prepared our 2 bedrooms for arrival,and gave us a bottle of wine,biscotti (amazing),cookies,coffee,tea

I was greeted with nice Vegan cake + English Tea + fresh baked bread (this was customized by her as she knew my parents are visiting from India which was very thoughtful of her). Her home is truly charming, lovely and very well kept with a huge collection of books. There were fresh flowers in the vase of living and dining which lived for an entire week. Quiet neighborhood and a perfect getaway from the city chaos! Easy commute to Boston and places nearby as well. My parents and I totally loved the stay here. Highly recommend it!"

Our hosts (A&L) were very friendly and helpful, the house was beautiful and immaculate, and the beds were super comfortable.  Our room even had it's own private bathroom, so you didn't feel like you were being too intrusive.  The neighborhood was very quiet and safe...just far enough from the hustle and bustle.  3 short blocks to the Bus Line and about 5 short blocks to the Subway made it very easy to get into the heart of the city."
When we come back to Boston,"I won't even bother looking for another place to stay.  We'll just come back and stay with A&L again.  That's my highest recommendation!\"",,,,

The 3rd floor suite with adjoining full bathroom was clean, fresh and has a great view of the JP neighborhood.    Our hosts were attentive and very helpful regarding nearby restaurants, sites, etc. and they welcomed us with shared breakfast goodies from a local bakery.    Finally, the location was fantastic, walkable to both Jamaica Pond and Centre Street.   We really enjoyed a Jamaica Plain Historic Society free walking tour, which are scheduled each Saturday during the summer at 11 AM.    Overall, we highly recommend A & L's B&B as a friendly oasis in JP."

Our time together was limited as we each had full days, but it was nice to return 'home' in the evening and share a bit of our respective day. I enjoyed their personalities very much. All the things you read in the glowing reviews are true. Thank you for opening your home through Airbnb. Marcia"

They even left breakfast stuff ready for us to make, should we want to.  The space itself is gorgeous.  My favorite part was to lay on the day bed by the windows, while it was raining outside and cuddle with a blanket and a book.  Thank you sooo much for your kindness and helpfulness A and L.

There are lots of restaurants and bars nearby and it's really easy to get around by bus/train or taxi/uber. The hosts were friendly and welcoming -- really important since there's no private entrance -- and a pleasure to be invited into this beautiful home. Internet worked great, there was coffee and good breakfast things in the morning (yogurt, fruit, granola, eggs, bread).

Description of house, room, and neighbourhood were accurate, and all were excellent. It was the best Air BandB accommodation we have found, and we recommend it very highly.  It is out of the City Centre, but we found the 10 minute walk to the T Line interesting and safe even late in the evening. We find that to stay in a 'proper neighbourhood' and trip in and out of City sights is for us the most enjoyable way."

The house itself is also very nice - especially the bathroom is great. Also breakfast in the garden in the morning was a great experience.

The space itself was just as the pictures showed -- very sunny,spacious and relaxing.  Wonderful bathroom and I wouldn't change a thing.,,,,
Great location in Jamaica Plains,loved the walking area and Centre street restaurant choices.  We were gone most of the time during the day and chose to eat close by for dinner on a couple of the evenings.  We had a rental car so I can't comment on public transportation.  However,A and L commute on the subway and noticed many walking commuters in the morning.,,,

Once there, the hospitality continued and they were very helpful each day. The listing description was very accurate and the neighborhood was very nice and safe.

The only negative was the lack of a hair dryer,which I had forgotten to take,"as hotels always provide them.\"",,,
2378421,81328214,2016-06-22,74153422,Mark,"This is a delightful property, an older immaculate home in a tree-lined residential neighborhood. It is not terribly convenient to most of Boston's historic sites but public transit is nearby and we had no problem finding parking in the neighborhood (and we were not there as tourists but visiting family who live just a few blocks away). Jamaica Plain has much going for it -- the pond, parks, arboretum and a little bit of a hipster vibe along Centre Street. The cosmopolitan hosts are welcoming and gracious, though not intrusive in the least, and strive to maintain an accessible and comfortable relationship with their guests.  The 3rd floor suite is mostly as advertised and quite lovely, especially the airy sky-light filled bathroom. All in all, a beautifully maintained house and guest quarters with accommodating and flexible hosts (one main rule: remove outdoor shoes while in the house)."
2378421,82279484,2016-06-27,47731586,Marilyn,Antoinette and Louie are extremely gracious hosts. I felt welcome in their beautiful home and will return if in the neighborhood again.
2378421,83541926,2016-07-03,60756497,Mami,The guest quarter is the entire third floor of a beautiful home and it is so spacious with a private large bathroom with skylites. It feels like you have your own nice apartment and it was very comforting we could relax after a long flight. Breakfast things were ready for
us in the kitchen - tasty berries,good bread with butter and jam,granola,eggs,coffee and tea and it was a great help for a good start of the day.,
The whole house is very tastefully decorated and the garden was lovely with full colors of summer flowers. The neighborhood is surrounded by lots of green and we enjoyed riding Hubway bikes that our hosts kindly offered us to use their key fobs for. And even more special was our host Antoinette. She is such a generous and warm-hearted person who was always willing to do everything you could think of to make sure we had things we needed and were comfortable. She treated us like old friends and we really appreciated her kindness. It was a perfect stay and,,,,,
we would definitely come,,,,,
"back if we have a chance. Highly recommended!\"",,,,,
2378421,87929001,2016-07-22,38800907,Paul,"Ours was an excellent experience in every respect -- the welcoming hosts, the beautiful room, and the location.  The surrounding gardens were beautiful as well.  We could walk on a delightful street to both Jamaica Pond, where one can take a walk or a run, or rent a small boat, to the retail activity of Jamaica Plain's Center Street."
2378421,89449687,2016-07-28,13507768,Greg,We truly enjoyed our stay in the lovely third floor space in Jamaica Plains. Our hosts were very welcoming and attentive to our needs.

Always helpful and accommodating, yet never intrusive, they gave us a stay to remember in their beautiful upstairs suite.  It is private and extremely well-appointed.  No fancy hotel could have been better."
Antoinette cares about the finest details in outfitting the guest quarters,using fine linens and--would you believe--even providing a magnifying mirror in the bathroom!  I always miss mine when traveling.  :-),,,,
The location is a short walk from all that the best part of Jamaica Plain has to offer.  We enjoyed many fine restaurants,boutique shops,thrift stores,an antique store,and walking around the Arboretum and Jamaica Pond.,
Our bank was right nearby,and Whole Foods is a goodly walk or a short drive up Centre Street.  Oh,and do go a few extra blocks to try The Blue Nile [Ethiopian Restaurant] sometime during your stay.  It's worth getting in the car for a short drive,but if you choose to stay on the main shopping area on Centre,I'll not hold you to blame.  We could easily have done just that.,
Also,do enjoy the lovely cottage gardens surrounding the house,and the front porch,and the ample parking if you drive.  Oh,"there is just too much to like about this place.\"",
2378421,98812683,2016-09-02,68681617,María Angélica,"Todo en este lugar es para recomendar. Antoinette y Louis son unos anfitriones amables, respetuosos, serviciales y afectuosos."
Su casa es preciosa,perfecta. Muy cuidada,cálida y limpia.,,,
La zona exclusiva de los huépedes es una planta espaciosa,con dos camas muy cómodas,luminosa y hermosa como el resto de la casa. El cuarto de baño es muy amplio,con dos lavabos,ducha y una bañera de jacuzzi.,
Y esta increíble casa está en un barrio encantador y muy seguro que es Jamaica Plain,algo alejado del centro de Boston,pero muy bien comunicado por la línea 39 de bus y la línea Orange de T.,,,

13433475,86012223,2016-07-14,81301658,David,This flat is in a great location at a reasonable price - but 'beautiful' it certainly is not!
It is a dingy basement flat in a building with dilapidated common parts.  What little natural light there is has to penetrate windows that have not been cleaned for a long time.,,,,,
The electrics are rudimentary: the sockets of extension leads dangling in the air because they are not long enough,a power point that is damaged and another that has come away from the wall,cables coming directly out of walls,no central light in the living room and a bare light bulb in the kitchen ceiling.,,
The decoration is poor with bodged repairs to timber and plaster and the walls bearing the traces of whatever had previously been sticking to them.,,,,,
The flat needs a thorough dust and clean. The laundering of the bed linen for the sofa (not a sofa-bed) had not been very thorough!,,,,,
So if your priority is a large flat screen TV in a great location at a budget price and you are prepared to put up with student-style squalour to get it,then this is the flat for you.,,,,
Since pointing out the defficiencies of this flat to Paige she tells me that the filthy window blinds are going to be replaced.  Let's hope that everything else is also attended to.,,,,,

Our flight was canceled and we had to stay an extra day, the host was very quick to respond and access was simple. The apartment is clean and has basic amenities. But let's be real, considering all the wonderful things to do in Boston, we didn't spend any time inside anyway, other than a quick shower, change of clothes and sleeping."
"Thank you Paige for being so accommodating.\"",,,,,
13433475,89624306,2016-07-29,75606332,Derick,"This location was awesome. Got up every morning and walked to a coffee shop. Didn't even need an uber most of the time. Boston Commons is a few blocks away and lots to do. I never felt unsafe for a moment. The overall building itself is old, but has a certain charm with that. The unit is a basement unit, which is fine, but it doesn't exactly show that in the pictures, but I didn't look very hard so take that with a grain of salt. Great balcony access from one of the bedrooms and we truly felt part of the neighborhood. Beacon Hill is great."

She was very open and ready to communicate with us, she told us that she is new to hosting people through airbnb, I think next experiences with her will be better."

Internet is ok,maybe I can suggest Sienna to provide more towels for guests,"one for each person and for the hole time we was there was really too few. \"",,,
13751871,96424569,2016-08-22,41632892,Wiran,Place was as described. Sienna was a great host and provided an iron and ironing board when I requested it.

The proximity to the Harvard T stop and all of Cambridge's great restaurants and shops was great.  Christian's place was well equipped and had laundry right downstairs in the building.  Plenty of street parking too.  An older apartment, but very clean and tidy.  Has all the necessities you need including a stocked kitchen and wireless internet.  Great experience and we would certainly stay here again!"

3131519,14249039,2014-06-15,9253313,Johnson,This is my best airbnb experience so far. Quinn was a very great host . He responded promptly to all my requests/needs before and during  my stay. He is very flexible and conscious of his guests needs. The room was exactly as advertised. Great location. Lechmere station is 3 mins away and would usually take you to Boston within minutes. I met Quinn the day I checked out. Very pleasant man. Would stay here again!
3131519,17120073,2014-08-07,18456973,Da,"The location is great! One minute's walk to metro station, which will take you to most of the attractions. The room is clean and tidy, which feels just like home. However, the bath water is not hot enough for me and I don't know how to turn it up. I didn't ask the host though because it was not that serious. Overall, the experience was satisfying. I really enjoyed my time in Boston and will choose staying here again next time."
3131519,17327584,2014-08-10,3059296,Nicolas,"This is a great, basic place just as the ad describes it, very clean in a shared apartment. Super conveniently located : within minutes to the Lechmere station (which also has a bike share station from 'the hubway' :) ). Quinn was very accommodating and communicative, quick to respond and provided all the information I needed -  I was even able to leave my bag in the place for the day after I checked out."
My stay was pretty quick (1 night) but it worked out perfectly. Maybe the only downside is that it's close to a fairly busy road,so there can be a bit of traffic noise,"but being a normal sleeper it didn't bother me. \"",,,

The room was small but clean and comfortable, and had everything I needed for my short stay. The location of the house is perfect, close to subway so you can get around easily. There is a huge grocery store 5 mins walk from the house as well as nice cafes and food spots. I met the hosts this time and they are nice and friendly. The communication is fast and easy. Keep in mind the space is shared but you still have your privacy. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone going to Boston for a few days."

Difficult to arrange arrival with key pickup/dropoff location 6-8 blocks away (unless you can check in from 2-4 PM only, which is not convenient for business travelers certainly).  Fourth floor walkup, which is not advertised (elevator not working).  Host was in Italy, repeatedly communicated through text/phone/(SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) on the day of and after arrival in a way that came across as impatient and focused on his time zone.  Wet sheets in washer, towels still in dryer, no toileteries, dishes still in dish washer.  Decent neighborhood, close to South Station, some restaurants."

Novlett and her husband Chester were super friendly,easy-going and always supportive. The room itself is nice,definitely big enough for two persons and worth the money. The neighbourhood is OK. Only point of criticism could be that the next train/metro station is 10 min by walking (red line station ashmont is 20-25).,,,

True to its pictures,the apartment is bright and airy,with lots of natural light. Location is terrific - walking distance to many attractions and destinations and if walking isn't your thing,it's also super close to Charles/MGH subway. The apartment was clean and tidy,with fresh sheets and towels and Jay was extremely responsive to all messages and requests. Overall,a very comfortable and enjoyable stay. Highly recommend for a couple or pair of friends.
My only cautions would be:,,,,,
a) Accessibility - the apartment is located up a fairly steep hill,and then on the top floor of the building so 5 flights of stairs. It does list this in the profile but if you were planning to come and go frequently and/or have accessibility concerns,this may not be ideal.,,,
b) Building age - something the photos perhaps don't capture is the age of the building. Whilst the original exposed bricks and wooden floorboards are gorgeous,"the building is fairly old (as are many in this part of town). If you're after the brand-new/\"\"hotel\"\" experience","this may not be for you either.\"",,,

As mentioned in other reviews, you have to walk up a hill and climb five stories of hills to get to the apartment, but it's well worth it.

The location in historic Beacon Hill was exactly what we wanted. We were able to see the beautiful buildings and architecture as we started and ended our day. The location gave us access to options for the subway system, Boston Common, Public Garden, etc."
We were concerned going in July to an apartment without air conditioning. However,we got lucky with some cooler weather. There was an oscillating fan that helped with air flow in the apartment and kept us comfortable while sleeping. On that note,it was a very quiet neighborhood,which made it easy to rest after a long day of sightseeing.,,
The apartment itself had everything we needed. The bed is very comfortable as previously stated. We certainly were happy to have the refrigerator to keep pastries we had purchased from Mike's and Modern Pastries and also the filtered water pitcher to cool off with after our walks. The wifi worked well with our phones and iPad.,,,,,

It can be better if having a fan for the living room where the 3rd person sleeps. Still quite hot in Boston summer. :) Thank you Alice for everything!
3079305,20456643,2014-09-29,3856533,Amanda,"This is a lovely apartment in a fun neighborhood in Boston - the apartment was very close to a T-stop and all in all it was the perfect place from which to explore Boston. The apartment was clean and comfortable. Adam was very welcoming and left us additional food/drink items to make us feel more at home. I think we might have been their first guests and yet we had a perfectly seamless stay and would highly recommend Adam and his apartment to others. Thank you, Adam!"
3079305,21222448,2014-10-13,21196259,Faye,"This place is amazing! Clean and well decorated. Adam and his fiancé were very welcoming. They even left us a book about Boston to guide us during our stay. They live in Jamaica Plain, which is a nice and quiet neighborhood and a few minutes walk to Franklin Park (where the half marathon was held - reason why I was in Boston over the weekend)."

The place was great, seemed newly renovated and located short cab ride from BC's campus.  The apartment had both a front and back balcony and you really experienced life in Jamaica Plains.  Walking distance from a good bar (James Gate)and a trendy coffee shop (Fiores).  We would definantely stay here again in the future, convenient street parking was available."

They have modern appliances in the kitchen, a nice tv (although we really didn't get to use it) and very comfortable furniture. My husband and I stayed in the second bedroom, and although it was small, we slept very well. Their condo is an easy 5 min walk to the Forest Hills T Station, and we also enjoyed walking around their neighborhood. Adam also gave some excellent suggestions for cafes and restaurants. Although we didn't get to try all of them, we definitely enjoyed our dining experiences in the area. Also, the proximity to J.P. Licks is a big plus! Highly recommended."

The apartment was just what we needed for 4 adults in town for the marathon and a little sightseeing.  Perfectly located 5 minutes from the T station with pubs and small grocery store within walking distance. The apartment was clean, cozy, and cute. Adam was a dream to work with, offering advice on transportation to and from airport (even giving a phone number to a reliable cab company and directions), and was always timely with responses to my questions.  Highly recommended."

10231171,62302539,2016-02-13,28566515,Maria,"This was the best air bnb experience I ever had! Joe goes out of his way to make everything perfect for you and he helped me out with everything I asked for - iron, ironing board, hair dryer, and I even borrowed his laptop. Clean, warm, spacious rooms, each with their own extra heater, Joe of course provides towels and clean sheets. Wifi is great, Joe provides shampoo and shower gel and the two bathrooms are great. You can use everything in the kitchen. Well located flat in quiet area with the 66 bus 2 minutes away which takes you straight to HBS/Harvard or of course you can take uber. 15-20 min ride to the airport. But above all the highlight was getting to know Joe, his girlfriend Nancy and their flatmate Omar, who are the kindest, most generous and most genuine people I have ever met. They are super friendly but also understand if you want privacy and then they won't bother you. I came for 5 days for an interview - I thought about getting a hotel or private house on air bnb but I'm so glad I didn't. It's a great option for a budget traveller especially, or for couples/families. If I come to Boston again I will not look for anywhere else!"

Joe has a number of rooms available for AirBnB'ers, but it was very quiet, both of the two bathrooms were almost always available, and I only caught glimpses of the others during their stay. The bedroom and bathrooms were kept nicely ready and clean. It was super hot outside, but we had an AC unit that allowed us to get the room quite cool for easy sleeping. And it's under a 10 minute walk to get to the main Allston food strip."

It was an easy 15 minute walk, which I appreciated and needed. I enjoyed my room, the bed was comfortable and I had access to the full kitchen. It was quiet and the shared bathrooms (2) were fine.

But if you want a comfy, homey, perfectly located place to stay on Beacon Hill - this is perfect! We loved the apartment (lots of character), the area, and the fantastic hosts. This was our first airbnb experience, and my first trip to Boston, and it couldn't have been better.  I had tons of questions and Galen and Kate answered all of them quickly and thoroughly."

"I would definitely stay here again!\"",,,,,
3673104,17074762,2014-08-06,2760095,Stacy,"This is a great apartment in a fantastic location. It is a very short walk to public transit, many shops and restaurants in Beacon Hill and even a quick 15 minute walk over the bridge to Cambridge. Be aware that this listing is on the 5th floor and there is no elevator. I personally didn't mind the exercise! The building's entrance and staircase are pretty sketchy looking right at first but I've found that to be the case in several of the older buildings in the area and I felt very safe and secure in the neighborhood and the apartment, even walking alone at night. The apartment is bright and clean and has great views of the surrounding neighborhood through the many windows. The bedroom has an a/c unit that helps on warm, muggy nights. The second bed, a twin, is comfortable and is in a cute adjoining room to the bedroom. The kitchen is fully equipped for making meals and plenty of room at the table to eat them. The bathroom is spotlessly clean but older and the shower really didn't work very well but it got the job done.  The host was easy to contact and they left a fantastic gift basket of toiletries and treats as well as a welcome letter and helpful signs on doors and drawers to make living there for a few days easy. I would recommend this listing to anyone (except someone with mobility issues or young children because of the stairs) and I hope to stay here next time I'm in the area and many times after!! Great Job, Galen!"
3673104,18843587,2014-09-01,454411,Dana,"Galen's house is exactly what we were looking for: clean, warm, full of character and well located. You can immediately notice that Galen thinks about his guests, placing illuminating notes in key points around the house (lights, shower, food, sheets, etc.), making his guests' lives easier. We had our baby with us on this trip, and Galen even bothered to have a special baby's soap in the shower! We had a great stay in Boston, and Galen's place had a big part in it."

3673104,19965701,2014-09-21,7763041,Carrie,"Our experience staying at Galen's apartment was phenomenal. He was responsive to all of our questions, and extremely accommodating to our travel schedules. He left us a welcome basket and note, clearly labeled his apartment to help guide us (extra towels, etc.), and sent exceptionally clear instructions to help us get in. I truly can't recommend this listing highly enough!"
3673104,32261154,2015-05-16,8585604,David,Galen was a great host and the place was great! I loved the Beacon Hill area and getting to explore all of Boston from a centrally located place was fantastic. It was roomy for the two of us and the breakfast food was a nice unexpected touch. I appreciated the hospitality and prompt responses for any questions I had. Thanks again Galen!
3673104,47862854,2015-09-21,44016437,Annie,"Galen greeted us, gave us a tour, left a welcome basket and breakfast supplies. The neighborhood was great (we actually wish we had spent more time exploring it), the location was perfect, the price was right, the apt was cute, the beds were really comfy, and Galen was really good about answering any questions we had while we were there. The building is quite old so the shower was a bit temperamental, the fire escape  was a little questionable and the living room/bathroom/kitchen got quite warm in the 90 degree weather (the bedrooms were nice and cool) but with the windows open and a fan going it was comfortable. We would definitely stay here again!"
3673104,87927309,2016-07-22,32532666,Patrick,This was in a great area! Easily accessible and prime spot for some Boston exploration.

I didn't meet him but he prepared a very comfortable and clean apartment and breakfast set for us. Also, the location of the apartment is perfect. It is very near to the south station, connecting to most of the attractions within 15 minutes. And the neighbourhood is peaceful as well. I will definitely choose to stay here again."
3673104,95506728,2016-08-20,865592,Kerstin,"We stayed in Galens apartment for 7 nights and loved everything! Its bright and spacious as the description reads, right in the middle of beautiful historic Beacon Hill. The apartment has a very personal touch - not one of those clinical hotel-like apartments."
Galen welcomed us in person,gave us tips and was very eager to make sure we felt comfortable and had everything we needed. He also left some breakfast items for us,coffee and wine which we very much appreciated.,,,
Communication was easy,"Galen replies almost instanteneously. Highly recommended and will definitely stay here again next time I visit Boston.\"",,,,
7482338,40281370,2015-07-29,39190246,Nicolas,"Joe and Patty were very nice, laid back and trustworthy! Everything was as described. They gave me tips on things to see, they offered food and coffee when they could. They prepared a list with the wifi key and their cell phone numbers in case I had any questions during the day. They also recommended different restaurants in the area."
The appartment is located in East Boston,at the heart of the South American community,"so there are many Spanish-speaking restaurants and shops in the area. It's a 10 minute walk from the appartment to the \"\"Maverick\"\" blue-line station of \"\"the T\"\" (subway/metro system).  All in all",it's 15-20 minutes away from the downtown area (State street,Quincy Market,etc). I found it very convenient
7482338,40403904,2015-07-30,13949848,Ignacio,"Probably the perfect Airbnb. Patty & Joe were super nice. They were very willing to help with directions, ideas for things to do, restaurants, etc. The entire apartment was perfectly clean and well put together. Its also very close to public transportation. We enjoyed our stay there and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an affordable place to stay in a safe neighborhood that is very close to downtown and the airport."
7482338,40667071,2015-08-01,39258589,Chris,"If you're looking for an amazing, clean, welcoming room with all the amenities you'd need for a stay near the Boston Airport, then look no further."
This place has got to be one of the best values on AirBnB,thanks to how Joe and Patty set everything up for you.,,,,
From flexibility in picking up the keys to a cork board with reminders on how things work,this place had it all.,,,,
You're welcomed into the room with a bottle of water and plenty of towels,clean sheets,pillows,and a huge floor fan (a big plus during my summer stay).,,
Access in the apartment to A/C,HD TV,a sizeable fridge,and a bathroom that's very well kept and clean.,,

7482338,43658705,2015-08-21,38015656,Ben,Joe and Patty were fantastic hosts. They gave us tips on local places to eat and things to do. The room is exactly as described with a large comfortable bed. The apartment was queit and for most of our stay we had it to ourselves due to Joe and Patty working long hours. The location makes it so easy to access the local station  (airport) and then take the blue line into central Boston. A great experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
7482338,44072692,2015-08-23,26479749,Delo,Amazing Hosts!
Joe and Patty made me feel welcome and comfortable. The neighborhood was friendly,room was clean,"and house was well kept. Had a great time.\"",,,

House is the same as the pictures, clean and have sunshine. And the house does close to the station and airport, it really fit the person who carry a lot of stuff and luggage. It's really nice to meet Joe and Patty."
7482338,47321008,2015-09-17,43898242,Katy,We had a very pleasant stay. Joe & Patty are very friendly.
The T (subway) isn't a long walk and it's easy to get around.,,,,,
The only thing is parking was a bit of an issue. It's street parking. By the time we got back in the evening,there's no parking so we have to park where the meter parking are and move the car in the morning. But if you find a good parking spot,you can leave it there for the day. Which that's what we did and travel by public transportation. Much cheaper than tolls and parking lot fees.,,,
"Would recommend!! \"",,,,,
7482338,47495806,2015-09-19,39368354,Jonathan,Nous avons passé 2 nuits chez Patty et Joe pendant notre séjour à Boston. L'appartement est parfaitement conforme à la description et très agréable même si la chambre est un peu petite. Il est situé dans un quartier populaire très animé de Boston et proche de l'aéroport qu'on peut facilement rejoindre à pied. Il faut environ 20 min pour aller au centre en prenant le métro dont la station la plus proche est à 10 min à pied.
A notre arrivée,nous avons été accueillis avec des bouteilles d'eau fraîches ce qui était très appréciable étant donné la chaleur qu'il faisait à Boston le jour là.,,,,
"Patty et Joe sont très sympathiques et nous aurions souhaité discuter un peu plus avec eux si notre anglais avait été meilleur et si nous avions eu plus de temps.\"",,,,,
7482338,47864823,2015-09-21,17427660,Xue,Everything is perfect! The room is clean and cozy. The kitchen is convenient. Flexible check in & out time is great and makes our trip so easy. It's so close to the airport that we went back grabing the suitcase at 5:40pm to catch the flight leaving at 7pm. Joe and Patty are lovely hosts! They also give us the Charlie card for transportation.  So sweet! I strongly recommend you living here to enjoy the trip in Boston.
"\"",,,,,
7482338,49222180,2015-10-02,14320352,Edward,"Lovely little room and flat in a convenient location for those who need to get to the airport.  Joe was very helpful and friendly (even carried a heavy bag up the stairs!), and let us leave our bags in the flat all day so we could collect for flight later.  Only stayed one night so hard to judge the area etc, but would recommend for those looking in this area."
7482338,50036733,2015-10-08,5668559,Jj,"The room was great.  Clean, convenient and all the needed amenities.  Thank you Joe and Patty.  I would stay there again."

7482338,50936835,2015-10-16,860610,Cindy,Patti and Joe were great hosts - welcoming and warm.  The room is small but clean.  We ended up changing our plans suddenly and they were flexible about this.
Five stars for the host,"maybe four stars for the room and environs as this is an area in transition.\"",,,,
7482338,51167128,2015-10-18,42335053,Valerie,Good location. Very near airport. The host are kind.
7482338,52234563,2015-10-27,44353456,Roberta,"Excellent experience for my first time using Airbnb!  The room was exactly as stated on the site, no surprises.  Patty and Joe were not in when we arrived but, once we did get to meet them, they were very pleasant and helpful.  Their recommendations were spot on.   Two equal distance T stations to choose from, I enjoyed the walk to the Airport T over the Maverick T station but there were more places to eat and get coffee walking to the Maverick T.  I would recommend, without a doubt!!  Thank you Joe and Patty for a comfy room while we visited Boston."
7482338,52402047,2015-10-29,34989766,Cristina & Andy,"The apartment was easy to get to from the airport and easy to gain access to. Joe and Patty were very welcoming. The room is as described. Small, but clean and comfortable. The location allowed for an easy & quick ride on the subway to downtown Boston. This location was the perfect spot for our two night layover in Boston."
7482338,53423968,2015-11-08,47972845,Fiona,"It's a cozy and compact space to stay in. Host is responsive and patient. Details are adorable, that you can see the host cares. Bathroom is very clean which is impressive. Because the host left for the weekend, I felt more freedom using living room. The rooms and the apt indeed are very small. The ceiling is a bit low. Neighbors like to play loud music however, I do get bothered by that. But if you are planning to stay short and visit Boston downtown (less than 20 min drive but there is toll) than stay in during daytime, this apt should be a nice choice."
7482338,54050382,2015-11-15,47110380,Augusto,"The room is conveniently located near the airport. Just a $10 taxi ride. Very important for me since I was catching a 7:00 am flight. The apartment is very cozy, unfortunately I was not able to meet Joe and Patty since they were out of town. Everything was great. I would recommend this room without reservations!"
7482338,57276090,2015-12-23,19571887,Jonathan,"Like other reviewers have stated, the apartment is very convenient for travelers. I had a short overnight layover and getting to Joe and Patty's apartment was fast and simple. While they were out of town, communicating with them was easy. Their apartment was cozy, and I was able to get a good night's sleep before continuing my travels the next day. If my travels bring me back through Boston, I'd stay here again."
7482338,59540991,2016-01-11,18903416,Sophie,Very nice experience.
7482338,68293876,2016-04-04,3756136,Nina,Joe and Patty were easy to communicate with before my arrival and they were very friendly and helpful during my stay. The room is cosy and the apartment is conveniently located. It is near to the airport and is only a 10 min walk from the metro to the centre. It is definitely an excellent option for people who are visiting Boston and do not want to spend a fortune on their accommodation.
7482338,69193421,2016-04-10,36246507,David,Jo and Patty were terrific. We arrived very late and tired to a personal and warm welcome. Instructions on how to get in were clear and the bed was super comfortable. Whilst it's a small unit we were made to feel like friends and not intruders. I highly recommend this host (PS) you can also sample some great coffee direct from El Salvador :-)
7482338,70478074,2016-04-18,58121759,Natasha,"Overall, a wonderful experience!  Both Joe and Patty were very welcoming.  Always willing to answer any questions.

Joe and Patty are great hosts and I enjoyed chatting with them. The room is relatively small but has everything you need. The bed was very comfortable.,,,,,
You can get to the apartment in around 15 minutes by foot,"which is great. Getting to the city center is easy too. It's like a 10-15 minute walk to either Maverick or Airport T-Station and a very short ride into the city.\"",,,,
7482338,72158131,2016-05-01,15615038,Adela,We loved staying at Joe and Patty's apartment!
It is always bathed in light and the low ceiling makes it very cozy. The room is small,but functional,and honestly you wouldn't need more space.,,,
Joe and Patty were not there when we stayed at their place,but they were very helpful in leaving all the instructions we needed.,,,,
The neighborhood is cool too! It's the home of the Latino community of Boston and this makes the area very lively.,,,,,

7482338,74075292,2016-05-13,66488143,Nagesh Kumar,"Joe and Patty were very nice and friendly and received me very well when I arrived at their place. Bed room and bath room are very small and bed room was very hot as soon as I entered into it and there was no fan or AC and there is no place to hang my cloths in the bed room, I did not feel very comfortable staying there and I do not recommend it to anyone else. It is not worth paying $95 per night for that kind of place (I think it is worth paying around$50 per night) and the neighbourhood is ok not great."
7482338,74755742,2016-05-16,60834485,Lauren,Joe and Patty were so kind.  The room was clean and cozy.  The apartment was very convenient to the subway and airport.

7482338,76037188,2016-05-24,63800570,Josh,Joe and Patty were friendly and helpful in our stay in Boston. We relied on public transit and their place was very close to the blue line. There was also a grocery store within walking distance of the apartment. We highly recommend staying with them if you're in the Boston area!
7482338,77769295,2016-06-03,18274455,Krystle,Joe and Patty were such great hosts. I got to meet Patty who was very friendly. Her and Joe were so accommodating and were flexible with my check in time and check out time so I could get some rest in between flights. It's super close to the airport and public transit so if that's a priority for you then this place is perfect.
Keep in mind,"it's an old building so you'll be carrying your bag up 2-3 flights of stairs. Not a bad thing if you know how to pack.\"",,,,

I was busy from morning to evening on business in Boston (easily accessible, I used Uber), so basically was at the apartment just to sleep - and found it most comfortable and a quiet neighborhood (with great Pizza at the corner restaurant)."
7482338,81263046,2016-06-21,16239798,Stefanie,"Joe and Patty were great hosts and also the late check in was no problem. They left the key with a lockbox in the mailbox. The apartment was very close to the airport and you do not need to take the metro to get there if 10 minutes walking is no problem for you. It might be tricky to get a heavy suitcase to the apartment, because it is located on the top floor and there is no elevator. The room is pretty small, but it was ok for us. The WLAN connection worked pretty well and there were also a hair dryer and cosmetics for us ready to use. I would recommend the apartment for a short visit of Boston."
7482338,87691428,2016-07-21,15084779,Sherry,"Patty and Joe were wonderful hosts.  They genuinely care about their guests' visit to the city of Boston.  We attribute the success of our vacation to the city of Boston to the help and kindness that Patty and Joe provided us during our stay.  As soon as we arrived, Joe went out of his way to help carry our luggage to the apartment.  Patty and Joe were very helpful in making great suggestions of places to visit and local restaurants to eat in.  Although they are a busy, young couple, they checked in on us periodically to see if we needed anything.  East Boston is a little removed from some of the sights sought out by tourists; however, the T is about a 15 min. walk from their apartment.   Everything is easily navigable.  Additionally, Patty was very kind in forwarding us discounts to two different transportation services (Uber)."

It is really close to the train station (really impressive transportation system in Boston btw), if you don't want to walk till the train station you can get an Uber for $6 and $10 to the airport.

Fabulous neighborhood restaurants include Aquitaine, 657 Tremont, B&G Oysters, Coppa and Stella to name a few. Also minutes from Starbucks and a terrific sandwich shop.

1200502,19756558,2014-09-17,21191205,Antonio,We felt very welcome and comfortable from booking to checkout. The place is just as described. Very nice neighborhood and placement is convenient. Would recommend.
1200502,20631307,2014-10-02,1118156,Mark,"The apartment was perfect.  Very clean, and great location.   I'll definitely be back."
1200502,21378643,2014-10-16,9124143,Tom,"The studio was just lovely - charming design, great location, beautiful block. Also, restaurants, convenience stores, public transportation are all within close walking distance.  It includes a fully functioning bathroom, kitchen, television, fireplace and wifi, with a bookcase loaded with maps and brochures.  The heat is not controlled by a thermostat in the studio, but Karoline accommodated us twice by turning it up.  Parking can be challenging, but we never parked more than a block away.  Absolutely will come back here."
1200502,21700458,2014-10-22,3377671,Brandi,"This cute little South End apartment was great. It was the perfect size for me and my best friend, and it was in a great location for food, drinks, coffee, and close to a few T stations, making it super convenient for our travels around Boston. Clean, safe, cute. Just what we needed. I would say that the only downside to our stay was the lack of communication the day before and the day of our arrival. After trying to contact Karoline a few times for info about the key situation, we ended up having to contact one of the others on the emergency contact list to ensure we had all the info we needed to get into the house upon arrival. It would  have been nice to have gotten a response from her before our plan got in the air, saving us a lot of anxiety on our flight to Boston. In general, (after our very initial communications when booking) communication with Karoline was not as quick or reliable as I would have liked, but overall our stay in her apartment wasn't hurt to badly by it. Better response time and more clear instructions on how to access the apartment/keys/lockbox would have been really helpful."
1200502,29207144,2015-04-05,9373155,Joel,Karoline's place was absolutely perfect! I would gladly stay there again and recommend it to friends.
1200502,30489470,2015-04-23,18839603,Judy,"My husband and I booked this lodging for a 5 day stay for the Boston Marathon. The apartment was clean, lots of towels, comfy bed and great location! It was great staying in such an authentically Boston location . . . felt safe and able to walk to many of the shops and restaurants within the area. Loved that it was only a short 15 minute walk from the marathon finish line and large enough to bring back some runners to grab a snack and a drink. Our celebration was a little noisy that afternoon, so hope we did not disturb any of the residents. Karoline was extremely helpful in answering our questions and making sure we were comfortable and all of our needs were taken care of, calling us several times during our stay. We would definitely return should we come to Boston in the future. Thank you Karoline!!"
1200502,30608114,2015-04-25,1120884,Francisco,"Great location and very clean, this apartment is spacious and has everything needed for a few days or longer stay. A kitchen makes it easy for those that want to have breakfast before departing to other adventures, and a landline can be useful as well. Karolin contacted me ahead of time and sent me detailed package with information that was useful. Since my check-in schedule was a bit unpredictable, using a lock case to provide the keys at checkin was very convenient and stress free. Check-out was equally easy. Nearby many small restaurants with great food. Good value for money in a city like Boston."
1200502,33565855,2015-05-30,8421802,Anja,Karoline' place was very nice especially the outside garden. The location is perfect close to cafes and restaurant. I can really recommend people staying here.
1200502,35597021,2015-06-20,35245794,Selma,We had a great short stay at Karoline's lovely studio! She was incredibly hospitable and helpful the whole way. The place is in a perfect location tons of shops and restaurants nearby. The studio was very clean and had all the amenities and an added lovely garden. Really perfect! Thanks. :)
1200502,38264428,2015-07-14,29121664,Lauren,Studio is as described and in a nice part of town. Unfortunately not made to feel welcome by the host.
1200502,38553098,2015-07-16,37798096,Whitney,Loved every minute my husband and I spent at this super cute studio.  We walked everywhere and even spent an evening drinking wine in the garden before heading to dinner.  Lots of fun dining around this area and a great hub for traveling the city too!

We didn't see the hosts after the initial check-in, but felt comfortable with the set up of the room and ways in which they said we could contact them.  Would certainly stay again!"

"We had a few issues connecting initially with the host for the check in but I guess it was very particular\"",,,,,
1200502,69529000,2016-04-11,14770551,Ken,Karoline went to great lengths to welcome me and make sure that I had everything needed to settle in comfortably. The studio itself is truly a wonderful space in an amazing (building and) neighborhood. It was very clean and well maintained. The furnishings were an thoughtful selection of fine New England pieces. The appliances worked well and the temperature was perfect. Karoline kept in touch throughout my stay. I will definitely return as soon as the opportunity arises. Many thanks to Karoline and Todd.
1200502,71118611,2016-04-23,34049201,Jan,The apartment meet our needs.  The front door was rather difficult to open. The distance to our daughters house was a very pleasant 15 minute walk. The only negative was that most of the dinner plates and some utensils were greasy. We did put them in the dish washer to make sure they were clean.  Overall it was a great stay
1200502,72571297,2016-05-03,19876355,Claudia,"El departamento es idéntico a las fotos, súper cálido y pintoresco, muy bien equipado y en un barrio muy seguro y tranquilo. Siempre es un plus el hecho de tener tu propia entrada al edificio, te da mucha privacidad y en este caso además la entrada es por un patio súper lindo. Otro beneficio es el hecho de poder usar el lavarropas y el secador y lo bien equipada que está la cocina. Quizás lo que podría mejorar es que el control de temperatura es central de todo el edificio con lo cual uno no puede regularlo y nos tocaron días bastante fríos para lo que estamos acostumbrados. Y la otra cosa que definitivamente podría mejorar es la cama, el colchón es algo incómodo y resulta duro."
1200502,76282768,2016-05-26,62942310,Isabel,"Nos pareció un hermoso lugar!!! Karoline era muy servicial y el lugar estaba completamente preparado para recibirnos. Fácil acceso, muchos lugares buenísimos cerca y un vecindario tranquilo."
"Sin duda si regresamos a Boston nos hospedaremos en el mismo lugar.\"",,,,,
1200502,78076339,2016-06-05,42523279,Susan,This was the perfect location and space for us. We were greeted upon arrival and made to feel very welcomed. The space was very charming and the studio itself was very comfortable.
1200502,79084711,2016-06-11,43507966,Siting,Everything is good as described. The location is very convenient and close to prudential center. Karoline is very nice too.
1200502,79654676,2016-06-13,3788503,Sergey,Quite and well equiped apartment in a very convenient location in South End. Facing lovely courtyard full with birds' singing!
"Thank you\"",,,,,
1200502,86016485,2016-07-14,39254969,Annie,"This was the perfect place to stay whilst touring Boston for a few days. The South End neighbourhood is fantastic. Great restaurants, lovely vibe and easy walking into the back bay and more central areas. Was nice to be slightly out of the action of the more downtown areas as well and the apartment was a great respite. Well kept, cosy, great back garden and Karoline was very helpful and friendly. This was our first Airbnb experience and we were not disappointed."
1200502,87404251,2016-07-20,70820026,Chris,"My wife and I traveled to Boston for a concert at Fenway and a general desire to experience the City. We were not let down. The food, concert and City was amazing. Karoline's place was in a perfect spot to enjoy everything in the South End as well as the North. Boston's public transportation system is so easy to get around in that it does not burden a guest with the need to rent a car. We did have a small snafu in the beginning of our trip with gaining access to the physical location of the unit but Karoline communicated to us through all of our challenges.  We utilized late check-in which was great due to our delayed flights. No complaints at all about the accommodations other than maybe the bed being a bit uncomfortable after walking 10+ miles a day in the City.  Thank you again for opening up this property for us to stay in!"
1200502,89300464,2016-07-27,21329911,Alejandra,"El apto muy prolijo y muy limpio, y sobre todo muy cuidados todos los detalles. No encontramos punto débil y estuvimos muy a gusto. Incluso tienen una carpeta a disposición con toda la información disponible sobre la logística en la cuidad. Servicio completo mínimo disponible y todo muy moderno. Nos sentimos como en un buen hotel, todo impecable."
El jardín es un excelente lugar para desayunar o relajarse en la tarde luego de un largo día de recorrido,y puede ser la alternativa ideal para entrar o salir con valijas pesadas si tienes dificultad con las escaleras.,,,,
"Karoline está siempre disponible para ayudar o aconsejarte lo que necesites.\"",,,,,
1200502,96170350,2016-08-22,6787939,Julia,We stayed at this lovely apartment for a long weekend. Everything we needed was there and ready. The home is in a lovely neighborhood within walking distance to everything we wanted to do.
1200502,99950916,2016-09-06,27236196,Aleksandra,The condo was clean in a nice neighborhood. It was as described with the  amenities one might need when visiting a city. The backyard garden was very cute with a little pond and greenery all around.
Karoline was not very friendly or responsive before the trip. I asked to provide me with the details of a check-in process and the condo address. The host wouldn't send me instructions until the afternoon of the arrival day.,,,,,
"Karoline and her husband were much friendlier after we checked in.\"",,,,,
9711934,59443910,2016-01-10,33384443,Nabil,Olga was a fantastic host! The apartment and room were very clean. The bed was super comfortable. This is a great place to stay if you have a lay-over at Logan or just want to visit Boston. It costs $2.50 to get from the the Airport to her apartment using the silver line - take the free shuttle (Bus #22) from the airport to the MTBA (subway). Get on the train that takes you to BOWDOIN but you will get off at the first  stop (Maverick). It is then a 5-8min walk.
"I will definitely try to rebook this room when I revisit Boston!\"",,,,,

I would highly recommend this apartment to any would-be renters. The location of the apartment is excellent. It is less than a 3-minute walk to the Maverick T station, which goes directly to downtown and is running constantly. The location is in a nice, quiet area of Boston, that has some great restaurants such as Santarpio's pizza. I would highly recommend this apartment to others."
9711934,67110496,2016-03-26,62120947,Francis,Olga and her mom were great!! They have a lovely place close to the centre of Boston. They both made me feel really welcome. The room is very nice and all is exactly how it is described. I will definitely stay here again if I ever come back to Boston
9711934,67185549,2016-03-27,59394447,Gabriella,"What a warm reception! Olga and her mother are incredibly generous and friendly hostesses. They have a way of making you feel at home right away. Olga is quick to respond to any questions and needs you may have. The apartment is close to the Maverick metro station, which makes transportation to the city and the airport smooth and convenient. The 3rd floor walk up apartment was comfortable and matches the listing. I look forward to staying with these ladies, should I be in Boston again."
9711934,68106219,2016-04-02,55035390,Joel,"I really enjoyed my stay at this listing. The location was very convenient as it is only a block away from the MBTA that takes you into Boston.  The apartment is very nice and clean, and the bed was very comfortable. Also, Olga and her mother Olena were awesome. They were extremely welcoming and helpful with my first visit to Boston."

9711934,68579872,2016-04-05,24781888,James,Olga made my arrival easy from the start and had everything prepared for me. The house was very easy to find and close to the subway and from there to everything in Boston.  Very convenient and an ideal way to see the city.
9711934,68744047,2016-04-06,26223458,Judy,"I was welcomed to Olga's apartment by her mother, Olena. The apartment is a very short walk from the blue line (T) and is small but cozy. For the price and accessibility to the airport, it is quite a bargain. The cab ride to the airport at 4:00 the next morning cost less than $7.00. The bed was comfortable and I slept very well."
Olena was the perfect hostess. She was very welcoming and interested in my plans,but she was not at all intrusive. When my take out dinner failed to show up on a snowy April night in Boston,Olena insisted on making me a delicious salad accompanied by cheese and some lovely Ukrainian cold meat. We enjoyed a meal and a glass of wine together and talked for quite a while. I could not have asked for a nicer night anywhere. We even exchanged small gifts and I left knowing I had a new friend whom I value very much.,,,
I would highly recommend Olga's apartment to anyone,whether you need quick access to the airport or not. Mine was the sort of experience that makes airb&b such a great alternative to sterile,"expensive hotel rooms.\"",,,
9711934,69696303,2016-04-12,45269807,Mark,"Very pleasant experience.  Cozy.  Clean, Quiet.  Olga's mom was the nicest.  Parking was a question and here is the deal:  In the evenings you can park on the street from 6pm to 8am without restrictions.  (I paid $10 in a private lot down the street.)  During the day there is a 2 hour maximum on the street.  Walking distance to the subway, as well as restaurants, coffee shops, etc.  Safe area.  Boston police precinct walking distance as well as fire station block away.  7 minutes to Logan  Airport.  Would stay with Olga and her mom again."

I arrived at 9pm, and felt very comfortable walking in the neighborhood."
9711934,73008927,2016-05-06,9218905,Neil,Excellent experience! Olena  (Olga's mom) was the host and was very gracious and pleasant to speak to. I only stayed for one night and it was very convenient to the subway and airport.  Recommended.

I love biking this part of Boston. It is a nice ride up to Revere Beach. The rail trail is just a block away.  You can also take your bike on the subway which is just a few blocks away.  Within minutes you are in downtown Boston.,,,,,
East Boston has  long history as a neighborhood of immigrants which makes the neighborhood very alive,good ethnic foods. There is some gentrification happening so it will be interesting to see how this neighborhood changes.,,,,
There is a parking lot down the street for $ 10.00/day.  But parking is free on the street after 6:00 PM and on weekends.  Otherwise it is a 2 hr. limit.,,,,,

The location was great....easy walking to everywhere (we are walkers).  Close proximity to a CVS, Walgreens, Macy's and the downtown shopping district, but we also walked to the North End and to the Aquarium.   Subway stops are not far away.  Building was great...our 20 something kids used the indoor pool.  Only disappointment is that one of the beds was a double, not a queen.  Otherwise we had everything we needed.  Building is quiet, with a doorman, and an adjacent parking garage.  The wifi worked perfectly, as did the ability to stream to the TV.  The place was immaculate and very quiet.   We loved the city view.   We could have used a few more cooking utensils (mixing bowls), but we managed.  (We tend to bring or buy food and cook in).

The apartment had everything we needed, it was very comfortable and clean. The weather was freezing cold but the apartment was warm, cozy and quick to heat. The views across the city were beautiful and the balcony an added bonus. The apartment was spacious, had great storage and with 5 of us staying (2 adults, 2 teenagers and a 6 year old) gave us all the space we needed. There was no noise from any neighbouring (URL HIDDEN) pool was a little cold but the kids loved it and it was brilliant being able to nip downstairs and get a coffee.

1873046,12704354,2014-05-08,570385,Tiffany,"For a last minute trip to Boston, I booked this apartment because of the host's positive reviews for other properties and the central location. Ahmed was responsive during booking, and Eddie (the property manager) was very helpful and friendly, even giving me tips on where to eat and sightsee. The apartment is very close to some nice parts of Boston, but be prepared for the soup kitchen on the same block. There's noise from neighbors and the street, but they do provide earplugs for guests! I'd also recommend an eye mask because flashing lights from the parking garage across the street comes through the blinds at night. It seems all but the bathroom was remodeled recently, and the hallway (out of the host's control, unfortunately) smells of cigarette smoke from the neighbors."

There is a T stop at the end of the street which was really helpful. Eddie met us (in the middle of a Tuesday night!!) to let us in and show us around. He was very kind and gave us a run-down of the area so we weren't so lost when we got up in the morning. Ahmed and Eddie were both very responsive and helpful through the whole process which was reassuring. The apartment had everything we needed. My only warning would be that Boylston is a very busy street at all hours, and with the bedroom window facing the street from a lower level, it could get pretty noisy at night so bring headphones/earplugs/sleepaid if you are a light sleeper. Other than that, this place was pretty great!"
1873046,36378312,2015-06-28,18467302,Abigail,"We stayed at this apartment for a total of 6 weeks while doing a summer term at BU. I'll start with the good: the apartment was in a very convenient location (near the T, near South Station, relatively near to the airport as well). It was located near the chinatown area so there was a lot of food. The apartment itself was pretty spacious - as what was shown on the site. The kitchen was well furnished. The bad: when we first arrived the cleanliness of the apartment was less than desirable. On the surface it looked pretty neat, but when we opened the closet we found lots of stuff, like clothes, crutches, boxes, plastic bags (essentially, lots of junk) - probably left behind by the previous tenant. The ceiling lights in the kitchen and living area weren't working and we were told to make do with a standing lamp. It was bright but definitely not bright enough to light both the kitchen and living area. The toilet was completely bare though - no soap, shampoo, toilet paper - which was a huge problem for us because we arrived pretty late into the night and were unable to get these items at that time. All in all an ok stay but could be better."
1873046,43519362,2015-08-20,12096378,Scott,"The host was very accommodating, even buying an iron when the original appeared to have gone missing.  Fantastic service."
Location: Pros: very close to T-stations,near Boston common and downtown,,,,
Cons: the neighborhood (not surprising for its location near the heart of Boston) was not devoid of a few dodgy characters,,,,,
Apartment: Pros: very spacious,nicely appointed,all the basics for a nice stay,,,
Cons: the outside traffic could be a little noisy late at night (for someone like me who has trouble sleeping),but the host had provided a box fan which provided sufficient white noise that it was not a major issue,,,,
Overall: a very good value for the area,"I would stay there again\"",,,,
1873046,44534382,2015-08-27,36592803,Janet,We were really happy with the flat - it's very central and we found it easy to move about by foot. We travelled in three and were pretty comfortable using the double bed and sofa. The place was clean and the wifi worked fine. The host was courteous and helpful. Would choose it again!
1873046,51549108,2015-10-21,1895774,Muriel,"Great location for this appartment, near Boston Common.  I have not met Ahmed, but its assistant Eddie welcomed me."

1873046,56383013,2015-12-13,4471409,Ricky,"Very nice place, great location. Short walk to T station and great restaurants.  Ahmed and Eddie are very easy to communicate with. Super simple check in and check out process."
"\"",,,,,
1873046,57036467,2015-12-21,7000556,José,Amazing location and the apartment had everything you need for a comfortable stay.  Even accommodated an extension of checkout time.
1873046,59756046,2016-01-15,40379959,Melissa,Excellent communication and accommodation. The location is perfect for exploring the city and just the right size for a couple. I would highly recommend staying here if you're visiting the city.
1873046,60355299,2016-01-22,30805503,Elizabeth,"Ahmed was out of town, but Eddie was very helpful with quick text responses to travel questions and directions. The building has a great location to numerous subway lines, food and entertainment. Was also an easy walk to old North End. Friday & Saturday nights proved to be very loud with the street clogged with cars, loud music and ambulance sirens till 3:00am. The apartment is getting a little shabby with chipped appliances, scuffed walls, and dingy carpets. The smell of pot is heavy in the hall as soon as you get off the elevator, and can sometimes be smelled from the apartment. Checking out was easy with just a text to Eddie and a pleasant response back from him."
1873046,64059240,2016-02-29,21215831,Hekam,"booking was done very professional with Ahmed, yet dealing with him after moving in was not really friendly , as he is not diplomatic at all, Eddie on the other hand was very welcoming and understanding."
Apartment is very nice and great location,"you need to chk carefully that everything is clean.\"",,,,
1873046,65563313,2016-03-15,13414767,Aj,Pros:
Booking and check-in / check-out processes very simple and professional. Apartment is functional with full kitchen but slightly dated. Good central location close to public transportation and restaurants. Great elevator and easy access. Great wifi and cable TV.,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
Homeless shelter directly across the street means that there are a number of homeless people hanging around,which didn't feel very safe at times and made the area quite loud much of the day (and into the night). Strong smell of pot in the hallway.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1873046,66997412,2016-03-26,50851158,Koll,"Overall, my experience was good. The apartment was exactly as advertised and met all of our needs. It was in a good area, extremely close to Boston Common and not far from most attractions. Ahmed was responsive and assigned his assistant Eddie to communicate with us and give us the keys/show us the place."
There was some confusion after our arrival because Eddie couldn't make it in time to meet us so he sent someone else to minimize our waiting time. Not to sound disrespectful,but the person who met us at Starbucks with our key was not professional at all and could not communicate effectively with us. He was hard to understand and he didn't understand what we meant when we asked if he was from AirBnb. After we came to the conclusion that he was who we were supposed to meet with he just walked us to the bottom of our building before leaving us with the keys. However,Eddie was responsive via text message and provided us with information when we contacted him.,,,
A few days after our visit had ended I received a confusing text message from Eddie that was asking if we could drop off the keys somewhere. I let him know that we had left a few days ago when sent a message informing him so. He quickly said okay and apologized. This could have just been an innocent mistake of his by messaging me instead of someone else,but I'm not sure.,,,,
Besides the confusion upon arrival and departure,"the visit was very pleasant and the apartment was great. I would recommend this location. \"",,,,
1873046,69923649,2016-04-14,16833850,Tricia,The location was great and made it easy to get around town. The apartment was perfect for what we needed. The one challenge was a lot of noise outside which made it difficult to sleep well.
1873046,70263114,2016-04-17,14611810,Fanping,"This is not a typical Airbnb setup, i.e., the host is the owner and lives in or nearby.  Instead, this unit is managed by a team of professionals.  It is listed under Ahmed, but you will be received by Eddie, and if Eddie is not there, it will be Kevin - both Eddie and Kevin claim to be Ahmed's assistant.  I was in touch of three of them before arrival but was greeted by Eddie.   Met at the Starbucks by the corner, handed over the key, shared WiFi coordinates, and that's it.  You are supposed to go to the unit by yourself, open the door, and set in.  When you check out, drop the key, text Eddie, and supposedly cleaning contractors will be sent for.  Overall, this experience is satisfactory, but different.  I would recommend this place to friends, but with detailed explanation."
1873046,70670368,2016-04-19,8366601,Amy & Kohl,"Overall, we had a pleasant stay. We enjoyed the location, but the block the apartment is on was rather noisy and there was quite a bit of commotion outside. Communication with the host wasn't as clear as we would have liked."
1873046,72294737,2016-05-01,57487850,Hrvoje,I feel our stay very nice in Boylston Street. Nice place very good located.
1873046,73654284,2016-05-09,45073634,Jorge,"Really enjoyed the stay at Ahmed's place. The check in and check out was very smooth. Great location, apartment was very clean, kitchen was well equipped, TV and internet worked well too. Highly recommend and would definitely stay again."
1873046,73909196,2016-05-11,63413501,Ana Lia,NOS SENTIMOS CÓMODOS PORQUE EL DEPARTAMENTO TENIA TODO LO QUE NECESITAMOS. A  NUESTRO PARECER NO ESTABA DEMASIADO LIMPIO Y LA ROPA BLANCA TAMPOCO. EL SILLÓN CAMA DEL COMEDOR NO LO PODÍAMOS ABRIR Y SE TUVO QUE DORMIR CON EL COLCHÓN EN EL SUELO. LO BUENO DEL DEPARTAMENTO ES QUE LA UBICACIÓN ES EXCELENTE!.
1873046,74052308,2016-05-12,5280022,Karin,"Perfect spot! Super convenient location, not far from train station and across the street from subway! Eddie, Ahmed's assistant, was super accomodating in meeting with us to drop off the key as our shuttle ran late and we got a bit lost. Apartment was very cozy and comfortable for our quick overnight stay. Will definitely keep in mind for next trip too!"
1873046,75268376,2016-05-20,18876436,Bobby,The location was great. Being next to Boston Common and really in the center or close to the center of all of the activity was an awesome experience. It was really close to several T train lines and we put that to use when visiting further away locations in the city.
The amenities were up to my expectation and I believe Ahmed described them accurately. I didn't expect anything too fancy- just pretty much a place to sleep,cook (if needed) and relax after days of walking around. This place provided all of that and more.,,,,
The only negative was there were a group of homeless people that hung out near the entrance to the building that made a ton of noise throughout the day and night. Also beware that on Friday and Saturday evening,the road outside is a popular thoroughfare for taxis and others leaving the city after the bar so it can get super loud at those times.,,,,
"Overall though we had a great experience and would definitely rent again.\"",,,,,
1873046,85530904,2016-07-11,29301591,Eirini,"I stayed for 7 weeks. The apartment was really dirty when we got in, the floors were darkened with dirt and full of hairs. And there was a rotten pumpkin in the living room... The mattress smelled really bad the first night and in the morning we realized it was pissed on... Thankfully Ahmed replaced it in 4 days, until then we slept on the couch, which was comfortable. WARNING: It is impossible to sleep without earplugs on Friday and Saturday, and there is a homeless shelter across the street, so be prepared for people pissing on the front door and dealing drugs. Ahmed's associate Eddie was always helpful and responsive. The location is central and convenient but I would not stay there again."
1873046,86253833,2016-07-15,15384278,Lia,"Communication was difficult however he was accommodating to my changing needs. His assistants were very nice and helpful. The description was accurate and the location was very conveniently located. The only drawback is the homeless shelter across the street. This makes the street very loud and busy and as a woman I did not feel comfortable walking to and from the apartment especially early in the morning or at night. If you're a city girl and can handle yourself you'll be fine, it's just something you should be aware of."
1873046,87070492,2016-07-18,56341666,M Elliot,"Great location and a cozy place. It's right near the beginning of the freedom trail, and there's a few bars around the place (like Tam's) that are great late night places. So you'll be able to walk anywhere in downtown Boston easily. You'll probably be in communication with one of his associates (Eddie, Kevin, Eugene) and it may be a little confusing, but rest assured there is definitely someone there to check you in while you get there and they're completely accommodating for your time. The area can get somewhat loud outside at night so just be aware of that (it's a trade off for having so much to do at night). While we were there the air conditioning did not work. And it was upwards of low 90s (80s at night). So it was a really uncomfortable experience to sleep at night. But other than that it was a great place, just make sure if you're staying during the summer months that the air conditioning is working."
1873046,88251990,2016-07-23,26819603,Anna,"This place was perfect, well as perfect as can be for what I needed. The apartment was cute and very roomy, and conveniently located to nearly everything: shops, transit, restaurants, etc. While I did not meet with Ahmed, I did meet with his assistant Eddie who was able to provide feedback on where to go for fun and food."
"I would definitely come back!\"",,,,,
1873046,89877288,2016-07-30,14137586,Tanner,This place was really well located and with lots of space. It is only a minute walk to the nearest train station and Boston Common park.
The apartment was nice and comfortable,and although there are some comments about noise,"we did not find this to be a problem at all. \"",,,
3901439,21887459,2014-10-26,21463432,Eugene,Great place to rent. I stayed for almost a month. It was clean + safe and very close to center of town. Housekeeping/Maidservice included. Ari is an excellent host very thoughtful and welcoming.
3901439,22255190,2014-11-02,20053438,Jim,"Everything was as listed. Ari was perfectly helpful, informed and welcoming. he was patient and generous with all my questions at the onset and then we did not see each other again - which was fine.  It is a student Neighborhood and very safe and secure. Good location. Parking on the street a block away was not an issue for me.  Hallway could be a wee more tidy, but the bedroom and bathroom were very clean - which is what matters. A very decent functional place to crash during my conference."
3901439,22612715,2014-11-10,22932225,Diana,"The room was spacious, clean and neat.  The bathroom down the hall was neat as well.  It was conveniently located near plenty of shops, and restaurants and access to public transportation.  I never saw the host as he was out of town, and had arranged for a friend to be my host."
3901439,22819705,2014-11-15,4075109,Niels,"\"Laten we eerlijk zijn, dit is een studenten hok. Niets meer dan dat. De verhuurder beheert meerdere huizen die propvol kamers gebouwd zijn.  Totaal niet de gedachte achter airbnb. We hebben de man alleen per telefoon gesproken omdat wij naar het verkeerde adres waren gestuurd. Het huis voldoet, 2 badkamers voor 6 kamers met 2 gasten per kamer is wat \"\"krap\"\". Als je persoonlijk contact verwacht: niet doen. Als je gezellig wil zijn: niet doen. Als je vlak bij de tram naar de stad wil zitten in een kamer met een bed en verder geen frutsels:  aanrader. Schoon? nee. Vies? Ook niet. \""
3901439,22878873,2014-11-16,20773737,Pramod,Nice and clean space. I did not get to meet Ari but his friend took care of all the arrangements over the phone. I would  recommend his place for a comfortable stay in a nice neighborhood.
3901439,24902017,2015-01-03,22777068,Annie,I enjoyed my stay here. The room is clean and cozy. I will come back for Feb and April break when I get a chance.

3901439,27624031,2015-03-08,21295311,Steve,"The place is away from major streets, so traffic noise is kept to a minimum.  The room was warm, the bed comfortable.  This is a great place given that I didn't need much else.  Even though Ari was out of town, he left the contact information of someone that I could get in touch with if I needed anything, which I thought was great."
3901439,29231568,2015-04-05,6569510,Jean-Baptiste,"We were looking for a place to sleep in Boston and found Ari's room. We didnt't really expect to stay in a shared house and I have to say that we were at first a little bit disapointed by the situation. But, if you're looking for a bed in Boston, the room was clean, so were the kitchen and the bathroom. The other people were nice and the house is very close from public transportation and you can park your car for free on the corner. Overall, everything went well."
3901439,32153892,2015-05-14,32166656,Qian,"The place is very good. Big bed for one people. Room space is also big. Generally, BIG GOOD for this place."

Everything was more than expected; the house is big, very clean, quiet neighborhood and very private room with a street view. Ari is a great host, he made sure I have everything I needed to feel comfortable and welcome. He was very quick at responding to emails and follows up regularly. I would definitely recommend this place, and will surely come back there."

Getting access to your house was easy going. It's a pleasant, functional and clean room with a nice view. It seems a friendly, green, rather peaceful neighborhood, easy to find & close to the subway (max 10 min walk + the greenline B ). If I come again to Boston I would contact you to book again."

3901439,34180933,2015-06-05,17409256,Giulia,I stayed just for 1 night at Ari's house. I've found it very spacious and
in a good neighborhood. Ari was abroad,but he was easy to get in touch with and always very concerned with the confort of my staying. I've had just some difficulties finding the house,but I manages.,,,

3901439,34353790,2015-06-07,29902873,Josh,"Spot was in a quiet Neighbourhood, not to far from downtown and had some close food spots. Uber came thru big making it very easy. Spot was clean, had several other roommates or airbnb'so, but was cool. Very hospitable. Access to kitchen, and some shared food but I did not eat there or use the fridge. I would recommend this spot."
3901439,34829264,2015-06-12,15202875,Yuanzheng,"It was a nice experience in this private house. Pretty quiet place and not far away from the train station. The host was very nice. There were wash machine, kitchen, fridge and etc. that you can use. You are also provided shower tower."
3901439,35186973,2015-06-15,25326815,Jonathan,"Great place on a fairly quiet street in Allston. Although Ari himself was out of town, his friend graciously took over hosting duties, and was very kind and accommodating. We didn't spend much time at the home, but it was clean and very comfortable. We enjoyed the big old house itself, too. It was nice to be able to leave our car parked on the street there without worrying much about it. Definitely recommended!"
3901439,35336535,2015-06-17,34954662,Vixey,Ari was super great in making things as easy as it can be for the tenants and was very considerate in providing extra electronics like a mini fridge in the room. Enjoyed the stay very much.
3901439,35973712,2015-06-23,14041306,Courtney,"Ari was abroad during my stay, but left detailed instructions for check-in through the AirBnB app. The house has about 8 rooms, so there are guests in the home that you may not meet during your time there. This is mostly ok except that if there is a dispute or if something is awry, it is up to you to handle it with the other guest. Actual hosting is probably best when there are so many others under 1 roof. The house is beautiful, but could use some TLC to make it less cluttered. The bed was divine and the pillows so amazing. I also appreciate that Ari wanted constructive feedback so that he could address issues (or have someone else address them) while he is away. I appreciate his proactive approach and I think it will make him an even better host with each guest."
3901439,36071651,2015-06-24,6736860,Frauke,Ari's communication with us was great. He always texted back immediately and really seemed to care. The place was clean but due to a lack of decoration and the fact that nobody really lives in the room it did not feel homie.
3901439,36160296,2015-06-25,36514006,Francesco,"Ari is a perfect host.he was out for work when I get his room but he gave me all the info that I need for using the apartment and the (URL HIDDEN) was like the description,the room was clean and comfortable and I found everything I need."
3901439,42977456,2015-08-16,2078171,George,I stayed for 2 nights Fri to Sun. The host is very responsive and gave clear info on access and a local contact since he was abroad. This is a college neighborhood with people partying on Fri/Sat night. It created no issues for me other than it was hard to find parking at midnight :). The room is on the second floor that has 4 rooms rented out sharing one bathroom. You get a code to the front door and the key is in the room lock. This makes it easy getting keys but also makes it possible for someone accessing your room before you arrive. I guess this is what happened in my case. I picked up my key ~10 pm and then returned at midnight. The room had issues that I didn't notice until I uncovered the bed. It was resolved by Ari's helper pretty fast. The room was clean otherwise. So was the bathroom. The room had a mini fridge. Air conditioning was listed for my room (room h) but was missing. It would have been really useful on that hot weekend. There is no a/c in the hallway and the bathroom. There is a ceiling fan in the room. The window blinds were broken so I used a sheet instead. This is a nice and green neighborhood. The house is on a hill and is tucked away from the street. I slept with the window open :).  Bath towel is provided and there are plenty of shampoos and soaps in the shower. The owner was very sympathetic and surprised about the issues and agreed to a partial refund. This added a star to my review.
3901439,43204745,2015-08-17,14172278,Baron,"This was real nice place. The host was gentle, the place was easy to find, and the bed was really cozy enough. I would like to stay other night if i have to time to stay in Boston."
3901439,45858407,2015-09-06,22937667,Lauren,"Ari was very accommodating in letting my boyfriend and I arrive to the house early. The room was extremely clean, bed was extremely comfortable, air conditioning was great. I also liked that you had your own lock and key to your own room, because there are many rooms in the house and it was reassuring knowing that our belongings were safe while we were out of the house."
Also,"the house was very close to the T stop so it was convenient to get to even with our luggage. I would definitely stay here again!\"",,,,
3901439,51174494,2015-10-18,23832101,Yu,"The whole experience of staying in Ari's house was great. I didn't meet Ari in person but I could get all the necessary information from him beforehand. There were quite a few people staying in the same building but they were really friendly and nice. And Cindy was super helpful, as well as the cleaning service lady. They made sure our floor was clean and tidy all the time."
And the room was exactly the same as the photo,nice and tidy. The bed was very comfortable and the other exciting thing was that I had my own fridge in my room.,,,,

Ari was really responsive and assisted  me and my girlfriend with our check-in. The house has an automatic-lock door. You have your own room in a big house with access to a full kitchen. You will most likely meet other guests who stay there. The house has a warm and fuzzy feeling to it. I don't see any cons if you decide to stay here."

3901439,65208874,2016-03-11,61606767,Aharon,I loved my stay at Aris he is the best host!  His place is so nice and clean.  I would recomend anyone to stay with Ari you will love it:-)
3901439,65286295,2016-03-12,61792103,Marc,"Ari was a good host, responds quickly and very accommodating to my requests. The location is close to restaurants and convenience store in the area. I'd recommend this place if you're staying in Allston."
3901439,65424952,2016-03-13,30824856,Esther,"I have stayed at a number of airbnb rooms in Boston and Ari is my favorite airbnb host. The rooms are always beautiful and sparkling clean, and this one has a lovely stained glass window and a mini fridge. Also, the location can't be beat!"
3901439,65516015,2016-03-15,61606767,Aharon,I travel a ton and once i meet Ari everything for me became much easier. He has a ton of listings and always sees to have availability for me in one of his rooms. Ari is always available to help whenever i have a question he answered messages superfast it almost seems like there are two of him:-)
3901439,65516630,2016-03-15,49644623,Chelsey,"The time of check-in and check-out were quite flexible, while the host didn't physically present the whole time (abroad and such), sent instructions through airbnb, and left the keys on the door. There's something up with the blinds in the room and I had to bend it by hand to prevent people outside see through the window. FYI for drivers: It's not easy to find a public parking spot in the neighborhood so just in case you're going to be driving in Boston."
3901439,66074657,2016-03-19,58730170,Christoph,"Ari was an amazing host. He provided us with a clean and wonderful room in Boston. If we had a question about what to see or where to go out, he answered right away. There was enough parking space outside of the house and the neighborhood was very quiet at night. I will definitely recommend Ari to the next person who is going to ask me where to stay in Boston."
3901439,66541461,2016-03-23,40611612,Nicolás,"Perfect, any inconvenience, Ary's house is  very quiet and good place for spend time in Boston, roomy and warm. My parents felt all the time comfortable and perfect instructions to arrive there."

Much appreciate easy check-in as the lock has a code and I can arrive on my timeline. If you're driving, there is parking just a few minutes walk away. The space is clean, the internet is good, and this is a convenient place to crash if you need to be in the area."

3901439,67974309,2016-04-01,39441871,Doron,"The place is great and gives you everything you need on a one night stay:  clean, coze room and privacy.  Highly recommended.  I keep on coming back and each time it's a great experience without fail."
3901439,68275285,2016-04-03,12589923,Sophia,"Ari responded to my request immediately, and gave me all the information I needed right away. I ended up changing my plans at the last minute and not staying with him, but I really appreciated his responsiveness and graciousness and will definitely come to him if I need a place to stay in the future."
3901439,68560833,2016-04-05,17597012,Vidyut,"The place was lovely. Located in a quiet neighbourhood. I liked the room. It was spacious. Also liked the closeness to Cambridge. Ari has designed things so smoothly that even though he might not be there, the guest has no issues. Ari was always available to respond to my queries. Would recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston"
3901439,70988847,2016-04-22,53455261,Kristen,I was in Boston for three weeks and Ari's place was the perfect place to stay.  It was close to bars/restaurants/transit stops but still in a quiet neighborhood.  The room was as described (there is also a big closet in the room that isn't pictured) and the house was clean and well-kept.  I'd been nervous about staying in a house with other Airbnb guests (I'm a very light sleeper and go to bed fairly early) but everyone I interacted with was wonderful.  Most of the people were also staying in Boston for several weeks and I really enjoyed getting to know them.
I never met Ari (he was abroad) but he checked in on me throughout the trip and was very responsive to my requests (I asked for a full length mirror,and there was one in my room an hour later).  The blinds broke while I was there and he did everything he could to get them fixed,"and actually refunded me for the days where they were broken.  I will definitely look into staying here on my future trips to Boston.\"",,,
3901439,72208803,2016-05-01,50134153,Ryan,"Ari was a great host. He made sure you were comfortable and knew he was always available if you needed help with anything. The place was clean, just as the pictures showed it. Would recommend to other people."

"I had a really good time. Also Cindy the other host is also very helpful and she even brings us milk and some food for all. This is a nice place for a chill vacation.\"",,,,,
3901439,83258249,2016-07-02,19799919,Mollie,"I had an awesome experience with Ari, everything went smoothly with check in and check out! And my stay at his house was perfect for moving back into Boston!"
3901439,83836107,2016-07-04,9462471,Amit,"Not sure where the other reviewers stayed but I won't recommend this place simply because it's grossly overpriced. We paid $100 for one night. There was one bathroom for 4 rooms each of which can have 2 people. So any visit to the bathroom had to be timed to perfection. No water in the water dispenser. And if you returned late at night finding a parking spot was a hassle. On the plus side the rooms were clean with clean bedsheets and clean towels. It could, however, do with a bit of lighting in the alley."
3901439,84781353,2016-07-09,33662460,Chris,"This was my third stay at Ari's place.   I can count on his rooms to be stocked with towels, clean and ready for me.   Ari was in communication at all steps of the check-in process."
3901439,88232998,2016-07-23,18169449,Cui,"It's a very convenient location, and Ari provided very clear message for my check-in. Also he gave great support when I need to extend my stay. I recommend his place for traveling in Boston."
14137262,89775138,2016-07-30,85574592,Chaofan,It was a great experience. The room is clean and cozy. There were drinks and food in the kitchen. It feels like at home.
The place is close to the heath street subway station (4-min walking distance),"which is the terminal station of green line E. So it is highly recommended for tourists since the old green line goes through many wonderful places such as museum of fine arts and Isabella Stewart Gardener museum \"",,,,

14137262,93948464,2016-08-14,10442146,Christian,"I had a very nice stay. The place was clean and Zoe was very quick to respond to any questions. If there is anything you need, just let her know and she will get right back to you. There was an AC unit in the bedroom window which proved to be invaluable as the heat outside was brutal. The condo is very close to the green line and about a 10-15 minute walk to the orange line. Though the walk to the orange line is a bit sketchy at night, the general area felt safe. There are snacks and drinks provided, as well as towels and toiletries. The only downside I had was that my bedroom didn't have a key to lock the door, while the other room did. It didn't turn out to be an issue, but in a situation where you are sharing living space with someone you don't know, it would be nice for the peace of mind."
14137262,95499854,2016-08-20,89439763,Omar,The place was nice and clean.
14137262,96601618,2016-08-23,29551770,Ralf,The house is clean and easy to check in and check out. It is located in q quiet neighborhood and you can find the parking lot easily. I highly recommend here to anyone who want to find a stay in Boston.

12191871,94903452,2016-08-17,39369206,Euan,"Absolutely loved our stay in Josh's apartment in a lovely area of Boston. Franklin park offers a lovely place to run in the morning and the bakeries down in Jamaica plains (10 min walk) providde a lovely place to grab breakfast. Whole foods is a 5 min drive away (15/20 minute walk) and Boston common is 12 minutes drive away. Apartment was loaded with everything we needed to stay for 6 days and Josh and his family are hugely helpful if you need them and also very discreet in allowing you privacy for your stay. Would recommend this place to anyone that wants to explore Boston and be close enough, yet far enough to relax while seeing the sights."
12191871,96669684,2016-08-23,41042515,Adrian,"This home is basically in new condition, well maintained, and within 10 minutes walk of the T (orange line, much better than staying near sloooow green line).  Cable, fast wifi, easy control over AC window units to control comfort.  Very nice place, would definitely recommend."

The basement apartment we stayed in was beautiful and close to a park where we could run and walk our dog- we loved that we were able to bring her along, as this is a pet friendly place. Josh and his family were extremely friendly when we ran into them outside and made sure everything was up to par and we didn't need anything for our stay. They also recommended great spots to eat!"
12191871,98711359,2016-09-01,3890919,Phyllis,"Josh welcomed us with a nice note and a bottle of wine.  The house and grounds are gorgeous, having just been remodeled.  The location was perfect...within walking distance of the T, coffee shops, the zoo and the park.  The downstairs apartment is very nice, easy to access and the washer/dryer were an added bonus.  We've stayed in many Airbnb's and this is by far the best one! Josh has done a great job in communicating and making everything comfortable for a nice mini vacation. We hope to be back!"
12191871,98736771,2016-09-01,66777789,Kaitlyn,"I stayed here with my family and the place is beautiful, very clean and in a nice neighborhood. There was plenty of parking available close by. We never me the hosts but everything was nicely set up and easy to understand and use."
12833084,77110357,2016-05-30,71188214,Dongfan,the host left a very detailed instruction which make me easily to use their home. the most special thing for this airbnb is that the host permit us to use every facilities and even all of their daily food.
12833084,80648191,2016-06-19,8757482,Lia,"Great place, very kind hosts, great location, friendly neighbors, close to public transportation and commerce. Would definitely stay again and recommend to others!"

My fiance and I had Red Sox tickets, Fenway is a 15-20 min walk but it is a pretty walk through the park. We would definitely stay there again."
13521713,88626044,2016-07-25,8086912,Karen,"This is a great place if you need to be near one of the hospitals--it's about a 5 minute walk from Brigham and Women's and Dana Farber.  The apartment is large and spacious, and Ricardo was easy to get in touch with."

The location is good for most downtown attractions.  The parking lot on the corner is bizarre.  The price varies depending on the attendants behavior.  The coffee shop just down the street is great.  The train is literally out he front door.  The neighborhood was safe, bustling with med students."

7007801,46220615,2015-09-08,30667017,Lee,Apartment was as described and very simple in a convenient location.
7007801,47317588,2015-09-17,35992805,Quei,"My entire experience involving Alex was very unpleasant. From reserving the Apt to writing this review. When I first contacted Alex to make a reservation he told me he didn't know if he could make the apartment available for myself on the days I requested. Mind you he had these dates set to available on his Air BnB calendar. He accepted the reservation last minute and told me check in was at 3pm. When I arrived in Boston Alex told me over the phone that I could not checkin until 8pm because he hadn't prepared the apartment for my arrival. Already I'm beginning to see how dis organized he is. Once I arrive at the apartment everything looks great until I enter the bathroom. The bathroom toilet was beyond filth, the shower obviously hadn't been cleaned. there was hair in the tub and used razors laying out. The bedroom looked cleaned but on further inspection (once I looked under the bed and in the closet) it became clear it was just a result of lazy disorganized cleaning. There where dirty clothes and used condoms under the bed and all sorts of miscellaneous items alike where shoved in the closet. The bed was hard as rock. Literally it was all metal springs, it was so uncomfortable I had no choice but to sleep on his couch. The kitchen also looked clean but in true Alex's disorganized style once I opened the fridgorator all I saw was spoiled food and God knows what else. When I contacted Alex to explain my concerns and asked him to help rectify the situation he met me with very rude remarks and basically told me that my request where invalid. Alex is truly a terrible host. He should not even be allowed to use Air BnB. Learn from this review and save yourself time and money."
7007801,47834375,2015-09-21,20625133,Yiwen,"room is clean and good for short trip, had everything needed for a night or two.   the location of the apartment is rather nice if you'd like to enjoy a walk along the river or on the street.  however it's a bit walk from public transportation.   the bedroom is facing a very busy street and with the window unit stuck there, can't even close the window to shut the noise."

7007801,77340857,2016-05-31,14036844,Alison,The location for the apartment was great and as per previous reviews it was sparsely decorated and very clean. In all honesty there were some negatives. The bed was very uncomfortable (springs) and the windows couldn't be opened (Alex told us opening the windows would trigger an alarm and it was VERY hot --there was an air purifier but no fan). I'd say this apartment could be greatly improved with a new mattress and a fan ... Good location though!

He was also responsive with any questions I had. The apartment is well located and in a nice building and the bed was comfortable..........However the apartment, apart from immediately visible areas, was filthy, window ledges, skirting, behind and side of bed, sofa, kitchen floor, fridge. It was also VERY noisy being 1 floor up from Mass Ave. Towel rail was broken, sink was blocked, holes in ceiling and missing light bulbs and a couple of bowls for plates didn't enhance my stay. May be ok for a night but NOT for my 2+ weeks. Shame because with some care could be a nice apartment."

The hosts left a very nice and personalized hand written letter with their contact info and clear expectations. The home was very cozy and was located in a very nice part of town that we probably would have never been able to experience otherwise. $7-8 uber rides to Fenway were nice. After midnight, the whole neighborhood goes totally silent (on both Friday and Saturday night), it's magical.. Reminded me of my stay in Paris and having a similar experience. Wonderful place.. Would love to return!"

13266176,92209126,2016-08-08,73097347,Huaizhi,"Fantasitic experience in Boston, I was there for a meeting. Susan's great hospitality helped me a lot, on the first night, I used her TV to watch the Olympic opening ceremony, fabulous living condition, will stay there again."
13266176,92505589,2016-08-08,84908003,Hanah,"Susan has been a fantastic host to me & my partner. The booking to departure was seamless. Her place is extra clean, you wouldn't find a speck of dust! The neighborhood is safe and the T is only walking distance from her house. Very hospitable folks, I recommend this place to others. :-)"

13266176,98636501,2016-09-01,89743663,Ardavan,"From the moment I got to Susan's house, she was accommodating and made sure I was taken care of at all times.  Tucked away in a quiet area of Bostononian, suburban life, her house provided a nice respite from the bustling energy of Boston, and it was pleasant.  The amenities were great, the bedrooms were clean, fully air-conditioned as well.  Additionally, the beds were comfortable, making it a great night's sleep.  Overall, I would say I got good value on the price I paid for room and would recommend it to any of my friends who want to visit the Boston area."

1141522,4643315,2013-05-17,4418691,Kevin,It's great stay here! Spacious kitchen and living room. All have private rooms in the second floor. great location. I'll definitely come back again if I visit Boston.
1141522,4884025,2013-05-30,549659,Randy And Marilyn,The location was great! It took us 10 minutes to walk to the subway and we felt safe in the neighborhood at night which was a concern for us. We fly standby and arrived last minute. We appreciated the quick reply we received by Islam so we knew we had a place to stay. Boston is expensive! It's fit our budget. Would stay here again. Thank you fritz for everything.
1141522,4989063,2013-06-05,5028819,Harshad,Our room was fine for the asking price. The room hadn't been cleaned when we arrived on account of a previous guest leaving late but was cleaned shortly after we did.
Our two issues were firstly the locality which felt less than safe and was quite dirty- the walk to / from the T is not exactly welcoming and secondly the fact that there were several other guests in 3 other rooms and us all sharing a single bathroom / toilet that you need to walk down a flight of stairs to get to.,,,,,
Also,our room was air conditioned and was pretty comfortable but several of the other guests had a rough time on a account of the heat and lack of cooling of any sort in their rooms.,,,,
Good enough for the price but less than perfect.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1141522,5151761,2013-06-15,2910178,Yi Tian,"The overall experience was good! The house is just 6 to 7 minutes walk to blue line subway. The room is really cozy and comfortable. During my visit, even though Islam was not there, but the instruction details given by him in the reservation confirmation is sufficient enough for us to check in. On the last day, Islam's brother is kind and give us a ride to bus terminal as we were carrying two check in luggage and it will be difficult for us to take them to ride on the subway. I certainly feel this stay is worth the price."
1141522,5212478,2013-06-18,6381329,Isabel,"I really appreciated staying at Islams place. It was clean, the neighbourhood was save and the appartment is located close to downtown. Furthermore, his brother, who also stayed at the house during my visit, took care of me by giving me a ride to different sight seeing places and helped me out if I had any questions or needed some help. It was a lot of fun! So I definitely recommend to anybody, who is planning a trip, to stay at Islams house and have an enjoyable time!"
1141522,5465711,2013-07-01,6816144,Pam,"Location was really good - about a 7 minute walk to the subway station and public transit in Boston is amazing and easy to figure out.  Really easy to get everywhere - downtown, Cambridge, North End, etc.  From the airport, a free bus will take you the subway station that is closest to the house."
"The room we stayed in was clean and comfortable.  The bathroom was fine but sometimes it was difficult sharing with all of the other guests (there are 4 other rooms in this house).\"",,,,,
1141522,5551190,2013-07-05,7170263,Carly,Less of a bed and breakfast and more of a stay out all day and come back to crash-kind of place. 5 min walk from the subway.
Pros: Hosts were accommodating and nice,,,,,
Cons: The comforter had yellow stains on it,hosts played music loudly during the day,,,,

1141522,5629643,2013-07-08,7287124,Reg,"Islam's place was clean and comfortable.  My girlfriend and I used it as a homebase as we explored the rest of Boston.  We, even though a stop was very near by, did not use the T and because of that had trouble getting into the city and back out to the apartment as the roads in Boston stink and show their cow-path history well.  Islam was a great host and gave us the low down on his neighborhood in addition to providing us with whatever we needed.  Definitely a great stay!"
1141522,5702913,2013-07-12,7228295,Gerardo,"My sister and I were in Boston to look at apartments.  Islam's place was economical, comfortable, and convenient.  We had a car so we drove into the city every day so we had to pay the $3.50 toll to use the tunnels although I'm sure there are ways to get into town that don't require the toll... Finding parking in the neighborhood could sometimes be a challenge since we always got back from town late at night.  Also, be aware of the signs specifying street cleaning days, on some streets each side of the street is cleaned on a different day."
The house was clean and organized,and although we never ran into Islam he was available by phone to help out with any doubts we had.  There are two other guestrooms in the house and only one bathroom so it can get a bit busy in the mornings...,,,,
"Overall it is an excellent place and I would definitely stay there again.\"",,,,,
1141522,5924932,2013-07-22,7149488,Jakob,"Positive things: it is close to the subway, there are good restaurants nearby, as well as a supermarket. In the house, everything you need is there: a good kitchen, Ac in the rooms etc."
Negative things: the room had only one very small window,so it felt kind of claustrofobic. The door was also very thin,so you could hear all the other guests in the house very readily. I however slept very well and enjoyed my stay in Boston,"so I can absoutely recommend this place. \"",,
1141522,6155493,2013-08-01,7164802,Emilie,Séjour très agréable chez Islam. Le centre-ville est très proche en métro et Boston est une ville très agréable.

1141522,6371717,2013-08-10,7399212,Florian,The Room and the Bath were clean and tidy. The bed was very comfortable.
The neighborhood is quiet,some shops are reachable within a few minutes.,,,,
The connection to Downtown Boston and most of the sights is nearly unbeatable,it's a 5 minute walk to the Airport station and then a 5-7 minute ride.,,,,

1141522,6738650,2013-08-23,7745030,Mae,My boyfriend and I loved our stay at Islam's place.
PROS:,,,,,
-It is extremely close to the Airport stop on the Blue Line,,,,,
-It is super easy to find Islam's place walking to and from the station,,,,,
-Our room was exactly as shown in the photos (clean,great decor,AC unit,nice bed,lava lamp) and on the counter was bottles of water,maps
-Big & fully stocked kitchen and nice downstairs lounge. We never made use of these things,but others would probably enjoy it,,,,
-Great privacy,,,,,
-Nice park (Bremen Park) closeby with fountains,grassy area,picnic tables,etc.,,
-Didn't get to meet Islam,but his brother was there and very welcoming. Also,Islam was very prompt to respond via text when I had a question.,,,
CONS:,,,,,
-The immediate neighborhood is not very interesting or clean,,,,,
-Walls are very thin,other houseguests can be quite loud with videogaming,etc,,,
-Only one bathroom for the house,but luckily this never posed as an issue. Only once did we have to wait about 5-10 mins for use,,,,
--,,,,,
All in all we loved our stay! Thanks so much Islam!,,,,,

The apartment is very conveniently located, close to the T and the airport shuttle. Our room was very clean and comfortable and great value for money. Islam is a very friendly guy and helpful to give tips about the area. We had a great stay!"
1141522,6833270,2013-08-26,8085654,Matthew,"My wife and I stayed here for one night. Islam is a very nice guy,  we actually got a little lost on our way and the host came to pick us from where we were. He is very welcoming and accommodating. Clean room. Close to subway. Great price. Safe area."
1141522,7073428,2013-09-05,8091718,Alexandra,"Islam is very friendly and helpful, he always replies quickly. We had a good time there. Thanx!"
1141522,9216498,2013-12-14,10177440,Robert,"Sorry to say, Izzy's standards for providing accommodations are very low.  I was greeted upon my arrival by a broken screen door. I couldn't access the lock box arrival because the porch light was out. Fortunately, a fellow occupant, let me in. She complained, rightly, that the place was dirty. She had spent hours cleaning it. There were two mousetraps in the kitchen. The bathroom light worked intermittently. No bars of soap were provided. Spoiled food was in the refrigerator. No fire extinguisher or sprinklers were in evidence. There were no fire escapes. The dense, uncut brush in the front yard is a breeding ground for rats. The front steps leading to a low iron gate are so steep that if one slipped one could be impaled on the gate. Need I go on? Stay here at your peril."
1141522,11068076,2014-03-18,12930903,Benjamin,"A bit late but Izzy's place is really convenient. Indeed, the location is perfect. You're exactly five minutes away from downtown Boston and the neighborhood is really nice. You can find good places to eat, and not really expensive late at night."
Anyway,the room was really nice and perfect for two students. We stayed over for three days,and the whole house was clean as the bathroom and the kitchen. Izzy is a nice person and arranged us when we arrived early in the morning the first day.,,,
Perfect trip,perfect stay,"",,,
"Thanks Izzy !\"",,,,,
1141522,11164518,2014-03-23,1360066,Joe,The room is in an interesting neighborhood and is convenient to the airport. Good place if you're just looking for a very basic room.
1141522,12447066,2014-05-02,2624728,Andrew,When arriving at a bus from airport - go through a T station to get on Bremen street.
Instant reservation,we followed instructions provided within reservation confirmation email (be careful - it is so easy to miss them!) and got inside the house. But then we found that our room is locked and there is nobody in a home. So we took towels downstairs by ourself,had shower and cooked some food before someone had arrived and opened our room. Bed was very comfortable but walls are really thin - we heard someone snoring in next room at night.,,,
Izzy was kind enough to let us stay at home until 5PM next day waiting for our flight.,,,,,
In general very nice option for layover between flights. Not so good neighborhood,"not so clean inside the house but really close to airport and pretty comfortable as for a private room.\"",,,,
1141522,12846801,2014-05-12,2192405,Hyewon,"Izzy was very kind and his roommate also helped me everything. The place was very close to the airport, this is definitely good for short term travelers. However, the room and apartment itself was not so clean, dusty. I stayed in Room C."
The sleeper he provided was smelly,I recommend to bring your own sleeper(luckily I had one). But Bathroom was clean,and sharing was no problem.,,,
Also,it was very thin wall,and I could hear people outside or ringtone from the next room. (Also,this wasn't a safe area) I had to go back and forth to the airport,so it was good that I could walk to the airport station and took the free shuttle. To go to downtown,blue line comes very often and easily transferable to orange
1141522,13087578,2014-05-19,14159865,Esteban,Really close to the airport and the blue line (less than 10 min walk). The house was 4 rooms and one bathroom. Neighborhood looks tolerable no the best in Boston (but remember how much you are paying to stay there)
The house was clean and smells good. I didn’t meet Izzy in person he was out of town but he did everything he could to make us fell comfortable.  I recommend the place if you ready for an adventure and meet Boston with some friends.,,,,,

1141522,13191624,2014-05-21,12196095,Louise,"This was a good basic place to stay while visiting Boston. It turned out to be a good place, me and my sister were a bit discouraged with a bad start. Our major problem was that when we got to the house (and entered using a code) our room was not ready and there was no key for us. When contacting izzy we didn't get a reply until more than 90 min later. I totally understand things can happen when providing this service and many circumstances can result in this but what I would have appreciated would have been if this was communicated to us so that we wouldn't have worried about not having a key and not being able to use our room. After getting access later in the evening, the stay was good with clean spaces and easy access to transportation. I think we had bad luck, so I would recommend this for a few days stay."
1141522,13425203,2014-05-27,12194125,Katy,Very nice apartment. Was clean and the host was welcoming. A bit difficult to get a hold of but apart from that we had a great stay. Thanks!

However the hose smelt a bit odd and the neighboor was very dirty, trash on the ground etc. The location in relationship to the beach, airport and downtown is great.

1141522,16109576,2014-07-22,13350981,Kristin,"Kommunikation und Check-In verliefen ohne Probleme. Im Haus gibt es wohl drei Räume, die immer vermietet werden. Alles andere wird geteilt. Die Räume haben eine gute Größe und sind ausreichend eingerichtet. Nur fanden wir alles nicht sauber vor. Unter unserem Bett war es dreckig, das Fenster geht nicht zu öffnen, wodurch trotz Klimaanlage eine schlechte Luft entsteht. Die zu teilenden Räume waren unordentlich und unsauber. Auch andere Urlauber empfanden das so. Eine Reinigungspauschale ist hier nicht angebracht. Zur U-Bahn sind es ca. 8 bis 10 Minuten zu laufen und dann bis downtown reichlich 5 Minuten Fahrt. Insofern ist die Überschrift nicht richtig."
Wir können die Unterkunft bedingt weiter empfehlen.,,,,,
Communication and check-in went without problems. In the house,there are probably three rooms that are always rented. Everything else is shared. The rooms have a good size and all the things you need. But not everything was clean. Under our bed it was dirty. There is an air condition,but you can not open the window,so the air is getting sticky.,,
The shared rooms were untidy and unclean. Other travelers felt the same way. A cleaning fee is not appropriate here. The subway is about 8 to 10 minutes to walk and then it takes about 5-7 minutes to downtown. In this respect,the headline is not right.,,,,

The room and house is not super clean but convenient to stay for one night. The host didnt show up by himself but cared about the guests. Generally it was okay for its price.

1141522,16487363,2014-07-28,5642409,Christine,"This place is great for a last minute booking for low budget. Not a lot of contact with the host, people can let themselves in after receiving the instructions, find their bedroom and that’s it. It’s more a self-check-in hostel than a typical airbnb home. Unfortunately we didn’t know we had to print all the information in the confirmation email and had no internet access in the US. That said we had no access to all those details, plus Izzy’s wifi was broke, so even when we arrived we were a little lost. The room and the house were great. Clean, big and comfortable. I also liked the fact that we met other people, not so much sharing the bathroom with up to 5 other guest though… Also it's confusing that the listing says 5 minutes to downtown but actually means to the subway station."

We could enter because an other guest opened the door. 3: The room was small but neat and clean and it has an airco which was necessary. The thing was pretty loud. There were some brochures from 2013 and receipts in the drawers unfortunately 4: Due to reorganising, the basement was a bit of a mess (which was not a big problem) 5: We shared the house with at least four other guests. 6: Shower and toilet were clean! 7: Lots of kitchen tools! 8: Free use of the washing machine, super! 9: Wifi did not work... 10: Location was fine, both for free parking and access to the centre of Boston, use the T, station 'airport'."

His ad says downtown Boston,"when really it was a bit out. 5-6 min walk to the subway and few stops with one change over and you're in downtown crossing. My only negative aspect to our stay was the fact there was only one bathroom (downstairs) which was shared among 3 other rooms. During the night I found it annoying having to go downstairs to use the toilet. This was our only issue. Everything else was perfect. \"",,,,
1141522,17576259,2014-08-14,18228999,Shilin,Nice and quiet neighborhood. 7 mins walk to the Airport Station. Nice and well equipped apartment. Will definitely stay at Izzy's if I revisit Boston. Thanks for hosting us!
1141522,17645019,2014-08-15,5148159,Marisa,"The place looked as expected from the photos. The bed was very comfortable. We arrived quite late so we never actually met Izzy (but met his brother), and had no trouble getting in or accessing the keys. Everything was ready for us and clean. It was a short taxi ride from the airport ($10). We would have taken the T but it was too late at night. Nice quiet neighborhood, with restaurants near by, and a 24-hour CVS down the street. Would definitely recommend staying here if you need a place close to Logan! Just be careful in this room if you're tall - there's a sloped ceiling!"
1141522,18881340,2014-09-02,17374149,Laura,"Izzy was a great host, in fact more than just great... He was warm and kind and helped us with advice on restaurants, public transportation, car rental and anything in between."
Also,the room was perfect - good airconditioning,big bed and totally clean. Even though we had an extreme amount of luggage (because we were about to move to Boston permanently) the room could fit it all - the two of us included.,,,
Book this room if you want to be sure that you have friendly host and a clean,comfortable room close to the subway.,,,,
"I give Izzy my best recommendations!\"",,,,,
1141522,19140620,2014-09-07,2749245,Oskar,"The room was just like in the picture, very clean with fresh sheets and towels. The airconditioning unit was brand new and working very well. Moreover, the shares spaces and the kitchen have a small breakfast buffet which was a great addition and a kind surprise. The location is very convenient, close to the subway and the airport and the host was very welcoming. All in all it was the best experiance with airbnb I've had so far!"
1141522,19412714,2014-09-12,18387745,Mathieu,"We had a very pleasant stay at Izzy's place. He wasn't here but Orkhan, his brother, took care of everything. He answered all our questions and provided us tons if info. He surely is a very nice host."
The place is very well located and you can reach the center of Boston in 15 minutes max. It is also very quiet and clean.,,,,,
If we had to find one thing to criticize,it would be the lack of a second bathroom to prevent waiting too much when everyone needs it. But hey,that's not a big deal at all ;),,,
"Thanks again for everything Orkhan. I would definitely come back to your place if I had the chance!\"",,,,,
1141522,19539496,2014-09-14,1178507,Stacie,"My host Ofar (sorry if that's spelt incorrectly) was lovely - he was there to great me when I arrived and offered to help me with my bags! The room is a nice size, clean and comes with lovely amenities (hair-dryer, air-con, nice lights). The house is very close to the T so it's easy to get into town. I would definitely stay there again. Thanks!"
1141522,19688483,2014-09-16,20104957,Nora,"We had a great Time in Boston! We really enjoyed our stay at Izzys Place. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. There is only one bathroom in the house, but some how the bath wasnt usually blocked. We never had to wait long."
You only Need About 5 Minutes to the t-station and only 3 Station to downtown,"which was very nice. We can recommend izzys Place - thank for everything. Nora & Hannah \"",,,,
1141522,19739581,2014-09-17,20290238,Kristiyan,We found the house really easy! Everything was like in the descripton.

The location was excellent.....just a few minutes' walk from the T station, and really easy to get to from the airport via airport shuttle / walking. We arrived at the Boston early, well before check-in time, but were able to leave our luggage at the house and spent the day seeing the sights in Boston.  The home was clean, and the room was very comfortable.  We enjoyed meeting the other AirBNB'ers who were staying there as well."

Check-In was easy and flexible,all communication was friendly and easy-going.,,,,

1141522,20430789,2014-09-29,20333061,Alex&Angelina,"This was our first Airbnb experience and everything went according to the description and instructions. The neighborhood is very conveniently located right next to Boston Logan, and the train ride is 5-6 mins. to Aquarium or State Street T stops. We have already recommended it to friends."
1141522,20599445,2014-10-02,6948377,Luciano,Place is close to subway. Easy acess to downtown.
1141522,20913487,2014-10-07,21101685,Heidi,"Easy and good location to the airport as well as with the Metro to the Center. Clean and small room upstairs, window cannot be opened. Bathroom shared with other 3 rooms. Kitchen with free coffee and tea at your disposal. Good and practial solution."
1141522,20981791,2014-10-08,2826174,Dennis,"What a find !! Easy to find - thanks to good directions - and is just a short walk up Brooks Street from the T-Station (location was excellent for one night stay between flights in and out of Logan Airport). The property is easy to access by one self with coded secure entrance, once inside you note the common areas are tidy and clean. My room was upstairs (as are the other two that are let) - linen clean, fresh and towels are supplied. Clean shared bathroom with shower over tub is on entrance level, along with excellent appointed kitchen. Close by are a couple of outstanding cafe´s, highly recommend Angela´s Cafe for authentic mexician food and a great cafe con leche. Staying at this property you meet a wonderful host, Izzy who is a very personable and helpful host. Enjoyed an interesting chat and I look forward to continuing the talk next time I stay. If you are looking for a clean tidy accommodation, close to Logan airport that is good value then book with Izzy... his home felt like my home."
1141522,21387424,2014-10-16,5440151,Wanderlust,This is a pretty bare bones efficiency place.
1141522,21735070,2014-10-22,22777201,Jonathan,This place worked out really well for my situation I was stuck in Boston Airport missing my connecting flight I was preparing to sleep in the airport when I found his listing ironically it was one block away from a restaurant  I had taken a cab to from the airport terminal the cab ride was $15 I walk two blocks to the listing after finding it. In the morning it was a half mile walk through the park to the bus station to get back to the airport the bus was free total walk time about 30 minutes from his address to terminal the room was clean the bathroom was clean everything was set up exactly the way it is described in this post other than the bathroom I didn't use any of the other amenities I would use this place again if a similar situation were to occur
1141522,21788470,2014-10-24,21407937,Jenna,The room was great.  I had instructions on how to get in and there was someone to welcome me.
1141522,22031085,2014-10-28,2688826,Mingzhi,"Like the others, I didn't actually meet Izzy, but it's a good stay. The house is clean and organized, just follow the instruction. I like the room have everything I need: wardrobe, hairdryer, desk and chair (if you have bnb experience, you would know it's not common but great)... Also the house is close to blue line airport station, so it's easy to access downtown or airport. I think Izzy's place is a good choice for short stay in Boston, especially for someone have a late(or early) flight like me."
像大多数人一样,我并没有见到Izzy本人,但住宿体验不错,可以说是波士顿的经济之选。这是一栋四卧一卫的房子,我不确定住满时会怎样(我入住时好像是三间满),反正我只短暂等过一次
1141522,22113813,2014-10-30,11560881,Geronimo,"Die Unterkunft liegt sehr praktisch am Ende des Flughafen Shuttle Busses und an der blauen Linie der Ubahn von Boston. Man ist also in wenigen Minuten an beiden Locations. Die Gegend ist aber nicht grade die Beste in Boston. Dafür zahlt man dann auch nur ein Drittel der ortsüblichen Hotelpreise. Das Bett ist super, das Bad teilt man sich genau wie das Wohn-Ess Zimmer und die Küche. Leider ust das Bad und die ganze Wohnung etwas schmuddelig. Das Zimmer ist allerdings voll ok."
1141522,22211891,2014-11-01,19328400,Sasha,Awesome accomodation! A+
1141522,22256062,2014-11-02,22451077,Kayla,"We loved our stay here! The room, bathroom, and kitchen were all very clean. The host was friendly despite our late arrival. The neighborhood seemed safe and clean. We found close parking when we checked in and for our overnight stay. Our only complaint was the rattling door to our room which we easily fixed by placing a suit case or duffle bag up against the door. Overall, our stay was a great experience and I would recommend this home to anyone."
1141522,22403472,2014-11-05,22158348,Tyler,The host was great and very inviting. Gave us great tips on where the best spots to visit in town were. The experience was overall great and the neighborhood felt safe. The room was slightly smaller than expected but otherwise a positive experience
1141522,22444579,2014-11-06,23145496,Geoff,Really nice place. Prefectly located. An easy walk from the airport and a 5min walk to the train station. The house was great and Izzy was a really helpful and accommodating host. Would most definitely stay there again.
1141522,22654628,2014-11-11,6663046,Richard,Izzy rocks!! He's an incredibly friendly host with a beautiful and well kept space. It's very close to the blue line (via Airport Station) and the neighborhood has a lot of amenities. We stayed here for four days and had absolutely no issue.
1141522,22781344,2014-11-14,20980903,Soma,Izzy is a wonderful human being and the accommodation was just amazing. The location is really good too.  It's like paying half the price for a hotel and receiving 5 star facilities. Thank you once again for all your help Izzy.Would definitely stay again when we visit Boston.
1141522,22868150,2014-11-16,22677039,Christian,Das Zimmer entspricht der Abbildung und liegt sehr nah am Flughafen. Das Bett ist bequem.  Der Bruder des Hosts empfing uns und war außerordentlich nett und hilfsbereit.
Die Sauberkeit war leider nicht optimal,insbesondere mussten wir festestellen,dass unser Bett nicht frisch bezogen war.,,,
"Immerhin war der Preis günstig.\"",,,,,
1141522,23028424,2014-11-20,78147,Brett,"Amazing stay!  Felt just like a well-run B&B.  Izzy is an unbelievably affable host who went above and beyond what I expected.  Izzy helped walk me through the reservation process, and stayed with me over the phone until everything was complete.  He made himself available for my arrival, as I needed to arrive earlier than originally planned.  The room itself was very clean and quaint, as was the rest of the home.  A nice welcome note was written on a dry-erase board on our bedroom door - something which may seem small, but makes you feel welcome.  All in all, I was incredibly happy with our stay.  I fully endorse Izzy and this rental.  Any questions, feel free to contact me :)"
1141522,23133271,2014-11-23,20767013,Cheryl,"This was our first airbnb experience so we weren't sure what to expect. Izzys place did everything that it promised. The room was clean, comfortable and conveniently located near a supermarket, several restaurants and the metro station which is only a couple of stops from downtown. Izzys brother was very helpful and recommended plenty restaurants and sights to see. We also had the chance to meet other people staying there also so there is plenty opportunity to meet others should you wish to. Ideal location if you are visiting Boston for a short period of time."
1141522,23260250,2014-11-26,510045,Mark,Another great night in Izzy's clean and cozy place - thanks!
1141522,23342665,2014-11-29,23869276,Hongsu,"Really lovely and cozy house. House owner is nice and have a good chat. There are several restaurants around like Italian and Mexican dishes, and it is also convenient to reach the airport station, blue line to go to the downtown....Thank you for treating. Have a nice trip in Boston."
1141522,23456075,2014-12-01,16980778,Léa,"The house & room were very clean, very agreable and cozy. We felt at home right away, with cute little signs on our door to welcome us and the teapot ready in the kitchen. Izzy's brother was here to welcome us and give us information about Boston. The bathroom & kitchen were big and confortable and the bed & the matress were super confortable!"
We absolutely recommend. Plus,it is located in East Boston,a beautiful hispanic neighborhood very close to the historic Boston,that we may not have had the idea to visit if we were not living there,but we loved it! Colorful wooden little houses everywhere and good and cheap food in local restaurants! Check my personal blog if you want to see the neighborhood: (URL HIDDEN),

Maison et chambre très propres et accueillantes où nous nous sommes tout de suite senties chez nous avec des petites ardoises d'accueil sympathiques sur notre porte de chambre et la théière prête à être servie dans la cuisine. Le frère d'Izzy nous a accueilli très gentiment -alors que nous sommes arrivées à 13h au lieu de 16h- et nous a donné plein d'infos sur Boston. Le matelas était méga confortable! Salle de bain & cuisine grandes et agréables aussi! Très beau quartier également que nous sommes contentes d'avoir découvert : East Boston,à deux arrêtes de métro de Nort End,le quartier historique : c'est un quartier hispanique avec des maisons de toutes les couleurs en bois et des restaurants bons et pas chers cuisine colombienne,brésilienne,etc.,
"Vous pouvez voir le quartier sur mon blog : (URL HIDDEN)\"",,,,,
1141522,23664565,2014-12-07,15181816,Nazia,"Great communication and really accommodating. Didn't get to meet Izzy but he seems like an interesting person. Note: I didn't personally stay here but my fiance and his best friend did. Their feedback: the house was well-secured and his assistant was welcoming and the room was inviting. Comfortable, sturdy bed and quiet, clean, organized house. Only thing to note is that if you're driving, there's toll ($3.50) driving out from this part of Boston going into the city (unless there's another way that you may know about) -- this may be something to consider if you are planning a daily driving commute for an extended stay, otherwise the public transit is the way to go."
1141522,23739402,2014-12-08,6394413,Rasmus,"I didnt get to meet Izzy on my very short stay here, but Rose was nice and welcomed me even on short notice. I slept well and was a little sad I couldnt stay longer - there seems to be several rooms available here and I'm sure its a nice place to meet fellow travelers. Note that parking on the street can be a challenge"
1141522,23876195,2014-12-13,24335423,Kendray,"Staying at Izzy's was a great experience. He's very communicative, which I loved. He was not at the house, but he had someone staying there in case I needed anything, and she was very nice. The neighborhood isn't the best (it's also not the worse) but the house was exceptionally well-kept and clean and I felt safe there."
The keypad entry was difficult to operate (I couldn't get it to work),which was a downside. Also my room keys were missing (I didn't need them,I was literally just there to sleep for a few hour prior to my flight),but the young woman there helped me look for them and found me a spare,and Izzy was quick in responding to my message about the situation.,
I didn't take the airport shuttle to Logan because my flight was super early (it was still dark when I left) and it was cold,but it is an extremely convenient location if you need to be near the airport. I ended up calling a Lyft car and it cost less than $7 - definitely affordable.,,,,
"All in all a positive experience. Would stay with again.\"",,,,,
1141522,23902615,2014-12-14,18820295,Joannie And Xavier,Bon compromis pour éviter d'aller à l’hôtel (hors de prix à Boston) lorsque vous devez vous rendre à l'aéroport. Instructions claires données par l'hôte.
1141522,24027401,2014-12-17,20886906,Hauke,"The apartment as well as the room itself looked like on the images. Everything was neat and clean. I think we have been there wicht 4-5 other people, which was nice because we could share our boston experiences or ask for further recommendations. However, it should be clear that the apartment is (1) shared with others and (2)more or less professionally rented."
I cannot say anything about Izzy,"since we haven't met him. The neighborhood was ok: pretty close to the airport and at most 20 minutes away from downtown.\"",,,,

1141522,25394618,2015-01-14,21785784,Josépha,"Nous avons passé 4 nuits chez Izzy et ce fut un très agréable séjour. Nous n'avons pas eu l'occasion de rencontrer notre hôte, mais la chambre que nous avions louée était vraiment parfaite, mieux que dans la description ! L'accès aux parties communes (cuisine et salle de bain partagées avec d'autres locataires) est un vrai plus quand on est en voyage itinérant comme nous, car nous avons pu préparer nos repas, comme à la maison :) le ménage est fait tous les jours, et les autres locataires que nous avons rencontrés étaient très respectueux."

Like many other visitors, we didn't meet Izzy but he responded very quickly by text when we had a question on the day, and it was nice to meet the other guests staying in the house. The room was cosy and warm despite the snow outside, and the kitchen and bathroom were clean. There is a  code access system on the front door which was very handy, and we were able to leave our luggage in the living room after we had checked out while we visited the Boston centre. Overall, really good value room."

Short distance from the airport as well as small markets just a few blocks away. Highly recommend this place!

This was my first time renting only a room, and Izzy did an excellent job making my partner and I feel perfectly comfortable. Our room was cozy and clean, the kitchen and bathroom were spotless, and the location was very convenient, close to the train as well as many markets and amenities. Highly recommended!"
1141522,26850454,2015-02-20,23748354,Ronjon,"Izzy is a really good guy!!  He really bent over backward to help me out and make me feel welcome.  I arrived late in the evening, Izzy and I texted a few times and he made sure to be up just in case something happened (eg in case I couldn't get in the door).  In terms of the place, it was just as advertised, a clean, homey place to stay within walking distance to the airport shuttle, 5-10 mins even counting time in case you get lost on the way (which I did).  Plus the internet was really fast.  Would definitely stay here again without any hesitation"
1141522,26884252,2015-02-21,20631611,Sylvia,I had a pleasant stay at Izzy's place. Izzy's a friendly and helpful host. The house is literally 5mins to the airport shuttle station. Very convenient location and nice neighborhood. Highly recommend!

It saved my *ss LOL cause I was going to spend the night at the airport cause I missed my connection flt, and hotels in the area were insanely expensive. The place is literally around the corner from Boston International airport. I took the shuttle (free), and walked 3 blocks. The place is comfortable, and cozy, super clean, very nice bed, well organized. I didn't have the chance to meet Izzy personally but he was great as a host. Don't even think about it, TAKE IT!!!"

It was a cozy experience and getting to the blue line was very easy, as described in his description! The only issue we had was finding the code to open the door. I wasn't aware that you had to use the computer to access the more detailed information, rather than on the airbnb phone app! But, izzy contacted us very promptly and resolved out issue. Overall, great experience! Would stay at Izzy's again!"

The house is just a few minutes from the Airport Subway Station. Perfect to explore the city,especially if you are arriving or departing via Logan International. We couldn't made a better decision.,,,,
The room has got a nice,clean and modern bed and a little desk.,,,,

I wasn't aware the place was more like a hostel. During my three night stay, I met a lot of friendly guests that were staying at Izzy's place. The bathroom was not the cleanest and you are sharing 1 bathroom with 4 rooms. The smoke detector had low battery so it was beeping in my room one night but Izzy was very prompt in his response and we got it squared away. Overall, it's a good neighborhood (occasionally the neighbors would be mad yelling at each other) and it is SUPER convenient to the airport and downtown! Thanks!"
1141522,30040985,2015-04-16,16448400,Annie,Excellent arrival instructions and communication even though I did not meet the host.  Very convenient from the airport and perfect for my needs.

1. It is really close to the airport. Instructions were pretty clear on how to get there.,,,,,
2. If you are looking for a lavish place to stay,this might not be the one.,,,,
3. My room was a bit hot and I could not figure out the cooling system,and did not get any response from the host to the text. However that was not a big deal,since I was tired and fell asleep as soon as I got there.,,,
4. Conversations can be heard across the rooms.,,,,,

1141522,32265624,2015-05-16,18572502,Guoying,"Nice host, well organized."
1141522,32515346,2015-05-19,13138926,Mingjia,We stayed there for one night to catch a flight next day. The room and the bed were big enough to accommodate two people. The house was clean and quiet. Very easy to get to the airport. The only inconvenience is that there is only one bathroom and we needed to wait to use it in the morning.
1141522,32946855,2015-05-23,16052507,Christa,Izzy made my friend and I feel very welcomed! The directions and listing were spot on. I would definitely stay again!
1141522,33279472,2015-05-26,32012916,Annika,Everything is like it was described on here. The room was very nice and even had a desk and a closet.
It´s kind of like a very small hostel,because there are 3 more rooms with other guests.,,,,
Izzy was very welcoming and we talked to him for a long time.,,,,,
The house is very close to the Subway station and from there it´s only 5-10 minutes to Downtown Boston,that was great!,,,,
"I would always go there again.\"",,,,,
1141522,33581815,2015-05-30,2700204,Claire,"Il est vraiment facile de trouver l'adresse depuis l'aéroport en suivant les indications d'Izzy et c'est appréciable d'arriver si vite. Quand le vent est favorable, on n'entend pas les avions, seulement les oiseaux qui chantent le matin. La chambre est fonctionnelle, propre, avec seulement une petite fenêtre (air conditionné pour qui veut).  Pour y aller, un escalier bien raide comme dans toutes les maisons du coin. La salle de bain est très propre, très sollicitée le matin quand la maison est pleine. Izzy est attentif à ses hôtes, discret et de bonne compagnie."
Pour un séjour simple favorisant les échanges avec d'autres voyageurs,"une adresse amicale.\"",,,,
1141522,34215185,2015-06-06,27446842,Rebecca,I had a great stay at Izzy's place during a quick stop-over in Boston before a flight.  The house is very conveniently located near Logan (a quick walk & shuttle ride ~ 15 min from house to terminal) and is also near quite a few dining options (check out rino's place right down the street for amazing Italian).  The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable and the check-in/check-out process was smooth and safe.
1141522,34662642,2015-06-10,14129295,Lindsey,We enjoyed staying at Izzy's place for our one day in Boston. Taking the free shuttle to and from the airport made things so easy and took no time at all. Izzy was a great host and gave us food and sightseeing recommendations. We'd love to stay here again!
1141522,34873968,2015-06-13,3099251,Cecile,"Good location, nice room and I really enjoyed my time with Izzy. Would definitely recommend his place."
1141522,35325278,2015-06-17,34184646,Alberto,"Todo salió tal y como se planeaba. Muy bien organizado, limpio, muy buena ubicación y muy amable la amiga de Izzy que fue la que nos atendió."
1141522,35458879,2015-06-19,30619953,Raymond,"Izzy was a good host. The room was clean and cozy and Izzy provided towels for showering. There is street parking available which is a rarity for Boston (Please make sure you read the parking signs clearly, as Boston is notorious for ridiculous parking restrictions)."
The house has a communal kitchen which guests are allowed to use and a shared common space. Overall,"good experience and great location.\"",,,,
1141522,36115096,2015-06-25,4561625,Sue,"We were welcomed by Izzy's assistant, Victoria, who made us feel very welcome and gave us useful information abut Boston.  The room, and the house in general, was very clean and comfortable, and there were good kitchen and bathroom  facilities, with plenty of space for food storage, and tea, coffee and other drinks were available to use.  The neighbourhood was quiet and it was very convenient to walk to the metro station and to the airport and was not far from the centre of Boston."
1141522,36207093,2015-06-26,17571555,Jeremy,While our stay was just for the night everything was clean and the directions to get in the place was clear and concise. Definitely recommend staying here !
1141522,36761553,2015-07-01,24384436,Bronwyn,"The accommodation was well located, a close walk to the airport station which would take you into downtown Boston in 3 stops. Very convenient if you are arriving/departing via the airport."
The room was very nice and well kept. It was great to have access to the kitchen and washing/drying facilities. There were initially a few issues with the wifi dropping out but Izzy and his assistant Victoria sorted it out within a day for us and we were able to access the wifi upstairs. There is only one bathroom between several guests,"but we never had any issues with this. \"",,,,
1141522,36957429,2015-07-03,14387781,Dave,"Entry instructions were very clear and we were greeted upon arrival by a friend of Izzy's. The location conveniently close to the airport as we arrived quite late and didn't want to have to travel far. The room was as described, and nice and clean!"
1141522,38423345,2015-07-15,29003863,Alan,"\"didn't see Izzy during our stay. room as described. getting there a bit less obvious from the train. close to airport. other airbnb\"\"s in the house so could be a bit cramped if all full.\""
1141522,38637815,2015-07-17,28558577,Rebecca,"We enjoyed our stay at Izzy, no problems whatsoever. Thanks Izzy!"
1141522,39178865,2015-07-21,34662897,Jon,This place was great. Drove to Boston for a weekend. Street parking was easy. The house was well kept. Met some great people staying in the other rooms. It was a short transit ride into the heart of Boston.
1141522,39404064,2015-07-23,34463858,Dmitri,"Easy check in, nice room, cool area full of great Salvadoran restaurants and easy access to the airport."
1141522,39609797,2015-07-25,21528275,Annika,"Nichts besonderes, aber für eine Nacht in Boston sehr gemütlich, zentral und gut ausgestattet!"
1141522,40721562,2015-08-02,31089775,Siobhan,"Izzy was such an amazing host and the location is perfect for a hassle free visit to Boston. The rooms were clean and both the host and other guests were warm and welcoming. The house is located 5 minutes walk from the Airport T, be sure to jump on one of the free shuttle buses at the airport. There are plenty of grocery stores in the area to stock up on food etc. we stayed for a week and throughly enjoyed the whole experience."
1141522,40926633,2015-08-03,34897999,翊嘉,Izzy is a nice host. And the room is very comfortable. The location is very convenient for anyone who's going to airport in the early morning.
1141522,41382705,2015-08-07,17059705,주현,"Izzy's place was nice and cozy. My friend and I stayed 2 nights and we satisfied so much! Nice location, comfortable bed. Hot water also comes out well. Just take any airport shuttle and get off at first station(mbta). Izzy welcomed us and he was favourable. Thanks!"
1141522,42107769,2015-08-11,24257304,Morgane,"Chambre conforme à la description du site, propre et confortable et située très près du métro et du centre de Boston."
1141522,42659729,2015-08-15,14925731,Lynda,"This is an apartment that's set up as an air bnb and although We never met Izzy, there was a host staying there and she was very welcoming. The room is as pictured. It's adequate if you are only spending a night or two. Could benefit from a mirror in the room since the bathroom is shared."
1141522,43664523,2015-08-21,3818028,Ian,"Clean, friendly house with cozy room. Nothing fancy, but it made me feel very comfortable during my stay. Also, having a private air conditioner in the summer heat was amazing. It was absolutely worth the price to stay, especially in such a convenient location."
1141522,43814605,2015-08-22,39207497,Rutchakornpatara,Good location near airport but not near to the touristic place. The house was clean.
1141522,44294903,2015-08-25,35463234,Shaun,"Now while I was unable to meet Izzy the weekend I stayed, all my interactions leading up to the weekend and throughout were more than pleasant. He was incredibly accommodating, especially on the day I had to check out—check out is 11 a.m. and my flight didn't leave until ~7 p.m. that night—while I obviously needed to be out of my room by 11, he allowed me to use the rest of the house to do work I was in town for before heading to the airport. I appreciated that greatly."
Everything here was as advertised,and you will not be disappointed with what's around the area. Pressed for time most of the weekend,I took a cab frequently,but if you have more time than I did,I suggest finding a shuttle to save a little bit.,
Whether it was through email or text,Izzy answered any questions I had promptly and checked in to make sure everything was going well. And while I am not the most sociable person when I'm out of my element,I briefly met two very nice couples from out of the country.,,,
If you're in town for business,as I was,the room was perfect—ample desk space,multiple outlets,and so on. I would recommend Izzy to anyone. He made me feel incredibly welcomed and I know he'd do the same for anyone else.,
"This was my first time trying AirBnB and this experience certainly did not dissuade me from using it again in the future.\"",,,,,
1141522,44786480,2015-08-29,7963442,Gabriela,"We had a great stay at Izzy's. The room was great and the house is very well located. The check in/check out procedure is very comfortable and, even though, we did not get to see Izzy, he was very helpful whenever we had a question."
"Great place. I would definitely return.\"",,,,,
1141522,45131710,2015-08-31,20738350,German,"El barrio es seguro y tranquilo, cerca del metro y con buena conexión a Boston y aeropuerto."
La habitación es pequeña,tal como se muestra en la foto. El aire acondicionado hace mucho ruido,no se duerme bien,y no se puede abrir la ventana.,,
Lamentablemente Izzy no vive en la casa,por lo que se pierde parte del objetivo de Airbnb de conocer gente local.,,,,
"Para una estadía corta de uno o dos noches está bien.\"",,,,,
1141522,45376762,2015-09-02,36304519,Jonas,"If you need a place to stay close to the airport, this is what you're looking for. It's a 5min walk to the subway and the airport shuttle. Everything is well organized and Izzy provides a lot of information beforehand. The room and the rest of the house are very clean and  equipped with everything you might need during your stay."
1141522,45605035,2015-09-04,25197360,Yifei,The host was easy to reach and the house is in the safe neighborhood.
1141522,45701102,2015-09-05,26203670,Emily,"Proximity to the airport was great. Izzy made the instructions to get there and get in very easy to follow. It was a short distance to downtown Boston and overall it was just what we needed. I also appreciated the clean towels and available shampoo/hairdryer in the bathroom. The neighborhood was not as nice as we expected, if I had been alone instead of with my boyfriend the walk from the airport would have been a little scary."
1141522,45980074,2015-09-07,4679330,Felicity,"\"the host was nice--  the fridge had a \"\"share\"\" shelf with extras to help yourself--  there was a tea shelf with granola bars and ramen noodles and tea--  the room was comfortable and clean--  the neighborhood is VERY WELL LOCATED for getting in and out of the airport and the neighborhood seemed safe even at 1 in the morning when we arrived.  i would stay again.\""
1141522,46522486,2015-09-11,42419585,Gary,"This was my first AirBNB experience so I was apprehensive about how legitimate the list would be.   First, let me say that the apartment is not easy to get to and even by cab it's $17 each way. The airport transit bus stops running between midnight and 5:30 am so don't expect to walk if you have a flight before 8 am.  The front door requires a code entrance which I did not have with me on my first attempt to enter the house and knocking on the door to arouse someone failed even though I could hear voices inside the house.  My second attempt with the code was successful and the accommodations were as advertised.   Very plain with one bathroom on the first floor and all bedrooms on the second .   Air-conditioning was good and the Italian restaurant one block away has great expensive food. Since hotels at Logan are very expensive, Izzy place was very adequate. He was very helpful in trying to find a cab company that would come into the area at 3 am."
1141522,47038112,2015-09-15,13190706,Wencke,"\"Wie beschrieben ist der Flughafen problemlos zu erreichen. Das Zimmer ist recht klein aber gut ausgestattet, das Bett ist bequem. Allerdings ist die Klimaanlage unfassbar laut und macht eine \"\"Nachtruhe\"\" fast unmöglich. Störend war der schlechte"
1141522,48018146,2015-09-22,30551032,Yuhan,"Very nice stay! Friendly guests, convenient location, comfortable bed."
1141522,48274347,2015-09-25,3936536,Terrie,Izzy stayed up until we arrived and we were warmly greeted. His home was quiet and nicely situated close enough for walking from the airport. We had some good coffee before leaving in the morning and we will return on our way back through Boston.
1141522,48872587,2015-09-29,29333136,Laura,Izzy was a very welcoming and accommodating host. He answered our questions about the area prior to our arrival and was sure to recommend things to do during our trip. The rooms and bathroom were very clean. The house is very close to the subway (T) station which made getting around quite easy.
1141522,48999806,2015-09-30,3936536,Terrie,"We stayed here again on our way out of Boston. At first the trip from the airport to the house seemed a little difficult but it turned out to be easy once we saw it in the daylight. We did take a taxi at midnight when we arrived the first time (it was $10) but after checking it out the next day, we realized how easy it is. Keep in mind the park you walk through has a gate that is closed from about 1:00 am to 5:00 am - I would check with Izzy on the current hours as they are seasonal. The airport T shuttle is free and easy. The neighborhood felt safe to us but I (as a female) would likely hesitate to wander around alone at night as I would on any city street."
1141522,49109126,2015-10-01,3936536,Terrie,"The first time we stayed the route from the airport to the house seemed a little scary at midnight so we took a cab ($10) to the house. Once we were able to see the route in the daylight, it was fine and we went out that way early in the morning the day we left. Please keep in mind there is a gate to the park you walk across and it is locked at 1:00 and opens at 5:00 am (check with Izzy for sure on the times as I think it is seasonal). It was an easy trip to the airport and the T shuttle is free. The park is well lit with lots of people coming and going and you just walk across it, then you're on the street. I felt safe, even in the dark, but I was with my husband."
1141522,49764915,2015-10-06,6172180,Margarita & Fabio,"The house is very warm and clean, the location is perfect close to airport (takes max 30 minutes to arrive and 0 money), Izzy is very friendly and open."
1141522,49977195,2015-10-08,5673187,Tracy,"The apartment is great, good location, it's easy to get to the airport by free shuttle bus."
1141522,50177642,2015-10-10,16559069,Charlotte,"Comfortable, convenient, close to the airport, quick replies to any inquiries we had. We would definitely recommend Izzy."
1141522,50468814,2015-10-12,32505419,Jeffrey,"Thanks for providing such a great space Izzy!  The check in / check out process was extremely simple, and with our flight schedules, we appreciated being able to drop our luggage in the living room before and after checkout!  The space was extremely close to the airport MBTA which made travel in and out of the city easy and affordable.  Also, even with sharing space with other tenants, everyone was very respectful and welcoming in the house, with no issues at all.  We look forward to staying here our next time coming through Boston!"
1141522,51067257,2015-10-17,8725607,Leslie,This was a disappointing experience.  I had a hard time figuring out exactly where the house was because the street address is not included in the directions (I finally found the # on the map on the site).  It's described as a yellow corner house.  It's definitely not a corner house and I'm not sure I'd describe it as yellow (the house  next door is definitely yellow).  Including the number of the house and a better description of what it looks like would be helpful.
The bedroom was clean and comfortable.  The rest of the house was pretty messy.  There were food and drink containers everywhere when I arrived,lots of dishes in the sink,and it needed a good cleaning.  It was like being back in college.,,,
There is no way that this house is 5 minutes from downtown Boston.  It's about a 10 minute walk to the Airport T,and then about 15 minutes to Boston.  Also,"I tried to get a cab to take me to the North End for dinner while I was there and no cab would come.  \"",,,
1141522,51284507,2015-10-19,13398235,Greet,"The location was great, closeby the trainstation downtown and the bus to the airport, the room was fine and our host helpfull.. The bathroom and refridgerator, however, weren't very clean."
1141522,51466837,2015-10-20,8075159,Heather,"The location is great for walking to and from the Airport T stop only if you are traveling between the hours of 7 am and 11 pm. My flight left at 6 am the next day. You cannot walk from the house to the airport T stop because a park borders the area and is locked from 11 pm to 7 am. I had to take a cab from the house to the airport. It's good to know this if you are choosing this place for the location and walkability to/from the airport T station. The house was fine. The room could have had a more careful dusting and also garbage from the previous guest was sitting in  the trash can in the room. The bed was super cozy and clean and warm. That's the most important thing. I'm very grateful for that. The bathroom seemed okay and clean. I only used this place to store stuff while I did sightseeing. I returned at night to sleep and then got up super early to make my early am flight. I slept fine, saw maybe 1 other guest, and the situation was okay. Izzy was not around but a friend/colleague of his was in the house to greet guests and answer questions. That was really nice."
1141522,51750463,2015-10-24,26602118,Giuseppe (Beppe),It was great! The place was well taken care of and 2 stops away from the city centre! Lovely!
1141522,52192692,2015-10-26,32087427,Habib,Great room and good location ( 5-6 mn to the T aireport station ). We stay 2 night and all was well.
1141522,52332600,2015-10-28,4968268,Nicole,"Izzy provides good directions and information about his listing. And for the most part everything is as they say it is. This isn't the place for everyone - you can stay in Boston for $90 a much cleaner homes with less of a hostel feel. There were two other AirBnB people staying - which was advertised, but it was loud when trying to sleep. The bathroom was very dirty, luckily there was a mirror in my room to get ready in front of. The bedroom I stayed in was clean however, as were sheets and towels."
1141522,52959006,2015-11-03,2390074,Sam,Location is convenient to the airport and the Blue Line.
1141522,53500269,2015-11-09,45274853,Bianca,"Izzy is so detailed on all the things you need to know before your stay. As soon as we got there his written instructions was the only thing we needed to find the house which was SUPER close to the airport and the blue line T station which takes you to downtown Boston. Needless to say the location was perfect. The actual room was a decent size with a comfortable bed and lots of storage space. During our stay the room got a little warm, but after we requested a fan the room was easily cooled down. If I could recommend Izzy to all first time visitors I would! It was a great first time Air BNB experience."
1141522,53926932,2015-11-14,30239619,Nicole,"La chambre était propre et confortable et le bruit pas trop important malgré la proximité de l'aéroport, mais il est recommandé d'apporter des bouchons pour dormir. Les gens du quartier semblent sympathiques, et nous n'avons eu aucun mal à garer la voiture pour plusieurs jours. La proximité du métro et des petits marchés est pratique, et nous avons rencontré des gens sympathiques."
Le lendemain d’une nuit d’orage,nous avons découvert un lac au pied du lit et une petite flaque d'eau près de la table de chevet. Nous avons ensuite remarqué l'existence de traces de précédentes infiltrations d'eau,notamment que la peinture était écaillée à ces endroits. Une personne souffrant d'asthme ou d'autres problèmes respiratoires pourrait s'inquiéter de loger dans une chambre où il y a des traces de multiples infiltrations d'eau qui risquent de favoriser la moisissure à long terme.,,,
Mes passeport,sacs et porte-feuilles ont pu être séchés sans trop de dommages. Heureusement que mon portable était resté sur la table de travail,puisque ma mallette à portable a été détrempée. Contacté par la personne travaillant sur place,Izzy s'est verbalement engagé à nous dédommager pour notre mésaventure. Il n'a jamais donné suite à cette promesse.,,
La nuit de notre arrivée,de la vaisselle sale trônait dans l'évier. Toutes les surfaces dans la cuisine (plancher,table,comptoir et cuisinière) étaient souillées de nourriture,la table était collante. La cuisine est dotée d'une poêle et de 3 casseroles,dont 2 sont inutiles (sauf pour cuire des homards?) car elles sont gigantesques. L'unique poêle à frire
Bref,un endroit pas cher,"mais qui ne serait même pas coté trois étoiles...\"",,,
1141522,54297868,2015-11-17,48248917,Bach,The room was neat and really convenient as it is very close to airport (costs me around 10usd to get there) and within walking distance  to Boston Blue Line. The price was competitive too. Highly recommended!
1141522,54469076,2015-11-20,11624613,John,"Izzy was very helpful with the directions, his place is so convenient for the airport and metro. The house and room was as described with the huge bonus that the other guests were so nice and great company - sharing wine, beer and experiences. We would highly recommend Izzy's place."

1141522,56357798,2015-12-12,36034303,Indira,La habitacion estaba muy limpia y acogedora. La cama muy cómoda y el apartamento ubicado en un sitio de fácil acceso al downtown de Boston.
"Fue una experiencia agradable.\"",,,,,
1141522,57554219,2015-12-27,44514860,Stefan,"The stay at the apartment was excellent and everything was as described. The apartment is in a great location, very close to both the downtown area and the airport. If you are ever in Boston and need a great place to stay this would be it. Highly recommended."
1141522,58067097,2015-12-31,11884895,Héctor,The room was clean and it's close to the metro (10 min to downtown)
1141522,58712817,2016-01-03,13889742,Mitchell,"We arrived late, so I did not meet Izzy.  The house is very clean and 10 minutes from the airport.  This was great because we had an early flight.  Unfortunately, someone else had an even earlier flight, and there conversations easily passed through the thin walls.  The bed was very comfortable.  I will stay here again."
1141522,58992323,2016-01-05,626442,Ryan,"Izzy provides a warm, secure, super clean environment in a blue collar central Boston venue.  Easily reached on foot from the metro and airport.  I had a brief chat with a lovely lady, Olivia from Austin, who shared the house and both of us found it an easy pick and would use it again."
1141522,59177037,2016-01-07,16354512,Jittinun,We got help from Izzy's staff which was very helpful. His place was very great and clean. We're very enjoy our stay.
1141522,59621054,2016-01-12,45304564,Yui,It was really close and easy access from the airport. Also the place was comfortable that I extend my stay :) I will strongly recommend this place for people who wants to explore Boston.
1141522,60188997,2016-01-19,35331807,Dens,Everything was fine and the place was really cosy. The kitchen is well equipped.

1141522,60629911,2016-01-25,23043796,Sybil,The room was perfect for the night. It's easy to park the car in the street. The host was really nice and welcoming. Very good place to stay.

1141522,63833875,2016-02-27,58760998,Isabella,Very lovely and hospitable. The only downside was that the second step from the top step is crazy creaky and the bathroom is downstairs. If you make a lot of trips to the bathroom at night (like me) then you might risk disturbing other guests.

1141522,65868998,2016-03-17,41316981,Brandon,"Izzy has a great location close to the airport and the T Station Blue Line. Once we figured out you can walk directly through the train station and not all the way around the park LOL.  The common areas of the house are nice and clean, the single bedroom was perfect for my wife and I.  Rosa is also a delight to be around she checks you in, keeps the house clean and her English is great for only 3 months of study. We love Boston way better than New York we will return.  Gotta hit Peach Farm on Tyler Street in Chinatown best soft shell crab and lobster I've ever had."
1141522,66547279,2016-03-23,15352303,John,The apartment was nice.
1141522,68431153,2016-04-04,21265761,Weiyi,I felt right at home living in Izzy's home.
The place was a little old but it didn't matter to be all because it was very clean and well maintained. I did also managed to meet the rest of the people who was living there as well,which was very nice. Unfortunately,I only had the chance to do it towards the end of my stay. I was busy working on my presentation for the conference. Having said that,"my stay was great and I highly recommend to anyone who is visiting Boston. Thanks Izzy. \"",,
1141522,68826919,2016-04-07,23748354,Ronjon,"I've stayed at Izzy's place multiple times, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. This place is perfect for someone who has a late arrival flight or something early in the morning, it's maybe a 5-10 minute walk to the airport. Also, rooms are always clean and the people are always nice. Highly, highly recommend (which is why I come back here so often)."
1141522,68846471,2016-04-07,14482926,Michelle,"Izzy's place was clean and comfortable.  Exactly what we needed for our early flight out.  Within walking distance to the free shuttle to the airport, you can't beat it!  Would definitely stay there again!"
1141522,69153330,2016-04-09,58255598,Gabrielle,"Izzy was a fantastic host!!! His home was perfect for our stay, exceptionally well organised and extremely clean and tidy. It was the perfect location for anyone wanting to explore Boston. I actually left my wallet at his home and Izzy was such a great host that he dropped it off to me when he came down to Philadelphia two days later. I'm so grateful for his generosity in going out of his way for me. The best hospitality I've ever known! I would highly recommend staying with Izzy!!! Thanks again Izzy :)"

Izzy doesn't live there.. the complete House is Full of travelers who check themselves in with a door code. The Neighborhood is really quiet and there are not much things todo, or Restaurants.. or bars..."

1141522,70615913,2016-04-19,45356675,Kyndall,"My husband and I were sort of hesitant.  We didn't really know what to expect...we were pleasantly surprised.  Not only was the lady over seeing the property while the owner was away, she was nice and the property way too.  Our other house mates were very pleasant.   We were lucky all of us had a lot in common and there for the same reason.  The rental fee was very affordable verses what our friends paid for staying in downtown Boston."

1141522,72212105,2016-05-01,68227675,Katie,"I felt very welcomed by the host.  It was very easy to get from the airport to the house by walking.  However if you are traveling alone at night as a female, I would want to walk it alone.  The house was very clean and the bed was comfortable.  My boyfriend and I did not end up staying the night because there was not a TV in the room and he cant sleep without a TV.  But other than that we would have stayed and had a great experience."
1141522,72573064,2016-05-03,52105576,Michelle,"The check in was super easy. The directions provided before my stay were accurate and helpful. This room is very close to the airport, which was ideal for my night layover. The house is very clean and the bed was super comfy."

1141522,75730321,2016-05-22,23681224,George,It was a quiet and very comfortable experience. Bed was cozy and room was spacious. Super convenient when walking to the blue line while we were visiting. Overall great time!
1141522,76082041,2016-05-24,19232123,Kallan,"Really cozy room and the amenities are great!  Full kitchen to use, great living space, and still lots of privacy even though you're sharing with other guests.   Airport is so easily accessible, it's a great place to begin or end your stay in Boston. Thanks Izzy!"
1141522,76271473,2016-05-26,48206371,Karimah,I liked that the location is super close to the airport. Room was clean with a comfortable bed. I loved the self check-in process. Great airbnb experience! Thank you so much Izzy!
1141522,77213862,2016-05-30,66457136,Dora,Good transportation. They are very friendly as we request for keeping luggage in their living room on last day.

1141522,78788459,2016-06-09,62302004,Anto,"We really enjoyed our stay in izzy's house. It's very close to the subway, five blocks and it take you everywhere in Boston. The bedroom it's exactly like the picture and even the bathroom is shared, it's very clean and big."
WE didn't know Izzy,"but his friend Fabio was so welcoming and nice to us. We really enjoyed talk with him. He made that our staying was really great. it's highly recommended!\"",,,,
1141522,78898504,2016-06-10,76508388,Simon,Nice and hostel-feeling place. We had to get hold of a computer and the host let us borrow one. Would definitely stay at this place again!
1141522,79106147,2016-06-11,65334168,Antonio,"Everything was as described, the room was clean and so was the bathroom. We we there only for one night so we didn't use the kitchen, but it looked clean. There were some other tenants in the house and it was nice to hang out with them."
1141522,79403325,2016-06-12,53462650,John,"Easy arrival, only a 5 minute walk from the airport subway station, biggest issue was only 1 bathroom for the 7 guests in the house. Bathroom opened right into the kitchen so that was odd as well. Other guest were reasonable so this was manageable but not the best."
1141522,80449731,2016-06-18,5073050,Arturo,Great place! Enjoyed the comforable bed and room. Thank you so much Izzy. Boston was lots of fun!!
1141522,80666551,2016-06-19,27791232,Kathrin,"We stayed at Izzy's place for two nights as an overstop to our actual travel destination, NYC. For guests who arrive at the airport the house is perfectly located. We could even walk. We did a self Check-in, so we did not meet Izzy in person. All other guests who stayed in the other rooms were quiet and we rarely met them."
Our room was as expected - small but absolutely sufficient if you are out all day and only come back for sleeping.,,,,,
If you have a lot of luggage with you,it might get a little tight,but it worked for us.,,,
The only thing we did not like was that there was a permanent food smell in our room which didn't go away. But once we had been in the room for a few minutes we didn't notice it anymore.,,,,,
All in all we would recommend staying at Izzy's place,"especially for people who stay only one or two nights and arrive at the airport. \"",,,,
1141522,81211136,2016-06-21,63672908,Yun-Chu,"Izzy is well-communicated and helpful via app. The room is as listing described and comfortable.  I will recommend this place mainly for its convenience, it located near airport and downtown. This place is my best stay during my long trip!"
1141522,81411687,2016-06-22,71203981,Megan,"The location was perfect. You can easily use public transportation to get to and from the city center and the airport shuttle is within walking distance. There are clear instructions about how to arrive and enter the house (which we appreciated!), and Izzy was available and responsive to all inquiries. Didn't actually meet the host, but there was a pleasant worker managing the house (would have been nice to know about his role before arriving). Overall, a pleasant stay!"
1141522,81818602,2016-06-25,43722027,Marie,"Nous n'avons pas rencontré Izzy, mais un ami à lui était présent et nous a fait nous sentir comme chez nous ! La chambre est très agréable, ainsi que les parties communes. La cuisine est parfaitement équipée, et le balcon très agréable pour les soirées d'été ! La maison est très bien située afin de se rendre à l'aéroport, et à 5min à pied de la bouche de métro qui vous emmène directement au centre ville ! Seul petit bémol, une unique salle de bain, pour les 4 chambres à louer de cette maison : c'est un peu la bousculade le matin..."
1141522,82943986,2016-06-30,29942368,Dominika,"The check in process was smooth and everything was ready and prepared as expected. The notes in the house were clear and friendly. The house is a little run down and the room had a bit of a musty smell when we came in, but overall it was clean. Do note you'll be sharing a bathroom with other guests which means queues in the morning. Izzy was very gracious and allowed us to leave our bags behind for the afternoon. Overall good value compared to other options available."
1141522,83285684,2016-07-02,3717565,David,Everything was great. I had a early morning flight to the airport so I just wanted to stay nearby for a night.
1141522,84034346,2016-07-05,67689878,Lena,"We liked the place and it's a great location for going to the city center or to the airport. It is lovely to sit outside. Izzy hasn't been there,  but everything was arranged. Only thing the aircon in the living room was loud, especially at night. And there was no window in our room, a fan was in the window so it was a little bit dark and no option to open the window for fresh air. But I think it was just in our room, the other rooms had windows for daylight. Anyway, it was a really nice stay."
1141522,84840909,2016-07-09,25494123,Raed,I didn't meet Izzy but I met his cousin Flavio who was the host then. Communication with both of them was good and easy. This property gets A+ for location as it is perfectly situated near by the airport and Boston downtown. Both are accessible by public transport.
The bed was comfortable and the house is generally clean. The only exception will be the shower area which needs better cleaning.,,,,,
"Bear in mind that there are 4 gust rooms in the house sharing one bathroom. \"",,,,,
1141522,84912862,2016-07-09,39978706,Isaac,"Izzy's house is a very neat place, which I highly recommend to anyone interested in staying in Boston. The bedroom that I was assigned was clean, organized and covered all of my needs: a desk, a comfortable chair, AC, closet, and good lighting."
Being close to the airport was also a huge plus for me,since I had to leave for the airport early the next day.,,,,
Also,there is a train station nearby which allows for easy transportation to the rest of Boston,"and it has the advantage of being a designated stop for the Shuttle bus to the airport.\"",,,
1141522,85177903,2016-07-10,69523002,Kerstin,"Wir hatten die besten Kissen, die man sich nach einem langen Flug nur wünschen kann! :-)"
Wir waren nur eine Nacht in Boston,dafür war unsere Unterkunft absolut ausreichend. Es war alles so vorbereitet,wie Izzy geschrieben hatte; ihn selbst haben wir nicht kennen gelernt.,,,
Für alle,die recht nah am Flughafen eine Unterkunft für kurze Zeit suchen,"ist Izzys Angebot perfekt! \"",,,
1141522,85899559,2016-07-13,53664432,Rod,Safe area very close to airport and trains. Never met Izzy but his friend who looks after the place for him was there.Would stay again.
1141522,87920791,2016-07-22,81567355,Ulrika,Bra boende nära Bostons flygplats och det var bara att dyka upp när det passade. Lätt att ta sig ner till Bostons centrum med tunnelbanan. Trevligt att sitta på terrassen och äta frukost.
1141522,88883699,2016-07-25,44008793,Suyi,"Amazing experience! The room we stayed in was cozy and Izzy's cousin was helpful, therefore making the experience even better!"
1141522,90889172,2016-08-02,62007363,Richard,"Stayed here for 6 nights and it was a great base to explore the city from. Really close to the metro and a quiet neighbourhood. With the exception of a few planes flying overhead early in the morning this place can't be faulted, and I liked that there was almost always someone else in the property, whether it was Izzy himself or other guests, all of whom were really friendly. I would definitely recommend this place for those that want somewhere to base themselves and then explore the city of Boston and the surrounding area."
1141522,91147743,2016-08-04,41226821,Matthias,Thanks for a great and clean room in a cozy house near the airport. We were only staying for one night and leaving from South Station the next morning but the location would also be great to explore the city as its only a 5-10-minute ride on the public transport. The airport station is very close and we also found a nice Mexican restaurant right around the corner. Thanks for having us!
1141522,93541001,2016-08-13,29581155,Russell,"This is a great place just ten mins walk from the airport T station. Izzy carried out bags for us and the room was comfortable, air conditioned and had a very nice bed. The neighbourhood was clean and seemed very safe, we regularly returned after 1030pm and never saw anyone else. There is also a nice park nearby with fountains. Overall an excellent stay and highly recommended"
1141522,93711356,2016-08-13,875653,Kendra,"The house was very clean. The room was as advertised, small but clean with a comfortable bed. We did not meet Izzy, but his assistant was great! And we had no problems checking in. Izzy rents a number of rooms, so it feels more like a hostel than a private home. We also really enjoyed meeting the other guests as we ate dinner and watched the Olympics in the living room. The house is very convenient to the airport.  We had a very early flight out of Logan, so we booked Izzy's place due to the easy access to Logan, but we loved being in a part of Boston off the beaten tourist path. The largely Latino neighborhood felt safe, lots of families on the streets on a Friday evening, small grocery stores on every corner, and a short walk to the airport shuttle. If taking the airport shuttle in the very early morning or arriving very late at night, be sure to check the park hours on your way to Izzy's. They are posted on the PARK GATES as you enter the park FROM the T station.  The gates are locked at 10 pm and open at different times in the morning depending on the season. In August, the gates were open at 5 AM."
1141522,94345304,2016-08-15,56176541,Emma,Great place to stay if you need somewhere close to the airport
1141522,95381831,2016-08-19,50913153,Bo,"I had a nice stay at Izzy's home. I did see Izzy, but his friend helped me a lot. Everything is fine. Thanks so much. Highly recommend this house."
1141522,95985558,2016-08-21,54095317,Hassan,"Izzy's place was exactly as described. Our room was clean and his communication leading up to our stay was great. We got into Boston past 1am so the self check-in was perfect for us. The AC in our room worked very well. There is a slight musky smell at times but it wasn't overbearing and would not keep us from staying there again. There is only one bathroom in the unit but we did not have any issues when we needed to use it. Location wise, I'll just say that it's not in the most affluent of neighborhoods in the Greater Boston Area; nevertheless, my wife and I walked around to Walgreens and such nearby and did not experience any issues."
Ultimately,"I'd recommend this place if you need a somewhere close to the airport for a short stay at a relatively cheap price and still have access to the city via public transportation.\"",,,,
14663743,96812629,2016-08-24,6520750,Brad,Perfect place for two of us in separate queen beds. Walked to the convention center for our meetings on a beautiful sunny day and had dinner in the seaport. All close by!

Our only issue was that there was a small mixup with Xfinity account not being active when we arrived so we had no TV or internet. Ally contacted the cable company immediately but they never seemed to reactivate it during our stay (which was fine,since we were mostly out exploring the city and watching the Boston Marathon).  There was a public xfinity hotspot for xfinity customers (which we also are) available for use in the building so we were able to make use of that when we were inside.,,,,
Overall,"would definitely stay again.\"",,,,
11648212,70953339,2016-04-22,25144071,Meagan,Aly's apartment was super cute and in a great part of town.  I also forgot soap and luckily she had some there just in case. Key pick up was seamless and 10/10 would totally stay again!

7755144,48906716,2015-09-29,30607424,Amit,"Jason was a wonderfully accommodating host and his place was fantastic.  He was very quick to respond to messages and was able to meet our requests to check in early & check out late (due to weird flight times) without the slightest bit of annoyance.  Additionally he kept his place immaculate and incredibly well-stocked full of snacks, food, drinks and toiletries.  The place itself was in a perfect location, with great cafes and restaurants just right outside the door; and a quick 15 minute walk to all the tourist sites."

Everything definitely exceeded any expectations I had going into the trip!  We were in Boston for a week and saw a ton of the city but also really enjoyed the immediate area around the condo.  There is a lot of great shopping & dining within very easy walking distance. There is an amazing Mexican place called El Centro that is seriously a must try if you like Mexican food.  The Mass Ave T station is about a 5 min walk with a Dunkin Donuts along the way that was perfect for our morning coffee stop!  Having laundry in the condo was really convenient too and it was great to arrive home without loads of laundry to do!  Jason was really friendly and easy to communicate with. You will not be disappointed with any aspect of your stay if you choose this condo!"
7755144,52423723,2015-10-29,45493897,Barbara,"Jason was so warm, friendly and helpful.  He responded quickly and honestly to my questions in advance about the apartment and the location, texted during my stay to check in and make sure things were ok, and helped me with restaurant recommendations and using uber.  He was gracious and accommodating and a wonderful host. The listing and pictures were completely true to the space."

Great condo with short walk to award winning restaurants, theater, and amazing coffee houses. Jason went out of his way to make us feel at home with snack and libations galore.

The location is terrific, and the apartment is pretty close to the downtown and other lively districts. And the kitchen was great for cooking! My mum cooked a lot for us during our stay at the apartment. The room was big, clean and tidy. And there are powerful  washing machine and heating  machine inside, you could do your laundry easily. Joey were really nice guys that help all the time! Feel free to ask for help if you need to!"

The apartment was well-appointed and had everything I needed, including full-size laundry.  They had a huge TV with cable -- and I was able to plug in my laptop to watch Netflix, too.

The condo was clean, sleek, and lived up to its description.  I was quite impressed when I arrived, and definitely used the tips I got from them about the area.  It isn't far from the Orange line, which makes access to the rest of the city a breeze.  Definitely enjoyed staying here!"
7755144,74199934,2016-05-14,70569899,Susan,"Great place!  The communication before our arrival was friendly and very clear.  We were greeted by Joey who works with Jason.  Joey explained the ins and outs of the place perfectly.  The home was liberally stocked with comfort items.  The location could not have been better for our trip.  We were able to walk to all the places we'd wanted to visit, including Fenway.  We had a great stay.  We would recommend it and come back.  It was a great experience.  Thank you Jason and Joey."
7755144,77921415,2016-06-04,67069144,Nick,Great Airbnb to stay in. Close to everything and is in an awesome part of town. It was my first time in Boston. I loved the city and the location of the apartment. Would recommend to anyone. Couch is big enough to stay a third person if needed and is comfy. Overall great experience.
7755144,80334977,2016-06-17,13701272,John,"\"Nice place and very good location on Tremont St and Maass Ave.  Near coffee shops, restaurants, and the T stop 2 blocks away.  Downsides were a hasty and incomplete clean up from the party before, no hand towels provided, and no coffee maker or water kettle provided (nor toaster or toaster oven).  So \"\"Jason\"\""
7755144,82799911,2016-06-29,11342459,Dan,"I stayed in Boston for 10 days on a business trip and Jason's place was the perfect place to stay. Everything you could possibly need was attended to and it had all the comforts of home.    Jason was great with communication and left nothing unclear with check in and check out.  The place is as described and better.  The highlight of the apartment is the peacefulness of the bedroom; the entire apartment is below street level so the bedroom is cool, dark and quiet which is perfectly restful even with a busy intersection just outside."
Close to everything in the South End you will not need or want to keep a car; parking can be a pain.,,,,,

The cleanliness of Jason's apartment is impeccable. Also, he made sure his friend was there to check me in and provide guidance regarding nearby places to visit and directions to my conference center. Further, he made sure all our needs are taken care of during our stay. There is no doubt that I will choose staying at Jason's place whenever I visit Boston next.

Jurek was a brilliant landlord/host providing us with all the necessary information for our arrival and entry well in advance of the start of our stay. He was warm and welcoming and yet never intrusive,making us feel very relaxed and at home for our entire time there.,,,,

This was nice as we stayed in the apt as a stop over from Maine to fly home from Boston.  We would like to plan a weekend in Boston to see the sights as this was not the case on this trip.  Will contact Jurek in the future in hopes of staying there again.

4628907,63313220,2016-02-21,48004779,Zack,"Tuvia was very accommodating when I booked my stay with short notice. He and his roommate coordinated to let me in and nobody killed me or stole anything from me. The bedroom and the apartment were way beneath my personal cleanliness standards. I'm an AirB&B host also, and I used to host on Couchsurfing; I charge the same as Tuvia except my place is way way way nicer. I don't think I am undercharging. I think Tuvia needs to work a little bit harder to be a good AirB&B host. He'd make a FINE Couchsurfing host. (In which case I would have stayed for free.) Combination grateful and grossed out"
4628907,64111407,2016-02-29,57731915,Aviva,"Tuvia was very welcoming and kind to us during our stay in his home. He worked hard to make us feel comfortable and to accommodate our needs. The space is particularly cramped, and we had effectively no privacy. While he was very helpful, the space does not lend itself to guests, and we were unable to use the kitchen. The space is well below standards of cleanliness necessary for paying guests, especially at the price we paid."

His building is really close to one of the green line stations and it cost me only $5 the trip from/to the airport. Boston is an amazing city and if you have time available and like walking, you can walk pretty much anywhere! The bed was very comfortable and Tuvia was a great host. The info that he gave me about the city and the area was great. :)"

During peak hour it's double that. Parking was a pain but we managed to find a spot on Brainerd St, kept our car there for the remainder of our trip. If you plan on doing street parking, look carefully at/for the signs. We wanted to check in a little early and did not realize it was at 3pm so I asked Jim personally if he could meet us at 230 and he said it would cost $20. They are very strict that.

5593939,74646815,2016-05-16,7800226,Rose,We stayed at Jim's listing for the first time this month; the apartment is in a great location and was clean and comfortable. Check-in was easy and quick; would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Boston!
5593939,75022233,2016-05-18,9265097,Xilin,"Very beautifully decorated apartment. Not very large but clean and tidy and has all the equipments we needed. The kitchen's very useful. The sofa bed is quite large and comfortable. Great location, not in downtown but super close to both a bus stop and a metro (rapid transit) station. Would definitely recommend."
5593939,76433943,2016-05-27,44251546,Karolynne,"Apartment was great, perfect location in Boston. Very clean and exactly how it looks in the pictures. Jim was responsive and very helpful. Thank you!"
5593939,76818390,2016-05-29,29980376,Jeffery,"Jim's apartment was very nice. He was not available to check us in or out. But, his remote process worked well. Thanks again. Jeff"
5593939,78554632,2016-06-07,42641833,Priyanka,The apartment is quite cozy and very clean. All essentials were available. Jim greeted us at the door and was prompt in responding to any questions I had even before the visit. The best thing is the location. Opposite B-Fresh grocery store and a min walk to Harvard Street stop (mid-way between BC and BU). I think it is best suited to accommodating three people. I would certainly book it again!! Thanks Jim

5593939,79239564,2016-06-12,16391975,Dave,"My fiancee and I arrived late at night, and Jim provided clear instructions in advance for accessing the apartment. It was very clean and was a perfectly comfortable place to crash for a night."
5593939,79466166,2016-06-12,7549221,Margaret,"This place was terrific.  Just what I needed to visit my daughter for the night.  I only wished I had thought of this last year.  I would have visited her much more.  The place was cozy, comfortable and centrally located to what I needed.   Thank you Jim!"
5593939,80246146,2016-06-17,6817321,Nader,Jim is a nice polite man. He described the neighborhood amenities to me made me feel home.
5593939,80474797,2016-06-18,24416063,Kathleen,"Jim's place was perfect. He made sure we were comfortable and was open to giving us any suggestions we needed. It was in a convenient location, around a lot of bars and restaurants; it had a perfect balance of calm and the livelihood of Boston. Not to mention, the place itself was so cozy! Thank you for everything, Jim!"

5593939,81335864,2016-06-22,37096950,James,The host canceled this reservation 115 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5593939,83654744,2016-07-03,5675754,Chris,We had a great stay at Jim's place last week.  It was located right on a fairly major wide street in Brookline. His apartment is in an older building with unusual initial entrance but once in you quickly get the hang of it. Comfy bed and pullout couch.  He was nice enough to have coffee supplies on hand. Easy access to the major spots in the city either by car or Uber (used them to/from Fenway). We would stay there again for sure.
5593939,87621874,2016-07-21,74443497,Andy,"Listing was accurately described and Jim was very helpful and responsive. Condo definitely met our needs. Vibrant, safe neighborhood that was easily accessible by public transportation.  One thing to note is that the location is a fairly long T ride from the main tourist attractions in Boston. Perfect place for a family touring Boston University or visiting a student."
5593939,89113386,2016-07-26,7106903,Amy,Great place! Location was one block from public transportation. Close to Fenway Park and many other attractions in Boston. We had a fantastic trip and Jim was very helpful. He suggested a couple local places to eat and both had excellent food.
9208166,54082890,2015-11-15,6730524,Warren,Excellent experience. The room was as advertised and is in a perfect location to walk into the city. The apartment was very clean and decorated really nice. I highly recommend this apartment.

9208166,55299580,2015-11-29,48783539,Chloe,"The apartment was very modern, clean and contained everything that was needed for our trip which was an extended weekend. A very short walk to Whole Foods next door was very useful and even included a Spa. I highly recommend this apartment."
9208166,56823748,2015-12-18,28937340,Carolyn,"Loved the Ink Block apartment, and it was super convenient to shop at the Whole Foods next door, while the neighborhood felt safe to walk my pups at night.  Kyle allowed me to check in early, and the location is super dog friendly.  Kyle was very responsive to all my messages.  This apartment is exactly as pictured in a very cool building."
9208166,57257542,2015-12-23,10489174,Michael,"I have stayed in Klye's place before and it is great. Well furnished, great location and value. In the immortal of the Terminator, I will be back."
9208166,57405744,2015-12-25,51582012,Mb,"The apartment was spectacular! We felt like we were staying in a high end hotel. We thought some of the items were lacking until we found mugs and bowls in the dishwasher! It was perfect. Since there is a sleep sofa in the living room, it might have been nice to have sheets, but we made it work! We've decided to make this an annual tradition! Hope it's available next year!"
9208166,58374085,2016-01-02,26129422,Alfredo,"Everything worked well, as described.  Kyle was very attentive and helpful. Checkin process was fast and easy.  The building is very nice and location is great. All very recommendable.  Thanks!"
9208166,58903656,2016-01-05,13469546,Hilary,"Great location, very light and ideal for 2 couples. The 5/6 person would have to sleep on a sofa bed which I hadn't taken on board. The host is very helpful and the proximity to Wholefoods a real asset!"
9208166,59786516,2016-01-15,3997747,Stephen,"This is one of the best AirBnB apartments I have ever stayed at. The apartment was very well kept, clean and was in a great location."
9208166,59981050,2016-01-17,54001005,Katrina,"Would highly recommend Kyle's apartment! This apartment was very quiet, clean, full natural light and it was super convenient to shop at the Whole Foods next door. The neighborhood felt safe to walk around and we did not have a trouble with street parking. Kyle was very responsive to my messages and answered all questions I had. This apartment is exactly as pictured and in a very cool building. Will definitely stay again next time I visit Boston. Thanks Kyle!"
9208166,61085094,2016-01-31,21504915,Mana,Kyle was super helpful and quick when responding to my messages. He was a great host.
9208166,61997606,2016-02-10,51671479,Juancho,It was an awesome and extremely comfortable apartment. The location was good and the ad reflected accurately what the apartment was. I would absolutely recommend it.
9208166,64373621,2016-03-03,45868872,Jan Di,"Kyle was really flexible and understanding about the check-in and check-out time. The place was really neat, nice and as described. The Whole Foods market located right next to the apartment made cooking much easier."
9208166,65002565,2016-03-10,51185985,Sarah,"Great host, great apartment! The Ink Block is a great location. We loved being right next to Whole Foods and within walking distance to the Red Line, Silver Line, Green Line, and Boston Common with the Freedom Trail. The apartment was very spacious with the two bedrooms and the sofa sleeper. The building felt very secure. We would stay here again."
9208166,66391500,2016-03-22,48093690,Nick,Myself and 5 of my good buddies rented this apartment for 5 days during a recent trip to Boston for St. Patrick's day. I must say Great Location! The apartment is decent sized with good decor. Its very conveniently located close to everything we needed and had a whole food grocery store literally down stairs. The apartment even had a washer and dryer which we were not expecting.
This apartment was well equipped with towels,blankets,linens and plenty of dishes to accommodate our group. The apartment was easy to keep warm of the chilly Boston days that we encountered. It was in walking distance of most places and had a great curb appeal.,,,
If I ever come to Boston again,I would want to rent this apartment as it was spectacular. Keep up the great Airbnb service Kyle.,,,,

9208166,67549867,2016-03-30,10175845,Milena,"Kyle's apartment is even better than the pictures! The building is not exactly the one in the pics, but it is of equal comfort, design and is brand new as well. Kyle was also very kind to acomodate our needs: we managed to check in earlier than discussed, and he provided also the hairdryer that wasn't in the apartment. He was very quick to answer all our messages before and during the trip. The location is 7 mins. Walking distance from orange line stop Tufts Medical Center, which leads you in downtown and main areas in less than 10 mins. The apartment was big ebough for the 6 of is, and we enjoyed our staying very much!"
9208166,67961796,2016-04-01,52764712,Hsiao-Wei,"Very nice, beautiful and clean apartment! Perfect location! Amazing!"

9208166,68916111,2016-04-07,45709884,Jiang,Very nice experience to stay at the apartment. The room is very clean and convenient. It's a good choice for a family vacation.
9208166,69228658,2016-04-10,55406867,Christina,"We had a great time staying in this apartment! Very clean, very modern, sunny, corner unit. Having the Whole Foods there was so convenient. The beds and the pull-out couch were both very comfy so we all slept well, and 6 girls had plenty of room in the two bathrooms. I'd definitely stay here again!"
9208166,69970894,2016-04-15,3476093,Amy,"The apartment is great, it's clean and stocked with basic amenities and the Whole Foods mart just beside the building is a big plus! The building itself is cool-looking with a cosy lobby and concierge to help you with check-in: feels almost like a hotel!"
9208166,70670096,2016-04-19,9081542,Max,"Beautiful new apartment in a cool building! This was the perfect home base for my family to use during the Boston Marathon. Kyle was a pleasure to communicate with, and even was able to offer us parking in the building for a small extra fee. Thanks!"
9208166,71409174,2016-04-25,49638063,Jonathan,This apartment worked perfectly for my group during our stay in Boston! We had some minor issues with the management of the building when we all first arrived but when we got in touch with Kyle he ironed things out immediately. The apartment itself was beautiful and easily accommodated our party of 6. The Whole Foods just across the street was extremely useful for stocking up on snacks & breakfast food for our stay & pretty much all of the hot spots we wanted to hit while in Boston was within a reasonable walking distance. Would recommend & stay there again.
9208166,71731332,2016-04-28,59314584,Takiya,Kyle was an awesome host. Was extremely kind and attentive to all questions we had about check in and check out.

9208166,72581196,2016-05-03,63244606,Patti,"This was the perfect place for my daughters and myself to stay!  We didn't need a thing as far as soap, towels, garbage bags, T paper, Paper T etc.....  It was all there for us !!  And, having Whole Foods right there was perfect. Oh, and the parking spot (for a slightly extra charge) was just as perfect!  I didn't have to worry about parking at all.   I seriously would live here !  i felt that comfortable!  I would definitely recommend this place!"
9208166,73795572,2016-05-10,62095235,Zheng,"The apartment is very clean and tidy. There is a food market in the neighborhood, and it's very convenient for people who cook themselves."

The apartment was fantastic - modern, clean and well appointed -  and the location was great.  Kyle was an excellent host, providing accurate and helpful information that ensured our stay in Boston was a dream."
9208166,75674131,2016-05-22,30641758,Clarissa,"Kyle's condo met all of my needs. It was clean, well sized, and safe. The condo is brand new (they were still painting the hallway) so it was especially top-notch. Being a major city, parking was a little issue but Kyle offered his parking space for a fee. He was very easily accessible and exceeded my needs. The Whole Foods behind the condo was a plus to stock up on essentials. Would definitely recommended this Airbnb to anyone!"
9208166,76477531,2016-05-27,20850668,Krystal,Great experience and stay -the apartment was clean and comfortable and the host was super helpful and communicative!
9208166,78684603,2016-06-08,37598184,Corie,"The apartment is great and in a very good location in Boston. If you bring a car, though--either ask Kyle to rent his parking space in the garage or plan to spend Friday and Saturday nights searching endlessly for parking."
9208166,79847926,2016-06-14,28533863,Shaista,"The location of Kyle's apartment was excellent and so was the apartment itself as a cozy and comfortable two bedroom apartment.  On our arrival we were advised that concierge would let us in and the apartment would be un locked.  After a 20 hour flight, there was no one at concierge and the apartment was locked.  After a twenty minute wait including a few calls in vain to the host, the concierge let us in.  Once in, everything worked smoothly including the internet.  Location is very good with close proximity to Chinatown."
9208166,81006119,2016-06-20,55153816,Carlos,Very nice apartment and well located. A short walk to major attractions and public transportation. Whole Foods next door is very convenient.
9208166,81694184,2016-06-24,68007777,Tippawan,The apartment was very nice and clean.  Everything was as described.  The conceirge was great checking us in.  I will definitely come to stay here again when I come to Boston.
9208166,84771111,2016-07-09,15289087,Jean-François,"Pendant un instant, nous avons cru que nous n'étions pas au bon endroit car le concierge n'était pas à son poste et nous n'avions aucun moyen d'entrer dans l'édifice. Par la suite, tout s'est très bien passé. L'appartement est propre, en bon état et bien situé. Prendre soin de prévoir un stationnement si vous êtes en voiture. Le marché au bas de l'édifice est super pratique. Le logement est bien insonorisé, mais tout de même un peu bruyant car il y a quelques édifices en construction aux alentours. Je le recommande pour tous ceux qui cherchent un logement à Boston."
9208166,85652066,2016-07-12,79692812,Therese,Everything was clean and tidy.  Nice location - about a mile walk to Faneul Hall.  Whole Foods is located right next door.  We used Kyle's parking spot which is under the apartment building - a nice added bonus.
9208166,92934251,2016-08-10,41484454,Lewis,Kyle's place was exactly as described.  The apartment was clean and in a very quiet building.  The neighborhood was easily accessible to getting around Boston...and having Whole Foods and Peet's coffee close by was really nice.
9208166,96074885,2016-08-21,9394044,Shirine,"Secure building in a very convenient location. We walked everywhere - day and night - including over to Cambridge. The flat was a perfect size for four adults. We could all spread out and have privacy, too, as needed."
Close proximity to Whole Foods was also advantageous.,,,,,
And finally,Kyle was an extremely responsive host.,,,,
"We would definitely consider staying there again. \"",,,,,
4580825,28724300,2015-03-29,7017583,Jenn,"Four of us stayed at this location for a conference and it was a delightful experience! First and foremost, the location was FANTASTIC! Close to many good restaurants and generally a very central location. The accommodations were perfect; clean, comfortable, and nicely decorated to boot! The two bathrooms was a real convenience, and check-in/check-out was a breeze! Would recommend!"
4580825,29916858,2015-04-14,27971552,Daniel,"Our host was quick to respond to our AirBnB request and provided us with all of the information we needed soon after.  The instructions were clear and everything from getting keys, storing luggage, finding the apartment, and checking out went well.  The Adam's Apartment in the North End was clean, comfortable, and located in a great location for a family to walk and explore historic Boston.  We were a ten or fifteen minute walk from two T public transit stations and within easy strolling distance of several great restaurants, cafes, the historic Freedom Trail, and famous Mike's Pastry on Hanover Street."
Four of us stayed in the two bedroom,two bathroom apartment and although we never felt cramped,please note that this is North End Boston and you shouldn't expect a lot of space.  The apartment is just as nice and just as big as it looks in the pictures (and no bigger).  It is a great place to relax after spending the day and night on the town,though,and the kitchen is just big enough for some breakfast or an easy meal.  It was certainly better,though
If I revisit Boston,"I'll look up Dror's other locations.\"",,,,
4580825,30800120,2015-04-27,29935596,Mayaro,"Dror's apartment is exactly as it is shown in the pictures. The beds are very clean and comfortable, the kitchen and bathrooms also very clean and we find everything what was necessary to have a nice stay."
The neighborhood is absolutely lovely,lots of nice restaurants and grocery stores,friendly people and very near from touristic places and public transportation. If you are looking for a comfy and secure place,"this is a great option!\"",,

Cuando metimos todas nuestras cosas en la casa,falta a un amigo un tablet,hablamos con el anfitrion y solo nos ponia pegas de que nunca habia pasado nada,de que no nos entendia... asi que el anfitrion no se comporto como deberia,ademas llamamos a la policia para no tificarlo y nunca vino.,
No repeteria con este anfitrion.,,,,,

4580825,34395534,2015-06-08,14159722,Diego,Great stay! The house is cozy and beautiful.

Right off Hanover St in North End, the place was charming, clean and extremely easy to access. The key retrieval and drop off was super quick and they even had luggage storage. Everything was professionally run."
The bed we slept on was super comfortable and even had an AC right next to it as it was quite a hot day. We really got a good nights rest and enjoyed being able to take advantage of this wonderful North End spot even if it was only for a night!,,,,,
Highly recommended!,,,,,

4580825,39368949,2015-07-23,9211440,Geri,The two-bedroom / two-bath apartment was very clean and nicely decorated. The location is even better. I highly recommend this accommodation. The management was very responsive to our questions and comments.

Very comfortable for 2 couples who are in town to see the city - and a great price compared to the pricey hotels in the area. There's little room to socialize in the flat (no living room or sitting room) or have a meal (kitchen is tight), but that's not what we were looking for. We will definitely stay again. Customer service was good too."
4580825,44756278,2015-08-29,22021889,Ryanne,"This was perfect for a couples trip to Boston. The apartment was small (no living room), but it couldn't have worked out better. We did so much sightseeing and walking around Boston, we didn't need any extra space at the apartment. The North End is phenomenal. The restaurants and community as a whole are so lovely. We could walk to the downtown area of Boston in less than 10 minutes. When it came time for us to leave, we really didn't want to go. What a fun trip in the perfect little apartment in the best neighborhood in Boston."
4580825,45368387,2015-09-02,11784076,Lizzie,"A fantastic location in a smart,modern and clean apartment.  Everything a first time tourist to Boston wants to see is in walking distance.  For a visit with a friend this was a perfect choice as we could each have our own well sized bathroom.  As described, there is no living area and the kitchen is small, but there is no need for these things in this location. Loud but effective air conditioning was a relief after the heat of a Boston summer's day."
4580825,46262907,2015-09-09,20245891,Vicki,Good communication.  Picking up the key was easy.  Great neighbourhood.  Had a great time in Boston. Having to walk through the first bedroom to enter is awkward for two couples.
4580825,46467576,2015-09-11,13109601,Gloria,"Great stay at this little apartment.. position position position!  It was fairly easy to check in collect keys and then make our way to the apartment, which was within walking distance to everything, restaurants, Freedom Trail and most of the local attractions.  It was great just to walk a couple of hundred metres to dinner and breakfast each day.  The apartment is tiny but with 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms was just what we needed.   Though it had most things in the apartment would have been great to have some coffee, tea, sugar etc just to get you started.. a lot of other AirBNB properties we have stayed have coffee to brew etc.  Parking is a real problem so if you bring a car be prepared to pay for parking $25 day in a garage a couple of streets away."
4580825,48674672,2015-09-28,25998524,Alison,AMAZING place to stay in Boston!  I would stay there again in a heart beat.  Rooms were perfectly clean and the kitchen was perfect!  Location could not be any better!!!!  Check in and check out were extremely easy!!!!!!!
4580825,48996299,2015-09-30,9278937,Christa,"Great location! Good value. Know that there is no foyer for the bedroom - the entry door opens into it, which was a challenge as we had a friend with a different itinerary that came in late and had to walk through our bedroom."
Do your research in advance for parking options and read their signs carefully. We got rooked pretty badly by Sergeant's that has tiny fine print that you need to exit by 6am. Not the host's issue,but good to know! ;),,,,
Again,"the location is AMAZING and the decor is nice.\"",,,,
4580825,49165449,2015-10-01,44452175,Rob,The Apartment was beautiful and very clean. Our brief experience in Boston was perfect. Thank you!
4580825,49480030,2015-10-04,3563378,Adam,Great Location and a very comfortable apartment!  Key pick up and drop off was very easy and convenient.
"Thank you!\"",,,,,
4580825,50612378,2015-10-13,18256397,Rachael,"Location, location, location! This place is perfect for exploring the North End (which also makes everything else easy too). It's such a fun place to stay with so many bars and restaurants right on your doorstep. The apartment was perfect for us. Two beautiful rooms and two washrooms. The kitchen is small but perfect for storing a few snacks and making your morning coffee. In this location you shouldn't be eating in anyway! The key collection/drop off process was also very easy. Highly recommend this apartment for your stay in Boston. I've used AirBnB before in Boston and it was entirely inferior to this experience!"
4580825,50741851,2015-10-14,13008610,James,"Great location, very clean. Easy pickup and drop off of the keys."
4580825,51299948,2015-10-19,24497822,Shelley,"The apartment was clean and much more comfortable to stay in than a hotel....a bit strange that it did not have a living room but it worked for the evening.  Extensive notes on what to do in the area and the location could not be beat, nor could the ease of picking up/dropping off keys.  Only warning - the larger bedroom is as soon as you walk in the front door and on ground level overlooking the sidewalk, so staying there on a Saturday night, there was a lot of noise outside on the street and people climbing up and down the building's staircase.  If you're a light sleeper, this may not be the best place for you."
4580825,51604842,2015-10-22,8073193,Sigríður,"This apartment is very lovely, exactly like the pictures and perfect for four people + luggage. We were traveling with two children and it was great to have two seperate rooms. The location is perfect, the neighborhood is great and it takes only 15 minutes to walk down town. We simply loved it and would like to stay thera again some day."
4580825,51814694,2015-10-24,33005717,Chelsea,"Dror and Cara were great to work with, easy to check in and communicate with. The apartment itself was perfectly located in the Northend of Boston, close to everything we wanted to go to and easy to find. The apartment itself was great for 4 guests with a one night stay. It was very clean and comfortable. I think staying at this apartment long term with more than 2 people would be difficult because there is only a small common area in the kitchen. But it was everything we needed. I would definitely stay here again."
4580825,51885267,2015-10-25,10664480,Emma-Claire,The apartment is in an excellent location. Only a couple minutes walk to get anywhere you need to. It was super clean and a good size.
4580825,52673518,2015-11-01,35459070,Julia,"The list description was accurate.   The room is in the heart of the North End, almost on the Freedom Trail.   We could walk to everything we wanted to see on our vacation.   We were close to the subway to adventure out a bit further.   The room was clean and just as pictured."
4580825,53856581,2015-11-13,15939580,William & Kristine,"Hi Dror , thanks so much for opening your place to us . Even though we only stayed one night . It was a the perfect location .The place very clean.We will definitely be back again ."

The apartment is 2 bed,2 bath which is hard to find in a city center,great for 2 couples!,,,
Apartment is very clean and modern.,,,,,
There was a bit of a chemical smell in the building,"and noisy pipes at night when trying to sleep. Otherwise a great spot to stay.\"",,,,

appart comme décrit comme  le proprio l'avais fait pour le bruit dont certains l'on écrit dans leurs commentaires pour notre part no problème,appart très propre,superbement situé .,,,
juste une petite remarque si vous voulez faire des repas dans la cuisine,"attention ne faite pas  des choses qui provoque de la fumée ( ex: poisson ou viande )cette appart est bien pour le petit déjeune ... \"",,,,
4580825,67098011,2016-03-26,7726875,Shannon,"WAY better than a hotel! The location can't be beat. This is a clean, cozy, well-appointed two-bedroom suite in the heart of the North End. Super comfy beds, nice bathrooms, and a kitchenette stocked with everything you might need. It's a tight space, no sitting room, but we were two adults and two children on-the-go in the city 90% of the time so it was perfect for us."
Check in/out,easy. Luggage storage,easy and convenient. Dror was friendly and available to answer questions via phone or email in a timely manner. All and all,"a great experience!  \"",,

4580825,78871935,2016-06-09,10098683,Daniel,Great neighborhood and the apartment was very clean! I would definitely stay here again as Dror was an excellent host.
The organization of the rental experience and the communication by his team was a huge plus as well.,,,,,
"Thanks Dror!\"",,,,,
4580825,79404238,2016-06-12,23072872,Jenna,"Dror's apartment was an awesome location in the North End in Boston. Literally steps away from fantastic bars and restaurants in the Italian neighborhood. The apartment itself was comfortable for two couples to share- really nice beds, TVs, and two full bathrooms. Dror notes that the apartment does not have a living room within the description, which is an important detail- if you're comfortable with spending the majority of the time in a bedroom versus a common area. We were in Boston for a wedding so didn't spend too much time in the actual apartment- only to sleep/shower."
4580825,81255172,2016-06-21,9486289,Amanda,"Place was clean. Communication was sometimes overwhelming and other times incredibly poor. The key was not in the lock Box as promised, though I confirmed my reservation as instructed. There was no space for congregating. I'd definitely stay again in terms of cleanliness and comfort, but would not want to deal with the communication issues a second time."
4580825,81492877,2016-06-23,13495820,Lawrence,"Wonderful location! Dror and his staff were very friendly and accessible. I really enjoyed my experience! The apartment is in a great location with tremendous restaurants, sites, and shops around."

4580825,97240719,2016-08-26,58758017,Doug,"Dror was accessible, as was his support team.  He provided instructions in follow up emails to ensure I knew how to access the key drop box.  The place is tight (as known from other reviews), but the location can't be beat; north end is a great spot."
We stayed long enough that we asked for more towels (4 of us staying and only 4 were provided initially),and they were provided so that is good.  Place was clean and remodeled,so that was good.  Amenities are less than a hotel (which is expected),and there is construction next door,"but hotel in that area is expensive so for the value this place is great.\"",
11082235,64942876,2016-03-09,2808759,Juliette,"I stayed at Christal's beautiful apartment in my last trip to Boston. Christal's was extremely welcoming, left a very cute note for me, in addition to a delicious bottle of wine. Communication was very easy. The apartment is absolutely fantastic, in one of the nicest neighborhood in Boston. The apartment is a large 1BR, with fantastic decoration. It is beautiful and has a great personality. I would recommend the place to anyone!"
11082235,66185597,2016-03-20,57765137,Patrick,"Christal did a wonderful job of welcoming us to Boston! Her apartment is modern, chic and everything that we needed. She provided a nice clean space with everything you would need to make your stay comfortable."
11082235,66756486,2016-03-24,3848863,Regina,"Our stay at Christal's place was awesome. The apartment is incredible, beautiful furniture, designed with great taste and the best part is the location (right on Newbury St.). Christal was a very good host, attentive and nice, she received us with a bottle of wine and had prepared a booklet with reviews of nearby restaurants and sights. I would definitely come back any time :)"
11082235,68461097,2016-04-05,61885607,Anslem,"I thoroughly enjoyed staying at Christal's designer apartment on Newbury St. It was gorgeously decorated yet very comfortable. Apartment is perfectly located to restaurants, shopping and transportation. Most importantly, Christal accommodated my travel plans so that I can gain early access to her designer apartment. She was an amazing host and I look forward to being her guest in the near future."
11082235,69491118,2016-04-11,62196943,Paula,"It was a wonderful place to stay. Everything was clean, fresh and new.  The apartment is roomy, comfortable and chic decorations. The location is fabulous with just a short walk to the T.  Our host was very welcoming and accommodating for our travel schedule which helped us a lot."
11082235,70628765,2016-04-19,61015660,Kevin,"This is a very cozy, inviting place in a very quiet building centrally located in the historic Back Bay on one of Boston’s most interesting & lively streets for shopping & dining & galleries. Christal provides a binder with recommendations along the street & nearby, but you can’t go wrong just walking & checking things out for yourself. Restaurants run the gamut of types & price ranges and most places have outdoor seating. And if you prefer to take advantage of the well-appointed kitchen & eat in, there are two grocery stores- a Trader Joe’s and a local chain -basically around the corner and a Shaw’s in the Prudential Center on Boylston. Public transportation is also a short walk away at the Copley Sq. Green Line stop, but Boston is so walkable, you’ll see much more of the city on foot. I stayed for the Marathon weekend and the location is particularly good for that since Newbury parallels the final lap to the finish on Boylston St. On race day, Newbury is closed to traffic & parking and becomes the province of pedestrians. The apartment is spotless, has wi-fi, and a wide screen  TV with an extensive channel line-up & streaming services. Chrystal provided a complimentary bottle of wine and was always available to answer any questions or concerns. Great host, great place; you can’t go wrong staying here. Highly, highly recommended!"

She provided a bottle of wine, milk and orange juice as well as an nespresso machine with pods for everyday. The apartment is clean, modern and well decorated. If we came back to Boston we would stay her again."

Christal had a bottle of wine waiting for our arrival and has prepared a terrific guide book for places to eat and visit in Boston. The apartment was clean and well cared for and she goes the extra mile to put nice amenities in the bathroom and kitchen, as well as Netflix, etc. She has everything you'd need, including blow dryer, washer/dryer and nice linens. She was reachable if there were any questions almost instantaneously. Christal was easy to work with while booking and the stay itself. We couldn't have asked for a better first-time Airbnb experience. We would book this location in a heartbeat again. Thank you Christal!"

She had thought of everything, from breakfast items and a bottle of wine in the fridge to chocolates on our pillows.  Salt, pepper and condiments were available, if we had chosen to cook in the well stocked kitchen, though restaurants are so plentiful in the Back Bay that we chose to eat most of our meals out.   Everything about our stay exceeded our expectations."
13046976,77175066,2016-05-30,73659277,Carmella,Nikki's place is awesome. She got everything you needed for a vacation. Easy to reach out. You can definitely rely on her.

1327725,5834960,2013-07-18,6809251,Arezu,This was my first AirBNB experience and it was great!
The apartment is on the 3rd floor of a walk-up with outer door locks,I felt very safe there. The neighborhood was pretty quiet despite being in the heart of student living. Then again it was in the middle of summer.,,,,
The apartment is beautiful,loved the multi-colored walls and  simple decor. There's a bedroom,an office and even a little back sitting room. Big TV with Playstation 3 attached,Netflix subscription available for watching shows,even a roomba,lol.
Mikhail (the owner) was very pretty quick about responding to my questions and was always nice. He even made arrangements to get me the keys at 1 a.m. since I had a late flight into Boston.,,,,,
It was great having easy access to T (local train) and there are lots of little restaurants and convenience stores nearby. Great place to be if you need access to Boston University or Boston College,"you're kind of right between the 2 on a train line that'll take you directly to either. \"",,,,

1327725,6661436,2013-08-20,4161964,Betsy,"We did not meet Mikhail, as he was travelling when my family came to visit.  I live in Boston, just about a mile from Mikhail's apartment.  My family was visiting from Minnesota, so they stayed in Mikhail's apartment.  They really enjoyed their stay there.  The apartment is very clean and spacious, and Mikhail was very accomodating, making sure that we were easily able to access everything that we needed to, although he was not there when we were there.  I would definitely recommend Mikhail's place for future guests who come to visit me in Boston.  You will have more space and accomodations than you would at a hotel, at half the cost."

It also comes with free designated parking, which is a huge bonus in central Boston. Mikhail was travelling while we were staying, but he gave us heaps of information on how to get in etc well ahead of time, so it was not an issue. The only downside for us was that it's up four or five flights of stairs. Overall, we had a great experience and would definitely recommend it. Thanks!"

The flat is also conveniently located, close to restaurants, shops like wholefoods and near the tram. They had a great stay and would recommend staying there."
1327725,8523010,2013-11-04,6474536,Russell,"This apartment is beautiful -- absolutely pristine. The location was pretty convenient -- just 15 minutes by T from our conference at BU. The building/complex is a little rough around the edges, but that's a very minor issue. Mikhail was a great host -- he answered his phone right away when I called him when I got lost!"
1327725,8684874,2013-11-12,1019850,Dona,"We never got to meet Mikhail but he was a great communicator and took care to contact us via email to make sure everything was ok (both before and during our stay). The apartment was great and had everything we needed. The apartment was perfect for us - close to the T, close to all kinds of great food choices (and Mikhail even provided a list of his nearby favourites - much appreciated!), safe neighbourhood, a great home base for a visit to Boston. The apartment even comes with a parking space which is a real bonus in this area."
1327725,8817541,2013-11-19,9441603,Katrina,"Hi highly recommend staying at this location. The apartment is very clean, spacious and comfortable. The location is very central if you like to stay in the Washington square, Coolidge Cornor, Boston College Area. Not to mention a parking spot was a huge plus. I will definitely stay here again."
1327725,9202006,2013-12-13,378834,John,"Very good location and apartment.  Only drawback was dragging our bags up to the third floor. Otherwise, we were very pleased to be there.  Only a couple of blocks to the trolley and a good supermarket.  All easily accessible even after a few inches of snow.  Mikhail was very helpful and obliging.  We would recommend him as a host and his apartment as a place to stay in Boston."
1327725,9404837,2013-12-27,9359326,Jackie,"The Brighton apartment is clean, has a well equipped kitchen and quiet neighbors across the landing. We loved the accessibility to the trains and the close proximity to a wonderful Whole Foods grocery store. Wifi was certainly handy so we appreciate Mikhail's sharing access. Thanks again for an excellent stay in Boston."
1327725,9873139,2014-01-16,8295733,Lynley,"We loved the area this apartment was in. There's a Whole Foods Market just around the corner, as well as all the recommendations that Mikhail made (in particular The Publik House). It was fantastic to be able to cook and the parking space was a real bonus. We struggled to find good coffee, but Refuge Cafe on Brighton St was an absolute gem."
The facilities were very clean and tidy,as well as cosy and warm,"during a very cold snap.\"",,,
1327725,10194305,2014-02-05,5466540,David,"We loved Mikhail's apartment, it's perfect size and it's well equipped and close to the T. Loved the proximity to Whole Foods. We went to Boston to visit our son at Boston University and we even walked there  in the snow! we also walked to Coolidge Corner. Recommend Carlos Italian restaurant on Brighton and @Union for breakfast on Harvard Ave. Also very close to lots of bars. We liked Patron's. I highly recommend this apartment and we hope to come back soon!"

1327725,10339914,2014-02-14,11768734,Donal,"Mikhails place is great!!! Lovely apartment in a great area. Everything you could want in a apartment for a short term stay, close to shops and bars, right beside the T, tidy and comfortable with every amenity you would ever need. He is a great guy to boot. Highly recommend. You'll love it!!!"
1327725,11246319,2014-03-26,11218378,Karen,"The flat is clean, well-located, and very cosy.  We didn't meet Mikhail but he was very prompt to respond to email.  He also gave us detailed driving instructions to the flat, and to gain access to the building.  The flat is well heated -- during the period we were staying there, temperatures were below freezing, but it was always warm in the flat.  There is a great view from the master bedroom."
"Would definitely recommend Mikhail and his flat.\"",,,,,
1327725,11368462,2014-03-31,11947702,Hannah,"Mikhail was absolutely wonderful! He responded to our questions very promptly. He left very clear instructions on how to get into the apartment, what to do when we left, etc. He provided us with several phone numbers of his friends and family in case we needed to get in touch with him while we were in Boston.  The neighborhood was perfect and the apartment was quiet. Very quick access to Boston Univ. area by taking the T-- there was a stop just a couple of blocks from the apartment.  There restaurants and grocery stores within easy walking distance.  Apartment was very clean and well-stocked.  Mikhail was also nice enough to let us check out a bit late because he didn't have anyone booked for the following day."
1327725,11484336,2014-04-05,826256,Travis,"Great stay!  The apartment was clean, well kept and just as described.  The check in procedures went smoothly.  Mikhail gave very clear and accurate directions about how to check in and check out."
Before the visit - Mikhail responded quickly and informatively to my messages.  During the visit,Mikhail was very responsive to my messages and texts when I had questions.,,,,
Neighborhood was perfect.  It was just what I was looking for.  Somewhere that was a bit out of the busy main part of the city but very accessible by public transportation.  The train was a very short walking distance and there were several easy bus options.  Neighborhood itself had options for restaurants,bars,etc. as well.  Overall very pleased with my experiences there.,,,
"Thank you!\"",,,,,
1327725,11860820,2014-04-17,12455672,Christine,"Good time and great stay in Boston. Really we enjoy our stay there. The apartment is perfect ! Comfortable, clean and welcoming. Also perfect with the children. Even if we have not met Mikhail, his apartment is a place of life, refined, comfortable, warm and inhabited :-) - we felt like at home. Thanks much for this home. We recommend this address definitely."
1327725,12143347,2014-04-24,4012548,Áslaug,"Very nice flat on 2nd floor. We were 4, two adults and two teenagers, the husband running the Boston Marathon. The flat had everything we needed and was clean. Beds were conformable. The only downside is that the public transport (T) takes 35 minutes to downtown. Thank you Mikhail."
1327725,12341051,2014-04-29,511029,Rachael,"My parents stayed in Mikhail's place and had a very good stay. The place is clean, comfortable and private and is close to the green line. The parking spot was an added bonus. Getting in the room was very easy. There are lots of steps for those that have trouble, but it wasn't an issue for us. Thanks Mikhail!"
1327725,12537669,2014-05-05,12501038,Kelsey,"Host was very communicative, quick to respond, and overall seems like a very nice guy! He was eager to resolve any issues or questions that we had with the unit. The unit itself was beautiful, very clean, and in a nice neighborhood. Would definitely recommend!"
1327725,12684692,2014-05-08,12267391,Emily,This is a great condo! I live in Brighton and my family was visiting.  They couldn't all fit in my apartment so this was a great solution.  It was walking distance my my house and they could park their car which can be a pain in the Allston/Brighton area. The condo is very convenient to the T and walking distance to some great spots in Brookline. I highly recommend.  Mikhail is so easy to work with...he is very communicative.
1327725,12889830,2014-05-13,13281507,Diana,"The apartment and neighborhood were as promised. The apartment was beautiful, accessible, and centrally located to all of the locations that were of our interest. The neighborhood was quiet and friendly. I would recommend this apartment, and service, to anyone who is looking for a better experience than your usual mundane hotel room. We felt like we were at home!"

1327725,13275876,2014-05-24,7085144,Ted,"Great apartment in a fantastic neighborhood.  Plenty of room to spread out and relax.    Whole Foods is just a five minute walk away, as is the T and a number of good restaurants."
1327725,13809404,2014-06-05,8680693,Luciana,Great place to stay! Host was easy to contact and responded quickly to all questions. The listing was exactly what is in the description and pictures. The neighborhood is quiet and close to grocery stores and train lines. If you are looking for a place in the greater Boston area this apartment is a must. It was perfect for the four of us and we felt right at home.
1327725,14034342,2014-06-10,13816765,Sarah,"\"This is a GREAT place to stay. The apartment is neat, clean and well cared for. Mikhail was very responsive to emailed questions during our stay. It was easy to get in and to \"\"check out\"\" and the reserved parking spot was super convenient.\""
1327725,14503358,2014-06-21,11414881,Valentino,"In Mikhail's apartment there is everything, is very clean and in addition has a good wi-fi connection. Everything is just as described by the host, and even though I had never seen this state, everything went smooth, no problem, everything is ok"
The proximity to the metro makes this apartment a great solution to stay in Boston and surrounding areas,I highly recommend staying here.,,,,

1327725,15064031,2014-07-01,5061434,Christopher,"Very well kept, spacious apartment with easy access to the T line. Mikhail was responsive and helpful to any questions we had leading up to our visit. The apartment was also well equipped for light cooking (we made breakfasts there during our visit) and lounging during the hot afternoons after being busy tourists in the morning."
"Only complaint is that the bed was pretty uncomfortable.\"",,,,,
1327725,15259110,2014-07-06,12149413,Gordon,"Although I didn't get to meet him, Mikhail was an awesome host.  He provided us with great information on how to get to his place as well as some good places to eat while there.  He also left us with phone numbers in case we couldn't get a hold of him (which wasn't a problem because he got back to me very quickly through email.)  I was very surprised out how nice, clean and spacious the apartment was.  Thanks for making our stay here great."
1327725,15513311,2014-07-10,14061654,LiJun,"We stayed there for three days during my Boston College Visit. We are probably the only one who can't even find the apartment which is right in front of us, and we are probably the only one who's car got towed. So if you are considering staying there, it's a perfect place!!!!! And please remember to PARK IN THE RIGHT SPOT, and HANG ON THE VISITOR SIGN. Mikhal is a super nice guy!!!! He helped out a lot, and he is very patient too. If I'm going to Boston again, this will definitely be a wonderful choice. Thank you sooo much for everything you've done."
1327725,15817156,2014-07-16,1246024,Faith,Mikhail's apartment is in a great neighborhood conveniently located three blocks from a metro stop. The apartment was very clean and altogether just what we hoped for. Mikhail gave us some great restaurant recommendations.

1327725,16819889,2014-08-03,6475808,Rizky,"Mikhail was an amazing host! The apartment was very nice and clean. Location was also close to the T. There was even water in the fridge which I thought to be very thoughtful. Overall, I had a very pleasant stay at Mikhail's."
1327725,17556867,2014-08-14,13475088,Oliver,This was our second airbnb rental and we were very very impressed. The apartment which is about a twenty minutes subway ride to Copley  or Hynes for the Prudential building.
The apartment is very spacious one double bedroom with AC. A second room which is smaller though has am attached room which could be used. Includes a desk.,,,,,
The lounge has a huge HDTV with playstation (very handy for Netflix) big sofas and very powerful AC which is needed in the city. Kitchen is nice with big fridge freezer and cooking appliances.,,,,,

1327725,18978247,2014-09-04,112496,David,"Mikhail has a wonderful apartment.  Clean, lots of room, and it is well situated, walking distance to public transportation.  He communicated very well with me before, during and after my stay, providing very clear instructions.  He was also very understanding  when I managed to misplace an item from the apartment - I later retrieved it, fortunately.  Thank you Mikhail!"
1327725,19590098,2014-09-15,15945779,Candy,"Upon our arrival, I didn't put in the door code correctly and couldn't unlock the door.  I phoned Mikhail's father and was able to speak to Mikhail directly.  He told me that I left off the last symbol.  The apartment was modern and the air conditioners worked well.  I wish that we could have opened the windows."
1327725,19835082,2014-09-19,5118467,Chris & Kelly,"We had a great stay with Mikhail, so much so we have booked again already! great apartment conveniently located for the T, shops etc in a lovely area, highly recommended."

A delightful place to stay in Boston ."
1327725,24588753,2014-12-31,23026393,Mark,"This was our first time using AirBNB, so we were a bit nervous about what we would find.   Mikhail had send very complete instructions and directions when we made the reservation, and we were very pleased with what we found.   The location was perfect for us, and the apartment was well set up for our short visit - close to Whole Foods and Zipcar made it very convenient"
"Thank you Mikhail.\"",,,,,

1327725,28468030,2015-03-24,2762993,Clarice,"Mikhail's apartment was a perfect place for my husband and me to stay while in Boston for a wedding. His place comes with a designated parking spot - a very big deal in a city with extremely limited parking and proactive towing companies.  The apartment is very clean and stocked with bed and bath linens, bathing supplies, and kitchen staples."
Mikhail was easy to work with and quick to respond to inquiries.  His place is a very clean,comfortable,convenient,"and reasonably priced place to stay in the Allston /Brighton neighborhood. \"",,
1327725,28837028,2015-03-30,10943941,Jim,The apartment was beautiful and clean upon arrival. Checkin instructions were easy and seamless. Having the dedicated parking spot was a very nice luxury as well. All essentials were supplied and easily accessible and local recommendations were spot on. I will definitely check here first on my next visit to Boston!
1327725,29044937,2015-04-03,27352046,Jennifer,Mikhail was a superb host. He was very attentive and helpful. The accommodation was exactly as in the picture and in a very nice neighborhood.
1327725,29438504,2015-04-07,3615400,Maria,Our stay here was absolutely seamless! We were 3 people in town for 4 nights. Getting ourselves into the apartment was simple and instructions were very clear and easy to follow.
The neighbourhood is great,feels very safe,and many shops,restaurants,and public transit options are within walking distance. We left our car parked in the designated space all weekend as it really wasn't necessary for getting around (traffic/parking can be a pain downtown).,
We had everything we needed and then some; it was a nice touch to be able to help ourselves to coffee,there's a great collection of books,and a multitude of gaming/media/streaming options available.,,,
I didn't need to use the office desk/printer,but as someone who's on the road often for business,it's really nice to have and I something I don't normally see. And,I was silly enough to leave a jacket behind and Mikhail very kindly and promptly mailed it to me. All in all,10/10,"would stay again!\""
1327725,30489760,2015-04-23,5272356,Hallie,"\"Bright, clean, comfortable and conveniently located apartment. It was roomy, even with the second couple that unexpectedly \"\"invited\"\" themselves to join us.  The check-in and -out arrangements were great. We had a late flight out"
1327725,30987983,2015-04-30,29409841,Wendy,"We were 3 people for 6 nights. We really really really enjoyed our stay. The apartment is clean, bright and conveniently. The neighborhood is also great, quiet and feels safe. I like the arrangement of the self chick-in and-out. And there is a great and big supermarket near the apartment. We can got everything we need in the kitchen. It was very easy and conveniently cooking by ourselves. Mikhail answered all the questions quickly. Thank Mikhail let us leave our luggage and returned the key very late after the cleaner visit. Definitely recommend Mikhail's apartment; )"
1327725,31452929,2015-05-05,30183316,Jessica,"My husband and I had a great time visiting Boston, and a lot of the credit goes towards where we stayed. Mikhail's apartment was clean, nice, safe, and in a good part of town. An easy 5 minute walk to the green line, restaurants and convenience stores. A 5-10 min drive to Fenway, and a 15-20 minute drive to Boston Commons. The reserved parking space was also a killer deal! Mikhail was very easy to talk to. He responded quickly to any questions we had and was very polite and helpful. This was my first time visiting Boston, as well as using Airbnb, and I have to admit, I was a little nervous about staying in a strangers apartment in a town I've never been to; but this was a great experience! All the great reviews regarding Mikhail are true. If we decide to visit Boston again in the future, I will look into staying here again!"
1327725,32058615,2015-05-13,22241596,Chengyi,"My parents and I had a good time staying in Mikhail's apartment. It's a clean, spacious, comfortable place the self check in and out process is convenient. Mikhail is very nice. He responded questions quickly and was willing to help with any problem. Love this place and highly recommend it."
1327725,32737847,2015-05-21,22114656,Bob,"The apartment was exactly as pictured, very accommodating and extremely clean. There were no surprises."
1327725,33356610,2015-05-27,19379257,Eirikur,The apartment is very good and located in a nice quiet area. Mikhail's description of his place is very accurate.
1327725,33768790,2015-06-01,26737008,Katherine,The apartment was very nice and Mikhail was responsive and quick to let us know updates and details. Everything went smoothly and the apartment was even more clean and spacious than described. The parking space is also very valuable in the crazy city of Boston--great perk.
1327725,34119113,2015-06-05,15930626,Runa,We really enjoyed our stay and Mikhail was quick with his answers to any of our questions.
It's a clean,nice and conveniently located apartment,a short walk to the Green line and a nearby Whole Foods Market.,,,
"Our taxi was running late so Mikhails' father went the extra mile and drove us to the airport (thanks alot!). \"",,,,,
1327725,34466537,2015-06-08,32778633,Claire,"Mikhail's condo was very welcoming.  I felt very comfortable and at home. It looked exactly as it did on the web page.  The location was great. There was a Whole Foods a few blocks away, as well as many restaurants and local bars.  Having a parking space was a nice perk."
1327725,34932134,2015-06-14,9434246,David,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Boston and found Mikhail's apartment excellent.
1327725,35412930,2015-06-18,8784877,Spencer,It was my first visit to Boston and Mikhail's apartment was a great mix between affordability and proximity to the city.
The neighborhood is home to many restaurants,bars,and shops. Whole Foods is just down the street which makes shopping for groceries easy. Note that the Whole Foods doesn't sell alcohol so if you want to buy beer or wine you'll need to go to the liquor store which is a few short blocks from the apartment. There is also a transit train nearby that will take you straight into downtown Boston.,,,
The apartment is spacious,colorful,and reasonably clean. It has a sort of grad student feel to it but we quickly felt at home. It has air conditioning which was a blessing and it comes with a dedicated parking spot,which is hard to beat in the city.,,
Since this unit is in an apartment/condo complex,you may hear sounds from neighbors or people wandering home late from the nearby bars. We found it pretty few and far between but it's something to keep in mind.,,,,
"Overall we had a good experience. We never met Mikhail but he was quick to resolve the one issue we had. I'd recommend this place to younger people who want to stay in an area of town that has some life to it but don't want to pay the crazy prices in downtown Boston. \"",,,,,
1327725,35806239,2015-06-22,22304773,Ramona,"The apartment was light filled and very clean!  I was disappointed there was no printer available (Mikhail indicated that it had recently broken and he had not had a chance to replace it yet).  Other than that everything was as stated in the listing.  The apartment was located close to the B Branch of the Greenline train. I suggest when going into Boston, you go to the Warren Street Station and when you return you get off at the Washington Street Station (that way you're going downhill both times!)"
1327725,36759303,2015-07-01,4721414,Peter,"Had a fantastic stay with Mikhail in his apartment. Everything you need for a comfortable stay is provided, and everything else is within easy reach. There is plenty of room to sleep up to four in comfort. The building is secure and the apartment is on the 3rd floor of the building so be prepared for some stairs. The parking is directly out the front which was absolutely perfect.  The area is quiet but you might hear the occasional sound from neighbours especially out the front of the building. The B green line of the T light rail is a few minutes away which will get you directly into downtown. Mikhail's instructions were excellent and covered pretty much everything."
1327725,37285529,2015-07-06,25683835,Emily,"Self check in process, so no direct interaction with the host. However, his instructions were very easy to follow and he gave good recommendations for places to visit in the area. He also provided several contact numbers in case we needed any assistance."
The place was accurately described and as depicted in pictures. It was clean and had all necessities upon our arrival. The air conditioning was a plus as it was hot and humid during our stay and had children with us.,,,,,
The apartment is well located with only a short walk to major streets such a Harvard and Beacon as well as being only minutes away from the T line (train/subway) which made it very easy to navigate the city.,,,,,
"We all enjoyed our stay here and it fulfilled all our needs for a comfortable stay in Boston.\"",,,,,
1327725,37685943,2015-07-09,36306097,Joseph,"\"Staying at Mikhail's apartment was the perfect choice for our family visit to Boston with our teenage children. The apartment was spacious and clean and the neighborhood was safe. We took full advantage of the reserved parking spot out front and used the \"\"T\"\" for all our downtown excursions. We would highly recommend this apartment for those travelers who like to explore a new city on their own terms. \""
1327725,38104471,2015-07-13,27058287,Shannon,"Excellent experience!  My parents were visiting and we opted for AirBnB instead of a costly hotel.  Mikhail's place is conveniently located to us and the T.  And, it was more than we expected.  When we arrived, there were T passes on the counter for them (what a nice touch!), the A/C was already on, and the apartment itself was very comfortable and roomy.  Mikhail did a great job.  He has a lock box at the front door to access the building so we didn't even need to arrange to meet in person, though he was super responsive to emails when we had questions, still providing a personal touch.  I highly recommend his apartment."
1327725,38538427,2015-07-16,393965,Tim,"Mikhail's place was a dream! My friends and I all agreed that it was like staying at home. The location was wonderful (and near a lot of great bars and restaurants) and a short walk to the train to get to downtown Boston. Mikhail was also very helpful. The place itself was clean and comfortable. I would definitely love to stay at the apartment again next time in Boston, which thanks in part to Mikhail's place, may actually be sooner than I'd have ever imagined. Thanks so much!"
1327725,39004634,2015-07-20,1224142,Anneliet,"We had a great stay in Boston and in this appartment. As we had a rental car this was no problem thanks to the parking place he has with his house. What made it even more easy was that the tram that brings you  downtown is very close to his house. The appartement itself was wonderful as well. Thank gooodness for the airco! Great beds, lovely shower. If you are planning to stay for a few days, Mikhail's place is perfect. However we did not meet each other, he was a great host! I will certainly recommend his place to friends."
1327725,39479491,2015-07-24,13463579,Sarah,My parents stayed here while visiting Boston and they loved the apartment! Everything was as described and very clean. The area was very quiet and accessible by T. There was never a time when my parents even needed to use their car as they were exploring all of Boston. The free parking spot was incredibly convenient as well! Would very highly recommend!!
1327725,40092142,2015-07-28,13255308,Susan,It is good to have parking space right outside the apartment. Many good restaurants all close by and tram into downtown Boston is only a few mins walk.

Directions to the flat described well,although it takes a little thought,after a long flight,to get your head around it.,,
Host is quick to respond and was adaptive to our request to check out later.,,,,,
Enjoyable 4 mile run possible down to and around Chestnut Reservoir.,,,,,

The kitchen kept us from eating out every meal and we just had a really great overall experience. Def planning to stay here again if we ever end up back in Boston.

The apartment was spacious, located right next to a T stop and the neighbourhood is relatively quiet. Mikhail was kind and helpful and we throughly enjoyed our stay. The only downside is that without a car it takes about 40 minutes to get to downtown Boston via public transit, although it is very straight forward and easily accessible. Regardless, I would highly recommend staying here!"

The apartment itself is lovely: comfortable,very clean and outfitted with almost everything one may need. In terms of location,while it's not too close to the main Boston sights,it's a few minutes walk from a T stop which can connect you to most places. The area itself felt safe and very accessible.,,

Place was clean and had a cool modern look. Cozy and the heater kept the place quite comfortable. Great location for visiting the nearby universities and Boston by car. The lock on the building's front door is a bit tricky; takes some work to find the sweet spot to get the key to turn. Other than that, great experience, great place. Would book again."

He gave great suggestions of the local eating places and things to do when we told him why were interesting in Boston. His dad helped us out too! Thanks again, Mikhail!"
1327725,74446107,2016-05-15,55702700,Elena,"Thank you for sharing the apartment, it has all that any guest needs and it was comfortable and  as described in the listing. It was in a perfect location for us and between walking distance to Allston/BU/Brookline etc and a couple minutes walk to the T. Thank you, we had a great time."
1327725,75156584,2016-05-19,64510375,Yip,The condo is luxury and clean. There is a free parking space right under the building which saved us a lot of cost in Boston. Mikhail and his dad is very helpful and help us to solve the problem at anytime even they are busy. My mom and me had a very enjoyable stay in the condo.
1327725,76586903,2016-05-28,34780001,Lucas,"Well located, nicely equipped apartment to stay in Boston. Host was also super flexible with checkout time.  Would definitely stay again."

1327725,80759930,2016-06-19,34593255,Deborah,Mikhail's place was expertly prepared for our visit.  We lacked for nothing.  We had only to buy food and we were able to prepare everything.  He has everything laid out perfectly for your enjoyment.  It is a wonderful neighborhood with everything you need in walking distance.  We tried his favorite pub - The Publick and it was excellent!  We were 2 buildings down from my daughter's apartment and it couldn't have been closer.  I recommend staying here for anyone visiting Boston.  The T is just a short distance and we never even needed to Uber anywhere.  Thank you for allowing us to have a great visit.  I will come back and stay here again.
1327725,81867959,2016-06-25,71537432,Jenia,"The place was as described, very convenient neat Green B line T-stop (comes every 5 min) and walking distance from Whole Foods supermarket. Perfect space for a family of 4, with a large fridge and cooking utensils available. Nice to have a parking spot to leave the car while exploring Boston downtown! Mikhail is very easy to communicate with - responds to messages in a few seconds. Top floor of the building (no elevator, so you'll need to carry luggage up) front door took some time to open - the trick is to first turn the key clockwise and then counterclockwise to open (once you figure out the sequence it's not hard) . Everything was very clean, enough towels, soap, linen. Beds were comfortable. Highly recommend!"
1327725,82912472,2016-06-30,76764272,Cleis,"The apartment was in a great location, I walked to the gym, and the kids walked to get frozen yogurt and shopping.  Having 3 sleeping areas was great, 4 of us had plenty of room. The AC unit is in the livingroom,  but there was a fan we used to circulate it through the rest of the apartment, and the bedroom had a ceiling fan that made it comfortable to sleep. The check in and out process was very easy, and Mikhail was very available via text."
1327725,85234225,2016-07-10,66787002,Sean,"Mikhail had everything we needed and then some in the nice Brighton Apt. The key was tricky to open the door with (turn to the right then pull key toward you slightly and turn left). There was a crying baby that woke us up nearly every morning but that's not his fault. Also it is kinda hot in July with the 1 window AC unit. All in all it was well worth it, thanks Mikhail!"
1327725,86292609,2016-07-15,57901580,Corina,"Der Gastgeber hat sich vorher noch einmal gemeldet. Der Schlüssel war da zu finden, wo er sein sollte. Sehr toll war der Parkplatz am Haus. Die Wohnung ist sehr groß und super ausgestattet."

1327725,89529829,2016-07-29,24076266,Gabriel,Foi uma estadia muito boa e tranquila. A casa não é tão perto do centro mas considero bem localizada. O ponto negativo é que ela tem apenas um ar condicionado na sala e os quartos ficam extremamente quentes.
1327725,90869016,2016-08-02,4421771,Jennifer,"Mikhail was easy to communicate with, and check-in/check-out were easy. We were a bit surprised to find two mattresses on the floor of the living room, but they were probably placed there because the AC was only in the living room. The apartment met all of our basic needs, and it is easy to catch the B line."
1327725,91703425,2016-08-06,21548846,Esther,Nice apartment and well equipped.

1327725,92487161,2016-08-08,59183979,Michael,"Nice apartment.  Well equipped and was as advertised.  It was really warm and humid in Boston during our stay, so the large fan helped move the cool air from the living room to the back of the apartment.  Close proximity to train (B line) and Fresh Market nearby was especially helpful.  Travelers tip if you are taking the train... When departing leave from the Warren St. stop (downhill walk from apt) and when returning get off at the Washington St. stop (easier walk to the apt)."
1327725,93114172,2016-08-11,42323431,Patty,"Mikhail is an Airbnb pro, and we LOVED staying at his place. Cool, comfortable, clean, modern, spacious - what's not to love? The location may be a bit far out for those who want to be in the heart of the city (about a 30-minute train ride downtown) but it was quiet and perfect for us. And there is plenty going on in the Coolidge Corner and BU neighborhoods, both nearby. Mikhail also recommends places to hit in the neighborhood. My only suggestions would be to set out towels for guest use (I found some and hope they were OK to use"
1327725,94258487,2016-08-15,8245480,Michelle,"Apartment was great. Big, roomy and even with one air conditioner it was comfortable sleeping at night. Directions getting into the apartment were fool-proof and the parking spot was a huge draw for booking the apartment in the first place. Would absolutely recommend!"
1327725,96756741,2016-08-24,32595548,Dean,"While we did not talk with Mikhail in person, everything was as it was supposed to be.  A great place to stay while we were installing our daughter at Boston College."
217498,676690,2011-10-30,1313682,Susan,What a fabulous residence!
Deepti and her husband Michael were such gracious hosts,"my friend and I were not only impressed with the accommodation but  also delighted to meet this wonderful couple. We spent a weekend in their lovely basement and everything is as you see in the pictures--if not more so. The \"\"basement\"\" itself was spacious",with half windows on top so it wasn't as stuffy and dark as some basements might be. The lounge,bath,and bedroom were all spotless and well-decorated and well-lit. We had the whole floor to ourselves and really had no complaints. A really great option if you don't mind being a little way's away from BU/BC/Harvard/MIT... easy access to public transportation indeed,as stated in the description.
We took the liberty of using the private entrance a few times and helped ourselves to extra pillows and blankets they so generously offered. Deepti and her husband also gave us the option of using their washer/drier as well. That plus the free cup of coffee in the morning and this has definitely been one of my BEST experiences on Airbnb. Thanks,"Deepti and Michael!\"",,,,
217498,723223,2011-11-15,1362546,Claudia,"We had a wonderful time in Boston and staying at Deepti's and Mike's was great.   The room is exactly as pictured and the place is clean and comfortable.   They were both great hosts, even had tourist guide books that we could use and review.  The place is not as far from Downtown as it may seem, because the bus and train system are very convenient.  We took a bus line from the place which connected us easily to many areas in town.  We recommend them as hosts and would easily comeback and stay for another boston trip.  Thanks for hosting!"
217498,1046043,2012-03-26,1623274,Samantha,"Deepti and her husband were incredibly hospitable. We had the bedroom and bathroom in the basement, as well as a door that we could come in and go from.  Close to bus and train transportation, nice and safe area. Great stay!"

Coffee was available in the morning as was a parking place.,,,,,
Plenty of brochures to organize the visits.,,,,,
Not a lot of natural light (1st floor) but it hasn't been a problem at all as we were out all day.,,,,,
Not in  Boston but there's a bus nearby and a metro station not too far.,,,,,
Deepti and Michael were very very helful,in too many ways to be described here,"they are very nice and charming people and it has been a real treat to meet them.\"",,,
217498,1206205,2012-04-30,1491287,Akanksha,I was visiting Boston with a friend of mine for just the weekend.
Deepti's place is fantastic with a lot of space. It feels like home with all the amenities which includes a very big TV and the morning cup of coffee! She has a lot of maps and brochures of things to do in Boston.,,,,,
However,since we were in Boston only for the weekend...the location seemed like a bit of a disadvantage. It is closer to Harvard Square but you are far from all the fun part in downtown. The warren street station is easily a 10-15minute walk. And the only night we took the train - it was not running all the way to warren street (URL HIDDEN) we ended up taking a taxi.,,,,
"That being said...the place is fantastic. And if you are in the city for a longer period of time and need a place to call home - this is the ideal option. \"",,,,,

While the nearest subway stop is a little far (~10min walk to Commonwealth Ave),there's a bus stop right outside their house.  I was able to get to harvard square in about 30 min from the bus stop Sunday morning.  It's ok during the day,but you might do a little more walking during the weekend nights when buses don't come as regularly. Nevertheless,"I would stay here again when visiting Boston.\"",,

First i have to say that there is a lot of space,you have your private floor and they provide shampoo and soup so you don´t have to take care of those things (which is very kind and convenient).,,,,
"BUT there were a few strange things: you have to go through a very cluttered and dirty room to get to the private room. I don´t understand why they leave this place so cruddy...moreover the fridge in our room was full of mold. \"",,,,,

217498,2346238,2012-09-19,3329528,Silke&Armin,"We've stayed at Deepti's and Michael's appartement for 3 nights and it was inside like pictured: Clean+spacious, comfortable (with an very huge screen-TV) and established very tastefully. Having a private parking place was very convient for us. The best of all: We could prepare our „first morning coffee“ - all things needed for this were provided, great! Restaurants and pubs were nearby, only a few minutes walk along the street."
Deepti was very friendly and helpful concerning all questions we had about our stay. Although we didn't seen our hosts very often,Deepti was reachable for us by phone every time,when we needed her. The private entrance was useful,"just a little thing about that: It could be better illuminated from the outside and little more neater. But we will really recommend this place for your Boston trip.\"",,

217498,2556143,2012-10-09,2812253,Ethan,"This place was a steal!  After looking at hotels in the area that were running over $200 a night, we found Deepti and Michael's place and thought it might be too good to be true.  It was everything we hoped it was!"
We had our 7 month old baby and were really looking for a place with a little bit of room.  It turned out to be perfect.,,,,,
We had our own private space in the basement that is furnished very nicely with amazing leather coaches and a huge TV.  The bathroom is a good size and has a large shower.  The living area is big with pleeenty of room. The bedroom is a little tight,but there is enough room for a full bed,good sized closet,and small dresser/shoe container.,,
Also,there is a separate entrance to the basement,which really made it easy to come and go.,,,
"The \"\"T\"\" (subway) is about a 10-12 minute walk from their place which is not bad in Boston.  It's on the Green Line",which will take you to downtown in about 20 minutes.,,,,
Best of all,Deepti and Michael were very sweet and understanding of our situation (having a 7mo old baby).   Our baby was a little fussy one night and woke up several times crying,but after apologizing to them,they were quick to tell us that we were their guests and it did not bother them one bit.,,
We would definitely recommend Deepti and Michael's place and we might even come back and stay one day!,,,,,

The space is clean, beautifully decorated and conveniently located. The tea kettle and mini fridge were also very thoughtful touches! We had a fantastic stay!"

217498,3848705,2013-03-20,4596156,Cristina,"WOW!!! This was my first experience with Airbnb and could not be any better. Deepti is the best host; she is kind, attentions and very accommodating. Her house is very well located and easy to find transportation. I was traveling for business and had all I need; the apartment is big, comfortable, very well decorated and has all the amenities and conveniences. The bedroom is wonderful; I had deep nights of sleep. I really appreciate the cleanness and the uncluttered look. Deepti decorated the place with great taste and keeps it so clean and cozy. The TV, frige, keetle, lamps, etc everything works perfectly. I travel constantly and have stayed on many hotels with several stars, Deepti makes all of them look bad. I will definitely come back to her place and next time it will be for vacation and bring my husband with me. Thank you very much Deepti, you made my long trip much better."
217498,4096566,2013-04-09,5316757,Nisha,"My husband and I stayed at Deepti's for a weekend.  This was our first Airbnb experience and we both agreed that we would definitely do it again.  The place was spectacular and very spacious.  She came down to meet us the first morning we were there, and made sure we were comfortable.  We would highly recommend this location!"
217498,4193690,2013-04-17,411752,Bob,There were absolutely no surprises but good ones in my stay with Deepti and her husband Michael.
The accommodations are accurately represented in the listing.  They were friendly and helpful from our first correspondence until the end of my stay.  And I just loved the place.  It felt like home and they felt like friends.  Whoever complained about the entrance has never lived in a real house,as far as I can tell.  It is a back door basement entrance area were lawn and garden gear is stored and is in no way off putting. A miniscule gauntlet to a beautiful apartment.,,,,
I was there for the tragic Boston race and both Deepti and I were running in it.  The period after the race was filled with confusion and it was difficult to manage a way back to their place with much of the public transit shut down. I finally did manage to find a bus line running and while waiting for a bus got a call from Deepti who had finally managed to get home herself.  She offered to come and pick me up.  I declined but was so grateful for the thoughtfulness and concern.,,,,,
These are quality people and this is a quality place to stay.  I will be staying with them anytime I am in the Boston area and their place is available.,,,,,
Thank you Deepti and Michael.,,,,,

217498,4540332,2013-05-11,5806554,Carol,Once you get over the entry to the room you will find the area quiet comfortable.

Hosts Deepti and Michael are engaging and helpful. They are available if required but leave you to your own space.,,,,,

They were very helpful with our arrival and negotiating off street parking. We highly recommend Deepti's Private Bedroom, Bath and Lounge and can't wait until we can return."
217498,4787731,2013-05-26,5815503,Verena,"We spent a great time at Deepti's place. The apartment is really big, clean and comfortable. Don't forget that it is at the basement though you won't find big windows (but, because of that, it's really dark and quiet at night :-)). Deepti was always reachable and very friendly and helpfull every time we needed her. She had prepared a list of tips for restaurants and cafés in the neighbourhood and also handed out some information about Boston (map, monthly magazine with events etc.) to us. We could leave our car on the property - an important plus in that area! We definitely recommend this apartment!"
217498,4852362,2013-05-28,6523902,Nicole,"My partner and I stayed in Boston over the long Memorial Day weekend and decided to use Airbnb for the first time when finding accommodations for our stay in the city.  Deepti's place fit the bill and we had a splendid time staying there.  Deepti was very communicative with us prior to the stay and everything ran smoothly in terms of finding the place and gaining access.  This is a great place to stay if you have a car (we rented one) as there is a place to park behind the building so one doesn't have to worry about parking on the street.  Deepti and her husband were the perfect Airbnb hosts - I feel like I had the best first experience with the service.  They provided Boston maps, guidebooks and offered their personal recommendations for places to stop by in their neighborhood.  Definitely stay here if you are looking for an affordable and private place to stay close to the city."
217498,5869586,2013-07-20,7157711,Kristen,"Deepti and Michael were wonderful.  This was my first experience with Airbnb and I couldn't have been more pleased.  The space is perfect for 2 people.  It's comfortable and spacious with a private entrance and free parking.    Both Deepti and Michael were very friendly and communicative before and during the visit.  I'm glad we got to meet Deepti before we headed out to Cape Cod.  If we're ever out in Boston again, we'll be staying here."
217498,5966224,2013-07-24,6657239,Robert,"This space was exactly what we needed, immaculately clean, very tastefully decorated and immediately felt comfortable and inviting.  The property is on a very convenient bus line (#57) that comes frequently (though you cannot hear the slightest whisper from the bus once you step inside) and a straight and easy 6 minute walk to the streetcar/subway (Green Line B)."
Deepti was excellent to work with.  She was quick and clear with communications.  She answered questions almost as soon as I emailed about them.  The check in/out process was easy and intuitive.,,,,,
My only regret is that we never got to meet her; she was home when we were not and vice versa.  That said,"I have confidence that she is as dynamite in person as she is via email.  Thanks Deepti!\"",,,,
217498,6065616,2013-07-29,5256873,Stephanie,"Deepti and Michael were the most wonderful hosts and this was the PERFECT place to stay in Boston!  The condo is exactly as pictured and very clean and spacious with plenty of privacy and all the amenities we needed - and more!  We felt right at home and very comfortable.  We also found it very convenient - it was easy to get on the T at the nearby train stop to travel around the city when we needed to, and we loved the nearby cafes and restaurants, too!  I would especially recommend Dash Cafe and Mandy & Joe's Delicatessen right around the corner.  Thanks to Deepti and Michael our trip to Boston was one of my favorite vacations ever :)"

You're the best!"
217498,6271633,2013-08-06,5862420,Liam,"We stayed for five nights with Deepti and Michael. In organising our trip, they were very helpful and got back to us very quickly when questions were asked. Although the bedroom is quite small, the lounge area is very large and comfortable which more than makes up for the small bedroom. The house is conveniently placed close in a very nice neighbourhood with a bus to downtown Boston outside the door. Overall we had a very enjoyable experience here and would highly recommend it."
217498,6379182,2013-08-10,1470453,Maggie,Really clean and nicely furnished. An inviting place to stay. Hosts were very accommodative and very nice. Would definitely recommend and stay again!

The room was very beautiful and clean creating an excellent experience. Would definitely recommend to anyone needing a place to stay.
217498,6892273,2013-08-29,2548631,Jennifer,"We had a great experience with Deepi and Michael. Upon arrival we were provided with the access code to enter the apartment. Once we got settled Deepi introduced herself and gave us a bottle of wine, which was very kind!  The living space is very large. It has a television with local channels and guide on the tv. The bed room is comfortable. The off street parking is an appealing feature of this air bnb listing. However it is a very tight fit around the other cars. I had rented a mini van for this trip to move my daughter, and needed to fold my side mirrors in to fit into the spot. But it was off the street which I was thankful for with a car full of personal items.  Getting into the main part of Boston is about 25 minutes by bus, which is easy to catch right across the street from Deepi's place. Deepi also provides a Charlie card for use durin the stay which can be refilled at any T-station. We spent a lot of time in Boston and Cambridge and came back late some evenings, and we felt very safe. The location is right across from a hospital, but there is not any noise to disturb sleep because the apartment is at the rear of the building.   We had a very nice stay at Deepi and Michael's. Thank you for your generosity."

The space is exactly as pictured, it was a welcome refuge amongst the craziness of a college move weekend with our daughter. We enjoyed meeting Deepti and Michael, they seem to have thought of everything to make staying there easy, comfortable and lovely. Deepti was prompt and clear in communicating before and during our stay. The neighborhood felt safe, and the parking space was so helpful. We know two other families with students that have moved to Boston, we have already recommended they stay here when they visit. We look forward to our next visit to Boston and to staying here again!

We stayed there 2 weeks, while I was doing my rotation at Boston Medical Center. Deepti was so nice to provide us also some dishes for our longer stay. The basement appartment has an own entrance and although there are stairs from basement to the kitchen/living area of Deepti/ Micheal we never felt disturbed! Both of them made efforts not to disturb us, which I appreciate so much. They are very respectful to privacy and never would come down to use their own washing machine ( which is also there) without asking or giving a short message."

The living area is quite large, the bathroom had the essentials and the bedroom was cozy. I think this would be a nice place to stay during the warmer months as it is a basement apartment. We were cold in the bathroom and main living space, but the bedroom held the heat nicely. One feature that we found odd is that there was not a door at the top of the basement stairs, making the apartment feel like it was not quite a private space. The hosts were kind and helpful people. It is very easy to hail a cab outside, or grab a bus. Also some decent restaurants nearby was a plus."

Michael and Deepti were welcoming and friendly hosts and the space clean and tastefully decorated.  We visited during the never-ending Boston winter (spring by the calendar) which made the main room cold.  Our hosts inquired about our comfort on the first day and made every effort to make us warm (from a space heater to fluffy throws).  The addition of an electric tea pot, coffee pot, small refrigerator, and a warm and comfy bedroom enhanced the experience.  A small microwave to reheat the leftovers from our restaurant meals would have been welcome."

217498,30616793,2015-04-25,13460731,Gary,Very clean and comfortable.  Spacious living room. We took the Boston transit back and forth so it was easily accessible.  The sofas and chairs were relaxing and pleasant.  Excellent communication with Deepti and Michael.

"Very good and nice people\"",,,,,
217498,32174685,2015-05-15,12284826,Sylvia,Deepti and Michael's place is very spacious. The great part is that the place has a private entrance.
217498,32447355,2015-05-18,25303954,Rose Marie,"I had a very nice stay.  The place is very clean, well situated and the bed is very comfortable.  Added benefit is that there is a coffee maker provided.  Worked very well during BU graduation weekend."
217498,33065246,2015-05-25,26271876,Aidan,This was a fantastic place in a lovely neighbourhood and exactly everything that I'd hoped for.  Would have no problem staying there again when I return to Boston!
217498,33776718,2015-06-01,28495596,Sue,This was our first Airbnb and what a great experience. We are a retired couple and found the place to be nicely kept and an excellent location for our Boston vacation.  We were within walking distance to public transportation and restaurants.
217498,34279864,2015-06-07,28763581,John,"Deepti & Michael's home is great stay! Very convenient location to the T and to an assortment of cafe's, bars and more. The City of Boston is great, and finding a place to stay like Deepti & Michael's makes the trip that much better!"
217498,34851020,2015-06-13,1723002,Joseph,The home was a great stay!  Everything was super clean and there were lots of little personal touches everywhere.  There is a private access so you don't have to walk through Michael and Deepti's space when you are coming or going.  Easy access to the bus and subway.  Downtown was about 30 or so minutes away with transport running frequently.
"Michael and Deepti were super responsive and helpful with everything.  They made sure we had everything we needed and that we were comfortable during our stay.  100% would stay again!\"",,,,,
217498,35912652,2015-06-23,14802282,Katie,"The listing was very accurate, the room/space was very clean and welcoming. We loved having the separate entrance and some space to relax/watch tv after a day of wandering through Boston. We were fine with the location (Brighton vs. central Boston) since we wanted to be close to family, and we have no problem taking public transportation. My only concern during the trip was that since we could hear them (in their upstairs apt), they could hear us. So I felt like we needed to be super quiet. Not sure if this was a problem for our hosts. We tried to keep the noise level down. Thanks again for allowing us to stay, we thought it was great!"
217498,37831027,2015-07-11,27242604,Brent,It was exactly as described. They gave great directions to get in the place. Clean place. Comfortable.
217498,38434222,2015-07-15,37133202,Floyd,"accommodated my late arrival,Comfortable living arrangement, close to medical area,would highly recommend"
217498,38982440,2015-07-20,12663270,Sylvie,"Le logement était tel que décrit, très propre et spacieux. La proximité des transports en commun et l'entrée individuelle est un avantage très apprécié. Nos hôtes nous ont donnés toutes les informations que nous avions besoin avant notre arrivée."
217498,39596740,2015-07-25,26180949,Amanda,This was our first experience using airbnb. The property was just as Deepti and Mike described.
It was very clean and very comfortable and it made our stay much more enjoyable. We stayed here to see Boston and go to Fenway,"their place is in an easy location for these things and easy to use/get to the public transportation. I would definitely stay again and recommend it to anyone. Thanks again for making our stay easy and enjoyable.\"",,,,
217498,40195784,2015-07-29,5849231,Ben,As advertised the place is about 20-30 minutes by T to downtown Boston so if you're looking for it on your doorstep you should consider some place closer than Brighton.
Deepti and Michael let us check in early after our red eye with was very very much appreciated and even had a bottle of wine waiting for us for my birthday occasion.,,,,,
We discovered a delicious Greek restaurant (Esperia Grill) along with several other places that they had left as recommendations for local dining.,,,,,
Our reservation was for three nights and with a bit of unforeseen weather finding us we had asked to use the laundry (located in the suite) and they declined.  In their manual they say that it can be made available for 'long term' guests,so this should probably be something to ask beforehand if its something you need.,,,,
Also,as this is a basement suite,if you are sensitive to noise levels it may not be ideal.  The very young child upstairs could be plainly heard running and yelling early in the mornings.,,,
"Deepti and Michael were very communicative and we felt welcome. Thank you for hosting us and good fortune!\"",,,,,
217498,41059761,2015-08-04,20903946,Matthew,Deepti and Michael's place was exactly as pictured and very spacious and comfortable. We had a very enjoyable stay and although it is not in the centre of Boston the metro and bus are both close by with easy access into the city. The place was very clean and tidy and had everything we needed for our stay. As some previous reviews have mentioned you can hear some noise from the hosts flat above but this wasn't too much of an issue as we were up and about early.
217498,41577652,2015-08-08,28918250,David,"\"Deepti and Michael were great hosts and were easy to communicate with.  They provided several recomendations for local restaurants and were available if we had any questions or concerns.  Other than on our arrival we had no other contact with either of them.  The apartment space is well and accurately depicted in the pictures.  It is tastefully decorated comfortable.  It was spacious for my wife and I.  It was very clean and well lit.  While the neighborhood is approximately a 20 minute drive to downtown Boston it was a nice neighborhood to walk in and felt very safe (there is a police station two blocks away).  We walked to Porter Belly's, an Irish pub, a short distance away for some fantastic shepherds pie.  We used Uber to get downtown which cost $15.  While you could occasionally hear Deepti, Michael and their baby upstairs it was very quiet and both my wife and I slept very well.  The furniture was very comfortable and the TV was over 50\"\".  Overall a fantastic value and we would stay there again.\""
217498,42323578,2015-08-12,39768489,Ashley,"Deepti and Michael's space was so well appointed, with extra toiletries and lots of space to relax. It was almost like we got our own apartment! Everything was comfortable and it was so easy to access the space. Thanks a lot for a great first AirBnB experience."
217498,43507761,2015-08-20,10939027,Morgan,"L'endroit est sympa et pas si loin du centre-ville en métro. Le premier soir, nous voulions manger à l'appartement et nous avons vraiment eu l'impression de déranger en demandant des assiettes et des couverts. Les deux parties de la maison ne communicant pas, nous n'avons pas revu nos hôtes pendant notre séjour et nous n'avons pas pu échanger sur la ville..."
217498,44095028,2015-08-24,6273671,Alexandra,"Deepti and Michael have a very comfortable space. Perfect location if you aren't looking to be directly downtown. The bus station is just across the street and the subway stop not far away. They recommended many restaurants within walking distance and left out anything we could need (toiletries, an umbrella etc.). Sound travels very easily from the upstairs apartment so if you are a light sleeper I wouldn't recommend staying here. Other than that it's a great apartment."
217498,45921521,2015-09-07,28582229,Jennifer,"The space was wonderful! Deepti & Michael were very easy to work with and provided a wonderful experience all around. Unfortunately we never had the chance to meet face to face but they made sure we checked in safely. Highly recommend this place! Private bedroom and a nice common area to hang out and watch tv. I'm also obsessed with their shower. Water pressure heaven!! It's the little things, right?"
217498,47969377,2015-09-22,35835179,Julie,Yes all was as described. Everything was as shown in the picture. Deepti and Michael were always readily available.
217498,48694739,2015-09-28,2039432,Jeff,"The space is much bigger than the pictures show.  We had lots of room to move around and were quite comfortable.  Deepti pointed out a couple nice local restaurants (loved DASH for breakfast).  A few people have noted the noise from upstairs.  While we did hear some, it was not intrusive and didn't bother us at all.  The location is right on the bus line and only a couple blocks from the Warren Street T.  Riding the T with a car full of BC and BU students was interesting and educational!"
217498,49770050,2015-10-06,31396084,Abbie,"Our overall stay was great and we felt right at home. The space was exactly as described. Deepti stayed in contact with us leading up to our stay and was very willing to answer our questions. She also provided us with several restaurant and cafe suggestions that were within walking distance. I will point out that if you're a light sleeper or sensitive to certain room-temperatures, you will want to bring earplugs and a bedside fan like we did. It was really convenient that Deepti and Michael had an off-street parking spot available to us during our stay. We would definitely recommend this space."
217498,50435466,2015-10-12,37082572,Sarah,"This place was perfect for our weekend getaway! It was extremely clean and had everything we needed. Michael and Deepti were very thoughtful in leaving lots of info regarding things to do and places to eat in Boston and were right upstairs if we had any questions. They were also very accommodating in letting us come a little early on our check in day and leaving our car there on our check out day so that we could squeeze in everything we wanted to do in the city. If we ever find ourselves back in the Boston area, we would not hesitate to stay here again!"
217498,51354769,2015-10-19,3957345,Lisa,"\"I was so lucky to find Deepti and Michael's place for a last minute trip to Boston for the Head of the Charles Regatta. The separate entry made check-in and coming and going a breeze, and Deepti was very timely with communication before my stay. The space was exactly as pictured -- clean, cozy, and more amenities than your average hotel room. Their place in Brighton was a 30ish minute walk to the launch site in Herter Park, and very convenient to bus lines. It usually took me about 30-40 minutes to meet up with friends in Harvard Square or Back Bay by bus, or 15 minutes and $7-18 via Uber (It's also about .5 mi to the T's Green Line, which is often very crowded.) I felt totally safe walking to/from the bus stops through Brighton, which had  a quaint, \"\"Main Street\"\" feel. I'd encourage other rowers launching from FALS to consider the Brighton area for lodging -- it's very walkable with many cute cafes and shops. While Deepti and Michael provide a coffee maker and kettle"
217498,51689628,2015-10-24,32021703,Bruce,"We usually stay at a Boston-area hotel when visiting the grandkids in Brighton.  For some reason the prices were out of our range recently, so we took a look at AirBnB."
For less than the going hotel rate,we found this basement unit consisting of a large living room with a huge TV,separate bedroom and bath.  Deepti and Michael's unit was very comfortable.  Best of all,it was only a ten-minute walk from the unit to our grandkids' place!,,
The entrance to the unit is quite unassuming - through an unmarked door down a couple of steps to a storage area,and the actual entrance.  There is a combination entry lock (code provided by the owners) to enter the unit.,,,,
As seen in the photos,the unit is quite nicely appointed with leather couches (although one or two pieces have changed).  The bedroom is slightly larger than a walk-in closet (believe me,it's cozy) but will sleep two people comfortably.  The bathroom contains a shower and sink,and a variety of shampoos and soaps.,,
A desk,mini-fridge and wi-fi are among the other features.  There is also a powerful auxiliary floor heater when the weather turns really cold.,,,,
The location is on the main drag of downtown Brighton,close to restaurants and stores.  We enjoyed going to Dash Cafe for breakfasts and coffee,just a couple of blocks away.  The basement location of the unit is away from the street and keeps the street noise to a minimum.,,,
Needless to say,"the unit was perfect for our short-term needs.  We would give it much consideration on a future visit.\"",,,,
217498,69473805,2016-04-11,20241420,Roberta,"The listing was completely accurate and spotlessly clean. Deepti was available and responsive to any and all requests, questions and feedback. The neighborhood was great and we could not have been happier."
217498,70673179,2016-04-19,46103387,Angela,"Deepti was very helpful, and the place was easy to find.  Room was very clean as shown in the pictures."
217498,71806173,2016-04-28,64966453,Aiden,"We loved our stay in Michael and Deepti's home.  The basement apartment was huge and beautifully furnished.  There was a private entrance with an electronic lock, so we could come and go without disturbing anyone.  There was a list of restuarant suggestions waiting for us, and Deepti recommended a great cab company for me when I left.  Comfortable bed, and plenty of towels/blankets for our convenience."
"I cannot recommend this airbnb enough!\"",,,,,
217498,76072545,2016-05-24,57047831,Rox,"We didn't get to meet our host; since this is our first airbnb experience, I don't know if that's the norm or not.  But instructions to getting into the home were promptly sent and everything was fine.  It did take my daughter to figure out that turning the lock part of the lockpad was required in addition to entering the passcode---I kept trying to just use the handle.  So, perhaps that could be clarified.  The space was clean, beautifully appointed, roomy and comfortable.  Wish my basement looked so good!  Neighborhood was cute and convenient for us to get to Boston college graduation.   We loved Dash, down the street, and at your recommendation also commend Devlin's  (I think that was the name.)    We would definitely want to stay here again, and since daughter is staying in Boston, that may be sooner rather than  later.  Many thanks."
217498,76862726,2016-05-29,59083015,Susan,We had a great time - the rooms were very clean and comfortable.
Cute clean neighborhood.,,,,,

"Highly recommend! !\"",,,,,
217498,80702426,2016-06-19,66058954,Tori,My boyfriend had a fantastic stay at Deepti and Michael's. Short walk to the T to get into downtown Boston. Very close to Fenway Park. I highly recommend their place. It is a very quiet neighborhood and they have everything you would need and are willing to help you out anyway possible. It was like being at home.
217498,81641768,2016-06-24,78113392,Kelly,"Our stay with Deepti was everything that was described. It was private, clean, comfortable, quiet and beautifully decorated.  I was even able to find a book to read (unfortunately I forgot mine at home)!"
Deepti was very helpful on our arrival with parking,where the local bus stop is,ect.,,,
"I will be keeping this place on my favorites list for our next trip to the Boston area. \"",,,,,
217498,82206962,2016-06-26,55573411,Kimberley,"Great stay at Deepti and Michael's, they were really helpful hosts and quick to respond to any queries. The apartment is very spacious with a comfy bed. Would recommend if you're looking for a place to stay outside the centre of Boston."
217498,83673416,2016-07-03,66054288,Donald,"A great location with easy public transportation options to the city. The apartment was exceptional in every way, within walking distance of many restaurants and coffee shops. Seemed very convenient for Uber drivers, as well. Highly recommended!"
217498,84389325,2016-07-07,11400832,Dora,"The property is in a residential area, quiet at night.  The one bedroom rental comes with private bath and a nice size lounge."
217498,86927079,2016-07-18,81493443,Katie,"The general things: neighborhood was very quiet and safe at night. A short drive to Allston was all it took to have more of a nightlife. The apartment was exactly as shown, and they even give you comfy blankets to snuggle in while watching television. The best part is that you can leave as early or get back as late as you want and you won't have to worry about disturbing anyone because you get the whole floor to yourself!"
The service and communication: we arrived late and had a bit of trouble finding parking,but Deepti responded instantly to my messaging and showed us where to park behind the building. They gave us clear instructions before arrival on where and how to get in. And good thing too,because the entrance itself is not the most welcoming sight (but it's the inside that counts). We didn't get to meet Deepti or Michael,and they explicitly left a note to say if we had wanted to greet them,texting and email would do the trick. This suited us very well because we wanted just as much privacy as they offered.,
"Overall: I would most certainly look to book this location again the next time I visit Boston!\"",,,,,
217498,87781897,2016-07-21,28714257,Cil,"First time using Airbnb great experience, photos accurately represented the room. Privacy was respected wonderful accommodations, hosts thought of everything to better our stay! Fantastic first experience!"
217498,88506516,2016-07-24,30498552,Vanessa,Overall our stay was pleasant. It was a lovely place and pretty cozy as a basement apt.
We were thankful that they respected our privacy and made our stay comfortable with provided coffee and towels and toiletries (although some of the shampoo/container bottles were nearly empty and we had to use a combo of a few btwn the both of us). Having the list of places that are 5 mins walking distance was also great (we really enjoyed Devlin's!),,,,,
"A few things to keep in mind though. I drive a big sized SUV and parking was pretty terrible. Three cars are supposed to be sharing the space but I literally had to jam my car into the last \"\"spot\"\" available",parking diagonally on the grass. The next morning,there was another car parked behind the second car making it even more difficult to back out. Nearly impossible even with my bf helping me back out. I wished I had known that the parking space was really tight..anything bigger than an SUV will not fit. Also,there are no windows,so no natural light. Make sure to set several alarms to help wake up. Also phone reception was really bad bc it was the basement,although Wi-Fi worked great. The apt was absolutely freezing when we walked in and we could not change it. Thankfully there were throw blanket that we used around the apt. Lastly
"But it was a pleasant and homey stay. It definitely served its purpose as for 2 night stay in Boston.\"",,,,,
217498,89265821,2016-07-27,66461910,Paul,They were great from the moment we booked to the moment we left!
217498,90285578,2016-07-31,69690676,Natalie,"Deepti and Michael were very accommodating. They provided helpful information before and during the stay, and made it clear they were always available to answer questions. We found that the listing was incredibly accurate, and if anything, the room was better than we expected. The location was great, just a short walk from several restaurants and cafes, a bus stop, and a T stop. It was close enough to downtown Boston to go into the city without hassle, but far enough that we could escape the hustle and bustle when we wanted to.  Overall, we really loved our stay!"
217498,93397135,2016-08-12,60522980,Sarah,"We had a nice time at Deepti's and Michael's place. It's a great location to start trips by foot, car or with public transport to explore the neighborhood or the beautiful city of Boston."

After scrambling to find a new place that was close to where we needed to be, Stanley and Sue came through in the clutch and saved our trip but taking us in at the last minute. The home was great and the communication was prompt. I would highly recommend staying at Stanley and Sue's."

The apartments were clean and comfortable with all the necessary amenities. The location was nice too with easy access to the MBTA. Stanley & Sue were also very flexible and accommodating in terms of our schedule. We would recommend this listing to others looking for a pleasant place to stay in Boston for a reasonable price.

The location was a short walk to SoWa (an amazing Sunday open market - food, art, artisans, vintage stuff, etc.) and many great open air restaurants and bars.  Great location for walking and easy T access.  The parking space was important to me and was clearly described, well marked and safe.  Also an inexpensive Uber ride to both Logan and South Station."
Getting in was a breeze and the pictures are very accurate.  The apt. was spotless and we were provided with bottled water and good coffee.  Both beds were luxurious - who knew a sofa bed could be so comfortable!,,,,,
I did not meet Ken,but communication was easy.  As I live just an hour away,did not need much info but feel he would be very responsive to those not familiar with Boston.  I would recommend this place to both short and longer term visitors.,,,

It is a good location - close to transit, with restaurants nearby, and not too-long a walk to several places of interest. Also, the exchange of keys etc. was well-organized. There were maps and tourist books on the shelf. Trouble-free. Thanks!"
2292495,28442021,2015-03-23,18447543,Ruthe,This little gem was everything I expected it to be. Clean cute and an absolutely fantastic location. I would definitely love to come back!
2292495,28996635,2015-04-02,4890699,Rob,We met Kevin who was extremely nice and friendly and gave us a pretty good orientation to where we were and some great suggestions of where to eat and what to do.
The place itself was fantastic and was in a great location. It was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. The kitchen was stocked with pots and pans and most cooking amenities.,,,,,
My friends stayed with me and were blown away by the place as it was their first airbnb experience.,,,,,
"I would recommend this place to anyone considering staying Boston who wants a great neighborhood location. \"",,,,,
2292495,30805623,2015-04-27,6125371,Michele,Nice apartment within walking distance of most you'd want to see and do. Nice neighborhood too. Good communication.
2292495,31141087,2015-05-02,31727201,Tomer,"Great experience, very friendly and well maintained place"
2292495,31354144,2015-05-04,10416816,Megan,"Kevin was gracious to receive us a half hour later than intended when we first arrived, due to some traffic and mapping issues. The place was as described in a great location! I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to explore Boston, particularly the South End."
2292495,31739318,2015-05-09,32178464,Elizabeth,We were a bit late due to the delay of the flight. But Vivian kindly greeted us and we were comfortably settled in. The apt was clean and the location was perfect! All utensils (plates and pans) were available so it was very convenient. Thanks for a good experience!
2292495,43738223,2015-08-21,27128439,Stuart,The host canceled this reservation 17 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

2292495,47592424,2015-09-20,44353773,David,"I needed to find accommodation at the last minute and Glenn was quick to respond to my request.  Kevin met me when I arrived and showed me around the apartment.  The furnishings were very comfortable and the kitchen had everything you would need to prepare meals.  The location is great and you can walk to restaurants, shopping and transportation.  All in all it was a pleasant experience and I would stay here again."
2292495,56517526,2015-12-14,49278915,Douglas,Our schedule got fouled up by forces having nothing to do with this host. And the host made adjustments so it seemed like nothing at all had happened.  That was a welcome relief.
The apartment was tidy and is situated within easy walking distance of many restaurants and bars,"as well as Boston Symphony Hall.  I took the free Silver Line bus in from Logan to South Station and walked over in about 25 minutes. Super convenient. Cab ride back to Logan (MetroCab) was super easy and about $18 on the meter. \"",,,,
2292495,60715662,2016-01-26,53549735,Liz,Glenn is a wonderful host! We had an unexpected delay in our flight home and he was flexible with our check out time. This location is close to tons of hip South End restaurants and shops and a short Uber ride to the north end.
2292495,61580142,2016-02-06,23315214,Kelly,"Glenn handled the necessary arrangements and Kevin was there to greet us at the lovely brownstone townhouse in the Victorian-style neighbourhood of South End. The cosy apartment was exactly as described, and then some. There was a hair dryer, hangers, bath supplies and basic kitchen condiments (e.g. flour, sugar, salt, pepper and oil), which were handy. The location was safe and within a few paces of a convenience store and laundromat. Our taxi ride from the airport was about $30. Overall, my friends and I had a very enjoyable stay here. Thanks again!"
2292495,69422836,2016-04-11,10504315,Daniel,The apartment is well appointed and is in a great location.
2292495,71169246,2016-04-24,39075084,Brock,Nice apartment in a great location.  The check in and out process was extremely easy. I would definitely stay here again.
2292495,78605545,2016-06-07,10184213,Pamela,"Comfortable bed, fluffy towels, and a/c for those hot humid days... great place to stay and very convenient.  Glenn provided a square pack n play (totyard) for the baby - I was so glad to not have to worry about bringing my own! Included in the kitchen are glass snapware containers for storing food - it came in handy!"
2292495,85295652,2016-07-11,42632190,Andrew,Glenn's place was amazing and very central to many things in Boston. He was very accommodating and it was easy to explore the city. Highly recommend!!!
2292495,88430353,2016-07-24,10947330,Laura,"Great location, very clean and inviting apartment.  I appreciated the host's responsiveness and attention to detail before our stay."
2292495,90078026,2016-07-31,4398457,Chung,This stay in Boston was very pleasant and the apartment is exactly as Glen has described.  We had a wonderful time.
2292495,92656467,2016-08-09,65347760,Cosmo,Great apartment in a convenient location which was good value for what what we paid. We made a last minute booking and Glenn was very quick  to respond which was immensely helpful. I hope to come back soon!
2292495,94674574,2016-08-16,32207866,Vanessa,"Great location, amazing place, definitely staying here again next time we're in town."
2292495,96761053,2016-08-24,36380653,Florian,"Great hosts, quick response to any question. The place is adorable and very clean! Can recommend it to everyone!"
2292495,97242162,2016-08-26,61012837,Elisabetta,"It was very easy to communicate and make arrangements for the check in with Glenn. The service is very professional. The day of our arrival, We were continuously in touch with the person in charge to show us the apartment. He was very flexible to reaccomodate the check in time following some delays on our way over. The apartment is a very nice and convenient location. We found maps of Boston and written instructions about everything: house rules, wifi password, recommendations for restaurants, where to find parkings and supermarkets... The apartment was clean and the bathroom filled with many soft and white towels. I would surely recommend Glenn's apartment."
13171246,80125698,2016-06-16,36581644,James,"LOVED, loved, loved this place. It's bigger than the photos lead us to anticipate. The pillows and master bed are more comfortable than every other hotel AND home I've ever tried. The expresso in the mornings was a nice touch, though my brother maybe would have liked a touch of raw sugar. The location is really decent with close by bars and a sweet jazz venue down the street. Jancy, thanks for sharing your place."
13171246,80380258,2016-06-17,22263374,Jon,"Great location in Boston, amazing place, adjacent to great restaurants and the heart of the city.  Great hosts and home."
13171246,80937424,2016-06-20,1661741,Bill,"Jancy's home was the perfect getaway for our long weekend in Boston. Located in the South End, her home is close to great food, entertainment, shopping and the great sights of the city. It was easy for us to access the property via our car and we parked just a few blocks away. Her home is just as easily accessed by the T too, which is just a couple of blocks away."
Her home was clean and very spacious and was exactly as described,if not better. High ceilings,beautiful open rooms with lots of light and comfortable beds. The neighborhood is clean,quiet and friendly.,,
Jancy was a wonderful host who was easily contacted if needed. We look forward to coming back to our favorite city and now our favorite home away from home.,,,,,

13171246,86712804,2016-07-17,2343363,Marie-Josée,"Très joli appartement, confortable, spacieux, éclairé, fidèle aux photos de Jancy. Il y a tout ce dont on a besoin. Sauf, un grille-pain et une planche à repasser. Mais c'est un détail car le quartier est super agréable; petits resto fort bons et beaux, café à 5 minutes de marche. La cuisine du restaurant Terenga, sénégalais, était délicieux et nous avons pu prendre pour emporter et manger à l'appartement pour que notre bébé puisse dormir tranquille. À quelques rues du métro. Nous avons passé un séjour fort agréable et nous recommandons l'appartement de Jancy. Nous ne l'avons pas rencontrée mais elle a répondu à nos messages et texto dans la journée."

4860853,28283003,2015-03-21,29272172,Daniel,"For the price and location ($90/night, 10 minute walk from Hynes Convention Center), it was worth the stay. It's a small studio apartment in an older building. The apartment was clean and warm. The walls are not soundproof, so like most low- to mid-range motels you can hear neighbors if they're loud, but it was quiet after 10pm when I stayed. One piece of advice: be sure the electronic door lock is engaged (check from the outside after you leave); if not, flip the switch on the inside."
4860853,28674202,2015-03-28,20692305,Fernando,muy buen barrio  cercano a todo
4860853,29231920,2015-04-05,5324023,Pascale,The appartement was ideally located in the South End area - very cute neighberhood with great restaurants. Perfect for a short stay!
4860853,31215971,2015-05-03,5094769,Samuel,"Great neighbourhood!!! I came for 3 nights and we basically walked everywhere. The apt was very clean when we arrived and the keyless entry is really great. However, it was smaller than we anticipated, similar to a college dorm-room. Good for 1 person, a bit small for 2 but did the trick nonetheless. Quiet, nice and safe neighbourhood. We got a bit unlucky, as there was construction in an adjacent building. Overall, a good experience in a city with few decent hotels less than $300."
4860853,31530320,2015-05-06,30475783,Chris,"The apartment is in a great part of town (walking distance to many of the sights, inlcuding Fenway Park) and there are a number of good restaruants and bars nearby. The apartment is simple but has everything you would need for a short stay in Boston; and the key-less doors (entry is by number code) make checking-in etc. extremely convenient, no matter what time you intend to arrive."
4860853,31723235,2015-05-09,7535162,Emily,"The building was very quiet and the studio was very simple.  The bed and pillows were maximally comfortable, and the shower worked great.  The area was also perfect for access to Boylston street."
4860853,32520125,2015-05-19,30560699,Toni,The apartment was perfect for my travel needs in a beautiful area of Boston.  It was exactly as advertised.  Thank you.
4860853,32760782,2015-05-21,1577962,Phil,Brent was very communicative and helpful during the booking process and gave me the information that I needed.
The studio is in a building run by a holding company,they send an email with full details on how to access the building,the room and the wifi details.  All access is via number pad and so you do not need to be there by a specific time as no one needs to let you in,this is very handy when coming on a late flight.,,
It's located in a great area and you can walk to many of the great things Boston has to offer,the road the studio is on is quiet and the bed is very comfortable (so much so we made a note of the mattress manufacturer).,,,,
The apartment we had was very compact,if there are two of you you may find it too much so if you usually need a lot of space.,,,,
"However if you just need a comfy bed for when you've exhausted yourself from exploring then this is perfect.\"",,,,,
4860853,32934874,2015-05-23,33396472,Richard,The studio was perfect for my stay.
It had all the important items that I needed such as coffee maker,iron and tv.,,,,
The unit was bright and also very quiet.,,,,,
There is not a better neighborhood,may restaurants and bars to enjoy after a day at work and all in walking distant.,,,,
Thumbs up,,,,,
Richard,,,,,

4860853,33505849,2015-05-29,28970134,Kacper,"This room is one of multiple units that the owner has and rents through a different company with listings on airbnb, it's not a typical airbnb listing; Brent doesn't live here, nor does he live in the same building."
This being said,it was still a great choice for Boston. The check-in process is very simple; they send you an email with the code for the front door,and the code for your unit. My girlfriend and I arrived,opened the front door,found our unit,and got in. That's it. Overall very simple
The unit was not the one pictured in the listing,but it was basically the same. (Different carpet color,furniture arrangement,etc.). It was quite small,but good enough for two people in Boston.,
The room itself: clean,well appointed,but bring some toiletries if you plan on staying for a few days,as they only had one travel sized bottle of shampoo. There is a laundry room in the basement,with two washers,and two dryers that are free
4860853,34212049,2015-06-06,31976515,Benjamin,The listing was exactly as described. There was a nice welcome folder that outlined various food and beverage spots in the vicinity of the apartment. The neighbourhood was pleasant and convenient as it is very easy to walk to Mass Ave and Prudential metro stations.
4860853,36687808,2015-06-30,33043189,Jeff,"The room was as advertised. The neighborhood was nice, and was conveniently located for anyone wanting to travel around Boston. Upon our arrival the room was missing a few items such as the ironing board and hair dryer. Brent was really accommodating however, and had both items delivered to the room within 24 hours. Overall I would recommend this rental."
4860853,37865747,2015-07-11,14943744,Richard,Brent was on top of things and a great host.  Nice neighborhood and great Studio!
4860853,42420540,2015-08-13,7836502,Ana Maria,Communication wasn't great. You are dealing with a rental company. On the day of the arrival we didn't have the codes to enter the building or unit. They changed the unit at the last minute. The good thing is that we were upgraded to a larger one. The apartment was great with everything you need and the location is wonderful. It was clean and beautifully decorated. We would go back without hesitation.
4860853,45561573,2015-09-04,18069651,Brandon,The location was very convenient for the places we wanted to go. It's about a 20 minute walk to Fenway which is awesome. Only thing I suggest is to request extra towels before hand. We stayed for 5 days and only received 1 set of towels. I requested free towels after day 3 but did not get them.
4860853,46174802,2015-09-08,40882938,Morgan,Our experience with Brent was easy from the start. He answered all of our questions in a timely manner. The location on the South End/ Back bay was perfect! It was a beautiful street filled with cafes and restaurants that made us fall in love with Boston! It was the perfect place to stay if you want to feel like a local! It was also just a short walk to all of the wonderful attractions that Boston has to offer. The small studio was just as described in the listing and all that we needed for our stay. The keypad security was incredibly useful as we were driving in late at night and made for easy check in and check out. Overall I would say it was a wonderful experience!
4860853,50173045,2015-10-10,6272479,Ronald,"The apartment is located in a great location, on a quiet, tree-lined street. My visit was for business purposes, so proximity to the convention center was important - only 10 mins walk from the apartment. Initial communication to book the apartment was harder than it should have been, but once that was pointed out, the team responded quickly."
The unit was well appointed and clean,although the shower stall could benefit from an upgrade. Those points aside,"I would stay here again as an alternative to a hotel.\"",,,
4860853,66920067,2016-03-25,54543065,Michelle,I received all information needed to make my stay great in a timely manner.
4860853,72599079,2016-05-03,62302612,John,Place was fantastic and clean. Small quiet room on a beautiful street about a 10 minute walk to the nearest station. Door codes made getting in a breeze and not having to worry about keys during the trip was a plus. Would definitely stay here again!
4860853,72648305,2016-05-04,27767659,Spoyz,The worst Airbnb ever. Everything may look perfect on website but in fact it was so small and ridiculously poor management.
Arrival:,,,,,
He checked us in a different room,not this one we booked and paid on Airbnb. The room's calendar said it was available so we processed the booking. He said the room we paid for was not available.,,,,
The stay:,,,,,
We slept for the first night and woke up with panic by the hammer knocking heavily and loudly on the wall above our head in the early morning. The loudness went for many hours. It's clear that the room next door was under construction before we checked in,"because a ladder was left in front. Brent never tell us about this before we are here. We tried to text him on message but he never answer until now. So we called up to the apartment's management (because the phone number Brent gave to Airbnb was not exist) and asked for any solution because we booked here 3 nights and we cannot live in this environment. He replied \"\"There's nothing I can do about this.\"\" and repeated this phase many times. Until I was deciding to call a police because we paid for 3-nights rent here to sleep but we cannot sleep and the host was not willing to solve the problem. Later",he told us to go sleep in other room but we must leave the room before 10am because someone else will be checking in. So we had to walk up the stairs in pyjamas back to our knocking room in the morning after. This is the worst stay I have ever experienced from Airbnb.,,,
The host did not even apologize us or anything to make us feel better. He acted like we stayed here for free. The apartment has 16 rooms in the building,"so we aware when you book a place in Boston. Don't come here.\"",,,,
4860853,76927965,2016-05-29,3016298,Jody,"The property is just as it looks in the pictures: sunny, new, clean, small. The building is classic Boston brownstone and the street is beautiful: a narrow boulevard with a tree row running down the middle. The location is excellent with cafes, restaurants, pubs and clubs nearby. Not as great for shopping but Newbury St isn't too far away and an Orange line T stop is maybe a 10 minute walk. If you have a car you definitely want to add the optional parking space cuz you won't easily find street parking."
5768819,46412326,2015-09-10,41888979,Ahlam,"Personally I found the location strategic, but the quality of furniture was below my standard, and cleanliness was moderate."
Nonetheless Alicia was professional in her communication.,,,,,
"I did not like the fact that I never had the chance to meet anyone except the maintenance personal.\"",,,,,
5768819,54806398,2015-11-23,15150475,Nhi,"Location: 10-15 mins walk to train, restaurants, shops, and Prudential building. Great location!"
Apartment: Clean and neat - just like the pictures. However,the walls are so thin that I could hear the neighbor's music and phone conversations.,,,,
Host: Very responsive and helpful.,,,,,
"Overall experience was great!! Thank you so much for an awesome time in Boston :)\"",,,,,
5768819,56130004,2015-12-09,4060598,Jill,We had a great stay with Alicia. I placed a co-worker here and he was totally happy! Alicia was wonderful about pre-travel communication and was really helpful.
3392423,14806458,2014-06-26,17131642,Jeannie,Tuomas's apartment was beautiful! My friend and I enjoyed our stay. Tuomas is extremely kind and hospitable. I would highly recommend staying here. =o)
3392423,14894818,2014-06-28,16991232,Lauren & Sam,"Tuomas was a great, accommodating host for our two nights in Boston.  The location of the apartment was perfect - tucked down a steep side street on Beacon Hill and up a couple winding staircases, within walking distance of great restaurants, historical sites, and fun shopping. There was an amazing rooftop patio with a cool breeze and good views of the neighborhood.  The room was small and simple but the linens were clean and the bed was comfortable so we slept like babies after riding around the city all day on rented bikes.  Tuomas went out of his way to help us out - he kept our bags at his office all day since we arrived early in the day and couldn't check in yet; plus when we mentioned the room was warm, he went out and bought a fan for the next night. He gave us some great restaurant recommendations (sushi up the street and cannoli in the North End!).  Upon returning home after dinner, we really enjoyed chatting with Tuomas and swapping stories.  He is an exceptionally nice host and his apartment  is a great place from which to explore Boston!"
3392423,15195733,2014-07-04,51538,Jeremy,"Great, convenient apartment close to good restaurants and transit.  Only a ten-minute ride from the airport, too.  Rooftop garden is a great asset, too.  Highly recommended."
Slight word of caution - this is a walk-up apartment so,if you have big bags or are not a huge fan of stairs,"be aware.  \"",,,
3392423,15550916,2014-07-11,4926547,William,Great apartment and great host. Tuomas was very helpful and all the arrival and departure arrangements went smoothly. The location is perfect for exploring the city and close to the North End for restaurants.

The apartment is in a great location and as first timers to Boston, we were pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to walk to the spots we had on our list! The street is adorable and the cobblestone streets are extremely charming. Tuomas provided us with suggestions on places to eat, grab a drink, etc. and was very accommodating! This is a great place to stay if you are want to explore the city on foot, OR if you need to grab the train, as it is just a few blocks away. I would definitely recommend this as a place to stay! You won't be disappointed!"

3392423,27810010,2015-03-12,28366301,Brian,"This quiet downtown off-street is absolutely beautiful, and very Boston.  The apartment is rustically charming and in a very central location.  Also couldn't be easier getting to and from Logan airport using public transport (about 20 min total).  We only saw Tuomas for a brief few minutes on our last night, but he was an excellent communicator of instructions and made himself available for any questions.  All in all, a great experience!"
3392423,27882506,2015-03-14,11493528,Rob,"\"First of all, the location was ideal for someone like myself who wanted to walk the Freedom Trail and see a part of old Boston. The apartment was just as it is described ... very clean, spacious, and comfortable. Tuomas and I had been in touch keeping each other posted as to where and when we'd meet. He'd left perfect instructions as to how to let myself in if he had to work late ... which he did. I got in without any problems whatsoever, and immediately hit the Freedom Trail fulfillling a long-standing bucket list item. When I finally met my host I was reminded of an old saying regarding social graces, \"\"be interested"

The apartment is clean and inviting. I was in town for a conference so I didn't spend a ton of time in the apartment, but it was a pleasant, warm place to sleep and prepare for the challenges of the day. It was easy walking distance to downtown and the Red Line is a stone's throw away if you need to venture further afield. I would definitely stay here again."

The location is perfect for a short visit to Boston,right in the center of Beacon Hill. You are allowed to share the living room and the rooftop deck with Tuomas what makes you feel being  a warmly welcomed guest and compensates for the small bedroom.,,,,

Se encuentra cubierto con todos los servicios necesarios, destacando los bares y lugares de comida. El edificio es una construcción histórica en buen estado de conservación y el apartamento es tal cual figura en las fotos. Muy bien equipado y acogedor. La habitación es cómoda y el anfitrión nos proporcionó sábanas limpias y toallas. El baño, compartido, también estaba muy limpio, al igual que la cocina y el resto del apartamento. Tuomas es muy cuidadoso con la limpieza, al punto de que hay que quitarse los zapatos al subir la escalera."
Otro punto favorable es la flexibilidad de horarios de llegada y salida. Nosotros pudimos dejar nuestro equipaje muy temprano en la mañana para poder salir rápidamente a recorrer la ciudad y él nos abrió sin problemas. Lamentablemente pudimos estar sólo una noche en la ciudad,"pero esperamos poder volver ya que el lugar es muy lindo y Tuomas fue un gran anfitrión. \"",,,,

The Freedom Trail was in walking distance and the train to the blue line to the airport and South Train Station was all in walking distance. Tuomas was a lovely host and his penthouse was just great. Thank you Tuomas.
3392423,32839369,2015-05-22,32223011,Alex,"Perfect place to relax while exploring Boston. The location was amazing, right in the middle of Beacon Hill with easy access to the esplanade etc. Tuomas was very communicative and helpful. The rooftop deck was my favorite part  :)"
3392423,32916168,2015-05-23,32418400,Patti,"Tuomas initiated communication with me by e-mail the week before I arrived.  I never actually met Tuomas, but  he left a key for me and we were in communication by text during my stay.     He had given me enough instructions that I felt at home and welcome in his space.   I would definitely stay there again."
3392423,33480157,2015-05-28,4460490,Sugata,"Tuomas is an excellent host, very thoughtful and accommodating. He made us feel completely at home. His house is just as it appears in the photos with a small but great roof deck as well."

We loved having coffee in the mornings on his private rooftop deck, and wine in the evenings overlooking Boston. It was the coolest neighborhood and close to everything! Thanks, Tuomas!"

He would check in with me in the evening to see how my day went.  As a single woman traveling alone i was a little hesitant about staying in an apartment with a man but Tuomas was very kind, friendly and welcoming.

Tuomas left us clear instructions of how to get into the apartment and got back to us quickly if we needed to ask him anything. I would definitely stay here again if I ever came to Boston. Paramount is a great restaurant for breakfast and it's not too far away.
3392423,42812379,2015-08-16,23065647,Michael,"Das Appartement ist wirklich klasse. Ich war 2 Wochen dort und habe mich die ganze Zeit super wohl gefühlt. Beacon Hill ist eines der coolsten Viertel in Boston, in Downtown ist von dort alles zu Fuß zu erreichen. Wenn man doch mal raus will, ist der Red Line Stop der Bostoner U-Bahn direkt um die Ecke. Tuomas ist ein großartiger Gastgeber. Wenn ich nochmal nach Boston komme, ist Tuomas definitiv meine erste Adresse."
3392423,43538786,2015-08-20,6876465,Marshall,"Tuomas is a great guy, very nice and welcoming....I felt like I was staying at a friends place.  The location is perfect and amenities as advertised - walk to two main shopping/drinking/eating areas of Beacon Hill in 2 minutes and approx 2 miles from Fenway (30 min walk or $8 Uber).   Key pick up and drop off super simple."

Son appartement est très bien situé et très accueillant. Les clefs ont été facile à récupérer et Tuomas nous a donné des renseignements très complets avant l'arrivée des garçons.  Je recommande ce choix de logement sans hésitation.
3392423,46394135,2015-09-10,40318245,Daniel,Wir hatten eine wunderbare Zeit in Tuomas Apartment. Tuomas ist ein sehr angenehmer und völlig unkomplizierter Gastgeber. Das Apartment entsprach völlig der Beschreibung und die Lage in Boston ist großartig!

He is super friendly, treats you like  roommate and even clears a shelf off in the fridge for you. You are stumbling distance back from great bars and restaurants and close to a train station to get you back to the airport if needed. Fantastic Host! Highly recommended and will totally use again if\\when in the area."
3392423,47288862,2015-09-17,41306518,Gary,We had a brilliant time in Boston helped by the great location of the apartment we walked everywhere! The Mfa is fab and there is plenty to see everywhere
3392423,47491989,2015-09-19,39791121,Orly,"Tuomas arrived at the appartment in the middle of his working day, in order to make sure I found the key. Throuout my whole stay at his appartment, he was very helpful and courteous: Carried my very heavy suitcase up the stairway when I arrived and down when I left, let  me use the kitchen, answered all of my questions about Boston, explained how to get to places, recommended things to do and places to eat. He is a very nice person."
The appartment is located in the very beautiful,truely charming neighbourhood of Beacon Hill. It is about 20  minutes walk to Boston Common. I have walked from the appartment to all the places and sightsI  I had wanted to see in Boston.,,,,
I felt very safe walking alone to and fro the apartmet,even  late at night.,,,,
The living space in the appartment and the kitchen+ dinning area are spacious enough and nicely-sized. The room is small,but big enough to hold 1 big suitcase. The bed is comfortable. I did not mind at all the 50 winding steps,but people should be  aware they exist...,,,
In short,"I  highly  recommend staying in Tuomas's apartment.\"",,,,
3392423,48402242,2015-09-26,3187483,Charlie & Andrea,"Tuomas was a perfectly nice host, friendly and accommodating during our weekend stay in this amazing neighborhood of Boston. The location could not be better. There were some negative points to mention about our stay, however. 1)  The entrance to the building and stairs up to the apartment were extremely dirty, filled with fur balls, dirt, etc. and stale smelling (not Tuomas's fault but not a nice way to arrive regardless) 2) The shower in the bathroom was very uncomfortable to use. It's one of those detachable ones but there was no clip or anything to hold it in place and it kept falling, along with this heavy rack thing. And the door to the bathroom also locks on its own from the inside if you're not careful, thus locking you out. 3) The bedroom was pretty dirty and unmade upon our arrival. There were hairs in the bed and the sheets didn't smell washed. Tuomas explained he got tied up at work and wasn't able to prepare the room in time. Overall, though, it was a VERY affordable price for the neighborhood and our experience was mostly positive."
3392423,49222341,2015-10-02,33159009,Tina,very good place. Tuomas is very nice.
3392423,50854428,2015-10-15,10329753,Kath,Thomas is a very gracious host.  He made us feel welcome and at ease.  The accommodation is small and adequate for the price.  Could be a bit cleaner.  Location excellent...premier neighborhood

He was very helpful and great in keeping in touch if I needed help with anything.

Lastly, he was really accommodating with me checking out a little later for my interviews! Thanks, Tuomas!"

But we really appreciate everything he did to make us feel like home. We arrived his at midnight. With a detailed instruction, we found the key easily and had a very nice sleep. The location is great. Chinatown, Central Park and Boston Garden are within walking distance. It's a great experience to stay here!"
3392423,59281867,2016-01-09,44135050,Tsai-Yuan,"The place is clean,and we are provided by everything we needed. However, the room is a little bit small for two people with big luggages. Also, it is kind of inconvenient for us to carry so many luggages to climb the stairs up. But the cleanliness and comfort are nice."
3392423,59856228,2016-01-16,4898678,Thomsen,"Tuomas was very accommodating and flexible with my arrival time. I spent two nights at Tuomas' place. The apartment is in a very charming neighbourhood and it was perfectly located for exploring Boston by foot. One day I spent touring around downtown, walking the Freedom Trail, and exploring the Italian district. The next day I walked to MIT and Cambridge. Tuomas was helpful in providing plenty of tourist maps and information pamphlets. Unfortunately Tuomas and I were on different schedules during my stay so we didn't connect until my final morning there. When we did finally meet, Tuomas was a very kind and gracious host."

If you want to see the best of Boston stay here. Close to public transit and walking distance to everything I wanted to see - Boston common, Charles st, Isabella Stuart, cambridge/Harvard, commonwealth. Best of all is just walking around beacon hill - don't wear heels, though - The sidewalks are all brick."
3392423,81595399,2016-06-24,5267374,Rick,"Tuomas is a great guy.  A wonderful host.  Thoughtful, considerate, and a good listener.  AirBnB was designed for people like Tuomas.  He gets it."

The area is beautiful and just wandering around the neighbourhood was a lovely experience. It's close to many of the sights and we pretty much walked everywhere!,,,,,
"Also great was the rooftop to have a quiet evening drink before venturing out again to explore. Only one thing to note - the stairs are narrow and there isn't an elevator so try to pack light or you'll get quite a work out lugging your suitcase up as we did!\"",,,,,
3392423,84988191,2016-07-10,73105931,Mark,Tuomas was very welcoming and a pleasure to stay with. His apartment was clean and conveniently located. I would happily stay with him again in the future.
3392423,86058744,2016-07-14,231882,Rachel,Very central location in Beacon Hill close to two public transportation hubs and within 10 minute walking to Boston Common.  There are several restaurants nearby and a Whole Foods grocery store.
I enjoyed my stay and had everything I needed for a fast but fun trip to Boston. Tuomas provided maps and even a tour book. The wifi was strong and the bed was comfy. It was unusually warm in Boston but the room has its own air conditioning unit.,,,,,
Word to the wise,the stairs are quite steep so be prepared if you have heavy luggage.,,,,

All needs a bit of a clean. Also the shower isnt fixed to the wall.  Works if on a budget but Wouldn't recommend if going on work trip.

I had a great time both nights chatting with Jonathan late into the night. He gave me advice fairly quickly via text about places to go and eat in the neighborhood and things to do. Most of all we just had some great conversation on a variety of topics.,,,,,

4555637,43560167,2015-08-20,40268221,Roslyn,Note this was my first experience with AirBnB. I generally stay in hotels when I travel and never share bathrooms or living space with strangers. So this was unique for me.
The good:,,,,,
Jonathan was organized and responded to the request very quickly.,,,,,
The home was easy to find and close to Harvard.,,,,,
The home itself is charming,including the loft bedroom.,,,,
Details on how to enter and exit (keys) were clear.,,,,,
Shelves in the bathroom and kitchen were cleared if I wished to store belongings.,,,,,
What I wish I knew:,,,,,
There were at least 4 other guests in the home- including a crying toddler every night. This meant it was noisy well into the night. Considering I had classes to attend in the morning,it was not pleasant.,,,,
The room can get quite hot and the air conditioner in the loft bedroom is loud.,,,,,
The bathroom was not cleaned while I was there for the 3 days (hair on floor,trash bin not changed,overall grimy etc). This type of thing is a major deal breaker for me and if had known about this,I would not have chosen to stay here. To be fair,I did not inform the host about this while I was there. I kept thinking it would be taken care of because it was advertised as very clean.,
It felt like the home was run as a lodging business with all the different people there- I didn't quite expect that.,,,,,
"I think I'm just not the type to want to stay in shared accommodation for the above reasons listed. \"",,,,,
4555637,45907586,2015-09-06,41906604,Bill,Jonathan is a very good host. He is welcoming and helpful. He helped solve all my problems. I will definitely still live here next time if I have a chance.

I was in the loft bedroom,which is exactly as pictured.  Tastefully decorated; with everything you need.  Incredibly comfortable bed.  And the entire home is super clean,which was very important to me.,,,
The location is also very convenient; hardly 5 minutes to the train station.  I needed to be near the Longwood medical area.  From Jonathan's place,it was an easy 15 minute walk to the hospital.,,,,
The house has a few floors,with the kitchen and living room on the second floor.  The bedrooms are on the next floor,and the loft is right on top.  There are a number of stairs to get to the loft,and quite narrow stairs to get to the front door.  For me,the stairs provided a nice workout!,

The room is spacious, a nice bed and several wardrobes, it is in the top floor (3rd). The kitchen is really nice, spacious, well equipped, with everything you need to cook.

I've never experienced hospitality such as these. And to top it off it was a last minute arrangement. I was attending a conference in downtown Boston which usually causes hotels to be sold out.

The facilities on offer were exceptional and better than most hotels I have stayed in and I get to travel a lot with work.  Conveniently located just outside of the city center that is accessible via public transport, personally though it is a very pleasant walk too (30 mins). Jonathan even provided local information on local amenities and places to eat etc and his recommended pizza place (penguin pizza) did not disappoint. Exceptional value for money and would recommend without hesitation."

Jonathan not only welcomed me as a host, but also welcomed my countless questions and offered some very helpful suggestions."
The loft bedroom listing is very accurately presented,and I found the room spick-and-span when I checked-in.

This is just the photographer in me, but his apartment let light in very nicely - making the place seem so nice and comfortable. Wilke is so easy to talk to and was very quick with his responses. I'd definitely stay here again!"
3591359,73799509,2016-05-10,50164695,Chen,It is a very good apartment. The place is near the subway station. Place is clean and comfortable.
3591359,75809681,2016-05-23,72365939,Gao,We have a good experience at your house. It's clean and cheap.
3591359,76759940,2016-05-29,65236131,Zhao,"Wilke is a very responsive host. The apartment is spacious, sunny and clean.  We love the full-size kitchen and enjoyed making breakfast before we head out to explore the area. If you love to walk, the Jamaica pond is 20 minutes away and Arboretum is just 10 minutes from the pond. The neighborhood is very lively and you can hear birds chirping all the time.  One night after dinner at Blue Nile, a wonderful Ethiopian restaurant within a short walk, we somehow went on a different street we used earlier. As I stood on the sidewalk checking my phone for direction, a friendly neighbor saw us  and walked over to see if she can help. She even shared with us her story of how her grandfather moved to the neighborhood.  That really made us feel good. The night before I left Wilke's apartment, I stumbled upon the Double Edge Theater's free performance a block away and had a blast.  You simply can't duplicate the experience staying at a hotel."
3591359,81618516,2016-06-24,5430298,Tobias,Wilke was very easy to communicate with and made a last minute request get sorted easily.
The place is accurate to the pictures showing in the add. The location is good considering the price we got. 5 Minutes walking you find a supermarket and another 2 minutes are the subway station. 28 minutes to downtown Boston.,,,,,
Easy to park your car in the street  (for free) and a very nice neighborhood in all.,,,,,
It is an old house so be aware that you have to carry yourself up 2 flights of stairs and that there is no air conditioning in place.,,,,,
We were unlucky to pick 3 nights in June and the indoor temperature was 83 degrees despite the windows being wide open which made it difficult to sleep.,,,,,

Unfortunately we were there in August and we have found some very hot days and the house is not so fresh.,,,,,
However,the house is perfect for an holiday and we have been there very well.,,,,

El barrio muy tranquilo y facilmente accesible en metro. en cuanto al resto de la casa bastante desastre. la cocina no la usé en toda mi estancia porque estaba extremadamente sucia con grasa por todos lados y la jarra del agua con verdín. el baño tampoco daba mucha confianza. para el precio que pagué (27 euros/noche) estaba relativamente bien. En favor de Luson eh de decir que fue en todo momento muy amable a pesar de no vivir en el apartamento. la otra habitación del piso está ocupada por Lucy, su compañera, que casi nunca está pero es bastante desastre con la limpieza."

Cynthia and her daughters did everything to make us feel welcomed and at home. Even on our last day, she gave us some of the cake she had baked so that we could have a quick snack at the airport"
The breakfast was good,it gets you going for the day.,,,,
However,I found the neighbor hood a bit sketchy. Although I was never attacked or anything,I just did not feel comfortable walking around. I guess maybe it is different to what I am used,but I thought I should point that out. As a result I was very cautious every time I went out.,,
At the house it was very safe though and i never got worried,it was just the streets. Once again,"Cynthia is a great host! She takes great care of you!!!\"",,,
2931165,14158829,2014-06-13,15400005,Rumbidzai,"Cynthia was so accommodating and welcoming into her lovely home, she even let us come early in the morning to leave our bags though we did end up finding the room ready for us. The room was comfortable and clean as well the bathroom which was cleaned thoroughly when we were staying there. The breakfast in the morning literally took us through to dinner! No kidding! The breakfast conversation was really fun with Cynthia showing us pics of her grands and learning more about each other's cultures. The house is close to the bus stations but a little far from the train station but not too far to be inconvenient except when we had to take both a bus and a train to get to the airport. The home is actually in Mattapan. Overall, it was so pleasant staying there and her daughter even came in to tell us about the Free Wednesday access to the Museum of Fine Arts which was the perfect way to end the stay. The only thing is that there were times when instructions to her son were shouted up from the first floor to the second floor which was a bit noisy  on days we were sleeping in. However, this was not a big deal as it only happened once or twice! Overall, my mum and I loved our stay there and would recommend it to anyone who's in Boston and who wants a comfortable homey place where you'll be fed till you burst. Thanks again Cynthia and family for your hospitality!"
2931165,14400626,2014-06-18,10953913,Larry,"My wife and I had a wonderful stay in Boston. Cynthia was a perfect host. After a good nights sleep we woke up to the smell of fresh coffee, followed by a hearty breakfast, a good start to a full day of discovering all Boston has to offer. Although we had a car, we opted to leave it parked at Cynthia's and take the public transportation, which is more efficient than driving ourselves. It is only a short walk to the bus stop past some of the most charming houses and people of the neighborhood. The 3 days I spent in Boston was not nearly enough time to see all that Boston has to offer. If I get a chance to return to Boston I would definetly prefer to stay with Cynthia again"

All the best!!    Sandy"
2931165,14796863,2014-06-26,16681338,Merissa,"Had a lovely stay with Cynthia and her family! A friend and I were in town for a concert in Cambridge and Cynthia was more than accommodating (we left our stuff at her place during the day of the concert and then didn't return until late that evening). Cynthia, her family (got to meet her daughter and husband), and Izzy the Pomeranian are all lovely. This location is a bit outside the city but decently close to buses and the Purple/Red lines. My friend and I were able to have breakfast before heading back home and chat with Cynthia and her husband for a bit. They were super helpful with driving directions and recommendations for places to visit/park in Boston. Again, if you're looking for an inexpensive place to stay that is fairly easy to get to and from public transportation, I would highly recommend staying with Cynthia!"

The house is really nice, and so does do bedroom... It was just as described on the airbnb website. The breakfast was really good too! The only thing that we did not liked is that we had to take at list one bus and one Subway to go anywhere in Boston. The neighborhood is okay, but at night is really dark, we used to arrive at the house really late and we never had problems, but we were always careful and a little bit afraid. The whole experience ess great and we recommend you staying at Cynthia's house."

If there was any problem they were quick to fix it and made my stay very comfortable. I love that they had provided breakfast, although I only took advantage of it one day. This was my first Airbnb booking and I was very pleased. I had a wonderful experience with them and am so thankful for their generosity :)."

Our commute began in New York and was longer than expected which made us arrive really late, 1:30 am. We felt really bad but Cynthia wasn't bothered at all and can down to open the door and welcome us in. We walked in ad there were other friendly guests that were still up, 5 friendly Brazilians. Cynthia continued To give us a brief tour of where we'd be staying, we thanked her and let her go back to bed. The home is really big just like her harming family whom we talked to through out our weekend. The location wasn't right in Boston but in a city that isn't far, about 10 minutes by taxi as we were relying on public transit the whole time which isn't bad either in Boston, very simple to navigate. Breakfast in the morning was great, we only had it once but that was due to our right schedule since we trying to make the most of our limited time and left the house in a rush. Bottom line, Cynthia was very nice, has a clean home and has a great location for those visiting Boston. Thank you for allowing us to stay in your home with you and your family, maybe we will see each other again if we go to Boston in the future!"

The room is of decent size and, luckily for me at the time, air conditioned. The place is located in the outskirts of Boston, so you'll have to take the bus to get to the train, which slightly limits how late you can stay in town."

Our room was clean and comfortable with a window a/c and we also had a keyed lock on the door so we could leave our stuff in the room with no worries.  They are both from Jamaica and have been living in this home for a very long time.  The bathroom is shared with family members as well as guests renting the other room they have listed so that could be an issue.  It wasn't for us as no one was in the other room at the time and the family did not spend much time in the restroom either.  Cynthia provides the food for breakfast but you fix it yourself as she wants you to feel as if you are at home.  There is free parking available on the street and Keith is redoing their driveway so in the future you might have the option to park there.  Not two many places to eat close by.  We drove 10 min to Jamaica Plains area of Boston and there are plenty of eateries there.  The Orange Line Forest Hills  \"\"T\"\" station is one bus ride away on the #31 bus and from there you can pretty much get anywhere you want to go.  It is not close in to downtown Boston maybe about 25 min away.  Not much to see in the immediate area but as I said once you get to the \"\"T\"\" you can get pretty much get anywhere.  \""

Keith & Cynthia are caring hosts who really spoiled us and Princess, their little grand daughter is just adorable. Not to forget their cute dog Izy and cat Lucy."
The area was safe and it was easy to explore Boston from it. Check out the Roti place nearby (you find it on Yelp) - the food was cheap and soooo delicious!,,,,,

2931165,81956860,2016-06-26,61109757,Ramya + Tucker,Cynthia and her family were so welcoming. We had to arrive earlier than expected and then changed our plans to arrive later in the day. They were so understanding and made us feel comfortable. The buses from their house are very convenient. There is one that stops right in front of their road. I am very grateful to have stayed with them. Cynthia even gave us a piece of cake when we left. The bed was super comfortable and the air conditioning worked great!

Nous avons aimé discuter avec Cynthia de plusieurs choses et parler avec sa petite-fille. Toutefois, le quartier n'étant pas sécurisant, nous avons pris le taxi pour se rendre au métro et du métro à la maison. Une résidente nous a dit qu'il y avait eu une fusillade quelques jours avant notre arrivée et que nous ne devions pas nous promener seule.  Donc il est bien de se loger dans sa demeure, mais pour le quartier il nous a fallu un taxi pour le traverser."

The bedroom was clean and comfy with everything we needed. Towels are provided. The bathroom was clean and hairdryer provided, an added bonus. Breakfast is served between 8-9am and although I didn't avail of it most mornings, my boyfriend said everything was great and enjoyed the conversations with both Cynthia and Keith. Izzy the dog and Lucy the cat are both very friendly and love a good rub! The location is very easily accessible to and from Boston city through public transport. Overall, a great stay and great value for money."

I was going to be the contact person since I booked it through my account. All seemed fine. The first (although small) hickup was the confirmation on how to obtain the keys was only sent the morning of my colleague's arrival (I had asked the day before after not hearing about it from Jason at all). My colleague was already on the plane but luckily he was able to check emails upon arrival to find out how to access the place. Phew. His assessment of the apt afterwards was: \"\"The place was mostly clean (except for blankets on the couch that smelled like pets)"
Fine. He had all the basics and we were not further going to worry about the non-homyness or anything else.,,,,,
Since no instructions on what to do with the keys were sent until 6:45am of the day of departure it was too late to inform my colleague who had left early. A few days later I get a message from Jason,"\"\"He's going to get a horrible review\"\"",without further explanation. Since the booking was through my account I enquired with him and learned that Jason thought my colleague had not locked the door!,,,
Upon immediate consultation with my colleague I learned that he,,,,,
had left the keys on the kitchen table. He had to make a good faith decision to leave the keys in the house with the door snapped shut preventing access without a key. It was the better option than to hand off the keys uninstructed (at that time of departure) in any other way (apparently preferred). (More detail: My colleague had locked one of the two locks from the inside to make sure your place would be locked. Of course he was not able lock the second deadbolt lock because he left the keys inside.),,,,,
"The claim that the door was not locked at all and not even enquiring with me but instead immediately threatening a \"\"horrible review\"\" made me very uncomfortable. The whole thing could have easily been avoided in the first place if Jason would have sent timely instructions. I had to ask for every detail before getting an answer. Compared to previous airbnb bookings this was not very forthcoming but perhaps I have been spoiled by other hosts.",,,,,
Anyway,to be fair,"Jason responded with \"\"Ok no worries\"\" after I explained the door situation. However",I feel compelled now to write about this experience after I was notified that Jason had completed his review and not knowing what he would say in there.,,

Lauren is really nice and has given us detailed support towards our questions and problems. The room was seperated with public area by curtains so you still get your own personal space. The space was totally enough for the two of us, the bed was warm, and the sofa was really soft and comfy! Lauren is away during weekdays but still very responsive to our messages and being supportive to what ever we asked. Since there are lots of students around, the location is very close to restaurants, metro, and super market, so the whole staying experience is great!"
7602994,52075728,2015-10-26,28783858,Arni,Lauren has been very nice and most accommodating. I'm thankful that she made my stay very comfortable. :)
7602994,53710657,2015-11-11,47618163,Elisa,"Lauren is a very calm, nice girl who is accommodating and willing to help you settle in and get comfortable. You will be staying with two other very nice girls who are very quiet and independent. The apartment is on the 3rd floor of the building (in case you bring large luggage!)"
At the beginning,there were no essentials (sheets,towels,etc.). Since it said there were on the description,Lauren and I went to buy them together and the problem was solved. There is not much space in the fridge,but you can leave small items like yoghurt
The area is very convenient. Practically a 1-2 minute walk will take you to the Packard's Corner T stop,which will get you to Park street in 30 minutes. There's also plenty of restaurants around the apartment,including a food court and a large supermarket.,,,
"Thank you Lauren!\"",,,,,

The room is nice and tidy,the bed comfortable,and everything else in the apartment (kitchen etc.) is just perfect.,,,
We'd go back to their place any time,without thinking twice.,,,,

2754149,13083314,2014-05-19,6134649,Stefanie,"Carl and his son were delightful hosts! We very much enjoyed our stay on Mission Hill in Boston. The rooms were clean and airy with comfortable beds—even a bouquet of fresh flowers greeted us on a small side table. The bathroom had everything we needed—hair dryer, optional handheld shower and a non-slip mat in the tub. Towels were fluffy and bed linens were soft and smelled fresh. Carl made excellent conversation over a cup of tea and was helpful with directions. All in all a great experience. We would definitely choose this location again."

Hope we could visit them again. :)"

By the time we left the Boston area, we truly felt as though we'd made friends.  If we return (which we're hoping to do next year), we'll go out of our way to stay with them again.  We've already extended an invitation for them to stay with us in Atlanta if they're ever in town.  Carl was kind enough to pick us up and drop us off from the subway stop nearest the house, which wasn't even asked for.  Coffee, tea, and medicine was offered without hesitation when each was wanted or needed.  Pretty incredible when you consider the modest per-day cost of the reservation.  You can tell good people, and if you stay here, you'll meet three examples and will be glad you chose this as your place to stay.  Thank you all, Carl, for opening your home to us and being such wonderful hosts."
2754149,14689812,2014-06-24,14799371,Lucia,"Carl is definitely a very nice and kind host. He waited for me at the metro station when I arrived even though I was late, prepared a breakfast for us every morning (his pancakes were very good!). He also showed us the surroundings and gave us a ride when we needed it. We had a wonderful time with him and his family, chatting and sharing experiences. The 'red room' is big enough for two people and there's plenty of room for your luggage too. The house is not far at all from the green/orange T station (the metro). We strongly recommend this place, and we would come back ourselves next time we're around!"

They love to answer or help you solve the problems you met in Boston. Carl told me a lot history and local information about Boston which really help me a lot for the next two years' s study in Boston. There is no doubt that we will meet with each other in the future. Looking forward to meet your family again in your approaching birthday.

Beyond that, I will also recommend to any family or friends that are visiting Boston to stay with them, as well. The location was great - convenient walking distance to both the Green and Orange lines AND the Samuel Adams Brewery (free tours with free beer, what's not to love). The bed was very comfy, the room spacious, and they kept the place nice and warm (even putting an extra radiator in our room if needed). We never had any issues sharing the bathroom in the mornings. Carl even made us some delicious pancakes one of the mornings that we were there! If you're visiting Boston, you won't regret staying with Carl and his family."

2754149,44892994,2015-08-30,7857186,Pavel,"We loved our stay at Carl's place, and would stay again in the future. Carl is an amazing person, who made us feel like at home, and helped us schedule our vacation by offering numerous suggestions on what should see. It was a pleasure to listen to him because he is a great storyteller, and has many interesting stories to share from his rich background."
Area around the house is very quiet. Our sleep was deep and refreshing. After spending five days in Boston at his place,we felt reenergized.,,,,

2754149,47356386,2015-09-18,37628901,Manuela,"La descripción de la habitación coincidía completamente con la realidad. Nos sentimos muy bien recibidos, estuvieron muy pendientes de nuestra llegada y recibimiento, de orientarnos en que hacer y como hacerlo. Fueron muy queridos y atentos y nos hicieron sentir como en casa.  Todo era muy limpio y aseado."
La habitación queda muy cerca (menos de 5 minutos a pie) de una estación del metro,que es una línea que conecta fácilmente con los lugares de interés y a 10 minutos de otra estación de metro que también conecta con otras líneas. El barrio es tranquilo y seguro.,,,,
La habitación es amplia con espacio muy suficiente.,,,,,
Quedamos completamente satisfechos con esta elección,"volveríamos a hospedarnos y lo recomendamos.\"",,,,
2754149,48999486,2015-09-30,20857080,Bettie,Carl and Cece made me feel right at home.  The room is comfortable and the apartment is convenient to public transportation.
2754149,49599018,2015-10-05,34067022,Bonnie,We were only with Carl and his family for two nights but we had an absolutely amazing experience with them. They were so pleasant and helpful and made some great recommendations that were definite highlights of our quick visit to Boston. We even had the absolute pleasure of being spoiled by Carl since he made us pancakes one morning. We will definitely be back to stay with them on our next trip to Boston!
2754149,52486603,2015-10-30,2951744,Ben,"Smooth, cosy and comfortable; Carl and Ceci were very warm and welcoming people.  They went out of their way to make us feel at home and have great suggestions on things to do in their part of Boston. Thoroughly recommended!"
2754149,53695836,2015-11-11,46294297,Julie,The house and room were just perfect. The hosts are warm and friendly and it was a very comfortable space. I will absolutely stay there again.
2754149,56067723,2015-12-08,45581274,Ulrike,"Carl was the best host we have had so far. He was so nice and welcoming, we immediately felt home when we came to his house. It is a very nice neighborhood with good access to the trains to get to the city. The room and all the house was very clean, he provided us everything we needed like towels and maps of all kinds. The bed was very comfi and the nights were quiet. The communication before and during our stay was perfect, he gave us very good instructions how to get to his home. We had a delicious breakfast together, learned a lot from Carl about many kinds of things and he gave us some very good recommendations about restaurants and places to see. We had a great time there and would definitely recommend it!"
2754149,62618496,2016-02-15,14757319,Céline,"Carl and his family are the best hosts!  Even before our arrival, Carl was very thoughtful and made our arrival very easy. Their apartment is great and well located (not even 15 minutes walk from Jackson Park station on the orange line, the bus for Cambridge is 10min away). I would recommend Carl's and Cecilia's place to anyone who wants to spend some time in Boston."
2754149,65813713,2016-03-17,57615826,Joshua,Carl and his family were great hosts. We had wonderful 4 nights in their house and wonderful days in Boston. The communication was really good from the first day of contact over mail. Carl got us an perfect description how we will get to the apartment. He and his family welcome us so warmly and showed us everything in the house. We had a nice room with enough space for two people. We could use all kind of things in the kitchen what we needed. We will never forgot the long conversations with Carl and Ceci and the lovely pancakes he mades us for breakfast. Thank you so much!! It was a wonderful stay and we recommend this place to everyone who wants to visit Boston.
2754149,68679453,2016-04-06,49268078,Ginette,My stay at Carl's hoem was a dream and I have one wish: to go back to them with my daughter to present them his wonderful family.
The room was perfect all very clean; their are not only very professional guests who explain you how to take the transportations or to go to shop but they share more : their hearth their humanity; Carl's wife is wellcome and take care of you more than a simple guest because it comes from the hearth;I also had the occasion to speak with the son who is a very sensible and intelligent boy and with already a great sense of justice with a wonderfull project for his life; I was fascinated; On sunday they share with me delicious pancackes (Carl is a great cooker); he also showed me his garden,explained me all the kinds of birds that he feed during winter and offering me a WONDERFULL cream for my hands made by him (I'll not reveal the secret of the composition); as it was snowing,"he brought me with his car to the Museum of Fine arts and to the airport : in one word my stay with Carl and his family was TO STAY IN A VERY WELLCOMING HOME Thank you Carl C and Z!\"",,,
2754149,70058941,2016-04-15,71553,Lesley,"Carl greeted us and made us feel very welcome.  Really a good vibe throughout the house.  If you like interesting conversations about everything from A-Z and hosts that are very community minded, this is the place for you.  Carl and his family love Boston and very knowledgeable about the area and the buildings.  I bet if we lived in Boston we would be friends!"
2754149,71399646,2016-04-25,16132255,Natalya,Very nice place not far from metro stations. Carl is a very friendly and pleasant person.
2754149,74975715,2016-05-17,57074420,Anna,"We really enjoyed our stay with Carl and his family. His communication before and during our time in Boston was excellent—he has lots of insight on a variety of topics and was able to give us some great suggestions. The description was accurate—it’s a clean, comfortable room in a warm home (with a full kitchen) in a quiet neighborhood, close to public transit and grocery stores. We stayed a week and had several opportunities to visit with our friendly and generous hosts (we were treated to a delicious pancake breakfast and heartfelt conversation) and were even treated by seeing some birds and blooms in their urban garden. We recommend staying at this Mission Hill gem."
2754149,77838995,2016-06-04,61838062,Christine,The host canceled this reservation 67 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2754149,85912590,2016-07-13,62757515,Brandi,Carl and Cece were amazing and so helpful! The house was a great location and everything was easy access.
2754149,92437564,2016-08-08,16875653,Paul & Georgina,Carl's place near the vibrant Jamaica Plain was a wonderful place for us to base our trip to Boston. The house and garden and beautiful and it is a lot more peaceful than being right in the city.
Transportation was easy; it's a 10 minute walk to the T line (orange or green) but we mostly used the city bike share,which was cheap and easy to use. It was around a 25 minute cycle (on tree-lined cycle track all the way to Back Bay) to the heart of Boston.,,,,
Carl and his family made us feel very welcome in their home and even made us a pancake breakfast one day! Above all,"these are wonderful people who believe in living life the right way and they would be welcome to stay with me in the UK any time. \"",,,,
2754149,99098903,2016-09-03,25432756,Emile,"What a great place to stay. First of all, the room is spacious and the house is very, very clean. Tomatoes from the yard are a plus. Boston downtown is about 20 minutes away. Cecilia and her son Ziggy did everything to help us get settled and had wonderful tips for things to do in Boston. When we had to leave, it felt like saying goodbye to family! Highly recommended"
8400275,48147366,2015-09-23,42096942,Shay,"First of all, when you book this apartment Sean will send you instructions to how to get the keys for it. They were very treasure hunt style and we loved it lol."
The apartment itself is old but well kept. The linen and towels were clean and so were the dishes in the kitchen,which is well equipped with electronic devices.,,,,
The apartment is VERY close to Fenway Park (you can see it from the window),"and close to a lot of restaurants and bars. We felt safe walking around the neighborhood.\"",,,,
8400275,48463993,2015-09-26,41968812,Christopher,Great location if you are going to a game at Fenway. The apartment is not much to look at but your expectations going in should reflect that. I was there just for sleep and for that it was just fine.
8400275,49066182,2015-09-30,16747567,Sierra,"Easy to book, gain access and check out. Modest accommodations were perfect for my needs. Good location with green space, community gardens across the street, a few blocks from quick bites and public transit."
8400275,49381994,2015-10-03,170203,Cory,"The apartment is small, but just as depicted in the photos.  All the basics are there and nothing more, so great for a short stay in Boston.  The location is great -- literally overlooks Fenway."
The only problem I have is the key access. It's left in a lockbox and when I arrived late at night,"that's in the middle of a homeless man's camp. It took 15 minutes of first befriending and then paying him before he would move his things around so that I could get access to the key. I'm a man used to living in big cities and this was not comfortable for me. I'm certain that other people would have felt very uncomfortable in this situation.\"",,,,
8400275,49516917,2015-10-04,36039344,Becky,Awesome location! Fenway out the window! So cool. Sean was great! CVS around the corner. Good for a quick night in Boston!
8400275,49687474,2015-10-05,44457026,Zachariah,Everything was great! Excellent location and price. No complaints at all.
8400275,49927223,2015-10-07,24636880,Vincent,We stayed at Sean's property off of Boylston St.
The location was fantastic! You're within walking distance to Fenway's great nightlife as well as streets like Newbury & Massachusetts for shopping/dining. You also get a great view of Fenway Park,especially when the sun sets.,,,,
You're also about 1/4 mile from the Kenmore terminal and a weekly unlimited pass is only $19 which takes you all over Boston.,,,,,
The apartment is a little bare/minimalist but all we needed was a place to sleep and freshen up so it worked out. The elevator may look janky but we never got stuck.,,,,,
Sean will send you instructions on how to obtain keys. Make sure you get those ahead of time!,,,,,
Overall,the apartment itself could use some TLC but the price reflects that because you're paying a third of what the hotels are charging. If you're on a budget,"I absolutely recommend booking with Sean.\"",,,
8400275,50022143,2015-10-08,44952098,Kristen,Great place right across from Fenway Park!  Sean gave great directions and instructions on how to find the apartment.  He also was quick to respond with any questions.  We had a fantastic time in Boston thanks to this airbnb stay.
8400275,50106667,2015-10-09,28027244,Lauren,Let me start by saying that Sean kept us up to date over the course of a few hours while he straightened out a situation with the keys he has to various properties. I can give credit where it's due. We arrived after dark and had no problem finding the place or the lock box where the keys are kept.
My problem lies within the actually apartment itself. The bed is listed as a 'real bed' but is in fact a futon frame with a standard mattress being used as the box spring and a futon mattress on top of that. This is an older apartment building and I realized that walking in but full strides weren't taken to clean the place. The chair and comforter both have significant stains on them.,,,,,
We don't ask for the world from our Airbnb hosts. We don't need shiny new things and brand new high rises but this place wasn't well tended for in the least.,,,,,
We called Airbnb in the morning,"told them our concerns and immediately left. We were originally booked for 4 nights and had we arrived in the daylight never would have stayed for the first.\"",,,,
8400275,50595229,2015-10-12,4073752,Kjahn17,"It was exactly what we needed.. A place to lay our heads down at night after getting into town late! Great area, felt very safe! Great first experience using Airbnb"
8400275,50738759,2015-10-14,26698873,John,"The apartment was clean and in a very convenient location, just what we needed for our short stay."
There were signs that the kitchen and bathroom were being decorated,this will improve these areas a great deal. The kitchen equipment was a little short on cups.,,,,
We found the key pick up a little awkward but phoned Sean and it was sorted.,,,,,
"Overall we thought the accommodation provided was good value for money.\"",,,,,
8400275,51034297,2015-10-17,724596,Sheilah,"The apartment appears as in the photos. It was a clean and bright with clean towels and linens. The neighborhood was very centrally located, with a view of Fenway outside the window. It was very easy to walk to the T station. There was nice greenery nearby, and you were a short walk to the Charles River as well. This is a good, basic accommodation option if you're on a budget."
8400275,51883005,2015-10-25,31253910,Chloe,"We only met Sean for a short while however he was lovely and very helpful, even giving us advice on a good coffee shop in the area and leaving us some coupons. The actual building was quite old but great size for a couple. Loved having the kitchen and bathroom all to ourselves as well. The neighbour did play loud music until 1:30am on our first night but we didn't mind as it was an experience and we had a short stay. It was a Friday night though so may not be such an issue at other quieter days of the week. Loved the place and would definitely recommend to all."
8400275,53884926,2015-11-14,45032076,John,"\"Host have very clear instructions about how to get to the place and how to get the key via a lockbox (a bit sketchy but nothing to bad).  The apartment is located in a great area; it's about five minutes from the Kenmore t stop which is right near Fenway. However once getting into the apartment we were a bit disappointed. While we expected a smal place we were not expecting the room to be boiling hot and between the heat and the noise (from Fenway area, complex itself wa very quiet) it was impossible to sleep in. With no thermostat to change heat and what appeared to be a futon to sleep on despite \"\"real bed\"\" being listed we ended up leaving the apartment at midnight. Overall the price was cheap but I guess you get what you pay for. Would not stay in again.\""
8400275,54079632,2015-11-15,19734179,Jiwoo,I did very last minute booking and everything went well. Key pickup and dropoff was easy as mentioned in Sean's email. The apartment was simply equipped for basic needs and  good enough for overnight staying. Location was very good and short walk to Newbury street. Cleanness did not meet my expectation though.. Carpet in the bedroom was dirty so i had to put my slippers on and there were hairs in the bathroom and trash bin was filled with wastes in the bathroom. Obviously no one cleaned up the place after the last guest had left before me. It was noisy outside until 3am but it did not bother me much. Considering Boston's average room rate it is value for money but it needs improvement for cleaning.
8400275,54438476,2015-11-20,13404829,Chia-Hui,It is a special experience. The location is so convenient  and the price is so friendly. Sean always response quickly when we face the questions.
8400275,55208781,2015-11-29,4483321,Meghan,"Sean is a great host! His place is clean, simple, and conveniently located. My family (two adults, one small child) stayed at Sean's over the Thanksgiving holiday. The apartment was easy to get to (Sean provides great instructions) - close to two metro stops and lots of shops, places to eat. We had a great time. Sean provided clean towels and sheets; there is also wi-fi. We could have stayed at a hotel for twice the price and no kitchen - but why do that? Sean's is highly recommended!"
8400275,55785774,2015-12-06,44984266,Fabio,"I have been in this apartment for 9 days. Sean is a very kind and nice guy, always available to help and solve (eventual) issues. The apartment is nice for one or two people maximum, it is comfortable, warm and well furnished. I have to say that the building doesn't seem to be very recent and the apartment is not completely well maintained, but this was not a problem at all. The flexibility of the check-in and check-out is also very useful. Just the e-mail communications with Sean, in my opinion, can be improved in order to receive answers with reasonable time in advance."
8400275,56443987,2015-12-13,11337515,Andreas,"The place was nice and thanks for the price.  I didn't meet Sean, but he was responsive to messages."
8400275,56545868,2015-12-14,25496364,Karissa,Sean was very nice and gave clear instructions on how to get in the apartment. I liked that my husband and I didn't have to be there at any particular time. We were able to get the keys when we arrived.
While it was nice to be so close to the nightlife of Boston,it was a little too close. We arrived on a Saturday night and were within walking distance of an awesome bowling alley/bar. However,this bar is literally right outside of the window of the apartment and people were out being very loud until about 3am,so we didn't get much sleep.,,
Because of this,I would recommend the apartment to people interested in experiencing Boston nightlife. It's not for people looking for a good night's sleep.,,,,
The building is pretty run down. The elevator is a bit scary- like one that you've only seen in black and white movies. It reminded me a bit of the Tower of Terror at Disney World.,,,,,
The walls of the building are paper thin so you can easily hear people in the other apartments.,,,,,
The apartment is on the grungy side. It looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in a long time. There is no top sheet on the futon bed. There is no television but there is internet.,,,,,
We weren't told what time to leave the next day so we were planning on noon. A little before noon,the door unlocked and 3 people walked in. They were the next renters and were told it was okay to come. It would have been nice if Sean let me know as the bed was not made and we had a few dishes to do. I felt bad having the next people come in without having the place cleaned a bit first.,,,,
Overall,"it was not a horrible experience. It was fun being in that area despite not getting much sleep. You get what you pay for I guess. \"",,,,
8400275,56721500,2015-12-17,46807440,Christian (Chien),Me and my girlfriend and her friend stayed at Sean's place for three days. The place is just as Sean described on the webpage.
Really coazy apartment and it was really nice to have the kitchen and all. Our friend though,had to sleep on the floor and she said the heater was not warm enough. But everything else made us feel at home. I personally really liked the elevator haha!,,,,
Sean was really nice although I was too sick to wake up to say hi,but my girlfriend had the chance to meet him. In all,"We had a really nice time in Boston!\"",,,
8400275,57382201,2015-12-25,41971378,Lucas,Sean is a great host ! I didn't have the chance to see him but I enjoyed the quick replies in the emails ( even at midnight ! )
8400275,57598250,2015-12-27,51766258,Gu,It's a good place. Great neighborhood!
8400275,57885693,2015-12-30,1545993,Turner,"Sean's place was great. We were looking for something inexpensive but centrally located, and being right near Fenway was perfect."
"Sean himself was very responsive whenever we had questions and the check in and check out process was as easy as can be.\"",,,,,
8400275,58192846,2016-01-01,10963741,Scott,"Sean's place is tidy, and is in a great location. Thanks!"
8400275,58295985,2016-01-02,31130805,Nicole,My partner and I had a wonderful time staying at Sean's apartment.  The apartment was exactly as Sean described it.  Having the kitchen to use was very convenient.  The building is a bit rundown but very typical for the area and it really didn't put us off.  The location is perfect.  We stayed during winter but would highly recommend a stay if you're going to a Sox game!  Sean was really nice and easy to get in touch with.  We would definitely stay again.
8400275,58804295,2016-01-05,23793993,Simone,Quaint apartment in a beautiful area. Walking through the park was beautiful even in winter.  The proximity to the station and restaurants was very convenient for getting around.
8400275,59480248,2016-01-11,39656789,Matthew,"Sean's place is prime location for night life activities. The bare necessities are provided in the apartment. It's perfect if you and your friends or significant other want a night or two to go out. There are tons of bars within a ten minute walk, it was nice I didn't have to get a cab or take the T anywhere. Thanks Sean."
8400275,59672190,2016-01-13,42024505,Claudien,Nice room and Sean is show avaible for any problems.
"The appartment is ideally located for turism!\"",,,,,
8400275,61396023,2016-02-03,243883,Joseph,Easy check in and check out. Nice apartment with a nice view. Thanks Sean!
8400275,61991368,2016-02-10,46792685,Yanhui,"The place was great, located near subway station and close to downtown. The first day we arrived late due to the flights, having some trouble finding keys. Sean was very helpful, we called him several times and he was very patient! One night, Internet was down and he helped immediately. All in all, it was a good place to stay, thanks Sean."
8400275,62514571,2016-02-15,52961966,Haley,"The apartment was literally right around the block from Fenway, a great location for getting around Boston. The building was old but well maintained, as was the apartment. We had trouble getting the keys at first, it seemed like Sean didn't really communicate with the people before us, but a quick call squared everything away. Sean was extremely responsive and helped us out when there were issues. The key to get into the building was quite finnicky, but we got lucky and someone let us in. The apartment was clean and well maintained, although the bed frame seemed to be broken. The result was a bed that bowed in the middle and was a little uncomfortable to sleep on because we were stuck in the middle. Other than the bed, the room was as described and overall it was a great stay! You get what you pay for and all in all this was a steal in a great location!"
8400275,63364976,2016-02-22,46980439,Lindsey,"Sean was reachable and responded fast almost always with an exception of a couple times. The keys were easy to find however, when we entered the building the key broke off in the lock. We called Sean and he had me hold on for almost five minutes while he talked to someone else in the same room as him. After he seemed annoyed and told us we had to wait until someone left the building because he was busy and couldn't come let us in for an hour and a half. He did get us a new key once the lock was fixed which was good."
Continuing with a bad first impression,there was a foul odor when we went to the apartment so we opened the windows only to realize the gas stove had been left on and was leaking gas in the apartment. The bed is also a futon held up by paint cans and would not stay still at night so we put the mattress on the floor. The toilet comes up when you sit on it too.,,,,
"The area is awesome though and everything is in walking distance. We knew we wouldn't be staying anywhere fancy (you get what you pay for) but we were expecting something a little more clean. Would not stay again or recommend. \"",,,,,
8400275,63592517,2016-02-24,31674809,Gabrielle,"Fantastic experience, I booked last minute and was grateful to have somewhere to stay while away on business. Apartment was everything he said and a great location, the elevator is fun too! Thanks for everything"
8400275,63682631,2016-02-25,60118946,Kimberly Lauren,Sean was incredibly helpful and responsive and answered all of our questions as this was one of our first experiences with airbnb. The apartment had an awesome location right by the House of Blues which is where we were going to a concert so it was perfect for us!
8400275,65224139,2016-03-12,47830607,Jolana,"The Apartment has a great location, it's close to the next T-Station and only a few minutes walking to stores and restaurants."
The size of the Apartment is enough for 3 People. We got a Queensize bed and another Queensize mattress. Only the kitchen is really tiny.,,,,,
But unfortunally there are some things to crizice...,,,,,
1. It's an old building and the old pipes are really loud - if you have a light sleep it's nothing for you,,,,,
2. It wasn't that clean as we aspect it,on the floor in the main room were crumbs & fluff and in the bathroom black hair.,,,,
3. There were mouse traps in every room. So I didn't have the best feeling sleeping on a mattress or leaving food out.,,,,,
If you are traveling on low Budget like me you may can live with these things.,,,,,
"The area and location is great and it's affordable!\"",,,,,
8400275,65593316,2016-03-15,21428066,Kathy,Sean was a great host. The internet wasn't working when we arrived but props to Sean for staying up until 11:30pm on a Sunday night to get it fixed (& we knew how busy he is with his kids!) We didn't need the wifi but it was nice to wake up and see how much he did for us. Thanks Sean!
"The place itself is at a great location. The apartment was good enough for our needs & close by the school I had my interview. \"",,,,,
8400275,66894671,2016-03-25,9534447,Felix,"Great location and easy communication with Sean. The photos accurately reflect the apartment, the building is a bit run down, but the internet works great."
8400275,67374483,2016-03-29,46668097,Wayne,"This was my first Airbnb and didn't know what to expect but Sean was very helpful with the questions I had. The apartment was clean and simple The space was small as expected but perfect for what we needed A place to sleep, shower , and have breakfast as we were out of the room most of the time. We were going to a convention at the Prudiental center which was only a 12min walk which nice. Also there was a drugstore, a couple of bars/restaurants, and a supermarket within a 7 min walk. The area  around the apartment was safe and well lit and had no reservations of walking back as late as 2am one night. Would stay again."
8400275,67721251,2016-03-30,16192089,Alonso,"It was a great experience. Sean was very responsive and sent out detail instructions on everything. The back view was Fenway so it was nice. Overall, a nice overall Bostonian experience."
8400275,67960032,2016-04-01,16330490,Ankur,"Upon arrival at 1:00pm (check in time was listed at noon) the sheets on the bed were dirty as were the towels. The floor and carpet definitely needed sweeping and vacuuming. I called Sean and he was a bit snappy on the phone saying he was one his way to do all the laundry. When we came back later that day, however, everything looked pretty clean and we appreciated the thorough job Sean did to tidy up the place."
There is a pipe in the room that rattles very loudly at night every hour or so,making it very hard to sleep. You can also hear everything your neighbors are doing at all hours.,,,,
The best part about this place is the location right next to Fenway park. We enjoyed the proximity to great restaurants and cafes. The park right in front of the building was nice to jog and walk around.,,,,,
Overall,I felt safe and for our purposes of simply needing a bed to sleep in at night,it was sufficient. It's true you get what you pay for,but next time I'd rather pay a bit more for a nice place and a more punctual,responsive host.,

8400275,68201731,2016-04-02,29814102,Michael,"I didn't meet Sean but he was very responsive via email and provided clear instructions.  The place is in a great location.  The accommodations aren't luxurious, but as described."
8400275,69854528,2016-04-14,53171269,Morgan,"The neighborhood was nice, and right around the corner from Fenway Park which was our main attraction. It was quite a walk from the downtown area with bars, restaurants, stores etc. However we didn't mind all the walking because Boston is a great walking city. Driving around is intense until you get used to it, and parking is atrocious. We spent 100$ just on parking and had to walk an hour to get to our car. We tried to double park on the street in front of the listing to carry our bags up quick and retrieve our key, but extremely rude cops monitor the area enforcing a resident only parking policy."
8400275,70066085,2016-04-15,443694,Nancy,"We had a great time at Sean's place and it was nice to actually meet him.  The condo is not huge but it is comfy, with a pleasant light through the windows.  You can take the lift to the third floor, but the steps are not a challenge.  The location is great - Fenway Park is almost under the window and a city park, museums, galleries, shopping, and Symphony Hall are truly a short walk away. Parking at the nearby Shell dealer cost us 40 dollars for 24 hours.  We hope to stay here again on our next overnight."
8400275,70668677,2016-04-19,875425,Spencer,"Sean wrote detailed instructions, and both getting to the place from the airport and finding the key was easy.   The apartment is in a nice area, if a bit loud due to the proximity to the bars next to Fenway.  It'd be a cute place, but unfortunately - it's not very clean.  Nor is it well supplied.  There was a paint  roller tray stashed on the side of the bathtub. which was strange.  The toilet lid hadn't looked like it was cleaned in more than a few days/weeks, and the walls of the apartment all looked like they could use a scrubbing.  The carpet needs to be vacuumed.  My girlfriend and I stayed there for a long weekend, and for the purpose of our trip, not staying in the apartment much at all, it worked.  But it really needs some work.  We went to a grocery store and bought some tea to have in the evening, which is when we discovered that there was one mug in the apartment.  All of the cutlery was dirty.  There were random half empty bits of hygiene products in the medicine cabinet.  Which is great if you need and feel comfortable using a half empty can of gold bond powder.   Given even a half-ass effort, this place could be a lot more comfortable and even a great experience.  The pillows are terrible and the bed hardly big enough for two people.  I don't even think it had the right size frame, and given that he simply wanted us to dump the garbage on our way out, I am not convinced that the sheets are changed between guests.  The toilet sure isn't cleaned, nor the carpets vacuumed.   It was convenient but kind of gross to stay here.  I'd look elsewhere."
8400275,71431976,2016-04-25,21186640,Maggie,"Sean was very responsive and nice, gave good details about how to get to the building and find the keys, and the price was definitely right. The place is very old, which can't be helped, but it was also dirty, which can be helped."
8400275,71984693,2016-04-30,41957302,Belen,Es un buen lugar para quedarse unos días en boston. tiene una cocina bastante completa y la cama es comoda. queda cerca de lineas de subte y de calles comerciales. el barrio es hermoso
8400275,72217872,2016-05-01,34779572,Louisa,Sean's apartment was great for the price in the area that it was in.. Couldn't beat the view right outside the window of Fenway park. Sean's communication for the key entry was also very detailed and helpful. The only downfall is that the parking is very expensive. I don't know if this is possible but maybe the permit parking sticker can be shared with the air bnb tenants where they would put it on their dashboard of the car upon staying and then leave it in the apt when departing from their stay.
8400275,72584972,2016-05-03,65893183,Jocelyne,Great place! Perfect to go crash after being out and about. Definitely want to stay again even for a weekend in Boston!
8400275,73067728,2016-05-06,6806104,Brett Will,"A good inexpensive find in Boston. Is it 5-star?  No.  But it's a good find if/when you're visiting on a budget.  The place was clean, the futon was comfortable (bonus for foam mattress on top), and the view of Fenway definitely tells you that you're in Boston.  Be sure to check out Island Creek Oyster Bar when you stay.  It's less than 10 minute walk and has rockin' good food."
"Sean also is great at communication.  \"",,,,,
8400275,74858963,2016-05-17,25757754,Matt,"A cozy place! Sean was very friendly and helpful, stopping by to check in on everything and willing to chat about local life in Boston. He ensured that the place was in good shape and bed and towels were clean. Although I had a little trouble with the deadbolt, Sean promptly arrived to help and fix the issue. The flat is well located off the Green Line and walkable to grocery stores, universities, shops, and restaurants in the area. Highly recommended for a short stay for one or two people."
8400275,75320003,2016-05-20,71379042,Sasha,"Staying at Sean's place was a great experience. The location is excellent for museums, baseball, MIT and all of Boston really. Everything is as described."
"Sean was a wonderful host. He helped us a lot even after we checked out. Thanks again Sean!\"",,,,,
8400275,75522500,2016-05-22,49634609,Adam,"Great location, able to see Fenway Park from the window. As a place to crash for the night, this suited us well."
8400275,77076462,2016-05-30,31945321,Eva-Deane,"Location was great, even though we didnt meet Sean he seemed nice. The place itself wasn't the greatest. It was dusty and dirty so we ended up checking out early."
8400275,77635080,2016-06-02,60658127,Dayna,"This apartment was smaller than I though, but it was a good size for just me and my boyfriend. I couldn't imagine having more than 2 people in the apartment. The apartment was easy to find and the instructions sent by Sean were easy to follow. The keys to the building and apartment stuck a bit, but we were able to make it work. While the apartment was comfortable, it would have been nice to have a coffee machine instead of an espresso machine. The bathroom was functional, although the water was either super hot or freezing cold. Also, while towels were provided, we only received bath towels with no hand towels or wash clothes. The bed was comfortable with clean sheets. However, there are no shades on the windosw, so the morning light streams directly into the bedroom. Blinds or blackout shades would be nice. The neighborhood was great and we could walk or take the T to any place in the city.  All said , I would probably stay again because the price and location were good."
8400275,77930464,2016-06-04,49243114,Marcus,Very good location. Sean fixed some problems quickly. Good for a couple of days.
8400275,78975893,2016-06-10,50375794,Juan Andres,"Nos sentimos un poco desencantados. Las instrucciones para conseguir las llaves no eran del todo claras, la red wifi no existía y luego la password no funcionaba. El departamento refleja lo que aparece en las fotos pero necesita una limpieza urgente  y un nuevo colchón para la cama. Por este precio se puede conseguir algo mejor seguramente. La ubicación es buena ya que hay metro y estación de bicicletas cerca asi como el estadio de los boston red sox. En conclusión, no lo recomendaría por falta de limpieza, no tiene TV ni sofá y la mala relación precio-calidad."
8400275,79652397,2016-06-13,4546128,Daniel,"I will start with the positives. The location seems very nice, your close to Fenway and easy access to get all over Boston. Sean seemed nice on the phone."
Onto the negatives. The key that Sean left us would not open the front door of the apartment complex. I tried about every way you can for a key but no luck. Called Sean who assured me that key should work,but never could get it to open the door. A couple finally came outside so we just went in then after trying for about 30 minutes. I wish I had never got into the building. The apartment was disgusting. I'm not a massive clean freak,or germaphobe,but I can't imagine how any Airbnb host could expect someone to stay in that filth. The kitchen was stained everywhere,there was old food in the fridge,expired milk etc. The bathroom was equally disgusting
I have stayed in Airbnb's literally all over the world and have never encountered anything like this. Sure,some aren't the most clean or pleasant but they have always been passable. Sean's apartment is not even close and he shouldn't be allowed to rent it with out some serious asterisks attached to his listing. Like,"\"\"if you enjoy staying in apartments that match the cleanliness of a college fraternity","then this apartment is for you\"\". I really don't like leaving a review like this but no one should rent this apartment without knowing exactly what they are getting themselves into. \"",,
8400275,79961769,2016-06-15,62017892,Michelle,Great location
8400275,80551989,2016-06-18,2883804,Mariela,"The apartment is nice and is also well located, but we had too many problems with keys. Front door key was crummy and we always had to wait for someone coming or leaving to get in, even after midnight, wich wasn't funny. The lock of the apartment wasn't good as well, as soon as we arrived the key got stuck (it was 7am) and we had to wait for Sean to change it; we were carrying all our luggage so we had to spend 4 hours in a bar until that. The apartment wasn't clean as expected, considering this charge is included in the final price. Unfortunately I can't recommend it, hope it helps him to work on a solution."

8400275,84878362,2016-07-09,20432308,Mara,"Sean was a great host. The apartment is in an awesome location, especially if you're a baseball fan! We could see Fenway from the window and watch the excitement. Everything was clean, and the bed was extremely comfortable."
8400275,86810790,2016-07-17,53768341,Kerry,Thank you for a great stay.
8400275,87363816,2016-07-19,15844532,Pauline,Sean was really helpful and gave us detailed instructions to go to the apartment. He was really responsive.
The main asset of the apartment is its location : just behind fenway park and with great access to public tra sportation. It fits perfectly for a couple. The main inconvenient is that you can hear the neighbours (it's not Sean's fault,but I prefer mentioning it). The kitchen wasn't clean,"but the rest of the apartment was fine\"",,,
8400275,89257169,2016-07-27,43801470,Matthew,Sean’s apartment was absolutely perfect for my needs as I was in town for some Red Sox games and enjoyed the short three minute walk to and from Gate B.
Nearest Green Line T is only a five minute walk away.,,,,,
The Instructions for finding the location and collecting the keys were very thorough and easy to follow.,,,,,
The bedroom has air con which was a lifesaver as Boston was doing a pretty good impersonation of Florida while I was there.,,,,,
I found a few items of food and drink in the well equipped kitchen left by previous people which were very useful,I also left some for the next residents too.,,,,
Next time I visit Boston Sean will be the first name I look for.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
8400275,90878586,2016-08-02,16815496,Violet,"Great communication from Sean and excellent location, very convenient to transportation and restaurants. Had a fair amount of trouble with the front lock, it was temperamental if you didn't jiggle and turn it *just so*. There was vomit and a shattered window in the building's lobby after someone presumably had too much fun Friday night, and it didn't get cleaned up until Monday morning. And you can definitely hear someone's band practice in an adjacent apartment. If you can look past that sort of thing,  and bring your own earplugs, it's a fine place to crash while you explore Boston."
8400275,91311026,2016-08-04,23998320,Cathy,"Let me start by saying that the neighborhood and locTion was exactly as described and super convenient for Fenway events.  There is much to do nearby, yet it is a quiet apartment.  Sean left maps, and brochures for nearby things to do."
Check in was with a set of keys in a lockbox locked to a fence in a nearby park,which was interesting.  There were quite a few directions on the check in paperwork about a tricky building lock/key.  As it turns out,it was more than tricky.  We never got into the building with that key.  Both times we were struggling to get the key to work,"someone came up behind us and let us in.  I texted Sean from the concert we were attending that we were very concerned about getting in after the concert and he replied promptly that \"\"It is best not to let ourselves get anxious.  Really it works","and you need to just wiggle it rapidly but gently\"\".",
IT did not work for us.,,,,,
The apartment is old and furnished with shabby,worn furniture.  Just about every surface,including ceilings,walls,doors,tile had some spotty paint but nothing was completed.
This was the most alarming thing to my husband and me... No top sheet.  Not sure what that is all about but I didn't like it one bit.,,,,,
this place was not a good fit for us,"though I'm sure some people enjoy the location very much.\"",,,,
8400275,92903600,2016-08-10,65026920,Andrew,"Sean is a great host. We never actually met him, but we didn't need to. We were given all the information we needed to check-in and stay. The apartment is excellent, it couldn't be closer to Fenway unless we were actually staying in the bleachers. It is an old building so the water pressure isn't brilliant, but that's the only issue with the whole experience which is not much of a concern all things considered. Would highly recommend, and if we're in Boston again would definitely stay here again."
8400275,94143678,2016-08-14,22141019,Virginie,"Super séjour à Boston. L'appartement est très bien situé à proximité du métro, dans un quartier très animé et sympathique. La ballade à pied pour le centre ville est très agréable. Nous avons bien aimé le charme désuet de l'appartement."

Faltaban almohadas (solo había tres) y la bañera podía estar más limpia. Por otro lado el resto de la casa aunque pequeña, estaba muy bien, el barrio era muy agradable (al lado de Fenway park) y de fácil acceso al centro tanto andando como en metro."
13300621,80414327,2016-06-18,62584718,Amanda,Paige was extremely helpful and always responded in a timely manner. Listing was accurate and the neighborhood was perfect--near restaurants and shops on Charles St or steps away from the T and all that Boston has to offer.

Regarding the apartment,absolutely solid location - close to Boston commons,all the bars and tourist spots,and perfect for a weekend trip. The apartment itself was slightly smaller than I expected,but for 6 of us we did manage to stay there without any issues.,

Our trip was for Pearl Jam Fenway-only a $10 late night cab ride.  There is even a 24-hour CVS right around the corner.  Great neighborhood.

It is a 12min walk from Broadway Station (subway) or you can catch a bus much closer. The neighborhood is cute and quite. The place was very clean and stocked with any toiletry you might need. The beds are both memory foam, the firm kind. We slept very well. The movie lighting on the first floor is very cool, it makes for a beautiful ambiance for watching a movie or relaxing. Tiffany also provided a booklet for how everything in the house worked which was easy to follow and she also provided maps and recommendations about the restaurants in the area.

4090224,24464548,2014-12-29,21781077,Jeremy,Excellent place in Southie!  Tiffany was top notch.  She left us snacks and a bottle of wine - both of which came in handy with our 3 kids in tow.  She was also very responsive to every question we had.
The listing looked exactly like the pictures,with the welcome surprise of the couch that reclines electronically with the push of a button. The condo was well kept and clean.  Just having use of a new washer and dryer made the booking worthwhile.,,,,
If I had to note just a couple things to be mindful of - parking can be a concern,especially for us with 3 kids in carseats.  You park about 4-5 blocks away since there is no non-resident parking overnight.  Also,the top floors are very warm and cozy,but the main floor was a little chilly.  We fiddled with the thermostat and put the heat higher,but it didn't seem to fix it.  Really only a concern in the winter.  Tiffany let us know about the parking beforehand,so it was not a surprise to us.
"Everything else was great.  Very good location - we took the T downtown to Quincy market and the park.  Very happy with our stay!\"",,,,,

Tiffany not only added her personal touch with a welcome food basket but also was a great source of inforamtion in regard to the area. We would highly recommend this listing to anyone planning on staying in the Boston area."

She was really attentive to any questions.,,,,,

Tiffany was so helpful and accessible through our entire stay, even picking us up from the parking garage the day we arrived!  The bedrooms (upstairs) were spotless and cozy.  The living/kitchen area down (downstairs) has everything you might need for your stay.  Bathrooms are pristine.  Neighborhood felt safe and quiet but plenty of nightlife just a couple blocks walk.  We will definitely be back, hopefully before next January!"

The beds and pillows were SO comfortable, we slept like babies.  Tiffany even made sure a DVD player was available so I could do my workouts while on our business trip.  She left us some goodies in the fridge and we made some pancakes in the morning.  She always answered very quickly and gave a bunch of valuable suggestions.  We will absolutely be back!"

Her place is a beautifully renovated two story townhouse. This was great for us since we traveled with my parents and the layout gave us plenty of space. We cooked out on the deck one evening,on the other days we went out to one of the places in the neighborhood. Public transport is close,but we opted for Lyft to get into downtown.,,,

We had 9 members in our party and were only going to spend a couple of days in the area before heading home.  Tiffany went out of her way (literally!) to make it a good experience for us.  First, she made sure that we had enough sleeping space by providing 2 inflatable mattresses.  Second, she found parking for us on a nearby street and even verified that we'd be ok for the duration of our stay by checking on the street cleaning schedule.  We had a great time in Boston and Tiffany really helped make it so.  The house was very nice and was within walking distance to the subway (red line)."

We had a very comfortable stay and certain added touches-like a hotel-style dispenser in the shower and pretty LED candles in the cozy and lovely backyard-were a nice touch.  Tiffany responded immediately to my request for a security code change for the front door when I suspected our code may have been compromised.

4090224,46868669,2015-09-14,34596154,Josh,"STOP LOOKING!  You've found your place to stay in Boston.  There is nothing else Tiffany could have done from the time of booking to the end of the trip to make the stay more enjoyable.  The house was spotless, comfortable, roomy, featured an easy check-in and check-out, and was absolutely perfect for my group.  There is everything you could need there but the star of the show is Tiffany -- she will go above and beyond to make sure your trip is all that you hope for.  Book with confidence."
4090224,48172846,2015-09-24,1566944,Christof,Just great. Calm street and super nice backyard.
4090224,48340112,2015-09-25,39377191,Denise,Myself and my party found Tiffany's home to be a fantastic place to stay. It was clean and well stocked with everything you could possibly need. I would 100% stay again if I were to visit Boston.
4090224,48674451,2015-09-28,30567299,Ramon,Tiffany's home was on a lovely quiet street in South Boston. It is an 8 minute walk to Broadway on the red subway line. From the time of booking to check in Tiffany was superb with her level of information and keeping us informed of things like parking and how to get to certain attractions. A+ for communication.
There was plenty of space for our family of two adults and three children in this three bedroom home. Amenities supplied was excellent with everything you would expect plus extras you wouldn't (pancake mix,frozen pizzas etc).,,,,
After Tiffany showed us around and explained things like the cable,wifi and AC usage she left us alone and let us enjoy our Boston stay. When we did have any question she would respond to messaging instantly.,,,,
In short,"people like Tiffany are the models of excellence for airbnb. She was simply superb. Book with confidence.\"",,,,
4090224,49108212,2015-10-01,38122827,Jiwon,"깔끔하고 독립적인 공간이라는 점이 이 숙소의 가장 큰 장점입니다. 전문적인 숙박업소를 빌리는 것처럼 수건이나 샴푸 등이 준비되어 있어서 편리했습니다. 또한 동시에 거실과 주방, 세탁기 등이 있다는 점에서는 호텔보다 좋기도 했습니다. 친구들과 함께 총 8명이 묵었는데, 거실에서 같이 놀기도 하고 요리를 직접 해먹을 수 있어서 매우 좋았습니다. 비교적 가까운 거리에 식료품점 등이 있다는 점도 장점 중 하나입니다. 다만 주택가에 위치해 있어 여행만을 목적으로 방문하는 경우에는 (특히 대중교통을 이용하는 경우라면) 이동시간이 길어지고 관광 시간이 줄어들어 아쉬울 수 있습니다."
"가족 혹은 친구들끼리 여유롭게 지내기에 좋을 것 같습니다. 그리고 호스트의 메세지 답변이 빠르고 친절하다는 점도 좋았습니다.\"",,,,,
4090224,49311279,2015-10-03,34598885,Tala,We stayed for 2 nights - 4 adults and 3 kids.
Tiffany was the perfect hostess from A to Z!,,,,,
She followed up on our questions quickly,gave us super detailed info  about the house,worked super hard to give us the house in tip top shape,and provided everything that was listed and much more - hair products and tools,snacks,brochures and maps of the city etc. etc.
She even got a package for me that could not have been sent abroad!,,,,,
The house is amazing - super stylish and well equipped with everything you might need and didn't even think you'll need (the largest amount of towels I have ever seen in my life!).,,,,,
The location is great,Southie is a lovely neighbourhood and it's super close to downtown (Uber was 10-15 mins. for 8-10$). A convince store is just at the top of the street.,,,,
You will need to find a good parking spot (that might be challenging),but Tiffany is there to help you with that as well!,,,,
"Thank you Tiffany for the perfect hosting and for welcoming us to Boston! \"",,,,,
4090224,49424922,2015-10-04,32229558,Clarice,"Everything was perfect! The house was clean and as pictured on the website.

4090224,50864344,2015-10-15,29248139,Ashley,Tiffany was an amazing host. She was so easy to get in touch with and made sure that we had everything we needed for our stay. She was the absolute perfect host. Her place was even better than we could have ever imagined! Tiffany provided everything we could have ever needed for our stay and then some. The beds were so incredibly comfortable and the house was spotless. There were so many extra towels and extra bedding. It was absolutely perfect. The house was located on a very quiet street and conveniently located. We had no trouble finding parking on the street that Tiffany provided as a good place to park. We would definitely stay here again. In our opinion it was the perfect Airbnb!
4090224,51603209,2015-10-22,29978635,Janet,"\"House was fantastic. Really well equipped, heaps of towels,pillows, blankets, even toiletries! Kitchen really well set up, single cup coffee machine a bit of a pain to use, but there was coffee beans in the fridge. Lots of leaflets of tours etc on kitchen bench so they were easy to see. TV easy to use, plugged our iPad in and watched our own movie when we had a night in. Bit of a walk to metro 10 minutes but not difficult to find or navigate. A few places to eat close by also pharmacy which sold just about everything and a liquor and market next to each other. Tiffany's extra touches like flowers, towels all ready to use was really thoughtful. She was still there fixing things up as we arrived earlier than expected, and gave us a couple of good tips of where to eat, tried both and were good,  Lincoln Tavern andLocos Mexican both on Broadway within walking distance nice to stay somewhere that had been well decorated not just filled with unmatched left overs with no night time noise. Well equipped laundry too\"\" altogether a perfect stopover"
4090224,52476271,2015-10-30,24509500,Tom,We were attending a conference and found this great place and so convenient. Fun neighborhood with good restaurants. Had a great time.

The train is about a 10 min walk which was very convenient for us since we did not have a car.  The space was very clean and the pictures are very accurate of the place.  The location is not very far from the airport either, which was a big plus."
4090224,54722828,2015-11-23,34224182,John,"Tiffany was our host this past weekend while our party of four traveled to Boston for the Shamrock Series football game at Fenway Park.  We loved our South Boston location. Within easy walking distance we found all of the essentials:  Coffee shop/Bakery, grocery store, package liquor store and a very nice restaurant, Shenanigans. It appears to be a vibrant area and we felt safe walking to places after dark. There were always people out on their bicycles, walking their dogs or exercising."
Tiffany's home is very much as advertised and the photos accurately depict it's condition.  Our party of four was quite comfortable in the two bedrooms with the queen beds.  The living area on the first floor was spacious and the kitchen was well appointed.  We especially enjoyed our nightcaps out on the deck in the evenings.,,,,,
In no time,"we were experts at finding the Broadway \"\"T\"\" station and found our way to the North End",Copley Square,Boylston Street and Fenway.  We did take Uber on a couple of short trips out of the south end and their service was excellent.  Trattoria Il Panino is highly recommended for a great dinner.,,
Tiffany was a wonderful host and made the booking,"checking in and checking out process very simple. The information packet she sent to us prior to our trip was very detailed and helped us plan our trip before we arrived. She has done a marvelous job renovating her home and we would not hesitate to contact her again if we were to head back to Boston.\"",,,,
4090224,55345666,2015-12-01,38556851,Sarah,Tiffany was so welcoming and took great care of us during our stay!

She was extremely organized and helpful leading up to the stay, providing a complete guide to the house, as well as parking. The main apartment had a fully stocked kitchen in which we were able to whip up great dinners and breakfasts. The accommodations were super comfortable and the space felt very homey. Everyone in my group raved about the place. Location-wise, the T at Broadway (red line) was less than a ten minute walk and there were tons of restaurants and bars also less than ten minutes away. Don't hesitate to make a weekend out of staying here!"

Informational brochures were on the counter to help us plan our vacation, the kitchen has great basic amenities(coffee, tea, condiments, etc.) and the bathroom were also stocked with all necessary toiletries.  Tiffany was available to answer any questions that we had and give us some great ideas on places in the area to check out. The location was fantastic to catch the T, walk to area restaurants and gift shops, and hop in an Uber to places downtown Boston.  We felt at home, and had plenty of space of five guests for the weekend. We all agreed we would want to rent this place again if we ever came back to visit.  For my first AirBnB experience, it was a great first impression of using this site to plan vacations.  Thank you Tiffany for everything!"
4090224,61632760,2016-02-07,9508263,Elizabeth,"Great experience! The house was very well-appointed, comfortable, and well-stocked. Tiffany was super responsive and helpful, even with my idiotic inability to understand Boston's parking laws. We were in town for a conference at Copley Square and ended up with 11 people in the house one night, and it was totally fine. The beds and couch are comfortable and there is room for multiple air mattresses. I would highly recommend this house if you're looking for a comfortable and homey place to stay in Boston!"
4090224,63098280,2016-02-20,3268223,Betty,Tiffany's place was true to the description and photos. It was VERY spacious and comfortable. It is beautifully decorated and very clean. There was a pack and play ready for us as requested and she even went beyond and fulfilled my request to stock the fridge with a half gallon of milk for my kids (we arrived after a long trip overseas). Everything was easy to find and use in her beautiful home. She responded to all my inquiries in a timely manner and made our trip easy. I would DEFINITELY recommend this home for anyone looking to stay in the Boston area.

My only regret is that we did not spend enough time IN the home during our three day stay, as we were on a warp-speed college tour with two high-school juniors.  The home is beautiful, simultaneously new and yet old, and is a welcome quiet oasis in the city.  Tiffany was also very helpful with college insights! Thanks so much, Tiffany!"
4090224,67423001,2016-03-29,20931286,Kaitlyn,"We had an amazing experience at her home. It was a terrific use of space as the layout was awesome for our reunion with friends.  We were even given a nice bottle of wine when we arrived.  Throughout our stay Tiffany was completely accessible and would respond immediately. For instance, we had a little difficulty getting the wifi set up and through her guidance she helped us locate the router which we had unintentionally dislodged from power."
The house had great lighting including the steps to the downstairs which had motion sensors. The house was also a few blocks away from a Main Street where you could buy groceries or pick up some beer which made things very easy for our stay.,,,,,

Though our trip was short we all loved our stay. Not only was the home a pleasure but Tiffany was amazing. We had some things delivered to house since we were traveling with a 6 month old, and she went out of the way to make sure out packages were delivered safe and secure. We can not thank you enough for an amazing stay, we may just have to make it an annual trip!! Thanks again:)"

Tiffany was very easy to get in touch with and always quickly responded to any questions I had. The house is close to many places that my friends and I wanted to go to around the area which was very convenient. The street in which the house is located was nice as well-- quiet street.

4090224,75033703,2016-05-18,18893578,Nicole,"Tiff set up the whole place in a very user-friendly matter. The most helpful thing she set up was a document of instructions on how to work the thermostat, TV, etc. and another document of where to park. Also, I really liked that she uses a key code. That way, you can go to the place whenever you like. You can also choose your own code. The place is very nice and modern with more than enough towels, extra pillows, beddings, etc. it was great to have the in unit washer and dryer with all the soap provided. All 7 of us that stayed at the house were very happy and satisfied. I highly recommend setting up a vacation stay with Tiff!!"

4090224,76483730,2016-05-27,7044059,John,"It was a GREAT place.  Beautiful, clean, cozy, etc.  The description was accurate.  I was there for a graduation in Cambridge, and that was just a 25 minute drive with moderate traffic.  It is closer if your focus is downtown Boston.  The location is in South Boston."
Any criticisms or tips?  Hmm,first,I would note that there are no bedrooms on the first floor of this two story home,so it may be difficult for those with bad knees to make the walk upstairs (like my mom).  Second,it is in a residential area so if you want to walk around,it may be a bit difficult.  Maybe a 20 minute walk before you get to a more bustling area.
I would DEFINITELY recommend to anyone in search of a place for a larger group,"and don't mind the slight distance to downtown Boston.   And the host was lovely and responsive even though we never met. \"",,,,

It's location provided us with ample opportunities to travel into downtown Boston. If I would have any suggestions it would be to remove the pans out of the oven and provide a pan hanger for storage. Also there were not enough tea towels at hand."

It was very clean and really for us to check in early on the day we arrived. We appreciate the help from the host to keep our luggages late on the day we left. Everything is well prepared and I wish I could have spent more time in the house. Extra blankets and the air bed were ready for usage as well. Highly recommend!
4090224,82555496,2016-06-28,17195647,Elaine,Our experience staying at Tiffany's place wonderful.  I would definitely stay there again on my next visit to Boston as the location was also a plus.  The only thing that was challenging was finding parking as regulations are very stringent.

She even checked in with us in the middle of our trip to see if we needed anything. Her home is lovely, modern, clean and conveniently located close to bus, red line, restaurants, and a grocery store is a few minute walk. We felt completely safe and enjoyed our first trip to Bosyon very much. We will be back !!"

And it is very convenient for eat, shopping, and get taxis. The collection in the apartment is exactly what I'd like. My family and I are so pleased spent a very nice evening here. Everything is perfect. I hope I'll come back again."
7840797,53351415,2015-11-08,45615457,Nili,The apartment was absolutely beautiful and we didn't want to leave!
Very spacious living room and modern furniture and appliances.  We only used the refrigerator,but everything looked sleek.,,,,
The location was perfect (very close to the hop-on/off bus tour) and near all of the places we wanted to visit during our trip to Boston.,,,,,

7840797,61880162,2016-02-09,44729831,Michael,The accommodation provided was excellent. The apartment is luxurious in every way. The location is great - close to restaurants and shopping facilities. Only complaint was the garage door opener was not left so we had to open the door manually which wasn't fun when snowing heavily. Apart from that I have no complaints.
7840797,62699301,2016-02-16,51259439,Tim,"Even though we arrived at 1:30 am, our directions and instructions to find the keys were easy.  Once inside our apartment was spacious and very clean.  It was a great stay for our group attending a wedding in Boston."

Everything was tidy,beds were made up and there were enough amenities. The building is located centrally and easy to be reached.,,,,
In one of the bedrooms there was a continuous humming noise from an ac outside or something like that,which was a bit annoying.,,,,
But further than that we had a great stay and everything was as promised! Great for business,family,"city trips etc etc.\"",,,

There could be a few improvements -- basically the management company doesn't seem to be keeping the place up well. The kitchen was not well stocked in terms of pots and pans etc,the blinds in the living room are broken,faucets are loose,fan the bathroom is super loud so you can sleep if someone is showering,and there are no sings directing you to the trash room.,
This said,"we would definitely stay again.\"",,,,

13592046,88295990,2016-07-24,64526542,William,Space is basically a Hallway with three bedrooms and an oversized Kitchen.  It is not made clear how many people are behind the other 2 of the 3 bedrooms.   If you don't mind not knowing who else is behind the other doors then it shouldn't bother you.  3 people sharing one bathroom can be problematic
13592046,88787681,2016-07-25,57067987,Vice,Great host and reservation was great and we were so last minute!  Hang really came thru for us and allowed us to be comfortable

7287822,43005494,2015-08-16,40987177,Jessica,I loved staying with Susie. From start to finish she made it a wonderful experience.
I was in a tough spot and couldn't find a place to stay in Boston. The night before I left for Boston I came upon her listing,contacted her,hoping she would respond,and she messaged me back within the half hour to help me out. Susie was so kind and understanding.,,
When I arrived at her home,I marveled at how lovely her neighborhood was,as each home expressed so much character. It was quiet,friendly,and full of color.,
Susie met us in front of the house and introduced us to two of the sweetest dogs imaginable. When we got upstairs (through a private door) to our private studio my sister and I couldn't have been happier. The studio was neat,bright,private,spacious,airy,and it felt like a home away from home. I loved the spiral staircase to our private bathroom upstairs and we even had our own kitchen stocked with coffee and all the utensils we could need. The room was bigger than it had appeared in the photos and the beds were pretty comfy. The bathroom was very clean (this is important to most of you out there) and stocked with towels. There was wifi and a television with netflix and movies to keep us entertained during our down time. Check out was easy
Also,Susie's home is conveniently located 5 minutes away by walking to the Orange line or a quick 10-15 minutes cab ride into the heart of Boston.,,,,
Susie was very inviting and made us feel very comfortable.,,,,,
All I can say is if I ever have a reason to go back to Boston,Susie's home is the only place for me.,,,,

7287822,43452721,2015-08-19,38510003,John,"Susie was great. Very friendly, open, kind and considerate. Susie was able to provide a lot of background information on the area, sites to see, information about public transport and assistance with the greater Boston area."

Susie and her partner made an excellent orientation guide giving us unique tips about the neighborhood and house. Overall, we loved our stay and will plan to come again on our next trip to Boston!"
7287822,44042032,2015-08-23,32259319,Sebastien,"Awesome appartment! Perfectly spotted in an area we didn't know about in Boston! Jamaica Plain is great for a couple days in the city!

Make sure you meet her as soon as you can because she knows a lot about the city! She'll make you comfortable and secure for sure! Thanks for everything!"

Området är så fint med sina annorlunda hus och nära till både restauranger och tunnelbana. Ett perfekt sätt att få se lite mer av Boston! Vi är jättenöjda!
7287822,45312835,2015-09-01,6186397,Becky,Susie is a wonderful host. She was VERY accomodating and kind to us and made us feel very welcome as we were making JP our new home. We will recommend her studio to all of our friends!!

It is conveniently located near the T for trips into downtown Boston, and the area in JP was definitely worthy of a full day's adventure. It was a perfect place to come home to after long days of sightseeing and exploring! Susie was very friendly and helpful; couldn't have asked for a better place to stay for our long weekend in Boston."
7287822,47072792,2015-09-15,11129668,Irene,"Susie's place was fantastic- in our favorite neighborhood of Boston, close to the Pond and shops on Centre Street, as well as walking distance from the T to get downtown. Aside from laundry, it had everything we needed, and it was especially great to have breakfast items/coffee/tea, etc., for those few days to avoid trips to the grocery store. Super clean and comfy. Would definitely recommend!"

Parking was NO problem and it's saying a lot right in the heart of Boston!! The apartment is so roomy and Susie left the kitchen stocked with essentials! It's like a real neat \"\"DIY\"\" Bed & Breakfast. We stayed for three nights and Susie was a very friendly host"
Highly recommended in the area (just ten minutes' walk) is to go to City Feed & Supply,a small neighborhood market,for their robust coffee and delicious sandwiches. They also supply craft/artisan beer.,,,

7287822,48618936,2015-09-27,373078,Sarah,"Susie was very helpful with things to do. She provided a whole binder full of info and even a map for the taking! The studio was cute and well equipped. Susie made sure we had some morning essentials (oj, coffee, English muffins) which definitely helped get the day going. The trundle bed was easy to operate - although we couldn't get it to stop rolling away, we just both slept on the single bed - which wasn't a problem for us. I'm sure if we would have asked Susie she would have helped us, but we didn't mind. The spiral staircase could be tricky, but was fine for us. The T is a short walk away and a very quick ride to almost anywhere in Boston. Jamaica plains is also a great neighborhood to explore. I would highly recommend this place for someone trying to see Boston as not just a 'tourist'."
7287822,49019128,2015-09-30,42199956,Susan,"Susie made us very welcome. She even picked us up from the airport. The studio is spacious, clean and comfortable in a lovely old house. The area is quiet with lots of independent shops and cafes and restaurants nearby. Highly recommended!"

Thanks Susie!"

Susie was very considerate and she even went out of her way to leave some English tea for us which we thoroughly appreciated.,,,,,
The house was exactly as described in the profile so we had no nasty surprises.,,,,,

Our arrival time ended up being super delayed, and she was so understanding and made the place feel so welcoming right from the beginning. She gave us great sightseeing recommendations and provided us with maps to help our navigation be a bit easier. SUPER great space; we had our own floor, with a bathroom, kitchen, and living area. We were out visiting Boston, Rhode Island, Plymouth, etc., during the day, but it was so nice to come back to a place that felt like home in the evening. The location was great - it was a 5 min walk to the nearest T stop, but far enough out to be in a peaceful suburb of Boston. Would totally recommend her place!!"

7287822,57369340,2015-12-25,27865432,Vinicio,"Susie's place was perfect! My partner and I were moving to Boston and needed a temporary place to stay while we looked for a permanent apartment. We stayed at Susie's for four weeks. The place was home and felt like home for those four weeks. We had everything we needed and whenever we saw Susie, she wanted to know how everything was and whether we needed anything - she's a super host and such a caring person."
The kitchen is fully equipped,the beds are comfortable,the place is clean,the water pressure is good in the shower,the apartment is private and cozy,and the location is great. Susie is also very mindful of safety
The place is close to just about anything you'd want or need - all within walking distance (we did not have a car,though there are multiple Zipcar locations within a couple of blocks). I was working in the Financial District and took the T to work each morning. The T stop is very convenient,only a short walk away. The train ride to work was only 18 minutes. JP is a cool neighborhood with lots of friendly folks. We fell in love with Galway House (Bar & Restaurant) on Centre Street,and even became sort of regulars there - good place,good food,good people

The location is in a wonderful area of Jamaica Plain, very close to Center Street with restaurants, shops and JP Licks (of course).  The apartment has everything you need - a nice little kitchen well stocked with coffee and tea, lovely bathroom, and comfortable beds upstairs.  It was also very quiet, which is always appreciated.  If you have trouble with stairs, you should be aware that there are steep stairs to the apartment and then a spiral staircase inside."

She helped me with specific things that was very comforting and extremely helpful. I basically felt I was living in an apartment, two story apartment within a house. Separate entrance in the back connected to a wonderful patio with a beautiful view of the backyard, trees squirrels birds and flowers delight. The inside is filled with homey objects and colors that connect in a unique way. Full kitchen, smart tv with Netflix and Hulu, Keriug, and large fridge. The area is eclectic, a few minute walk to a street of restataunts, little boutiques and Whole foods. The Jamaica pond about a ten minute walk is a wonderful thing to do, lots of people and kids (of course not in the winter probably) I felt right at home."

All of the basics were in the apartment, including lots of condiments and breakfast treats for the first day. Susie graciously approved 2 visiting family guests that stayed just to sleep one night. The trundle bed was quite comfortable. We didn't need any guidance from Susie since our daughter lives just 2 blocks away. We would definitely stay again and highly recommend the apartment."
7287822,70469521,2016-04-18,52338887,Gavin,Terrific host. Very nice accommodations for a quick visit to the Boston area. Worth a visit.
7287822,70874003,2016-04-21,29497013,Lucy,"We had the most amazing time at Susie's apartment. We couldn't have asked for a nicer place or host and loved meeting Beanie and Diamond. Thank you so much for having us!! Lucy, Tom & Jane"
7287822,71305466,2016-04-24,11800972,Morgan,Susie was a wonderful host. Checked in with us to see how we were doing and made sure we were ok an comfortable. The place it self was great. A cute place and in a wonderful area.
7287822,72422521,2016-05-02,66176017,Arzu,We spent 5 days with our children in this lovely place. It was clean and comfortable. Thanks to Susie for her excellent hospitality.
7287822,74188488,2016-05-13,64559281,Benjamin,Perfect and just as advertised! Great spot to stay in JP.
7287822,74305329,2016-05-14,4014592,Katie,"We only stayed one night, but Susie's place was great.  It's an apartment with a separate entrance up a fairly steep set of stairs (typical for Jamaica Plains).  There is a small circular staircase that leads you to the bedroom with 2 comfortable single beds and a bathroom.  Downstairs is a well equipped kitchen, including excellent coffee, tea and milk!  The neighborhood is full of beautiful old JP houses and close to restaurants and main roads.   Susie was responsive even though she was out of the country!"
7287822,75630527,2016-05-22,55468355,Patsy,Loved our time at Susie's house.  She was most pleasant and gave us good information for local restaurants and places to go.  We would love to stay he again!
7287822,76176194,2016-05-25,54053800,Tim,Susie was great! Apartment beautiful! She helped us a lot and has an answer for every question :). We felt homely

It's close to the Orange Train!,,,,,

7287822,77657066,2016-06-02,55692987,Caroline,"Even before we arrived Susie contacted me with details on how to access the property which was very considerate.  We had no problems finding the property and have to say the photos just don't prepare you for how lovely the apartment is, spotlessly clean and so stylish, every effort is made to make this a home away from home. Susie and Maureen are brilliant, they ensured there was tea coffee, juice and English muffins which was much appreciated.  They also had lots of local knowledge and we spent time getting to know Jamaica Plain which is such a great place and transport routes to take you directly into the centre of town.  Diamond and Beanie (their dogs) are so cuddly.  Maureen and Susie did all they could to make us feel welcome and were so helpful and friendly. We loved staying here it was a perfect end to our holiday in the US.  We hope we can make it back to JP again."
7287822,78226205,2016-06-05,40970793,Adriana,"Susie was a great host and very accommodating.  This Airbnb was a great experience in a beautiful neighborhood, and a close walk to the Green St. T station which was also convenient.  Their place is very comfortable and in a great location overall.  I would definitely stay here again, this place is highly recommended."
7287822,78722536,2016-06-08,22187268,Maddy,"We had a really good experience staying at Susie's place, it was a perfect place for us to land in Boston in every way.  Susie was a really good host, friendly, interesting and very helpful.  The unit is beautiful, clean and comfortable and the neighbourhood is lovely.  We wished we could have stayed there much longer, thanks so much :)"
7287822,79312371,2016-06-12,61766415,Hillari,We enjoyed this location very much. Central to everything in Jamaica Plain. Can walk from the T and can walk to center street and to Jamaica Pond. Nice neighborhood with beautiful homes and trees. The apartment was a good size. Plenty of room.  Nice kitchen and bathroom. Beds were good and they had everything you would need. Nice deck out back to sit.  The stairs to get into the apartment and steep and the spiral staircase to bathroom and bedroom is steep. I wouldn't recommend this for the elderly or someone with knee issues. We loved it and thought it was great!  The hosts were very kind and respectful. They had left some food and coffee. And also information and maps.
7287822,80527028,2016-06-18,58793334,Angeline,"The place was comfortable and have easy access to the train station. Susie is an excellent host. She provides you with muffins, coffee and other nice amenities to make our stay enjoyable. She even wakes up at 5 am to ensure our cab arrives. I highly recommend!"
7287822,81238419,2016-06-21,74386382,Cheryl,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Susie's place in JP.  Everything in the apartment was clean, inviting, and well-supplied.  Susie was helpful with our questions about the area and how to get around.  We loved meeting her pets too!"
7287822,82109839,2016-06-26,10854507,Tiago,"I really enjoyed my visit. Susie was super accommodating as a host from our very first communication. I'm very glad I picked this place, and"
The living space did have some drawbacks. The beds (3 separate twins) were uncomfortable. The only bathroom for downstairs guests is available up a narrow,steel staircase that was especially difficult to climb at night. We also found the staircase difficult to climb with luggage.,,,,
Even though the space itself was not completely as we expected it,"my friends and I were very impressed with the beautiful house and neighborhood. Susie has excellent taste and keeps a wonderful place inside and out that feels like home.\"",,,,
7287822,82767973,2016-06-29,70686280,Jon,"This was our first trip to Boston.  I liked the guidebook that Susie left for us.   She had an urgent situation so unfortunately was not able to meet us at arrival, but everything went very smoothly and the house was great.    The listing is correct -- JP is quite funky -- the neighborhood was perfect, walking  distance to good restaurants in JP, and just a couple blocks to the T."
It was very easy to get to the house by car,parking was free and close by,and we used public transportation for the rest of the trips in and out of Boston.    We didn't take advantage of the kitchen,"but everything looked great.  \"",,
7287822,85459632,2016-07-11,43154386,Amy,"Susie's place in JP is lovely. Bright, clean, well appointed and spacious. It was great to stay out of the city, but have easy access to it. Susie gave us great recommendations for dinner locally as well as things to do. She is a super host and we enjoyed spending time with her and the dogs!"
7287822,86114289,2016-07-15,70988516,Trine,"We (family with two teenagers) really enjoyed staying at Susie's place. It's a nice, clean and well situated apartment in a very quiet street only a 5 minutes walk from the station. From there Boston is only a 15 min ride away by train. Lots of shops and nice restaurants close to the apartment. The area is very calm and safe. Susie is a great host and very helpful in every aspect. She had even bought muffins and there was loads of coffee, teas, jam etc for breakfast. Would very much like to come back!"
7287822,89120147,2016-07-26,25210697,Kristian,"Susie's house is located in the most perfect spot, out in the most charming little community while still just a small subway ride away from Downtown. The perfect place for families or others who don't need to live right beside the night clubs."
The house in it self is perfectly equipped,with all you need. And if you miss something,"Susie will find a solution. We loved the place and could easily see us self return.\"",,,
7287822,91428292,2016-08-05,7865716,Lori,"We had a wonderful stay at Susie's place. It is within walking distance to the T, so it is easy to get into the city, yet a quiet alternative to the noisy city. Compared to a hotel, you feel like you're just staying at a friends place. The apartment is well stocked--including cook-ware, towels, a tv with cable, minor things like bandaids, etc., and she even left us plenty of coffee, tea, English muffins, etc. she also left a notebook with plenty of advice for restaurants, things to do, etc. We arrived late in the evening, so she left the key in a lockbox. Since it was really hot during the day, she had the A/C and fans running which was much appreciated after working up a sweat while carting around heavy luggage. We met Susie later and she was very friendly and even helped us to find a particular store that we were looking for that I would not have found by looking online. Thanks, Susie!"
7287822,92547613,2016-08-09,2776826,Laurie,Great experience.
7287822,94825166,2016-08-17,32762392,Nikoloz,"Susie is an awesome host, if you are looking for a cozy place near Boston, look no further !"
7287822,96593662,2016-08-23,29932880,Noellie,Susie did everything so we find the place easily. It was a great stay and Jamaica Plane is a lovely neighbourhood.
7287822,97927075,2016-08-29,65975957,Keysha,"Myself and some class mates stayed at Susie's place for the weekend. She was a very good host. She gave us lots of information on how to get  around, information on nearby stores and restarants, and wished us well on our exams.  On the last day my room mate ripped her suit case and Susie came right up with some duct tape for her to patch it up.  Susie's place is clean and quiet and so was the neighborhood."

2848362,19793708,2014-09-18,3263111,Josh,"One of the best put together places Ive stayed at with Airbnb. Super clean and ultra modern, right in china town and steps from everything. 2 full sized bedrooms with 3 beds, work desks, full kitchen... its got it all. This place was made for Airbnbers."
2848362,20156574,2014-09-24,20065421,Gareth,"This property was fantastic - newly renovated & very well maintained. Ideally located right near the heart of downtown Boston with:  good restaurants & bars, public transport & attractions all a short walk away."
Our host Sue was most helpful,easily contactable & willing to assist us wherever possible. I would gladly recommend this property for up to 4/5 people & will definitely look to stay here again during subsequent visits to Boston.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
2848362,21473508,2014-10-18,7078574,Frank,Reasonable walking distance to Boston highlights.  Convenient to highways and airport.  Clean and modern unit on the inside.   Communication with host is prompt and courteous.
Very dated and grimy on the outside.  Queen bed is comfortable.  The two twin beds are not comfortable.  And the twin beds have low cost sheets,"blankets and pillows.  The unit is adequate for two adults and two young children.  It will be cramped with four adults.   Questionable overall value.  \"",,,,
2848362,21905050,2014-10-26,22261089,Susy,"As advertised, good location for getting around Boston (near South Station) and a clean and tidy apartment.  Only drawback was noise at night-time from the construction site next door - bring ear plugs!"
2848362,22169249,2014-10-31,11335964,Dennis,Great location and the pictures were accurate.
2848362,23011015,2014-11-20,14252207,Navjot,A third taxi driver from the airport agreed to take me when the previous two did not recognize the address. I should have been told the apartment is in Chinatown or given a reference point such as 'Tufts medical centre' which is nearby.
The place was clean with new and modern but cheap furniture. Did not feel like a home at all.,,,,,
"Had two major issues with the alarm going off for hours and one night the entry lock did not work so could not get into the apartment for 15 mins till finally the contact person called another tenant to open the door. The contact person who is not Sue or Stanley arrived an hour later. She did not apologize or reassure me but told me \"\"if you are so unhappy you can check out early\"\". An extremely scary and unpleasant experience.",,,,,

2848362,24243290,2014-12-23,24374034,Jenn,"Great apartment, easy to book and in a great part of Chinatown."
2848362,28131479,2015-03-18,8784685,Jason,"The apartment was described accurately. There was a few glitches in the trip. We were alerted last minute that the place was going to have some damage from recent storms, but it ended up not having any effect on our stay. The host was responsive to our messages and needs. One problem was that the smoke detectors had low batteries so they were chirping all night, but the host came over the following day and fixed them and replaced the batteries. There is construction near by and ironically they had a fire alarm going off all night, which was not ideal. Additionally the floors are very thin and it is easy to hear the upstairs neighbors walking around at all hours of the day and night. So there was some trouble having quite nights!"

2848362,30373689,2015-04-21,21657149,Linda,Sue was very professional to deal with.  She responded promptly to my email queries.  We arrived very late in the evening and had no problems accessing the apartment.  Sue was a pleasure to deal with.

The location of the flat was excellent just off China town and everything is within walking distance from this. The flat itself was clean, well maintained, highly finished and everything you would need for a stay in Boston. I highly recommend staying here and certainly would in future."
2848362,39641447,2015-07-25,10916131,Tony,"The place was great, very clean and modern. Stan and Sue were SUPER responsive. I arrived to no sheets on one of the bed (things happen), and within an hour someone brought them over at 9:00 at night! I will definitely stay here again."
2848362,40265634,2015-07-29,38684055,Lonna,The apartment building front wall was leaning so when sleeping it felt like I was sleeping down hill towards my head. The twin beds were hard as a rock. There was construction going on next to the building which started hammering early in the morning.  The neighborhood looked pretty rough but we felt safe when walking to the apartment.

I appreciated the updated interior and the air conditioning units in every room (except the bathroom). The internet signal was strong and reliable, and their TV was setup with HD cable which was also a plus. At the time we rented, the hotels were almost all sold out and the price per night was comparable to what was still available for the location. Since you get two bedrooms for that price, it feels like a pretty good deal. We had a great experience and would definitely recommend."

The condo was perfect for our needs - offering an excellent location, stylish, comfortable furnishings, and a responsive, prepared host. We were visiting as a family, with 2 adults and 2 kids. It was cozy since there are essentially 2 rooms, plus bath and tiny kitchen. But the purpose of our visit was not to stay indoors. The location at the top of Beacon Hill was what attracted us. We walked or took the T most days of our 6 day stay. We walked to the North End, walked to Newbury Street thru the Commons and even walked back from Bunker Hill in Charlestown across the bridge. We did rent a car for 2 days of our trip and were able to make do with about $4 in quarters to pay for a few hours of on street parking behind the State House between 8am-8pm. In the condo, everything is new and very clean. The bed was very comfortable, and the kids were okay with the couch pull-out bed. The kitchen is tiny but well-equipped and functional, especially if you're just using it to prepare snacks or reheat leftovers as we were. The bathroom is small, but like the rest of the condo, well-designed, well-appointed and efficient. Sheets, towels, blankets were all new and great quality. And, yes, the view from the roof deck is memorable and stunning. I would stay here again if I return to Boston."

It's within walking distance of the Freedom Trail, the North End, Boston Common, etc. It's the perfect central location for all of your exploring. The condo is small and cozy, and very comfortable. Keep in mind that the kitchen is tiny and there isn't an oven, but this is pretty standard for the area. It was the perfect size for us to make a few meals on the stove top and have breakfast each morning. Marisa and Lin were both great to work with, and checked in several times during our stay to make sure we had everything we needed. It was a great experience overall."

Marisa keeps the place very well maintained - you definitely feel you are in a posh place! Check in and check out were very smooth. She was very helpful as well when I contacted her wondering if I had left something in the apartment."
5371687,71360838,2016-04-24,4443660,Greg,"This apartment is right in the middle of everything. My wife and I had a wonderful time exploring Boston from our base right by Boston Common. It is situated about 2 blocks from Bowdoin on the Blue line, which we took to get to and from the airport. It's about a block and a half from the Park St. station on the Green and Red lines. We only used  public transportation to get around the whole time we were there. The apartment has great views from the 10th floor rooftop. The apartment was cozy and comfortable for resting after exploring the whole day. There are so many places to eat within walking distance, including quite a few on the same block. There is also a convenience store in the same building. We would definitely stay here again for our next Boston adventure."
5371687,75295769,2016-05-20,6047201,Ailsa,"We really loved our stay in Marisa's apartment. The location is fantastic, steps away from Boston Common and right next to the State House. The roof terrace was a definite plus and had amazing views of Boston. The flat is lovely and Marisa had left out lots of brochures for things to do in Boston which was really helpful. We'd definitely recommend this apartment to family and friends."
5371687,77104403,2016-05-30,42618929,Charles,This was my first trip with my family to Boston. The apartment was beautifully decorated. It was within walking distance of many hot spots. Having the rooftop available to us was a great bonus. It was a beautiful view of the city. If we decide to return to Boston we will definitely stay here again.

5371687,86494528,2016-07-16,7120435,Christina,Marisa's place was perfect! The location made it so convenient to walk anywhere and it was close to subway stations. Check in was a breeze because there is a concierge in the lobby. The best part was definitely the roof top patio. You can't beat that beautiful view of the Boston skyline.
5371687,89649044,2016-07-29,7037129,Chloe,"We loved staying in this centrally located apartment - Beacon Hill really is the best area in Boston! We felt like locals sampling the local restaurant and bar scene and it was great staying in such a lovely, well-maintained and spotlessly clean condo. The roof terrace was a bonus and we enjoyed a bottle of wine up there one night whilst watching the sunset. We would definitely recommend Marisa's apartment and would stay again next time we're in this great city."

The apartment is in a fantastic location in the heart of the city and a quick walk to lots of restaurants, bars, and sightseeing spots. The rooftop patio is awesome and was a great place to relax and watch the sunset. The apartment was very clean and well kept, we had four adults in the apartment but we weren't too squished. The pullout bed is comfortable enough and the decor was very cute. All in all it was a fantastic spot!"

The space they have for guests is just as pictured and so clean and comfortable--especially the bed with its memory foam mattress! The location was wonderful, a close walk to so many great places to eat, run/exercise, and access the city via the T. Would definitely recommend without reservation!"
12849003,77286109,2016-05-31,13383236,Patrick,"I needed a place to stay during a visit to Boston to see family -- somewhere I could get a good night's sleep and relax a bit between activities. Rocio and Jason' place was just that: private, quiet, clean, and just what I needed. They were wonderful hosts and made themselves available for whatever I needed. The neighborhood is great and you couldn't be closer to a number of great shops and restaurants and the Green Street T. I would highly recommend staying in their lovely home on your next trip to Boston!"
12849003,80456389,2016-06-18,16242897,Mark,"This private room was exactly what I was looking for - clean, comfortable, quite and close to public transportation.

Let me tell you something, the best decision I made was staying at this ABnB site. The room was as describe, the location was as describe (extremely convenient with train stop near by, in addition if you don't like taking public transportation, an UBER/Lyft will only cost like $12 to go to Downtown, I used it), and they are one of the friendliest couple I've had the pleasure to meet. The bed is hotel quality; I'm happy with this experience. If my word helps in taking a decision, definitely spend the night (or two) at this location."

They are very pleasant and interesting a couple. And their townhome is  high quality construction. The lower level is completely private.  The bed is great, memory foam mattress.  Plenty of room."
"They didn't  mind us keeping a few things in the refrigerator and making coffee for ourselves.  But there's a cute coffee shop down the street.  Within 10 minutes walk there is a large array of great restaurants. \"",,,,,

12849003,98547082,2016-08-31,43790556,Anniek,"Our stay at Rocio and Jason was really good. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was clean. Rocio and Jason gave us suggestions for places to eat in Jamaica Plains, which is a really nice neighborhood and the metro is a 5 minute walk. Boston is a great city and Rocio and Jason's place is great way to start and end your day in the city!"

13998602,88299250,2016-07-24,82559406,Joey,"Chloe was easy to get in contact with and the check in process was very easy. The apartment itself was beautiful and the location was pretty pleasant.  Only complaint, which is not Chloe's fault, is that the street parking situation was miserable. It was difficult to find non tow zone or metered parking. Not getting towed or ticketed meant waking up at 7:50 every morning feeding the meters, not ideal if you'd just like to waste a day in bed. Despite good meter practices I still left my trip with two $30 parking tickets so if you are to stay in the area just be aware it's a tad difficult to park in. Otherwise, great experience."

She said she was available for check-in between 3-6pm. We requested 5:00 and did not hear back all day until 5:30. We tried to meet her at 5:45, stood outside of the apartment for 15 minutes and as we decided to give up and just leave after not hearing back from her, a man came out of the building and said he was there to help in her absence. We never met her, she did not communicate well all day and we almost ended up giving up to find another place last minute. And after all of this, she sent me a message asking to leave positive feedback. Place was nice but small. Good location but probably wouldn't book again because of the hassle of poor communication."
2495047,19672359,2014-09-16,16920224,Vicent,"The apartment is well located, in a beautiful and lively neighborhood, and  very close to the downtown.  Maybe it's a little pricey, for this price should include cleaning and more TV channels."
The garbage is collected only two days per week,buts that's the fault of the town council.,,,,
"Laura is very friendly and always willing to help. \"",,,,,
2495047,35449638,2015-06-19,27914760,David,"I stayed in this apartment for 3 months whilst working at a local hospital. The apartment, and Laura as host, made my time a great and hassle free experience! The apartment is very modern and intelligently designed making a small space feel very large. The location is ideal with many restaurants, cafes, and grocery stores in Tremont street and the surrounding area, as well as being a 10-15 min walk to the T station. The majority of my contact with Laura was via email, to which Laura was very quick to reply, and kept me informed to any happenings in the apartments building. Having met Laura 3 or 4 times she is very easy to talk to, and willing to help with any queries. A great addition to the apartment was an air conditioner that Laura came and installed herself when the temperatures in spring started to rise. Overall - highly recommended no matter what time of year, reason for travel, or length of stay."
2495047,40710943,2015-08-02,18575037,Sibel,"I and my daughter (6 years old) stayed around 43 nights in Laura's apartment. It was wonderful place for us. It is orijinal Brownstone apartment, very clean,full kitchen equipment and also there are a dishwasher,hair drier,iron,oven,towels etc. The apartment location is also perfect and safe for us, my little daughter could go everywhere on foot. In addition we could walk to the T Station (Orange Line and Green Line) around 15-20 minutes. Laura is also very very friendly and well organized person. Her reply is quick and she thinks everything that you need to live  in your apartment. We will miss Laura as a friend and our apartment too. I would recommend this lovely place to everyone, because if we have any opportunity to go to Boston, I do not hesitate to stay here again and again."

2495047,73122645,2016-05-07,15218739,Ayoung,My stay at Laura's was an incredibly comfortable and pleasant one. She responded quickly to my requests and questions and was incredibly accommodating (including an early check-in and a broken blind). You can tell she has put a lot of care into her listings and it really shows in her interactions with you.
The location is great - 10 minutes from Back Bay station,15 from Copley,and right in the heart of the vibrant South End.,,,
The unit is exactly as pictured and very comfortable. You have several amenities available. Some things to note - there is not much sound insulation so you will hear noise from the street (sirens mostly). Also,there is no microwave but you have state of the art stovetops and an oven for cooking.,,,,

2495047,74340002,2016-05-15,2090984,John,"This studio apartment has a wonderful view, especially as the sun goes down. We also really enjoyed the location, with so many great cafes and restaurants right at your door. All the fittings are pretty well new, with fantastic bath towels, a lovely wardrobe, a dazzling white sofa, a comfortable bed, & we enjoyed the amazingly fast convection oven & stovetop. Laura has quite strict rules about keeping everything spick and span, so don't stay here unless you're happy to go along with that (or else pay extra cleaning fees)."

Unfortunately, the room itself hadn't been cleaned and I had to hoover it myself upon arrival. The bathroom was especially dirty and not at all pleasant to use. Similarly, the kitchen was very unclean and had quite limited utensils for cooking - other housemates tended to leave dishes unwashed for days at a time. The neighborhood was lively and quite conveniently situated, but the cleanliness of the apartment was a major problem."

Moreover, the fact that Nancy speaks Spanish made things much easier for my stay in Boston. Jamie also  but just learning. The metro and bus are close by which also made things easier. The super quiet neighborhood, style of houses (wooden) makes it very picturesque . Three blocks away are the shops, supermarket and restaurants. I quickly reached by bus or metro the Longwood Medical Area where I took my courses . That same subway took me to all of Boston in minutes."
A particular aspect is the personality of Nancy,with her Latin American accent and style of healthy,"natural and fun life. Large and warm conversation and also vegetarians !!! Both Nancy and Jamie helped me find my way around.\"",,,

Their apartment is very nice, clean, quiet. The bedroom is large and the bed is comfortable. Its well located. I explored Boston by car, and it was very hand the fact you can park for free on the street. Also quick and easy to reach all points of interest for a tourist in the city. They were very friendly the times we met, good conversation, very polite. Besides english, we could communicate in spanish and even a little bit of portuguese. They gave us some hints and they have a nice collection of books. Super recommended if you are staying in Boston."

El barrio es muy tranquilo y agradable. Hay un supermercado a un par de cuadras donde se consiguen alimentos naturales muy buenos. La estación de Subte está a unas 7 u 8 cuadras y desde ahí es fácil conectarse con los distintos puntos de la ciudad.,,,,,

I checked in after a long work day and after chatting for a bit settled in to rest in a lovely, well appointed room (including freshly bottled water, electric teapot and a selection of teas) with a very comfy bed beautifully made up with fresh linens. Towels were thoughtfully set out with a new bar of luxurious, aromatic bath soap. A bookcase with a wide selection of good reads was a bonus! The bathroom was pristinely clean.  I didn't have time to enjoy their inviting living room but it is right outside the room, with a SmartTV and Bose sound system. I will surely plan to enjoy a movie next time. Parking was easy and unrestricted on the street with a spot available nearby each evening during my stay. A variety of well reviewed restaurants, Whole Foods, beautiful Jamaica Pond and a convenience store are within walking distance. I would stay here every time I am in Boston but I know it will be booked solid if I don't reserve early. Nancy and Jamie are lovely people and I look forward to another stay soon.  Thank you for being Airbnb hosts!"
9590679,83963632,2016-07-04,43761234,Alessandro,L'accoglienza del mio host é stata fantastica come tutto l'intero soggiorno! La camera e la casa sono davvero belle e confortevoli. Infine gli host sono davvero gentili e disponibili
9590679,87405446,2016-07-20,79420943,Sooraj,"Most excellent! Warm, wonderful people who'll tell you about the city and what's good. If you like music concerts that's a bonus - they seem to know all the good acts around the city! Definitely recommending this as a very worthwhile place to stay."
9590679,88021298,2016-07-22,31464785,Thomas,"We had a great time in Boston. The room was clean and neat. Although we didn't arrive till after midnight Nancy stayed up for us, which was really nice. The area offers great food at reasonable prices. It's very close to Jamaica Pond, downtown Boston can be easily reached by train and the airport is just about 20min away. Nancy and Jamie were very helpful and offered good advice on where to go, what to see and where to eat/get some good coffee. We would come back anytime."
9590679,91230863,2016-08-04,84577547,Daniel,Great place and great couple!
9590679,95828131,2016-08-21,3979999,Polly,I couldn't recommend staying with Jamie and Nancy more. They are a lovely couple - they were so warm and welcoming and did everything they could to make me feel comfortable in their home. I really enjoyed talking with and going out to see music with them. Their house is spacious and homely and they made it really easy for me to have my bicycle with me. I wish I could have stayed longer and would recommend staying with them to anyone coming to Boston. Thank you both!

We struggled with getting the TV to work as we wanted to watch some Marathon updates, sports games, etc, but it didn't take away from the weekend. Good location and nice place to call home for the weekend."
4787233,74519306,2016-05-15,22732600,Melanie,"Beautiful and comfortable apartment in a perfect location. Apartment was homey and comfortable, but not so cluttered that we felt we were intruding on someone else's space. Lots of light, great kitchen, comfortable beds. We've rented on Air BNB several times in Boston -- this was the best experience yet."

Instructions were clearly written and though there was an issue with cable and internet, Richard was very responsive and did everything he could to restore service.  I would highly recommend this unit to anyone staying in the Boston area."

Appartement neuf et contemporain, très bien décoré avec toutes les commodités cuisine et salle de bain. Parfait pour une famille de 4. Petit geste de bien venue, 2 bouteilles de vin vous attendent avec un petit mot d’accueil. Une belle vue sur Down town qui va peut être disparaître avec la construction d'un parking de l'autre coté de la rue. A recommander sans hésitation."

The kitchen was well equipped with everything we needed to do light cooking, and the overall space was very comfortable.  This will be at the top of our list the next time we come back to Boston!"
2481019,38092453,2015-07-13,9515598,Jonathan,"\"Unfortunately, we were informed, six weeks after making our booking on Canal St., that it was double booked and not available to us. The time delay meant that most of the other listings on airbnb were reserved and we were at the hosts mercy.  They offered a \"\"upgrade\"\" that was actually the same price. The new location was on the 30th floor in the West End. The location of the unit was convenient to local attractions in Boston"
It is clear that this is a persons business and they have multiple units throughout the city. Although the location and price points are good,I cannot in good conscience recommend this host as an authentic Airbnb experience. Examples of business versus personal touch include asking us to signing 3 page lease-like document after paying for accommodations; deleting email correspondence in Airbnb app so as not to be accountable for prior conversations (and told that they would be doing so); no shower curtain (just liner); ikea furnishings; asking us to clean the unit prior to leaving although agreeing in advance that they would provide this service due to change in location; not providing parking discount even though he said he would; noisy upstairs neighbors and finally never changing our reservation booking in Airbnb to reflect the location we stayed at.,,,,
Buyer beware,"you may not be getting what you think you are getting. Be wary of these bait and switch tactics. We don't know if they intentionally did this or it was a true mistake but we don't feel like they made any effort to make it up to us.  We will look elsewhere when we revisit Beantown.\"",,,,

An absolutely stunning apartment in the heart of North End, a perfect location to sightsee, just a 5 min walk from Faneuil Hall, the Italian restaurant quarter, and right by North Station if you want to get the T anywhere."
Richard and Victoria have put so much effort in to ensure every detail of the apartment is perfect,delivering a 5 star experience every time. Fluffy white bathrobes,towels,huge memory foam bed,hardwood flooring,fully fitted kitchen

4559774,30337911,2015-04-20,13711559,Mythri,"Super homely. I rented this place because my mom was visiting my sister in Boston. My mom wanted a place that had all the amenities of an actual apartment, and this place didn't disappoint! She had a great stay and felt super comfortable. Another plus was that it was close to downtown and easy to get around everyone.  Brian was a gracious host and my mother really recommends this place!"
4559774,32309799,2015-05-17,12135746,Andrew,Brian was helpful in getting me organized.  The apartment is as described and well situated for those needing to be near the Longwood Medical area. It is also conveniently located near a 24 hour Supermarket and an easy walk to Starbucks.
4559774,33361951,2015-05-27,29317687,Kleber,"Brian was a very kind and helpful host. He was very easy to reach and quick to respond as we coordinated our check in, as well as flexible when we had a small change in our plans. His apartment was just as it appears to be in the photos: clean, tidy, and comfortable. The location cannot be beat, as it is within walking distance to several great restaurants, Fenway Park, the green line, and downtown. I highly recommend Brian as a host and would gladly stay at his place again!"
4559774,34419314,2015-06-08,67644,Ana,"As I was attending a conference at the MFA, this studio in Fenway area was the perfect place to stay! The location of the studio is quite accessible and easy to walk to/from the nearest subway lines that give you access to all of Boston. Walking up to Kenmore and getting to the Charles River basin area is quite easy too! The area feels safe and has many local bars and restaurants, plus a 24-hour supermarket! I also enjoyed to see all of that Red Sox activity in the neighborhood!"
The studio itself is quite comfortable,clean and has all the equipment you may imagine needing in your vacation. Since I was most of the days working and out,I did not cook at all,but the kitchen is well equipped! I did notice though,that the lack of a table and a couple of chairs to eat may disrupt those who like to sit at a table to eat. The bed is comfortable and the water runs well in the bathroom.,
We didn't meet in person,but Brian was a very helpful host in every possible way. He takes great care in explain you any detail about the studio,how to access it,and makes himself always available to contact. He was also attentive in contacting me upon my arrival and departure to make sure everything was ok.,,
Although my visit to Boston was mostly work related,I would definitely recommend this place to stay for a long-term vacation,which will be definitely kinder to your pocket compared with nearby alternatives!,,,

4559774,37166769,2015-07-05,10047048,Charlene,"This apartment is in a great location and had everything most people could dream of needing in a temporary space. Easy key transfer, fully independent setting, but it was refreshing to know Brian was a text away if I needed him. 100% recommended. I hope to stay here again in the event I visit Boston in the future."

We felt very safe in this apartment, as we were behind 3 locked doors. There is lots of good food, coffee shops, grocery store, Fenway Park and bars within a short walk. There is a very close place to do laundry right down the hall. We would definitely recommend Brian's apartment as it fulfilled all of our needs. Thanks Brian for letting us stay in your place, we would love to come back again!"
4559774,46729929,2015-09-13,19394220,Alyssa,The location could not be more perfect. Minutes away from Fenway park and walking distant to some of the best shops and food in Boston.

We didn't get to meet Brian but his directions to the apartment and communication was fantastic! The location was good, the apartment was only a short walk away from Fenway park, and cabs/ubers would meet us right near the apartment. Brian encouraged us to contact him if we had any questions or issues which was lovely (however we didn't need to contact him as there were no issues). The apartment was perfect for our needs, clean and tidy, with a small kitchen, bathroom and comfortable bed; all private for our own use only. We read the reviews before we chose Brian, all of which were positive. We felt safe in the building and neighbourhood and would definately stay here again."

4559774,74278760,2016-05-14,32918157,Prasad,The instructions and video to access the place were very clear. Everything was as good or better than what was advertised. A comfortable bed and a reasonably stocked kitchen (though we did not use most of it). Centrally located with easy access being in the ground level. a 24 hour starmarket and target within a block. Brian was responsive and helpful when I needed any information. Would love to stay there again.

I booked the flat for my sister, brother in law and their 10 month old little boy, they were in Boston to attend my wedding. I had to change the start date of their stay due to last minute changes and Ben was quick to accommodate us. We were able to change the reservation and Ben organised for us to pick up the key late in the evening."
The flat was gorgeous. Modern decor,lovely comfy beds,well stocked kitchen and T.V. with access to Netflix and Apple T.V. Ben left helpful instructions for navigating the flat and was on hand to help when necessary. His family even left freshly baked donuts and organic apples for us!,,,
Location was perfect,easy access to the T (Community College T has lift access,great for prams and wheelchairs),just a few stops into town. Lovely local park great for kids and a CVS and Whole Foods within walking distance.,,

The room is just as picture with the guest bath across the hall. It is shared by one other person that lives there. The train station is a little less or just at a quick 0.5 mile walk so downtown is just about 10 minutes away. Ernesto's place is very reasonable compared to all of the very, very expensive hotels in Boston!"
4868653,52442054,2015-10-29,35749515,Vu,"I have a nice trip in Boston, Ernesto is a nice guy, he helps me lots in the trip"
4868653,70759417,2016-04-20,20805619,Joe,Ernesto and his family are very nice and provide a comfortable room for a reasonable rate. It's less than 10 minutes from the Airport T station and from there you can go anywhere in Boston. Plus there are two local restaurants- Angela's Cafe for breakfast and Rinos Place for dinner- a short walk away that were both featured on Diners Driveins and Dives. The bedroom is upstairs with a low ceiling in spots so if you're a tall person you may feel a bit cramped. It's minimally furnished as well but if you just want a convenient place to sleep while staying in the Boston area I recommend Ernesto's home as an inexpensive choice.
4868653,75828506,2016-05-23,32975163,Mohamed,"\"Ernesto provided a very comfortable stay and was a great host. Located very close to the airport the means to get to his place is ideal for any traveler. If you get in a taxi from the airport you can reach the place in around 10mins costing ~$10; Upon which a walk to the \"\"Airport\"\" train station on the Blue Line is 8-13mins away. To get to downtown is also another 10mins. If you want to have breakfast before heading out to explore Boston"
4868653,91994199,2016-08-07,75507988,Nick,I stayed here for 6 days in early August of 2016.
I had no problems what so ever arriving from the airport as it is super close.  The area is very nice and close to a very convenient subway stop that gets you to the main area of Boston within 10 minutes.,,,,,
Ernesto and his family were very welcoming and polite. They were happy to interact or leave me on my own.,,,,,
The room is quite large and clean. The bed was very comfy. There is also a bathroom right across the hall from the room which is pretty much only used by the guest which is really great if you like that privacy.,,,,,
I would be happy to stay here again if I return to Boston.,,,,,
A few things to note. The room is upstairs so if you have a heavy suitcase you may have problems taking it up and down.  Also,being close to the airport you may hear planes so if you are a light sleeper you could have some problems. Finally,"the wifi would cut out here and there which could be problematic if you require it for work or personal reasons. I would probably uber back to the house if you are out late ( after 11) but fortunately it is very cheap from most places in downtown Boston!\"",,,
2821825,19822813,2014-09-19,3120809,Peter,This apartment was ideal. I have a feeling we were the first guests as most things were new and even in their plastic wrapping. Great building and excellent facilities.

With a location very convenient to the green line, which basically was our hub for our entire stay in Boston, and a Whole Foods literally right around the corner, we felt that this was a perfect spot to plant ourselves. The apartment itself was small, but very comfortable for a couple. The welcome basket was a very nice touch that made us immediately feel at home, and the fact that it's Jessie's actual apartment guaranteed that it has everything you may possibly need. Though we never met, Jessie was very friendly and responsive with helping coordinate the check in and addressing any questions we had."
2663667,21562915,2014-10-19,22524248,Nancy,"Jessie's place was just what we were looking for. Close to shopping and restaurants and all that, and Jessie left suggestions that were very helpful. The apartment itself is small, but neat. A Whole Foods and parking garage around the corner were convenient too."
2663667,22548166,2014-11-09,13923326,Casey,"Jessie's apartment is very cute and cozy and is located in a really nice section of Boston. If you enjoy walking in Boston, she is located really close to the busy trendy parts of the city as well as some beautiful parks and waterways."
She was super helpful and easy to reach and she left me an awesome welcome basket with treats,coffee,"toiletries... I highly recommend her place. \"",,,
2663667,23048078,2014-11-21,21941891,Daniel,Jessie was a great host. Apartment was fully stocked and she provided a number of helpful items for travelers. The apartment is so in a convenient location to many arts of Boston.

2663667,46039871,2015-09-07,42232413,Greg,"Jessie's Back Bay apartment was just as described, if not better. The apartment was cozy and perfect for two, and her little decorations make it feel even more homey. Even though we never met in person, she was extremely helpful from the moment she approved our visit. She was accommodating in every manner, even leaving a little basket of supplies for us upon our arrival. Whatever questions we had, Jessie always responded very promptly."
2663667,48558292,2015-09-27,42423867,Sarah,The neighborhood is way nicer than expected. The pictures accurately represent the place - Jessie did a great job of maximizing the space without sacrificing comforts.
We LOVED the welcome basket (pictured in the main display photo on the bed) and clean towels.,,,,,
"Thanks for having us! \"",,,,,
2663667,59440799,2016-01-10,26049809,Celina,"We stayed at the apartment for the weekend. Even though we didn't meet Jessie in person she was a very thoughtful and generous hostess. The apartement is small, cozy and clean. The Apple TV and the breakfast she left for us were a plus!"
2663667,63984384,2016-02-28,58466289,Austin,"Jessie was an awesome host. Very easy to communicate with and her apartment was exactly as advertised. Very clean and well kept place, definitely recommend it!!"
2663667,70698398,2016-04-19,7956658,Alice,Jessie was a great host and would definetely recommend staying at her lovely apartment. Picking up the keys was super easy and she had left a lovely little welcome basket for us. The apartment was spotlessly clean and had everything we needed (she had even bought some bagels for us!) The location was fantastic- minutes from boylston and newbury ave and also walking distance to watch the Red Sox.
Jessie was really helpful when things went a little wrong for us (we lost our wallet on our last day) and offered to call up the places we had visited to try and find it.,,,,,
I would highly recommend this great find!,,,,,
"Enjoy :-) \"",,,,,
2663667,74793942,2016-05-16,57339304,Martha,"Jessie's place is just as pictured, cute & cozy. Bed was really comfortable, as was the sofa to relax & watch Apple TV. The apartment is located in a good area. She responded quickly to all our questions & accommodated our needs (i.e. air control & early check in/out). Jessie's hospitality is greatly appreciated."
2663667,78193889,2016-06-05,15543357,Kathryn,"Perfect location-- around the corner from Whole Foods, CVS, and a parking garage, and within easy walking distance from the T in a safe and vibrant neighborhood. Jessie made it easy to get the key, left clear directions for wifi, etc., and was a responsive communicator overall. It's cozy, but all we needed."

"We enjoyed our time there!! :)\"",,,,,
10271867,90759189,2016-08-02,16307182,Jonathan,"Great Location in a sometimes quiet neighborhood. Short walking distance to the metro and Sam Adams Brewery.  Great value, and easy to find."
497810,15269504,2014-07-06,16107454,Nat,Jon was super nice. The place was great as advertised. The location was amazing! Right in the center of Boston. Would definitely stay there again if in town.
497810,15590082,2014-07-12,4240040,Mathieu,"Location is perfect, very central in downtown Boston, the subway is right down the building. However, the apartment is not that clean. There were no sheets on the bed and in the apartment. We found hairs on the mattress. Also the building seems to be quite old and hot water was not working during an entire day."
497810,15726171,2014-07-14,17683574,Kyle,"This apartment is an excellent place to stay when visiting Boston, and that's thanks mostly to its' great location.  It's only a couple blocks away from the Commons, and a short walk to the Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market area.  This great location also gives it easy access to the Boylston/Newbury area or the North End via walking or biking (Boston's Hub Bike program is a great way to see the city; my traveling party loved it and I would highly suggest it)."
Washington Street and the surrounding area are home to plenty of bars,restaurants,and shops,so the area is bustling,even at night or morning.  It didn't bother us much,but loud construction in the area made it difficult to sleep in.  Large parts of Washington seem to be under construction at the moment
The apartment itself was great,and comfortably fit 7 people.  The accommodations were basic,but were good enough for what we needed (it's vacation,you shouldn't be spending much time where you're staying anyway!).  The bedrooms were all nice sized and beds comfortable.  The Apple TV & Netflix were a great feature in the living room.  The bathroom looked clean,though water pressure in the shower left much to be desired.,
Jon was a nice and helpful host,and even threw in a case of water upon our arrival,a small gesture,but one that we didn't expect and greatly appreciated.  I wish he was more clear on the check-in procedures,however.  He told me we could check in between 2-3,but when we arrived at 2:15
Overall,for the price & size of the apartment (as opposed to splitting 1-2 hotel rooms between 6+ people),and the awesome location,"I would recommend this space to friends or family.\"",,
497810,16285748,2014-07-24,18283982,Jeff,The reservation was canceled 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
497810,16358796,2014-07-26,16041698,Jeffrey,"All of my experiences with AirBnB have been easy and fun, and this one was too."
I called John about 30 minutes before I arrived and he was waiting for me at the door to the building. He gave me a quick review of access to the building and showed me around the apartment. The location is about as central as you can get to downtown Boston. There is a T stop immediately below the building so you can get anywhere quickly. There are plenty of restaurants,coffee shops,and retail stores right in the area. China Town,the North End,and the Boston Common are short walks away from the apartment.,
The apartment itself was nice,with three comfortable bedrooms and a nice living/dining room combination. The bathroom was comfortable,clean,and had a huge jetted tub. I didn't get to try the jacuzzi out,but it looked nice. The shower was hot and had great pressure. I took the back bedroom and was surprised at how quiet it was. My coworkers indicated that there was some street noise from construction next door,but they both indicated it wasn't a problem.
"Afterwards we agreed that we would definitely stay here again. Thanks Jon!\"",,,,,
497810,16574898,2014-07-29,15924958,Christie,We had a great stay at Jon's place. He let us check in a bit early and was waiting on time to let us in. The location was perfect and so central! It was nice to have lots of choices for food right below. Wifi and Apple TV were great bonuses. Tip: bring earplugs since there is a lot of construction going on nearby. We would stay here again for sure!
497810,16801914,2014-08-02,16575187,Jim,"Jon was very accommodating. Our plane arrival was delayed and we got in after midnight. He arranged for us to get the key and get in well after the streets were quiet. The apartment building is literally in the middle of the business district. We walked everywhere we needed to go for the whole 3 days. 24 hour store was 2 blocks north. Starbucks less than 1 minute walk. There was (Aug2014) some construction happening on the street and a few early morning noises as expected in the city. We are NOT early morning people, so ear plugs came in handy for my wife and I. Teenage kids didn't notice any noise at all. Windows on two sides of the apartment added some great light. In unit washer and dryer came in handy on our 2 week trip. A great experience for our first time using AirBnB. Thanks, Jon."
497810,17211396,2014-08-09,4073465,Brigid,"We had a great stay in the apartment. We were four adults and two small kids and it worked we for our group. The apartment is an easy 20 minute walk to the convention center where most of us needed to be during the days and Boston Common was very close and had a lot to offer the kids. The apartment was clean, well stocked with sheets and towels, and comfortable. It's especially ideal for anyone arriving by plane/train/bus because it's so close to the T and parking is a little tricky. Jon was responsive and helpful."
497810,17371928,2014-08-11,16669971,Lindsey,"Jon was a great host, stayed for one night for my sisters birthday."
Apt was clean and fully stocked. Easy check in and check out,safe too!,,,,
Jon was nice enough to meet me down on the street to bring us up to the apt,let us know the best place to park,"and was just super friendly and accommodating in the process. \"",,,
497810,17837783,2014-08-18,16920623,Jonathan,"The place was great. My family had a good time visiting Boston. The place was convenient for them in terms of shopping, visiting historical sites, and eating. The place is clean and the beds comfortable."

497810,19925479,2014-09-21,9740270,Jessica,"Jon's place is great, very central and close to all the city has to offer. It is very loud in two of the three bedrooms due to the proximity of them to the road but ear plugs take care of it and Jon provides them."
497810,20650108,2014-10-03,15615647,Junjie,"The location is great, but we couldn't drive our car along the road in front of this apt. The room was ok but a little bit crowded. The shower head didn't work well, making my dad crazy about this."
497810,20816870,2014-10-06,18130507,Elizabeth,Jon's apartment is located in the perfect location in Boston and is within walking distance to all of the tourist attractions.  Check in & out was easy and Jon responds very quickly to any messages.   The apartment is spacious and very comfortable but it does get quite noisy at night.
497810,21128492,2014-10-12,7234129,David,"We had a great stay at Jon's apartment in Boston. The apartment was located right in the middle of town, which was really convenient for the old town tourist attractions, underground metro, and several decent restaurants."
We were welcomed by Jon's girlfriend who showed us around the apartment. There were three huge bedrooms,a great lounge and dining area and a good sized bathroom. The apartment was really lovely,I particularly liked the polished concrete floors. Having come from New York we were also pleasantly surprised by the size. There was a bit of road and construction noise,however that did not seem to bother us. Light sleepers would probably want to take the back bedroom which was silent. Jon had left us earplugs too just in case,which was a nice touch :),
I would definitely recommend Jon's apartment to anyone travelling to Boston,"especially if you're only there for a couple of days due to its convenience \"",,,,
497810,21340891,2014-10-15,20495082,Stephen,"Perfect location.  Service was exemplary, catering to our late arrival and departure. Very pleased with the prompt and friendly service."

They were easily reachable & responsive to messages. The self check in system is also efficient.,,,,,
The location is very central,just next to the subway & right in front of Macy's.,,,,
The apartment is big & very spacious & we were pleasantly it comes with a water dispenser. It's also very well equipped,with a multiple plug in each of the 3 bedroom & body lotions & many body foams & shampoos in the bathroom. There's also a washing machine & dryer in the apartment.,,,,
If we really have to nit-pick,our only 2 qualms are the shower head doesn't work so well,but still manageable & there's an iron but we couldn't find the ironing board.,,,
Overall,fantabulous stay,"we highly recommend you to choose Jon's & Nannaree's apartment if you're visiting Boston!!\"",,,

497810,23003747,2014-11-20,9818247,James And Wendy,"The location was excellent.  Not only was in in Boston Commons, steps away from all major subway and bus transportation lines,  it was across from Macy,  and surrounded by restaurants.  We were able to commute and explore the north end, the south end, cambridge/harvard and east Boston with superb ease.  The condo was clean with a surplus of linen, towels, toiletry and cooking resources. The host was easily accessible by phone and text."
The only two small issues were the street level noises at night and the slow wifi.,,,,,

One block from skating in Boston Commons and a ten minute walk to the Quincy market. Lots of shops and restaurants everywhere. A note for future travelers with kids - the floors are a polished concrete. So socks with rubber grips are a must and slippers for the parents in winter will go a long way.  The back room is very very quiet so if you are a sensitive sleeper grab that room. The beds are very comfortable. We were able to check in and out without even having to meet with Jon. Felt more like a hotel experience than a private residence. We will look to stay here again next time we are in Boston. A+"
497810,23616028,2014-12-06,287734,Greg,Jon provided great communication about the apartment.  It is in a great location and everything was as advertised.  Would definitely stay here again!

Location is excellent.  He's not kidding when he says it's about 10ft from a subway stop.  It's right around the corner from the beautiful Boston Commons area (and where the busses pick up runners for the Boston Marathon,which is why we chose it) and the Freedom Trail.  It's in a relatively nice part of town,meaning I would feel comfortable walking around there by myself.,,,

Para alguien que tenga que permanecer en la locación por tiempo largo entre las 8am y las 6 pm , mientras  duren los trabajos de construcción, el ruido puede ser un problema serio, a pesar de los tapones facilitados."
497810,33773219,2015-06-01,18839219,Sinead,"The Host was incredibly responsive. Although he was not able to meet me in person, he was fast to respond via email / text / Airbnb messages. Everything was simple, from moving in and moving out."
I've lived in the Boston area for 4 years and had my family stay in Jon's Airbnb loft for a week,instead of a hotel,and it was the best decision ever made. The location was convenient and comfortable. On occasion when my parents (who have aged quite a bit) prefer to stay in,enjoyed staying in.,,
During the days  that I wasn't able to be with my family,they found the apartment location easy to explore as a tourist. Being right in front of the Commons,DownTown,ChinaTown,and having the T- station (the subway) literally next to the building,it was easy and fun for them.

497810,34704638,2015-06-11,14175069,Gretchen,"Best feature of this condo was LOCATION!  Right next to the  red-line Downtown Crossing so you can go anywhere from here.  Boston Commons is about a block away!  We did not find the street noise or construction noise to be a problem.  Condo was adequately furnished.  Queen bed in the Master was uber comfortable and the linens clean, crisp and fresh.  Secure, free WiFi was a plus.    Jon, the owner, was easy to work with and responded promptly to  messages."
497810,34861841,2015-06-13,23165489,Shady,"This place was awesome!! Great location for the day or night life. If your willing to talk everything is 15 minutes away max, but you also have the 'T'  right outside the entrance. You Must stay here! very comfy beds and clean. Thanks for having us."
497810,35059395,2015-06-15,25362466,Scott,Jon provided excellent communication prior to our arrival and ensured that we had a great stay.  The spot seemed bigger in person and had everything that was advertised.  Perfect for a large group (housed 8 guys comfortably).  Would definitely stay at Jon's spot the next time I'm in Boston.
497810,35388201,2015-06-18,13641950,Brian,"Great place to stay in Boston.  Jon's communication was superb and its easy to check in/out if you can follow the simple directions (which I did not so shame on me).  The place has everything going for it location, size, comfort, etc...you can't really go wrong by booking it now."
So lets talk about the negatives to give you some more insight...,,,,,
1. I couldn't find an ironing board; no big deal I made it work with a towel and a table.  Jon promises there is one somewhere but it eluded me for my 2 days there.,,,,,
2. I didn't find the beds to be super comfortable; but this is such a personal thing and I would still stay here in the future despite this so that should speak for itself.,,,,,
3.  It can be noisy; but you are looking for a place downtown so all of these places are going to be noisy.  If you want silence don't stay in the city.,,,,,
"I would want to stay here again and so should you!\"",,,,,
497810,36279897,2015-06-27,29916436,Paul,We were very happy with the place.
The location was excellent - central and only minutes from multiple T stops. The apartment itself was clean,spacious and well furnished. The broadband was of a good quality. Overall,I would have no complaints.,,,

When you first get there the apartment is clean and well furnished. You have access to wifi and an apple TV. Also the bathroom was well kept and stocked.,,,,,
I can’t emphasize enough the value you get for what you pay. The location is right in the heart of Boston and you have two T stops within a 5 minute radius. My group didn’t have to use an uber the whole weekend we were there. Also there’s a lot of food places right around the area,so you don’t have to make a trek anywhere to feed yourself or get supplies for the duration of your stay at the apartment.,,,,
Also,the apartment has a lot of space. Like I said,it fit 8 guys comfortably. All three beds were comfortable and the sheets were clean!,,,
Seriously,this is the best find I’ve had on AirBnB. Could not have asked for a better place to crash in Boston.,,,,

497810,37086815,2015-07-04,17329191,Lee,"This was a great place to stay for a family.  The location couldn't be better -- steps from Boston Common, parking across the street, supermarket a block away, and lots of other amenities. The bedrooms were the perfect size for my family. Jonas also given the place a number of personal touches. Jon made checkin very easy and was responsive to email throughout our stay. We would stay here again."
497810,37334138,2015-07-06,25433527,Will,We stayed during July 4th weekend to sight see and watch fireworks.
The apartment is located in the heart of Boston and everything you want to see is within walking distance (up to 20 min.) from this location (including Fanuiel Hall,Quincy Market,Harpoon Brewery,Chinatown,etc.). There is also the subway which is right outside the entrance for the apartment building which can help you get farther out very quickly (eg,Fenway Park
The place is very clean and open for all of the guests to sleep comfortably.,,,,,

497810,38090699,2015-07-13,23118306,Peter,Great location but very noisy at night. Probably due to construction across the street.

Il est spacieux propre et le propriétaire est très réactif en cas de problème. Bien qu' en plein centre ville il n'est pas bruyant, sauf pour la climatisation. Un bon choix très rentable dès qu'on est plus de 4. A noter un supermarché alimentaire très bien fourni en fruits et légumes juste à côté."

Jon was very responsive,the check in and check out instruction were easy to follow.  Over all,we enjoyed our stay.,,,
The place is 3 bedrooms which is big enough for 8 of us ( 4 adults and 4 kids).  The only thing that I did not realize was it only has 1 bathroom which was a hassle for us,specially in the morning.,,,,

Although I didn't meet Jon personally he made us feel very welcome. The apartment had everything we needed. It's just as it appears in the photos - impeccably clean, spacious and beautifully furnished. The Downtown location is superb, with shops and restaurants literally on the door step. Ideal for shopping, eating out and as a base to get to museums etc. We had a fantastic time in Jon's apartment - if you have the chance to stay here, I would thoroughly recommend it as a great place to stay."
497810,41203743,2015-08-05,33391243,Hilary,"We found Jon's place just fine for a family of four.  Comfortable beds and enough space for us all to spread out.  Shared bathroom with large tub/shower.   This was our first experience with Airbnb and have to say it was very easy and Jon's communication with us was great.  As a centrally located apartment in Downtown Crossing, we had easy access to Boston's sights along the freedom trail and Public transportation to other points of interest. Highly recommend Jon's place for anyone new to Boston."
497810,41378687,2015-08-07,36289228,William,"Staying here was a perfect way to see Boston for the first time.  The location was absolutely perfect!!!  Right next to Boston Commons, the Theater District and the Freedom Trail.  I can't say how much I appreciate being able to make use of the condo.  House was spotless.  Bed's were very comfortable.  Kitchen/Bathroom were great.  Jon was a great host and stayed in contact the whole time.  Highly recommend."
Positives:  Perfect location,clean,comfortable.  Five Stars!!!,,,
Negatives:  None.  Loved it.,,,,,
Neutrals:  The couches in the living room were not very comfortable.  But that was ok,because we spent most of our time exploring Boston.,,,,

We were also accused of inflicting significant damage to the concrete floor and of breaking the toilet seat in half.  While it is probable that one of our guests cracked the toilet hinge, we neither damaged the floor nor \"\"broke the seat in half.\"\" The host needs to learn to temper his hyperbole and contact his guests only one-two times during their stay.\""

We were airbnb newbies & didn't follow the (simple) check in instructions very well, Jon was extremely helpful and couldn't have helped more. We had the additional complication of a wheelchair and again Jon was very flexible with us which made our vacation much easier. The beds are all very comfortable & there was bags of space for our family of 5. Would happily recommend both Jon & the apartment to anyone."

There are lots of good restaurants and pubs around for night life, and the condo included WiFi, Apple TV and others useful services such as Iron to be ready for our meetings! Small notes, the place due to its location might seem to some noisy but it did not bother us much thanks to the included ear plug."

Although it was not his fault, the area was under construction but he warned us and made sure we had ear plugs.  Honestly, it wasn't necessary because it wasn't that loud.

Plenty of food options near by. The only negative was that construction work was happening all night with the building next door being renovated. Jon did provide ear plugs, which were welcomed. But the noise can be trying for light sleepers. It's clearly a temporary issue. I wouldn't hesitate to book the venue again."

497810,67624927,2016-03-30,36148068,Ken,Incredible location in the heart of the Boston theater district.
Jon was very responsive before and during the rental,even as he was traveling internationally.  Even ordered a french press when asked about a coffee maker!  Easy check-in.,,,,
HOWEVER,the place was not 100% to our liking.  Some of it had to be a new/inattentive cleaning crew.  There was old food in the fridge from the previous tenants and the bathroom trash was full and floor dirty.,,,,
But beyond that,the major issue was personal belongings.  Kitchen cabinets were full of personal food items so basically no room for our food storage.  The closets and dressers were full of personal clothing,and the bathroom was full of what appeared to be personal amenities.  The kitchenware was incomplete and mismatched.  Cool if you're renting a room only,but when I spend ~$500/night for the whole place I expect to not feel like I'm living with other people's stuff.   Rather,I'm looking for an elevated experience which I didn't get here.,
Also it seemed like some repairs were going on,the switch and outlet covers were all taken off and there was some paint overspray in a few places.,,,,
To Jon's credit,he provided a partial refund without us asking.,,,,
This place has potential.  With some focus (better housekeeping,removed personal belongings,remove food,"remove bathroom stuff). upgrade the couch and get rid of the odd unneeded 4th bed and gymnastics pads) I think it would be worth it.   I'd inquire with Jon about these things before renting again.\"",,

We were literally a 5 to 15 minute walk from everywhere we wanted to see and located at the Downtown Crossing train station that takes you anywhere in the city.  Check in was easy, the condo was very clean, the beds were comfortable, the WiFi worked great and again anything and everything we wanted was within minutes away.

"The apartment itself was clean and well furnished. The beds were comfortable. Lots of towels. Wifi and Apple TV worked great. The check-in/check-out process was simple and well-communicated. The street noise wasn't too bad but there was a lot of construction noise from crews that seem to get started pretty early in the morning. Otherwise we really enjoyed our stay. \"",,,,,

Our host had everything any traveler would need (towels, blow dryer, and even umbrellas just to name a few) and wants (washer/dryer, comfy beds, and a fully stocked kitchen).  It had three good size bedrooms that allowed ALOT of privacy for everyone.  It was so close to the Boston Common Park that I was able to take my two year old to the splash pads/pool everyday during our stay.  I would recommend parking your car at one of the hotels. You will not need to drive anywhere.  I absolutely love this AirBnB apartment!"

On a whim I searched Airbnb and came across Max/Ryan's Back Bay large studio. I wanted comfort, tasteful decor, convenience and above all, privacy, I spent weeks recouping and now feel it is my Boston home away from home. The host gracious, walked me through all questions, brought me flowers and fruit when he knew I would be at Drs and genuinely so kind...someone I could see actually being friends with! The apartment was spotless. The white sheets and towels pristine. Even better, the unit has a back door, so I could leave or enter without ever seeing another person. For me and my needs, on a scale of 1-10, this was a 12+. I will definitely be back. Thank you with all my heart."

9725178,88297634,2016-07-24,35646429,Pehr,Awesome location in Boston. Immaculate apartment. Caring and communicative host.
I was in town for business and thought it was a great alternative to staying at a hotel. Entering and leaving from the backside of the building means you have easy access to the apartment.  For those who are not accustomed to the Old-World charms of Boston it might be worth mentioning that the back-entrance door does not follow modern standards,and there are three four steps to navigate. However,this is part of staying in the Back Bay. There is a mix of European Flair with American ingenuity.,,,
Although I never met the host throughout the stay,it almost felt like I did. He provided excellent instructions for everything from checking in to turning on Netflix. I appreciate that he sent me messages both before,during and after the stay to make sure everything was ok.,,,

Rebecca was also kind enough to drop off a wine opener for us.

Le fenetre tres large presente un atout pour la luminosité mais il faudrait accentuer son isolation thermique et phonique,ainsi l'appartement gagnerait en confort.,,,,

12365454,77065957,2016-05-30,67740293,Michelle,"Apartment was great, Rebecca was very helpful. We fit 2 couples, a teenager, and a 2 year old comfortably. Only complaint anyone had was the teenager sleeping on the couch had some trouble sleeping due to the noise from outside and the bright lights from the street - but that's what you get for renting a place right in the middle of the city. The beds and couch were very comfortable. Overall a great experience!"

12365454,78854796,2016-06-09,57290504,Chris,"Nice place in a convenient location but lots of partying going on in the neighboring apartments, and the common area was filthy. It was really loud at night as people were screaming and running through the hallways. Not sure if this is an ongoing issue or if we were there at the wrong time."
12365454,79669352,2016-06-13,69023195,Liang,The location is great. The apartment is clean and well equipped. We had enjoyed our stay very much.

12365454,80471564,2016-06-18,67806407,Scott,Staying at Rebecca's in the heart of Boston was great. Rebecca was very detailed and welcoming. We had a brief issue finding the entrance at 1:30 am and she cheerfully accepted a call. The space is clean and inviting and could not be more centrally located. Walking out the front door to find Boston commons and the capitol only a half a block to the left is sensational. (She keeps good coffee in the cupboard as well!) Thank you!
12365454,81510637,2016-06-23,68138976,Chris,"The place was clean and well taken care of, but walking up to the building, I felt a little uneasy even mid day with a few sketchy people hanging out on the street. The entry way smelled like someone has urinated in it, but the place is in the middle of Boston in a GREAT location to the T, Boston Commons and a fantastic market. It's urban living and besides the 1st day, we felt safe walking down the street at all times of the day."
The apartment had pretty much everything you need,but you'll need to bring your own oil and spices. Beds were hotel quality,comfy couch and plenty of towels for the bathroom.,,,
Our only issue with the apartment was the neighbors were a little load late at night and the smell of marijuana was whiffing under the door,so we threw a few used towels down to keep it out for the kids. We live in SF and we're use to apartment living,so it really wasn't that big of a deal.,,,
If we were going back to Boston,I would definitely rent this place again. Rebecca was extremely nice and meet us when we got there offering any help and if we run out of anything,"let her know. \"",,,
12365454,82958815,2016-06-30,75472342,Chris,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was great.  All the communication was on-point and clear.  Rebecca allowed us to get in a few hours early to drop off our bags, which was much appreciated.  The apartment was perfect for our trip, in the heart of Boston within easy walking distance to the Freedom Trail, public transport and shopping."
12365454,83624834,2016-07-03,54635638,Cara,"Rebecca was an excellent host! She was very responsive to any questions that I had. The apartment is beautiful and in a great location in downtown Boston, right next to an entrance for public transportation. One thing that I don't think was mentioned in the description was the stairs to get to the apartment. There are two flights of steep stairs, which was not a problem for my group, but would be an issue for anyone with a disability or inability to climb stairs. The apartment was great overall and I would definitely stay here again!"
12365454,84166974,2016-07-05,75477414,Heather,Rebecca was a great host.  Her apartment was just as described and we loved the location. It was close to the subway and within walking distance of restaurants and Boston Common.

12365454,84857575,2016-07-09,19261249,Brandon,"Rebecca was very responsive to inquiries and the place was extremely clean. We were especially happy the apartment was stocked with towels, shampoo/soap, pots/pans, bowls/plates, and even filled ice trays in the freezer! Great experience, and a centrally located apartment right next to the Downtown Crossing T stop & bars/restaurants nearby. Thumbs up!"
12365454,85497537,2016-07-11,24087789,Nick,Couldn't have asked for a better host or place to stay!  Right in the heart of everything Boston and within walking distance of all downtown and public transportation. The place itself was very clean and comfortable and Rebecca was incredibly accommodating and ready to answer any questions. Highly recommend this location and host!

12365454,86324615,2016-07-16,30612550,Charlotte,"This lovely apartment is truly in the heart of Boston, barely a block from Boston Common. The location was perfect for getting around, but since it is in the middle of the city, it is a little noisy at night, especially in the bedroom with windows facing the street. However, ear plugs did the trick, so as long as you are prepared, you can get a very good night's sleep. Speaking of sleep, the beds in the apartment are amazingly comfortable!!"
12365454,87472192,2016-07-20,47592089,Abid,"Rebecca provided a perfect home base for our trip to Boston.  The apt is clean and easy to access.  It provides a great place to explore the city.  Just steps from the Boston Common and the Freedom Trail.  Easy access to Chinatown, Downtown Crossing, Faneuil Hall  and the Back Bay.  Even with a 1-year-old in tow we were able to easily walk to all of the above.  The central location allowed us to make it back in time for naps and go right back out to explore another area.  There is a bedroom away from the somewhat noisy street with no windows that is perfect for a child or a light sleeper.  There are countless option for food and drink just steps from the door.  The central air conditioning was a very welcome surprise on a 93 degree day on a town with very little A/C.  Rebecca was an extremely responsive and accommodating host.  She allowed us to alter our check in time slightly to accommodate nap time.  I saw some complaints of loud neighbors in the reviews but we did not experience that problem.  Overall, a great experience."
12365454,88820588,2016-07-25,16531898,Carsten,This apt. is perfectly located to explore Boston. Allmost everything within walking distance - and the subway station is just around the corner. The place was clean and beds comfortable.

A short walk to just about everything you'd want to see - Boston Common, the freedom trail, little Italy, the ferry to P-Town (which can totally be done in a day trip).  Additionally the place has all of the amenities you could possibly want or need, down to a washer and dryer just outside the front door.  Lastly, Rebecca was amazing and very helpful and welcoming."

13653016,92047644,2016-08-07,42062287,Jon,"This seemed more like a hotel then an AirBNB so everything worked very smooth and was easy, affordable and convenient.  I didn't ever see my host or contact them (aside receiving an initial instruction email), and didn't need to."
13653016,97679593,2016-08-28,21537922,John,"When I say new, I mean this place is a brand new building with paint still drying as of 8/26/2016. My daughter and I stayed here for three days while I dropped her at college. Total cost of $927 for three nights.  This appears to be made-for-air-b-and-b apartment as it does not appear to be a residence and it is managed professionally out of Canada, which is good in that you will be dealing with professionals. The only downsides are they do not have black out shades or blinds, only sheer blinds that allow the sun to shine very brightly. If you are good with eye masks you are set. The other thing is the mattress is encased in a plastic mattress bag, which is good for keeping out bed bugs, but can get a little hot. You may want to request or bring an egg crate topper for the beds. Other than those two things it was excellent!"

8340599,48227781,2015-09-24,43343333,Magica,Carlos e Gabriela sono due host gentilissimi e molto premurosi. Quando siamo arrivati ci hanno mostrato la casa e il quartiere e avevano preparato una serie di brochure e mappe per agevolare la nostra permanenza a boston. La casa era pulitissima e perfettamente corrispondente alla descrizione. Ci siamo trovati veramente bene. Consigliatissimo!

Neighbourhood very convenient for airport (but I didn't hear any aircraft noise).  Close to T station on Boston's subway network.,,,,,
My only problem was the stairs with a heavy case,"and getting in the front door downstairs while manoeuvring luggage. However Gabriela made light work of carrying my case up for me.\"",,,,
8340599,49060235,2015-09-30,44198031,Corinna,Carlos and Gabriela are very friendly people. My boyfriend and i felt very comfortable at their home. They gave us tips for Boston cause we hadn't prepared anything for this town. With the subway you can get easy to the center of Boston thanks to the favorable position of their home (5-10 mins). I can recommend their place!
8340599,50660893,2015-10-13,43966091,Anna,The hosts were just great! Very nice persons! Our daughter said Carlos is nice and cute)
The room and the whole place was very nice and cozy and clean. Just like on pictures.,,,,,
The neighborhood is nice with small historic houses,cafes and food stores. One metro stop from the very downtown and one stop (or \thwalkable) from the airport.,,,,
Highly recomended!!!,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
8340599,51158481,2015-10-18,21977384,Margo,"If you are looking for a quiet place, this is a good spot."
Unfortunately,my stay was not without issue.,,,,
I've listed them below.,,,,,
1) Trying to get instructions to the apartment. I had asked Carlos what the transit directions were,but did not get a response. As a result,myself and my friend ended up taking a taxi. We later found out we were one stop away from the apartment which would have saved us $12 since we had planned on buying a 7 day transit pass and ended up doing so later that day.,,,
2) When we arrived,we found that the bathroom was not clean. There was hair on the floor,a razor,toothpaste and tweezers left on the counter by the sink.,,
3) On the first evening,the bed frame broke,collapsed in essentially.  Myself and my friend staying with me tried to fix it,but it didn't hold up for the entire night. This of course resulted in a very uncomfortable night sleep. In the morning,I contacted Carlos and he was quick to respond and apologize and stated he would have that fixed right away. I sent him photos to better understand what the issue was. When I arrived back at the apartment later that day,Carlos had indicated he put the bed back together
Overall,it was not the experience I was hoping for,especially since the trip was to celebrate my birthday.  I will say that Carlos offering a refund without us requesting was commendable. The apartment is also close to transit,"which made accessing other parts of Boston very easy.\"",,
8340599,53604286,2015-11-10,38620000,Jacob,"Carlos and Gabriella were great hosts! They were friendly and always helpful when I had questions. Their place was also pretty close to the T, so I was able to go anywhere in Boston pretty easily. Would recommend their place to anyone!"
8340599,53996772,2015-11-15,23637087,James,"Carlos was nice, gave a couple tips of places to try in the area and of how to get downtown.  His place was very nice - clean, uncluttered, as pictured.  Was very convenient from the airport - I took the shuttle to the rental car building and then it was probably only the equivalent of an approximately 5 block walk to his apartment in a decent neighborhood.  Would definitely consider staying there again."
8340599,54933457,2015-11-25,16834751,Grover,"I arrived pretty late on 2AM and Carlos's roommate stayed up to check me in and introduce all the stuff, the room is exactly as described and all facilities are well maintained. During my 2-night stay in the house, I like the feeling Airbnb differs from Couchsurfing, it gives you much privacy without being so sociable, and Carlos knows exactly what to offer. Anyway, thanks for your hospitality and wish you happy holiday."
FYI,the house is 7-min walk from either MBTA airport station or Maverick station,$15 to take a cab from airport,"got some amazing restaurants within walking distance.\"",,
8340599,55025229,2015-11-27,27400945,Marco,"Carlos and his girlfriend are really nice hosts, friendly and welcoming. The room matched the description and the house is neat and pleasant"
8340599,55178386,2015-11-28,23637087,James,"Stayed with Carlos again.  Experience was similar.  No frills, just the basics, but more than enough and for a good price."
8340599,55735230,2015-12-05,48893081,Shen,"It is a vary good experience to live in Carlos' apartment. The room is nice, quiet and clean. Near train station and walking distance to airport. I'm pretty enjoy the 7days in his apartment."
8340599,64423570,2016-03-04,48338405,Serena,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Carlos' apartment 2 months. We met Carlos only one time, because he and his girlfriend were not in Boston, so we divided the apartment with one of his friend. Everything was just perfect. First of all, the house is located just 6-7 minutes walk to the T station stop (Maverick) on the Blue line, one stop away from the center of the city. It's also a couple of minutes walk to the Airport T stop. Carlos left the apartment very clean with every comfort. Kitchen, bathroom, living room and our room had everything we need. The only negative aspect was the washmachine in the building, which was broken, but Carlos advised us a laundromat just a block away and we could wash our clothes for about 5$, so we had no problems. During our stay, we really felt like home and, if we come back to Boston, we'll absolutely stay at Carlos' apartment again!"
9367059,70653966,2016-04-19,49626743,Aaron,Amazing location in Boston especially for the marathon. Krystle was very accommodating and made everything pretty stress free.  The place was as advertised. Definitely a good pick of you are looking for a budget friendly option in Boston.

Everything worked smoothly,"even though I arrived in the evening.\"",,,,
7454966,54405186,2015-11-19,15088854,Vicky,"We stayed 4 nights here. The house is conveniently located just 2 minutes walk from the JFK/UMass T station.  The living arrangements reminded me very much of my undergraduate days in the coop housing, e.g., sparsely furnished, with a bathroom that encouraged quick use of the facilities, but overall a good deal for the low price. We did not use the rather spacious kitchen. A couple other guests were staying on our floor, though we never saw them. Our hosts responded very rapidly to any questions or concerns we posted on Airbnb, though we didn-t see them either, except for the first day. We found the place a bit cold, but then we live in the tropics. We had three blankets though they were all a bit thin.  A fitted sheet was provided but not a regular sheet."
7454966,70435507,2016-04-17,65997235,Yunuen,"Barrio súper seguro, la estación T a 5 min caminando, tiendas cercanas, la anfitriona es ciertamente lo mejor del lugar, te hará sentir como en casa, se toma su tiempo para explicarte lugares cercanos de interés así como modos de transporte, definitivamente regresaría, sin duda una de las mejores ciudades de EUA por la educación y amabilidad de las personas."
7454966,76104168,2016-05-24,48353471,Maxence,"The place was ok. The host responded quickly to my questions (I arrived earlier than planned and I didn't wait so long). He wasn't particularly welcoming though. The bathroom is kind of dirty, the mattress is really thin, the bed is loud. The neibourhood is really cool, families and stuff, it's right beside the subway, downtown is near. To be honest, staying there was cheap, the experience went along with it. If you can afford better, pay for better. If not, you can crash there at the end of your day and you'll still have a wonderful time in Boston."
7454966,78480000,2016-06-07,66497334,Andrés,Really nice place to stay.
Clean,comfortable,placed in a nice neighborhood,the host was so helpful and she helped us too much.,,
A really nice aspect is that it's a 2 minutes walk from the train station ands that give you access easily to the public transportation system of the city.,,,,,
"Nice idea to stay in this house.\"",,,,,
7454966,81042772,2016-06-20,66590288,Frank,First time we did AirBnB. Choose the location because of the location. 5 Minutes walk to underground station which is important if you do not have a car. I was contacted by the landlord soon after booking through text messages. Easy to find. Room was basic (but I have expected) but large and clean. There was  a kitchen which could be used. Several other rooms are rented but this was not a problem. Bathroom could be cleaner.  Highly recommended if you look for a reasonable priced accommodation with excellent public transport links.
7454966,95134449,2016-08-18,53365760,Saskya,Orchid met us personally to give us the keys and make sure we felt welcomed and settled in. Communication was excellent.
We visited Boston during the summer,and although there is no AC it is very ventilated and pleasant inside the room. The room was very clean and cozy,kitchen nicely equipped,and the bathroom was also very clean. In addition,the apartment is super close to the subway station - easy and fast to get to downtown. The neighborhood is located in a quiet residential area with a supermarket conveniently within walking distance,and the people are friendly.
"Would definitely love to stay at Orchid's place again!\"",,,,,

7721323,42485291,2015-08-13,4793922,Tim,Apartment was as advertised and the host was both communicative and helpful.   A nice alternative to a hotel and close to pretty much everything you need.
7721323,43320447,2015-08-18,15385596,Lisa,"The neighborhood is very nice, right on the T line, restaurants close by. The studio is small, clean and very pleasant. If you have a car, consider another neighborhood - there is absolutely no parking anywhere."
7721323,45026391,2015-08-30,3699088,Rakhi,Very nice and comfortable apt. Close to T train. Feels like home.

7721323,46172653,2015-09-08,12446685,David,"Katharina was very responsive when we had questions and Maureen was accommodating for our late arrival. The studio was nice and clean and everything we needed for our long weekend in Boston. It is a bonus that it was so close to 3 different trains on the green line, making it easy to see different parts of the city. A great experience for our first time using AirBnB."

7721323,47493868,2015-09-19,19894436,Alana,"This studio was perfect for my stay in Boston. It was nice, in a good neighborhood, comfortable and near BC which is what I needed for my trip. Easy access to public transportation. The building is older and does have the normal sounds you'd expect from neighbors all around (hearing them walk above you), but no loud music or anything like that. The bed is a sofa bed so it's not the most comfortable but perfectly acceptable for a short stay. Katharina was easily contacted as was her MIL Maureen who was especially helpful. She made other arrangements for me specifically when we realized my short self wouldn't be able to access where the keys are normally kept and I really appreciated that. I would definitely stay there again if I come back to Boston!"
7721323,48556766,2015-09-27,36303321,Jerome,"Great neighborhood and location next to the T (B Line).  The apartment was just as described and was very comfortable with a delightful atmosphere that was most welcoming. Katharina was very quick to respond to messages and easy to work with.  The unit is cozy yet bright and has everything one might need and especially enjoyed the little kitchen.  Overall, staying here was a great experience and I would definitely recommend it to others."
7721323,52142567,2015-10-26,35026266,Sean,"Such a lovely place to stay, and it was super convenient being so close to Boston College! I could definitely see myself coming back here should I find myself once again in the Chestnut Hill area."
7721323,54002554,2015-11-15,14951723,John,"Katharina and Maureen were fantastic. Muareen even made sure there was coffee available for me for the duration I my stay. Overall, the place wa exactly as described and worked perfect for my needs. It is so close to the trains for getting around town. The neighborhood around the receiver is beautiful. The building is older and is quite nice. The age of the building does make carryover noise from the other units noticeable but completely tolerable. There street noise can be a bit loud but that is to be expected in the city. Also, the bed is pullout sofa  but it was comfortable. I really enjoyed my stay and would be happy to stay here again. Perfect for a single traveler or couple."
7721323,71200370,2016-04-24,26469737,Charles,"Katharina and Maureen were very welcoming and easy to deal with, prompt and helpful. Bottled water and bananas were a nice extra touch. The apartment is not beautiful, really, but it is comfortable, quiet, safe, private -- everything I could have wanted for a weekend in Boston. The sofabed is modern, with no bar across the backside; I slept well there. And the location can't be beat, with a T stop on the block, shops nearby and Zipcars handy."
7721323,74097880,2016-05-13,65680415,Brett,"Nice apartment on the 3rd floor over Commonwealth ave. A good location, with a  convenient and pleasant to walk to Boston College. Also very convenient for  the Green line (B, C and D) for getting into Boston."
7721323,76135911,2016-05-25,21502096,Laura,My parent's stay at Katherina's place was great. Katherina's mother in law was very helpful and responsive. The bed was not the most comfortable but that was expected since I knew it would be a pullout couch. The location is great and near BC and the T lines.

Maureen was very helpful indeed - going so far as to stand in a parking space outside while I drove round the block! A bit of traffic noise, but no more than might be expected given the location. Nice neighbourhood. Cleveland Circle is only 10 minutes walk away with convenience stores, restaurants and an alternative access to a different (and shorter) line of the T.  We'd go back."

When I arrived, everything I needed was available and easy to access.  The room was cozy and bright, with plenty of room for one person or a couple.  Drew was very responsive and was sure to follow up with me after my visit.  A great experience all around!"
8271384,48594850,2015-09-27,43272744,Kevon,"Lovely cozy studio located in south Boston. The studio was neat, clean, tidy, and came with everything we needed. It was located a few blocks away from the red line.Most importantly, drew was very helpful as I considered canceling our reservation last minute because I wasn't feeling well. Drew was very accommodating when we finally decided to show up hours later than expected. I highly recommend staying here and will definitely stay here again if given the chance!"
8271384,48976343,2015-09-29,6808442,Dan,Great short notice stay in a convenient area! Definitely recommend.
8271384,49087355,2015-09-30,5177095,Zohra,Drew's place was simple but plenty comfortable. He had all of the essentials to make your stay in Boston great. It's located in South Boston and within walking distance to the Seaport. Drew was awesome about coordinating getting me into the apt and settled despite him needing to be elsewhere. Definitely recommend staying with him.
8271384,49260771,2015-10-02,44175646,Davin,Great neighborhood! As advertised. I enjoyed the experience.
8271384,49819864,2015-10-06,41960609,Zichao,"I rent Drew's studio for 3 times, totally around 10 days, for my parents during their visit to Boston. My parents were pretty satisfied with his place, like environment, convenience and so on. Besides, Drew is a very nice person who really cares his tenants as he helped my parents a lot. This quite studio is just 5 mins walk to the T station and surrounded by many restaurants and stores. I highly recommend Drew and his Studio to you all."
8271384,50101787,2015-10-09,44252429,Benjamin,"Drew manages the property in South Boston for the owner that lives upstairs.  He is very nice, attentive and helpful.  You will like him.  As for the apartment, it's very true to the pictures.  The bed is really comfortable... a memory foam mattress that is better than you have a right to expect at this price point.   Bathroom is nice and they have  plenty of towels, shampoo, conditioner, etc.   The neighborhood is OK.  Not a lot of stores, restaurants or bars within a few blocks... I imagine that will change in the next few years.   Parking is not good for non-residents. I didn't find an option except a lot 6 blocks away that was $24 per day.   That said, I never had to wait more than 5 minutes for an Uber and would avoid having a car in Boston the next time i come back.  Overall, a great experience."
8271384,50880773,2015-10-15,12676842,John,"The apartment is as advertised and as other reviewers have confirmed is in a good location, close to subway and two blocks from local shops and restaurants and if needed a laundromat. Walking distance to downtown Boston. Check in went well. We were met by Drew's associate, John, who showed us through and gave us plenty of tips on how to get around. The bed is very comfortable and the apartment is fine for a couple.  We only stayed for two nights, but would come back again if we return to Boston."
8271384,51740996,2015-10-24,9153488,Andrea,"The listing description and photos are very accurate, and it was nice to have the owner meet us when we arrived. The location was perfect, both for exploring as tourists and for attending a conference down at the convention center."
8271384,51952756,2015-10-25,45668525,Lea,"Our host waited until 1:30 am to let us in, which was very kind! He also came the next day with fresh towels and was friendly to us. The neighborhood seemed to have a lot of new bars and restaurants, though we didn't explore it too much. It was very close to the T and Lyft rides were easy to get. The place had everything we needed and was affordable for Boston."
8271384,52728534,2015-11-01,44963422,Dorothea,"Very cozy, clean and tidy apartment. Well equipped. In a nice quiet neighborhood. We enjoyed our stay very much and will definitely recommend it to friends."

8271384,53384062,2015-11-08,28826973,Dianne,Drew kept in close touch before our visit and was there to greet us and explain things. We barely used the apt. It worked fine. Liked the neighborhood with remnants of the old Southie mixed in with the new.

8271384,54912777,2015-11-25,25314984,Jan,"Great location and great appartment. The bed is just amazing. Drew is a wonderful host, very attentive and welcoming. It can get a bit chilly when it is really cold outside (there is central air and the warm and incredibly comfortable bed as a solution). I would definitively come back. Thank you, Drew, for the great time."

Traveled to Boston for business and found the perfect little home away from home in this very clean and cozy studio apartment. It was nice to be able to cook meals in the full kitchen. Plus it was within walking distance to the grocery store and a few good restaurants (for when we were too lazy to cook!) Host was extremely accommodating and our stay was excellent."

Drew was also a fantastic host. He went out of his way to help me get settled in Boston (where I would be for a few months after staying in his apartment) and accommodated everything I needed.,,,,,
The place does get pretty bright in the morning,but this didn't bother me. Still,it's something to keep in mind if you're used to having curtains and want to sleep in.,,,

8271384,64813317,2016-03-08,14696846,Abbie,Great spot.  I was there for a conference at the Convention Center.  Very close to it.  About a 15 minute walk.  House is super cute.  Not sure how convenient it is to the city because I didn't go there.  Would stay again if i have to go to another conference. I loved how comfy the bed was!

This is a comfy,efficient apartment in a convenient part of So Boston,near downtown. (If you haven't been to So Boston for a while,please note that it is dynamic and prosperous now — unlike in the late 20th c.),,
The Broadway stop on the Red Line is a few minutes' walk. There is a range of cafés and services within easy walking distance (and the fashionable Coppersmith only two blocks away). Yet this is a quiet residential street.,,,,,

Spoiler alert: Neptune was amazing!!! The apartment is centrally located, easy to get into, and very comfortable. Not to mention a special welcome gift (don't want to ruin the surprise for future guests). Loved it!"
8271384,66680527,2016-03-24,54488624,Philippe,"I rented this studio apartment as I was attending a conference at the Convention center and didnt want to pay the exorbitant prices of the Convention-adjacent hotels. I was very happy with my choice. The location was great. I timed my walk to the Convention Center: 8 minutes when taking 3rd and then D Street all the way to the Center. The studio was exactly as shown in the pictures. Everything was clean, the bed was comfy and the hear worked well (which is crucial in a place like Boston). I also liked the funky 30s inspired mirror furniture, very stylish! If there was one improvement to make, it would be to increase the pressure in the shower which was on the low side. All in all, I was very happy with my stay and would definitely return. Thank you Drew for making my stay so enjoyable."

It was perfect for my girlfriend and I to celebrate our anniversary in Boston. The neighborhood was incredibly quiet, parking was not an issue at all, and there were plenty of stores and restaurants nearby. Foodies (literally 1 minute walk from the apartment) was a great small market. Walls seem thin, but the streets were so quiet it didn't make any difference. It was a little drafty, but the heat works incredibly efficiently so it wasn't a problem at all."
Drew made the whole experience really easy for us. We actually never saw him,"which was a great thing because no problems came up! Everything in the apartment was fully stocked and very tidy.

We were happy to have met John who greeted us during his lunch hour and went over everything necessary for our night's stay. They were generously flexible with our check in and check out times (Thank you, again!) and we immediately felt comfortable as we walked in. Their space is light filled and better than pictured. I felt they maximized the space as best as possible with their finely picked furniture. We easily walked to lunch and then to the T from their apt and would definitely consider staying here again if it's not already booked!"

8271384,77977777,2016-06-04,13843125,Melanie,Drew and John are very nice hosts and we felt welcome from the first moment. We had an early check in which was great. The flat is clean and has everything you need. The bed was compfy and the location is perfect. It's just a short walk to the city center and there are some nice restaurants/bars just around the corner. Highly recommend!
8271384,78836247,2016-06-09,10879304,Alana,"Drew's place is in a great part of town. I'm glad I stayed in Southie, I may not have gotten to see as much had I stayed in one of the other neighborhoods closer to work. The space is pretty spacious for a studio, and it was indeed bright, which was refreshing in the mornings. Super walkable, I was able to walk to work in the financial district most of the time. Make sure to visit Bell's for some deli meats while you're near by."
8271384,79575191,2016-06-13,55069517,Josue,"Awesome apt, exactly as seen on picture. The apt was very clean and has everything you need to make the experience better. Drew was very attentive and answered all my text immediately. Definitely will stay again."

8271384,80318150,2016-06-17,8641792,Richard,"Drew's apartment was exactly as described, comfortable, welcoming and perfect for what I needed."
Drew's communication from time of booking all the way through until checkout was fantastic,courteous and respectful. This part of Boston is quiet,safe and I felt very at home. A short distance to grocery,restaurants and a beach for an after work run/walk etc. is close by.,,
"I'd happily recommend Drew's apartment to friends and stay again myself. \"",,,,,
8271384,80746686,2016-06-19,36487387,Christina,"Located in the heart of trendy South Boston, this place was a true gem. Great Bostonian feel with clean, bright, traditional feel decor. The newly installed air conditioning was an appreciated bonus!"
8271384,81300198,2016-06-22,2738223,Stuart,"Drew was well prepared with detailed instructions and really responsive when I had questions about checkin, parking, and anything else. Great host!"
8271384,81881975,2016-06-25,20244871,Abdulhadi,"Drew's place is exactly like it is in the pictures: cozy, clean, and well-kept! The neighborhood is quiet and safe, and a little away from busy streets so you can get yourself a good night sleep! Drew was very responsive, and checked in on us to see how we were doing and if we needed anything."
8271384,82509784,2016-06-27,6472668,Megan,"I stayed at Drew's studio for a couple of nights while in town for a conference. It's a perfect spot - spacious, bright, clean, quiet, and with all the amenities you'd need. It's clear that the space has been carefully thought out for guests. Would certainly stay here again. Turns out my conference was actually at the Hynes Convention Center, and not the Boston Convention Center, but it still worked out well!"
8271384,82664364,2016-06-28,67209068,Wayne,"Drew did a great job with keeping in communication leading up to, during, and after my stay at his place.  He gave me clear instructions on getting to and into his studio.  The place is in a nice spot in South Boston, well within walking distance of the seaport and several restaurants and bars.  The studio was clean, accurately described, and had several useful amenities like an iron/ironing board, blow dryer, coffee, shampoo/soap, and towels.  The price was very reasonable for what is being charged in Boston during the summer."
8271384,82939829,2016-06-30,23007792,Neil,Great place! Perfect location for the conference center and Drew was extremely helpful in my last minute needs!
8271384,83910555,2016-07-04,19202114,Matthew,"Drew was a fantastic host. He was in close communication until we arrived. After he was easily accessible by text if we needed. Short walk to convention center. Ran out of a few items and Drew was able to bring the over before we got back. Little grocery store a block away was nice to get eggs and a few items to cook. The sun comes up at 5:11am, I would recommend back out curtains. Overall good experience."
8271384,84448792,2016-07-07,52561872,Juan,"He was a good host , solved all my questions on time, And was will inglés to help. The studio was beautiful very clean And very organized."

8271384,86231427,2016-07-15,5943361,Paul,"The unit was perfect! I had a conference at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, and the unit is a short 10 minute walk from the Center. The size was just what I needed with all the amenities---including a newly installed AC for those hot Boston summer days. Drew went above and beyond to make sure I got in, got settled, and had a pleasant stay. When I checked out and accidentally left my shirt in the closet, Drew texted me to let me know I could come back and pick it up. Great service!"
8271384,86720898,2016-07-17,1405687,Rebecca,"Less than a 20 min drive to the airport, and even closer to downtown Boston, this studio apartment was the perfect location for our weekend trip. Clean and beautiful studio, with a comfortable bed and central AC in a quiet neighborhood. We didn't meet Drew, however communication with him was fantastic- he was always quick to respond and checked in with us during our stay. Would definitely stay here again!"
8271384,87987287,2016-07-22,47024182,Anton,"It was great experience for me. I was in business trip and all I needed is the place to sleep close to everything, comfortable and cheaper than a hotel. The studio worked ideally for me. Great value for money."
8271384,89180554,2016-07-27,35724170,Christina,"Overall, the property was great. The pictures were accurate. Drew was helpful when any questions came up. The neighborhood was clean and felt safe. I would stay again."
8271384,89511633,2016-07-28,65475070,Courtney,Generally convenient. It's about a mile walk to the front of the convention center. There's a grocery store right around the corner too. Drew was friendly and there were no hiccups.
8271384,89912618,2016-07-30,85994318,Ridhi,"I had a great experience at this Airbnb! It was in a very safe and quiet neighborhood, and was only about 10-15 minutes from all the popular areas that we wanted to go to in Boston. The studio was extremely clean and and comfortable, and Drew was easily accessible all weekend. Every basic thing that we needed was supplied (toiletries, dishes, pots/pans, coffee, condiments, etc.) For the area, the price was very good as well. The only inconvenient thing was parking, since street parking for visitors was only freefrom 10-6 on weekdays and on the weekends. We had to pay to park our car at an expensive parking garage a 5 minute cab drive away, but parking seems to be this way throughout the entire city. Other than that, I'd definitely recommend staying here!"
8271384,91673625,2016-08-06,1934411,Mia,"Really nice place, quiet street.  Bigger than I expected based on pictures. Great location if you need to go to the exhibition and convention center, close to public transport. I would definately consider to stay here again the next time I am going to Boston."
8271384,92727902,2016-08-09,62203881,Tegan,Drew was helpful with checkin and the listing was very accurate to the accommodation.
8271384,92885221,2016-08-10,19187985,Chip,Drew was great.  He was very responsive to all of my texts/questions and was very helpful.  He also made a special point to come to the apartment to introduce himself and to meet me.  I was very pleased with my stay!
8271384,93411933,2016-08-12,55040119,Dan,"Great spot for all business travellers. While the space was cozy and clean, the close proximity to the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center makes its the ideal location. Highly recommend for next Boston trip."
8271384,93937891,2016-08-14,26601308,Jessie,Apartment was great. Clean and Drew was great about getting back to me regarding check in. Not Drews fault but there was a guy who had puked all over himself and was passed out on the outside steps when we came back Friday night. That's Friday in Boston for you though. Over all I would stay here again 100%. Thanks drew!!!
8271384,95693417,2016-08-20,78375155,Miyoung,"Drew was really nice host. The house was already prepared clean and nice. The location is excellent, which is located near airport and convention center. And market(Foodies) and subway (broadway station) are located around the house, it's really convenient to use public transport."
I was happy during stay the house,it's really fantastic experiences. If you search to stay in Boston,"I recommend you Drew's house. \"",,,
8271384,98667910,2016-09-01,57955585,Matthew,Very responsive.  The place was very clean and everything was as advertised.  Great experience and great working with Drew.
8271384,99234458,2016-09-04,22318786,Sebastian,Nice room to stay a few days in Boston. It is not very close to the old town but we expected that before ;-) The bed is very comfortable!
8271384,99930120,2016-09-06,18275017,Patricia,"The studio was a great spot for my partner and I to drop our bags and go out and about. Pretty conveniently placed near public transit and a short Uber ride most places. Street parking is available on weekends, but I imagine one would have to pay for parking if staying over the week. Internet is unreliable, so don't expect to watch Netflix or browse online for a bit. Overall, worth the price but doesn't provide all the comforts of home."
6452246,45181951,2015-08-31,22522429,Damien,"Sarah was a really nice host. She obviously made a great deal of effort to make the place as welcoming as possible (And it is, as well as really central which makes it easy to visit Boston by foot) and prepared us exquisite cookies and sangria. Thank you Sarah!"
6452246,46199470,2015-09-08,21746128,Kate,"Sarah was wonderful host! She was there to meet us we we arrived, gave us a tour, answered all of our questions, and even left us a welcome/things to see-and-do packet! The packet was a huge help, we actually took it with us around town for a reference for where to stop and eat and places to see!  The apartment it self was also great, just as Sarah and the pictures portrayed.  My husband and I were very comfortable in our private room with a bathroom right next to it.  It was also very easy to navigate the city from  the apartment, very close to the T.   Sarah was around and available for questions but gave us our space.  We really had an awesome experience and would definitely stay here again!"
6452246,46766210,2015-09-13,21089545,Greg,"I had a great stay at Sarah's apartment. Not only is the apartment exactly what I was hoping for, Sarah is a wonderful host and a super nice person to boot. I enjoyed our conversations and wished I could have spent more time with her."
Sarah does an awesome job of making sure that the apartment feels like home. I had my own bedroom and bathroom. The bed was comfortable and her entire place is clean and well maintained.,,,,,
It was 93 degrees when I arrived so the AC was much needed. The room (and apt) were very comfortable.,,,,,
I was in town for a conference at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center (BCEC),which was a short 15 minute Uber ride away,so I didn't have time to check out the neighborhood. There are plenty of good restaurants nearby from the looks of it as well as a Whole Foods within walking distance.,,,
I couldn't have asked for a better airbnb experience than what I had at Sarah's place. I highly recommend staying here if you're in Boston.,,,,,

6452246,47420270,2015-09-18,43733066,Carly,"Sarah was sweet and accommodating. The apartment was gorgeous, convenient, and very clean. I would definitely come back again next time that I visit Boston."
6452246,47755283,2015-09-21,622645,Erin,"My partner and I stayed with Sarah for the weekend for a wedding in Boston. Sarah was a great host and shared coffee with us in the mornings. We didn't see her a lot but when we did she was friendly and helpful with great tips of what to see in the city when we had free time. The room is cozy and bright - but with shades to keep out the sun if you want to sleep in. The bed was comfortable and there was a closet and drawers for our clothes.  There was a bathroom just for us which was clean and tidy. The apartment location was just perfect!  A block from the heart of Chinatown and a short, lovely walk from everything we wanted to see. If we go back to Boston we will definitely look at staying with Sarah again."
6452246,48138478,2015-09-23,5534666,Nicole,"This room was so great! Sarah's apartment is spotless and the bed was so comfortable. Sarah made it super easy to check-in and out and she was super flexible with the times. We had everything we needed! Also, the location is a fun, busy neighborhood."
6452246,48549599,2015-09-27,32161487,Joel,"Great place, perfectly presented. We were able to pick up the keys early which helped us fit more sightseeing in in the short time we had. We felt very at home even though we were out most of the time"
6452246,49130270,2015-10-01,26018720,Debbie,We loved staying with Sarah. She made us feel very welcome. She was very helpful. Her place was walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go. Her place is very clean and orderly.  The room was nice and bright.

6452246,49990780,2015-10-08,42390577,Markus,"We could not have wished for a better first AirBnB experience. Sarah was an amazing host. She  made check in and check out really easy for us. She was great to talk to and ready with tons of useful information.  The apartment was spotless, the room cosy and comfortable. The apartments location is just perfect - everything you would want to see in Boston is basically right around the corner and within walking distance. A word of warning though - the bed in the guest room is a serious hazard to all your sightseeing or shopping endeavors - it's way to comfortable and feels like being hugged by clouds. Make sure to steel your resolve or you might just end up spending all day in bed."
Thank you Sarah for an amazing time - we do hope to be back some day soon.,,,,,

6452246,50654998,2015-10-13,43699667,Jeremy,Sarah was a great host and keeps her apartment immaculate.  The proximity to subway and South Station is minutes by foot.  Would stay there again.  Thanks Sarah.
6452246,50874229,2015-10-15,45384384,Danielle,Super clean! Very comfortable mattress and good quality bedding. Sarah is very nice and sensitive to privacy for her guests. There's a lovely little yard which I was too busy to take advantage of. And she made coffee for me in the morning.
6452246,51547922,2015-10-21,19514126,Nomcebo,"\"Very friendly host, well-equipped, clean apt. - all the right (basic) stuff. No frills and the exterior of the building (beyond her control, one would think) does not enchant, but it IS nicely located - a big plus for those of us who like to walk. Again, not her problem in the sense that she has any culpability, but parking appears to be little short of nightmarish. If you can't go carless for a few days - and DO consider it - factor in some hassles & expense in that connection. The reason for mentioning it is that this is VERY close to Chinatown, and that means that if you keep \"\"tourist hours"
Last,"a \"\"plus\"\" - I think we became aware that we would be apt-sharing","not apt-occupying before we made our final booking click. NO PROBLEM in that regard - the layout and host's lifestyle give one privacy comparable to a hotel room.\"",,,
6452246,51811374,2015-10-24,46415784,Jen,"Sarah was great. She welcomed us in and chatted with us for a bit, giving suggestions on places to eat. I am allergic to down and the room was very accodating in that reguard. We were in the city to see a show and it got out late. She was really good about us coming in late and making noise upon arrival. So overall it was great."

The bedroom is comfortable and clean and has both closet and drawers, the bathroom is right by the bedroom and also very well kept and clean. As many guests have said before the bed is very comfortable. Sarah herself is a great hostess making me feel very welcome and right at home. I would love to come back again someday and can highly recommend this room for anyone and any length of stay in Boston!"
6452246,52933336,2015-11-02,35493699,Marlene,"Sarah was a wonderful host! She was flexible with check-in and check-out, so that made our trip feel more relaxed. Very clean, organized, you feel like you're at a hotel but at your home. I recommend staying at her place, especially since she's so close to the center of Boston but that you can grab a city bike that's close!"
6452246,53056072,2015-11-04,44865405,Bianca,Sarah's place is absolutely adorable and clean. She is so nice and was very responsive to any questions and concerns the day of my arrival. I highly recommend staying here! Five stars all around!
6452246,53625676,2015-11-10,42049224,Bob,Visited Boston with my GF as a surprise birthday gift to her.  I used to come here often but it was all new to her.  I wanted to stay somewhere close to downtown so we can walk and see everything the city had to offer.  Our stay was four days.
Sarah's location is in a really sweet spot.  By Boston Common and pretty close to everything.  Had a great time while we were there and the location definitely allowed us to make max use of our days!,,,,,
Sarah's place is impeccably clean and organized.  Made us feel VERY welcome and she was very hospitable and accommodating.  That bed..... ugh,so comfortable...,,,,
This is the 4th time we've used AirBnB and I gotta say,"Sarah wins the \"\"most organized BnB Award\"\".  The printout explaining the \"\"rules of the road\"\" and \"\"where stuff is\"\" was awesome to have.  It answered every question to where we never had any questions!  The other printout that listed all the cool/trendy places to eat and hang out was also nice to have.  Whenever we travel",we like to embed ourselves into the locale.  Even though I know Boston fairly well,her printout was super informative.,,
We had a great time in Boston Sarah!  You got a nice pad.  Thanks for letting us hang out!  We'll definitely come back and would love to use your place again if you'll have us!,,,,,

She gave us a guidebook of recommended restaurants/bars/coffee shops/attractions which was great because we were unfamiliar with the area. We would definitely recommend staying with her if you are in Boston!"
6452246,56134052,2015-12-09,47739105,Alexander,"One of the best Airbnb's I've stayed at. Very clean, quiet and private room and bathroom. Host responded to inquiries quickly and was clearly experienced. Check in and out went smoothly. Central to downtown Boston and near South station for train/bus. There is also a free shuttle from Logan airport that will drop you off 0.5 miles from her place. Would def stay again."
6452246,56275948,2015-12-11,6765046,Mat,"Sarah was very responsive to communication if I had any questions, but most of the time any questions I had could be found on her amazingly detailed guide book and house manual. Upon arrival Sarah was there to greet me and show me around the apartment. It truly felt like she has done this for years because everything was so neat, clean and well organized. The room felt like a hotel and the bed was extremely comfortable. Sarah even laid out printed versions of her manual as well as trendy spots to check out around her neighbourhood and restaurant suggestions. Sarah thought of everything for guest comfort, from providing ear plugs for her guests to managing to let you have access to your own bathroom with all the amenities you could ask for. On top of all that, the location of the apartment is in the heart of Boston at a walking distance from anything you could want, and with her restaurant suggestions, it made for an amazing stay and wished I could have stayed longer just because of my experience here.

It was a challenge getting up every morning due to the extremely comfortable bed. Also, you can't beat the location for the price. The apartment is located in Chinatown, which was perfect since many of the restaurants are open until late. I would recommend staying here to anyone wanting to visit Boston."

Sarah had written extensive notes on what the neighborhood and the Boston area offers, as well as all kinds of info about the apartment, and she even had supplies available if you forgot toiletries. Sarah is very professional and thoughtful."
Downstairs in the apartment,we had plenty of room in a fridge and thus didn't need to eat out all the time. The neighborhood is conveniently close to Whole Foods and within walking distance of much of downtown Boston. Also easy to get to the T from the apartment.,,,,
We didn't get to use the courtyard because it was winter,"but it looks charming. Great value. We would certainly return.\"",,,,

Sarah was a fantastic host and made me feel very welcome during my 4 days at her place.,,,,,
Everything is maintained well,with a great level of care and the shape of the space was both interesting and aesthetically pleasing.,,,,
It was easy to be both sociable and private when desired as there are two separate entrances and two bathrooms between two people.,,,,,
The weather way below freezing and as my stay was for working only,Sarah's place was ideal for staying in from the cold and watching TV etc. However,she was very knowledgeable about the local area and things to do when the weather is better.,,,
Thanks so much for an easy and enjoyable stay Sarah x,,,,,

"This is very much so \"\"living like a local\"\". For those familiar with Allston",it has pretty much been taken over by college students. Good and bad. That brings in a lot of fun things to do in the area. For example,Harvard Avenue is filled with tons of restaurant and bar options. However,the area can be a bit dingy and rowdy on weekends. Occasionally,there will be a loud,wandering drove of drunk college kids on a weeknight. It's just part of what makes Allston so interesting. Housing in the area is
Again,Sa has done what he can to keep the place nice. However,the above are inherent factors in Allston which you cannot avoid.

Travelling from Europe it was so convenient that I didn't have to worry about chargers or adaptors as all this was taken care of. This of course, pales into insignificance with the man himself! Alex is exceptionally kind and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble for him - I had hurt my ankle before flying to the US and he made sure I had pain relief and assisted me at every opportunity to ensure I didn't place too much strain on it. Alex is a consummate professional and knows Boston like the back of his hand. He was also really good fun as we toured the city seeing the sights - I especially enjoyed his culinary tour. We also had an opportunity for a Craft Beer tasting in a Boston brewpub. It turns out this guy has a really great palate for good beer! If I return to Boston I will definitely choose Alex's accommodation without hesitation."
1223050,8009730,2013-10-12,113354,Kamen,"Alex's apartment was beautifully situated in a historic part of Boston, which was only 15 or so minutes walk across a causeway over the Charles River from the North Station and its connections to public transportation and only 10-20 minutes ($10-$20) by cab from Beacon Hill/Back Bay."
"The room itself contained all necessities for my stay and Alex was an unswervingly diligent and good host.\"",,,,,

1223050,8298682,2013-10-24,1143459,Sunshine,Alex was such a friendly and welcoming host. We had fun conversations and shared dessert for breakfast! Because he didnt have another guest arriving he allowed me to leave my suitcase in the house while I tramped around Boston. When I returned that evening he offered me tea before catching my taxi to the airport. I loved his puppy and two cats and the penthouse common area was just fantastic!
Thank you,"Alex. I hope to see you again someday!\"",,,,

He was so welcoming and his presence and spirit were nice to be around in the morning and when I came back after working all day.  I had such a good time staying at his place, meeting his daughter and his neighbor friend came over we had a great conversation."
His place is gorgeous and very well kept.  Also nicely situated right on the freedom trail. Charlestown is beautiful to walk around and have a bite,see historic sites. Also It's a snap to get on the bus to the green and orange lines.,,,,

Alex really made me feel totally at home and part of the family. He showed me Boston and took me out numerous times. We've become good friends..  hell he even gave me an amazing Tarot card reading and relationship counciling #priceless. Alex's pad is chic and in a lovely part of town. Wholefoods and nice coffee is a short walk. Alex has the cutest dog Leo and he's a pleasure to take for a walk too. Usually I rent private apartments through airbnb but this time I decided to get a room and I loved it. Amazing balance of private time if I needed it and company, friendship and local knowledge if I needed that too. Thanks Alex :)"

The bed was really comfortable and the living room/kitchen was exactly as beautiful as on the photos, if not more so. The view of the city at sunset from the living room was spectacular!! Everything was well maintained and very clean and it was important and convenient for me to be able to use the modern kitchen and Alex was extremely accommodating with full use of his well equipped kitchen. Now let's get personal: Alex is an incredible guy! We clicked immediately and he was eager to help in any which way he could. He assisted me with some logistics the night before the race and even got up at 5am and offered to drive me to the shuttle!!! The balance between having my privacy and yet feeling welcome and entertained was flawless. I am allergic to cats, but the house is so clean that this was not a problem at all. I wish I had had time to do more sightseeing as Alex's place is smack in the center of a major historical district conveniently located near busses, T's and even a 5 minute bike ride from downtown. I highly recommend staying with Alex. I will be back!!"
1223050,12219780,2014-04-26,9297525,Glenn,"Alex was welcoming and engaging. The home, a beautiful brownstone located in a very nice neighborhood, is clean, quiet, and comfortable. Also, the views from the"

He was very solicitous and genuinely concerned that I have a positive experience. It is clear that Alex truly enjoys having airbnb visitors. The bed is very comfortable, the entire flat is clean and attractive, and you have access to the upper floor with the great views. I enjoyed getting to know Charlestown a bit: a lovely historic neighborhood that invites walking. Alex is very organized about the airbnb process and responded quickly to questions that came up before my visit. You will be in good hands in a comfortable home with Alex!"

This was my first airbnb experience so I wasn't sure what to expect from my host, but not only was Alex the friendliest and most wonderful host I could ever imagine, he knows every single thing about Boston and took me out countless times to show me around. I will be living in Boston for the summer and after just 5 nights with Alex I feel so acquainted with the area and ready to live on my own. The room is adorable and comfortable; the area is breathtakingly beautiful and historic; the host is one of the best you'll ever encounter in your life. If you're considering booking in Boston, I can promise that if you book with Alex you will have one of the most memorable and wonderful travel experiences of your life! :)"

The hosts were away during my stay and I had emailed at least 5 times prior my arrival with the house rules,then instructions,then updates etc. I was provided with a code for the lock,which ... did not work! So when I arrived I spent over 30 min after dark in pouring rain trying to figure out what was wrong. Eventually I was emailed a new code which apparently had been changed for the guest safety! I definitely did not feel safe waiting frustrated and jet lagged in front of the apartment! The host did not bother to apologize.,,
Another unpleasant thing was the cleanliness. There are two cats in the flat and the hosts' assistant was supposed to clean the cuvettes daily. When I eventually got the right code and I managed to get into the flat the cuvettes were full and there was a cat poo on one of the sofa! The sofa which had clear marks this had happened in the past!,,,,,
Maybe the hosts have got good intentions and all goes smoothly when they are around,but I definitely would not rate my stay as a pleasant experience.,,,,

Parking was a little hampered after dark, but I had no problems finding a spot.  As I approached the building, words left me - historic and beautiful.  Once upstairs, I followed Alex's cheery voice to his spacious sanctuary of art, skylights, city views, cozy cushions and loving animals.  How lucky I felt to be invited into such a wonderful home!

Everything in the building is code-based so you don't have to worry about exchanging a key etc. Note however that there are pretty concrete check-in/check-out times when your code for the apartment is activated and subsequently expires so if you need more flexibility this may not be the best option. Overall we had a great stay at this Airbnb!"

There is a little street noise but nothing that kept me up.  More importantly, you're walking distance to just about everything and the green T line is less than half a mile."
11275963,82745972,2016-06-29,338385,Kristian,Nice and clean apartment with great location.
11275963,85051688,2016-07-10,56239172,Heather,The listing was as described. The neighborhood was fabulous. It was 3 blocks from the Copley T Station; approximately one mile from Fenway; and approximately one mile in the other direction from the Freedom Trail. It was the perfect location to shop and eat and people watch.
1612842,8390467,2013-10-28,2617583,Vincent,"Razan and her husband were really great hosts. We stayed in the place with 4 people and had enough space to sleep, dine, and work for a whole week. There is good internet connection, a central metro line within 10 minutes walking distance and lots of restaurants and supermarkets in the area. would definitely recommend this place to people!"
1612842,13520002,2014-05-29,7728402,Diego,"Razan is so far the best host I've had. She was really helpful on which places to visit that fitted in our itinerary. She even had snacks for us when we arrived! The place is gorgeous (I believe the pictures don't fully show this) and comfortably fitted our party of 6, it is close to the T, and quite comfortable, and it is located in a really quiet and beautiful neighbourhood (Jamaica Pond is only 4 blocks away if you fancy a walk). I can only recommend Razan and sincerely hope to find more hosts like her."
1612842,17045696,2014-08-06,16063930,Gerri,"The apartment was lovely and very well appointed.  It was very clean.  We did not meet Razan, but were let in by two lovely friends of hers.  The neighborhood is very nice and quiet.  The house is within easy walking distance of shopping, dining, and public transportation."
It should be noted that the only air conditioner is on the second floor.  The bedrooms are on the third.  When we arrived,we were presented with an extensive list of rules.  Although most are not out of line,"it may be worthwhile requesting a copy beforehand.\"",,,
1612842,20196075,2014-09-25,20206251,Maxine,"Razan, is a great host. She welcomed us and had some goodies in the kitchen. The bathroom had everything we needed also."
There was fresh cut flowers on the table,which made me feel at home.,,,,
The apt is very private with private entrance to the apt. so you do really feel it's your own place.,,,,,
Her instructions were very helpful and detailed.,,,,,
What I liked the most was it was very quiet,"walking distance to Center Street where you can find great restaurants and stores. The train station to the city is 5 mins walk!\"",,,,

Razan had a few things in the fridge upon our arrival which was a great help,like milk,cheese,and eggs.,,
Jamaica Plains is a great section on Boston.  I was here on a working trip,so I didn't have much time to see the neighborhood,but what I saw was great.,,,

1612842,76120168,2016-05-24,31733304,Dean,"The apartment is lovely and the neighborhood is delightful.  Razan helped us feel at home by having a few essentials (milk, fruit, etc) already in the apartment when we arrived.  We had a great stay and would stay again.  This apartment is great for a small quiet family, though it is inappropriate for a louder group as the host lives in the house below the apartment."
13549924,85115213,2016-07-10,53836201,Lauren,The host canceled this reservation 12 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

9926796,60350810,2016-01-22,47856417,Rita,Ming was truly helpful as this was my first trip to Boston.  The apartment was clean and easy to get to and from any number of public transportation options.  It appeared to be in a really safe neighborhood - mostly students and young professionals walking around at night.  Restaurants were numerous to choose from and it was convenient to have a grocery market (Star) and a city Target nearby.  Would stay with Ming again. :)
9926796,64402849,2016-03-03,42378685,Can,"It is a safe and quiet place to stay for a short trip. Because I've been hanging out most of the time, and the place for me is mainly for sleeping at night. Ming is friendly and helpful. Especially when we were both busy sometime, we have been staying in touch actively so we figured out our schedule together, and it worked pretty well."
9926796,67444312,2016-03-29,43910104,Teresa,"Ming's place was perfect for me.The apartment is near by Target and many restaurants. I visited my son who is a student at BU. It is only 0.6 miles to Boston University. I was able to walk to his dorm or met him halfway. The price of the room is affordable to me and made it possible for me to spent 4 nights at Boston. The set up is only suitable for someone like me just need a bed to sleep in and a place to take a shower. If one expects more than that he/she will be disappointed. Amenities are minimal, but the host was friendly and make me feel welcome."
9926796,68176459,2016-04-02,48867569,Munroe,"Ming was a great host. She was friendly, welcoming, and very accommodating to my busy schedule. The set up was exactly what I expected per the description in the listing. The area was close to several T stops and to restaurants, stores, and supermarkets, as well as quiet and safe."
9926796,70090953,2016-04-16,59793219,Lei,"I have been having several times in airbnb for booking places during traveling.  Most of the hosts were very nice and the room were cozy except this time. I have to say I didn't enjoy the time in this room at all. The room was ok, but there was no bed on the floor only a rough mattress. Moreover, there is a hole on the door which connect my room and host's room it is easy to see every single thing in my room, I feel so uncomfortable with that. Nobody would like to live in a place without privacy. The most important thing for airbnb hosts is that they have to provide good services even though the room might not be perfect. However, Ming did do any cleaning works before I arrive; the sheet and pillow smelled so bad. The only advantage of this apartment is that close to university. I would not recommend this host and room to other visitors."
明的房子地理为主不错,但房间内比较简陋,只有一个床垫在地上,其他提供给租客的也仅有水;,,
明是一个安静的人,合住在一居室,但她的房间有一个小孔看到租户的活动区域,令人觉得缺乏安全感。,,
明的家还算整洁,但床铺上的床单和被子都不是浆洗过的,有一种不好闻的味道。,,,

9926796,71999116,2016-04-30,29950890,Samantha,"It was a good experience ! I recommend this place to stay, as long as you're ok with a mattress on the floor , located in what would be the living room area! Ming is very helpful and responsive."
9926796,77535820,2016-06-01,72928783,Zhengjia,"Firstly, thank Ming to make an exception for a student to rent. To be honest, I had a terrible experience there. Ming is not a bad host but kind of stint. The room is stuffy and rough. Ming sometimes turns off the Wifi in the midnight. Ming turns off the power as soon as I am no in the room, even though I was taking a shower in the bathroom."
4461901,34816559,2015-06-12,4043600,Cyrus,"I never actually met Alicia, but she was responsive and helpful messaging through the AirBNB app.  Once I'd booked the room, she sent me the access codes for the door locks and I let myself in when I arrived.  The room itself is as-advertised - a small studio in a fantastic location.  Price was very reasonable for the area.  Everything worked fine in the unit.  No complaints on my end!"
4461901,68262451,2016-04-03,51942160,Allison,"I did not actually meet Alicia, but she was a great host. There was a tiny maintenance issue when I arrived but she had someone come less than 24 hours after I let her know and it was fixed! She also was able to accommodate my odd arrival and check-out times. The place was exactly as advertised, no surprises. Wifi connection was reliable. I'd definitely recommend this unit."

My friend and I had lots of luggage which they were totally heavy and he carried them to the top floor by himself. He provided us bottles of water and some chicken flavored noodles :) The house was clean and we stayed with a lovely Chinese family. Despite of coldness of outside, we had a heater in our room so we had no problem with cold too and also you can shower with hot water. The house is very close to metro station if you walk there, it will only take 3 minutes and you can go anywhere with this metro. I really appreciated Anthony's effort to make us feel comfortable and wish him the best. Thank you for everything! And for people who is looking for a clean and safe place, I think this could be your one of the top choices :)"

He always answered us about our questions or demands. We felt that we are staying in a safe place. We were comfortable about everything. Also the place is so close to metro and you can reach wherever you want easily. If we have chance to visit Boston again, we would like to stay in the same place :)"

4695542,27507599,2015-03-06,27876277,Arezu,"The house is located fairly close to downtown by taking the red line. Not to mention that it's right next a tram station which makes it easier for snowy days (but far enough away so that you can sleep quietly at night). We really enjoyed the cozy and clean room that he and his kind family have provided for our stay. Anthony is a very nice person. We had no worries about the communications. He always replied really fast to our messeges. He even offered to drive us to the airport on our last day. All in all, it could not have been better."

The bathroom is right next door. The train station is literally a 2-3 minute walk away, and gives you access to everywhere you'd need to go."

Lorsque nous sommes arrivés... Dans la cuisine de la nourriture abandonnée sur la table et les plaques chauffantes s'ajoutant une odeur désagréable (un peu comme s'ils s'étaient endormis en faisant à manger).,,,,,
Une fois dans la chambre... Nous avons été une fois de plus surpris. Une dizaine de cheveux (ne nous appartenant pas) dans notre lit,sur nos draps (ont il été lavé?),sur le sol de la chambre... Enfin partout quoi.,,,
La surprise ne s'est pas arrêtée ici ! La salle de bain... La baignoire,le lavabo,les toilettes mais aussi le sol pleins de cheveux également. Le soir ou nous sommes arrivés,nous nous sommes même posés la question de repartir et d'aller ailleurs mais impossible à la vue des prix des hôtels à proximité. De plus,la chambre reste assez bruyante en ayant le périphérique a proximité et des enfants dans l'appartement qui crient des 7h du matin.,
Cependant,"bonne communication avec le propriétaire qui nous a bien indiqué où se trouvait les clefs et l'appartement malgré notre arrivée tardive. Avoir les identifiants pour le wifi et la climatisation dans la chambre ont été super. Le métro se trouve à proximité donc cela reste agréable aussi. \"",,,,

She was very helpful and even suggested places to go and asked if we needed clarification about anything, so that was great. We spent most of our time outside but came right at home to a good night's sleep that night and had nice showers during the day. The neighborhood is really close to the Red Line, so that's a real bonus. I would definitely recommend this room to others :)"

4695542,46371502,2015-09-10,25847634,Rafael,"We had good times in Anthony's house. The subway is very close, so you can go to everywhere in Boston rapidly, that's the best part. There are not many people walking in the neighbourhood at night, so we prefer not to go back to the house too late. There is a road next there and it makes some noise, but inside the room is quiet, so don't worry about that. The air conditioning system works well. Remember that the bathroom is shared, so be prepared to waste some time waiting for other people using it. We had problems to connect the WiFi in our first night there, but they solved the problem with the password on the next day. In general, it's a simple and clean place to stay in Boston."

I wasn't at the space for long but it was a comfortable room with air conditioning. Anthony's family seemed to be around most of the time. The description was accurate. The neighborhood is great with restaurants and bars around.

Arriving late was no problem, the keys were easy to get, the apartment was cozy and clean, and it is across an overpass from the T (you can see the station from the window, it's a 2 minute walk). Despite being next to a highway, it is extremely quiet inside. Also a quiet neighborhood; we felt very safe.

Good communication from host though I actually didn't meet him in person. No shoes worn in the house so bring house slippers/flip flops and maybe a bath robe."
There are a family living in the space as well as other rooms being rented so there is a lot of traffic. Keep this is mind regarding bathroom usage and high activity level as it was most active morning 7-10am and evenings after 8pm.,,,,,
My room was very clean and towel was provided,but bathroom floor needs a deep cleaning,very sticky.  Not comfortable for me to walk in there with bare feet.  Shower was clean though- no hair or soap scum residue.,,,

Não cheguei a encontrá-lo, mas posso dizer que o local era bastante aconchegante, silencioso e tinha uma boa localização (muito perto do metro). O único problema que encontrei em minha estadia foi relacionado com a limpeza e disponibilidade do banheiro. Muitas vezes ele estava ocupado e, quando disponível, frequentemente estava um pouco sujo e/ou cheio de água espalhada pelo chão.

The apartment did not have heating. There is a small heater in the room that provides some heat if you put it right next to the bed (outside temperature is -1 Celsius). The problem is when I woke up,I had to drag the heater with me to the bathroom so that I don't freeze while brushing. The bathroom light went out. The host sent someone to fixed it overnight,but in the morning,the light worked for literally 5 min and then it went out again. It was difficult to get through the morning routine using cell phone light in the total darkness.,,

He also was incredibly accommodating in allowing Us to drop off our bags several hours ahead of checkin. Never actually did get a chance to meet with him person though.
Regarding the room,the bed was smaller and harder than expected. It might be fine for most everyone else,but I am 6'2 so it was a bit uncomfortable. Couple that with the lack of AC in the room and it spelled for a couple mostly sleepless nights for me. Everything else was as advertised,which was good.,,
My one final concern was the shared and separate bathroom. While I never actually saw the other residents in the house,I could hear them moving around and saw evidence of their passing.

4695542,79695885,2016-06-13,36748196,Elizabeth,"The house is in a good location, right across from the red line and with free parking. The bedroom was clean but not ready for us when we got there. The bathroom could have been cleaner but overall it was okay."
4695542,79860827,2016-06-14,77391715,Ilke,"Anthony was a great communicator - immediately let us know that everything was ready and detailed how to get into the building. The room was clean and decently sized. The bathroom was shared, but at no point did we have to wait a long time or feel very rushed. I would advise that you bring slippers, especially for the bathroom, since you have to take your shoes off before entering the apartment, as well as a (pocket) mirror since there wasn't one in the room. For those driving in, there is street parking. We got a spot right in front of the building but noticed there's readily available spaces on nearby streets as well. Best part is being able to leave your car and commute into Boston within minutes."

4695542,81749615,2016-06-24,54159575,慧明,"The Mr. Antony Zeng' house is very near the metro station Savin Hill, we can see it from station, easy for us in or out of Boston downtown."
4695542,82016632,2016-06-26,74841005,Andi,First time using this app and Anthony was very helpful in explaining the steps. Everything turned out great and I would definitely stay there again if I'm around Boston
4695542,82652183,2016-06-28,5044846,Sonja,We arrived in the morning and was worried about our luggages but Anthony let us drop off our luggages early.
The unit is located on the 3rd floor so we had to carry our luggages up the stairs. This unit is not friendly for elderly people or people with lots of large/heavy luggages.,,,,,
Overall,the room is neat but the ceiling fan was very dusty so we didn't turn it on. The kitchen area is not clean and neat like in the picture advertised. The bathroom is shared with other rooms so we constantly have to take turns. There was one time when the bathroom was used to do the laundry (the laundry machine was moved from the kitchen area to the bathroom) so we could not use the bathroom at all).,,,,
The best thing about this place is the location. The train station is literally across the unit divided by a freeway. So,"you just need to walk across the bridge.\"",,,,
4695542,84371352,2016-07-06,61720128,Huangdi,Great host! Safe and convenient neighbourhood.
4695542,85470496,2016-07-11,72247503,Georg,Two sides of our feedback:
1st the location was great as very close to The red line and also the Price in comparison to all the Hotels in Boston was an absolut plus,,,,,
2nd: what we did not like: the Noise from the closeby Highway was really strong as due to the AC the Windows were basically Open all time. Also as the Others wrote: the Kitchen Looks really nasty,the Bathroom is to Share which is ok,but one Time there was no Toilet Paper available...,,,
"Communication with anthony was perfect!\"",,,,,
4695542,86369059,2016-07-16,68660067,Xufeng,It is really a very convenient place to live in Boston. It is 3 min walking distance from the Metro station. We really enjoyed the stay.
4695542,86907347,2016-07-18,62426089,Celeste,"Very happy with our stay at Anthony's place. His place is very close to the Red line, Savin Hill station, it really helps us to get around town without driving or worrying about the parking. This place is also very clean and comfortable.m Definitely recommend to anybody who wants to travel to Boston."

4695542,87794479,2016-07-21,53105986,Gilbert,Everything as listed. Room was surprisingly quite with being that close to the highway & Red Line Subway. Easy communication with host.
4695542,88079724,2016-07-23,25250383,Nico,Anthonys room is perfect for a visit in Boston. The house is just a 2 min walk away from the train station which takes you directly to downtown (15-20) min. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. we didn't get to meet Anthony by himself but his family who lives there took care of everything. I would totally recommend a stay there!
4695542,88533639,2016-07-24,43497670,Peter,Staying at Anthony's place was overall a good experience.
The location is good,a bit outside the city center but very close to the subway,so it was easy to get to everywhere from there.,,,
Anthony was very easy to communicate with,and always reacted super fast to any question.,,,,
The bedroom was comfortable and clean with enough space and AC,although quite noisy due to heavy traffic on the highway,which is just outside.,,,
The bathroom was clean,the kitchen less so.... Considering the price,"it was ok. \"",,,
4695542,89311719,2016-07-27,64884760,Tom,"Anthony was very fast and helpful in his communication. The house was very close to a subway station, so walking with our suitcases was not a big deal. Only the two flights of stairs were inconvenient. The room and rest of the apartment were clean as you can expect from a listing. Overall a great first AirBnB experience."

It takes 2 minutes from the metro station by walk and we can go anywhere easily. Staying in Anthony's place was really good experience for us :)

4695542,92466823,2016-08-08,57137382,Grégory,"On a pas vu Anthony mais il répond rapidement aux questions par mail... le fait qu'il n'y ait qu'une seule salle de bain est un peu embêtant mais le logement est super bien situé, à deux pas de la ligne de métro. Et bien que l'autoroute soit en face, on dort plutôt bien... peut-être parce qu'on a parcouru Boston de long en large à pied pendant 5 jours ;-)"
4695542,94608485,2016-08-16,62452309,Dea,The room was exactly as seen on the photos. Small but clean. The house is one minute walk from red-line subway and very easy to get to.

Der Erhalt der Schlüssel wurde ebenfalls sehr effizient gelöst und die Kommunikation mit Anthony war problemlos. Leider ist es durch die Nähe zur Autobahn und nicht gut isolierten Fenstern aber auch Nachts so laut, dass es zumindest uns beim Schlafen gestört hat."

9485607,57589328,2015-12-27,51364156,Yoshihiro,"Thank you Chad for giving us the chance to stay at your wonderful house in Boston.  We, my family member, loved staying Chad's house. Since we were the second guest for Chad's house, there are still some more things to be added at the home. They are minor things like a house manual, a garbage instruction and a kettle. But most imprtantly, Chad replied to our questions quickly so that we could manage everything we needed during our stay.  Therefore, we want to come back again to Chad's home if the house would be available or the next stay. Thanks again, Chad!"
9485607,57930453,2015-12-30,5488127,Pat,"Chad's home and neighborhood are typical for Jamaica Plain. The house is convenient - walking or driving - to stores, services, restaurants and public transportation."
The home is very clean and comfortable. Chad responded promptly to our questions and requests and all was as we expected.,,,,,
"We frequently need to stay in JP and will definitely try to stay at Chad's again.\"",,,,,

9485607,60833319,2016-01-28,51008004,Helen,"We had an amazing time at Chad's place! The house is easily one of the best located houses I have stayed in with a Whole Foods, Zip Cars and CVS nearby and also the longest that I have stayed. It felt like a home away from home. We filmed videos in Chad's home and we kept saying it was a happy coincidence that Chad is an award winning documentarian. The kitchen is fantastic and as large as the house is it felt so cozy at the same time. This one stays on our favorites list! Chad is also very communicative we booked his home a month before we stayed and he emailed to check in."
9485607,62283669,2016-02-13,21335456,Julie,"We stayed at Chad's place for 2 weeks. It was very comfortable with everything we needed, and in a great location for our needs. Easy to walk to wonderful restaurants, grocery stores and public transportation. Parking is usually not a problem, but can get a bit hard to find late at night."
The best part of our stay was how responsive Chad was. We had a minor issue and he was in touch with a solution very quickly.,,,,,
"We highly recommend! \"",,,,,
9485607,64358299,2016-03-03,4623030,Jon,Chad's house was wonderfully spacious and comfortable. It was centrally located for a short walk to both the orange line and Centre St. He was responsive and understanding when I made a mistake about checkout the checkout time.

Our first time in Boston, and we found what we wanted, close to metro station, walking distance to Whole Foods and different places to eat. The house was as described, very cozy, lost of light, parking space in front of the house. Quiet neighborhood. I would totally recommended. Thanks Chad"
9485607,68299075,2016-04-04,15734186,Sophie,It was a pleasure to stay in this quiet friendly neighbourhood. The house was clean and spacious. Chad was the perfect host: so easy to communicate with throughout our stay and made us feel really at home. As one of our group was seven-months pregnant (!) Chad suggested that we could ignore the 11am checkout and stay until we needed to go to the airport in the evening. This was such a thoughtful suggestion and really helped us out.
9485607,70487026,2016-04-18,2546068,Nicole,Chad was a fabulous host. Always readily available by phone or e-mail and he made sure to check in frequently.
The house was gorgeous with the perfect amount of old world charm. The heating system can be a bit tricky to figure out but once you did it's fabulous. For an older house it has a lot of well thought out details and is very comfortable. Great furniture and all supplies you may need are available. Very comfortable beds!,,,,,
The location is wonderful and only a 7 minute walk to the orange line train which has you in the downtown core within 15  minutes. Very friendly,young neighborhood with huge amounts of curb appeal. Safe and quite charming. Also very close to the main drag in Jamaica Plain where you have all the little local spots you need.,,,,
"Highly recommend.\"",,,,,
9485607,71519278,2016-04-25,61677207,Cory,Great Time. Chad is quick to respond in either email or text. The house is lovely. It was clean and made me feel like I was staying with family. It is a quick 5 min walk to the stoney brook orange line and a quick 10-15 min ride from stoney brook to downtown crossing. I would definetly stay here again.
9485607,72420994,2016-05-02,52081927,Katherine,"My coworkers and I really enjoyed our stay at Chad's house! The house was exactly as pictured - clean and welcoming, and fully equipped everything we needed. Access to public transportation was easy and the neighborhood is beautiful! We especially enjoyed the Cuban restaurant just a few blocks away from the house."
9485607,74651865,2016-05-16,51095704,Evrim,"Cozy house in a great location. Walking distance from the T and Sam Adams brewery. Chad was a great host, and I would recommend this house to my friends."

9485607,76446976,2016-05-27,51025640,Travis,The location worked well for us.  Everything was clean.  We appreciated the laundry facilities.  We enjoyed the character of the house.  Thank you.
9485607,77563469,2016-06-01,60725487,Vijayakumar,Chad was an amazing host. The house looked exactly how is it in the pictures. The neighborhood was very good and safe. Chad was reachable by text anytime and if you have any issue he would sort it out immediately. I would highly recommend this place.
9485607,78069198,2016-06-05,53734898,Janet,"The house was beautiful, comfortable, and well equipped as a home away from home. The fully equipped kitchen made cooking a joy. Plenty of space and clean. The neighborhood was lovely, no problem with parking, and two grocery stores close by. The train station was a very quick walk through really nice neighborhoods, so coming home late at night was no problem. We came with kids, and always felt safe. Loved the place, would definitely stay there again!"
9485607,82129529,2016-06-26,14699669,Linda,"Our host was very helpful and clear in communication. We felt comfortable and safe inside the cozy home. Clean and at ease. The neighborhood , to us,did not feel safe for we 2 women to be outside or travel around after dark. It was in a struggling economic area of the county. Great ease to subway and we used uber a lot. I would not choose the suburb of Jamaica Plain again."
9485607,87805348,2016-07-21,25353672,Catherine,"Nous sommes venus en famille, un couple et deux ados de 16 et 17 ans, pour 10 jours à Boston. La maison de Chad était exactement celle attendue. Des fleurs nous attendaient à notre arrivée. Les lits étaient faits et tout le matériel nécessaire était là, pour la toilette comme pour la cuisine. Avoir une maison à Boston, dans un quartier qui est multi culturel, c'est sympa. Plusieurs supermarchés à proximité, la gare pas loin.  Nous avons loué une voiture, pour essaimer autour de Boston, et pour la suite de notre voyage aux US. En ville, nous avons préféré marcher ou prendre le train. De fait, se garer à Boston n'est pas aisé ! Devant chez Chad, pas de souci pour garer notre grosse voiture. Il faut juste faire attention aux jours de nettoyage des rues ; ou,  sinon, gare au PV,  voire plus !"
Chad a toujours été réactif et arrangeant.,,,,,
Pour résumé,venez chez Chad en toute confiance. Vivre non seulement dans un logement entier,mais dans une maison,c'est super. Et la maison de Chad est chaleureuse.,,

There were a few problems when we arrived but Chad sorted these swiftly.  The trainline is a 5 minute walk away with a few hills (fine for an active family).  Car parking is very easy.  We would recommend this as a home from home."

12211821,70709969,2016-04-19,13807554,Juan,"Last minute booking for me so I was not too picky. All I wanted was a place to sleep. It's small, but clean and private. Nothing fancy. There are six flights of stairs with no elevator that were not mentioned so be aware of that if you decide to stay here."
12211821,74906423,2016-05-17,31130305,Eva,"Alan and Eddie were great hosts. We met Eddie at the apartment and get information about Restaurants, shopping possibilities and further more for Boston. Alan was very helpful during our stay."
The apartment is very cosy and private with TV and wifi,but you have to climb up 6 flights of stairs. Nothing for people with disabilities. It is small,so for 2 its ok,I think for 3 its too small if you want to stay longer.,,
The apartment is close to the subway green and red line and the park Boston Common. There are a lot of Restaurants,coffee shops and the freedom trail in the neighborhood.,,,,

The only thing that could've been better was the mattress. Other than that, everything was perfect!! Thank you for such a nice stay!!"

12211821,87275349,2016-07-19,47620661,Richard,"Firstly, let me say that I am very aware that the point of airbnb is to save costs in comparison to hotels. With that, you sacrifice subtle experiences that you would otherwise receive at a hotel."
Unfortunately,this experience was not worth the savings. Our check-in was delayed and we were forced to wait in a local bar for 2 hours waiting on our host. The hosts,a property management company,was completely disorganized and had us confused with another guest at a different property on the other side of Boston. The apartment was in a clean condition but the window a/c unit did not fit and the window was half open- half closed for our entire stay. There was no toilet paper upon arrival but some was dropped off later that night. The bed was probably the least comfortable bed that I have ever slept in. Imagine your grandparent's guest bedroom and a 20 year old spring mattress. We had to request Wifi information twice. Just an overall painful experience.,,
If they replaced the mattress,got a fitted window unit and cleaned up their property management skills,this could be a very good rental.,,,
I would not recommend this airbnb option. I have used airbnb a handful of times and this was my worst experience,"by far. \"",,,,
12211821,88777042,2016-07-25,40538477,Veronica,The room was clean.  The hosts attentive.  The second bed as a comfortable cot.  I enjoyed Boston and easy access to this place.  The six flights of stairs aided our determination to exercise on the vacation.
12211821,90802043,2016-08-02,73677039,Zongli,"He is a very nice host. The house is very comfortable. My parents and me  enjoy a wonderful time in his house. What more, the house is described accurately just as what he said."

4040151,21426720,2014-10-17,1735076,Sudhi,"OMG - I cannot even begin to express how amazing our apartment was.  First off - it was huge! With 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a large kitchen and living area, it could have easily accommodated 6 people.  It was wonderfully clean and had all the usual amenities.  Plus we had a full size washer and dryer in our apartment!  How awesome is that??!!  The best part was that it was right in the center of town and so close to everything we wanted to see - Fenway Park, the art museum and Cambridge.  The local train station was about a block away and there were a countless number of excellent restaurants, coffee shops and other eateries within blocks of where we stayed.  Heskel was very responsive to all of our questions.  We had a few questions during our stay there and the team that manages the apartment (Churchill Suites) was so quick to take care of any issues we had.  I would whole-heartedly recommend staying at Heskel's apartment.  Have a lovely trip to Boston!"
4040151,21679242,2014-10-21,7319878,Chris,Amazing place!!! So much better than the pics or description show. One of my favorite AirBnB spots I have stayed. Extremely easy to get in with concierge.  Recommend to everyone.
4040151,23070257,2014-11-22,2595492,Pooja,We loved this place! The apartment is very spacious and cozy. There is one king sized bed and another queen sized bed. The host was extrememly helpful and gave us everything within 24 hours if we requested it. The building has a great gym. We stayed with our 2 kids and were very comfortable. I would highly recommend staying here! The only complaint is that the cell phone service was spotty at times but it worked well near the windows.
4040151,29852378,2015-04-13,752972,Karen,"I was very pleased with the responsiveness of the host both before the rental period started (answering questions etc) and while I was there.  We had a couple issues with the TV and dishwasher but they were very quick to respond and had both problems addressed without delay.  The apartment is not exactly as shown in the pictures but it is close enough to give you a sense of the layout - just the furniture was different but all the amenities were exactly as listed in the description.  The building is a full-service building with concierge etc and it made us feel very welcome even for the short term of our stay.  The gym is large and has a number of cardio machines so there was never any issue with not being able to get on a machine.  Also, the WiFi worked without any problems whatsoever.  The apartment is very close to grocery shopping and lots of restaurants; there is a Starbucks adjacent to the building.  I would definitely stay here again."

Apartment is in a great location with a quick 5 minutes uber/cab ride to all you need to get to in Boston.,,,,,
Apartment has a sucky pullout couch so if you plan on sleep on it and actually function the day after probably not a great idea.,,,,,
Note,"you will check in at the central lobby and then walk miles to the actual apartment so have one person with no luggage take care of it and just have everything else wait for you in the lobby of the actual building you will be staying in.\"",,,,
4040151,38406397,2015-07-15,28918918,Neal (And Lisa),"The condo near Fenway is a nice space in a great location.  Communication and check in was easy.  The internet, cable, wifi, and local phone did not work.  This felt more like a corporate time share than anything with a personal touch."
4040151,39543550,2015-07-24,37428617,AnnMarie,"I stayed here with my husband and three children.  The apartment was clean and spacious.  The wifi worked great in addition to everything else in the apartment.  Any requests or issues were immediately addressed when we called the provided number.  The location was great, just a block from Fenway and we were able to walk to many attractions.  I would highly recommend this rental if traveling with children."
4040151,40758273,2015-08-02,32201655,Michael,"Apartment worked great for our family.  We traveled with 3 kids and having the space worked great.  Plus, the location was terrific.  Everything we wanted to do was either walking distance or short cab ride.  Would definitely book again."

Mike was kind enough to provide us with all the amenities we needed (tissues, toothpaste, extra garbage bags, dish soap and more) and anything else we needed was picked up at the market across the street, or Target, which was just steps away. I also noticed that this apartment is ideal for anyone with mobility issues—it would be well suited for those in wheelchairs."

4040151,76154799,2016-05-25,40199650,Emma,Our stay at Mike's apartment was perfect. Check in was easy. The security staff at the building were kind and helpful all the time. The apartment was exactly as described. It was very comfortable and well equipped. I requested an extra set of keys for the apartment and got it very promptly.
Before arriving I received very precise instructions for check in and for using all the facilities.,,,,,
The apartment is very well located in an area with nice shops and restaurants,and with easy access to public trznsportation.,,,,

4040151,87813750,2016-07-21,70426925,Ramon,I was informed about two weeks before scheduled arrival Unit was not available and was forced to deal with leasing company Churchill and no help from Mike.  Leading company wanted to place Ina different building farther away and I had to insist to place in original building. They did provide two 1 bedroom units that did split family up. Other option we were given was money back and we could find something else. We stayed in 1 bedroom units. I would not recommend in future.  I also was trying to reach Airbnb but could not find a number

8238404,47934225,2015-09-21,44491471,Sean,Jay made me feel very welcome and was kind enough to even leave a bottle of wine.  The place was very nice and clean and when booking he was very helpful and quick to respond to help with any needs.
8238404,48049458,2015-09-22,44031552,Rami,"It was nice to book my stay with Jay. He accommodated my booking preferences really well. Also, the place as described and much better. He always have food for his guests and would invite you each and every time. Sure, my next stop at Boston should be here. Thanks Jay."

The location was convenient to the Orange line and centrally located. Wonderful neighborhood. Quick responses from Jay made the entire stay even more enjoyable.  Will seek Jay out as a host the next time I visit Boston."
8238404,48969902,2015-09-29,21985061,Amanda-Marie,Staying at 285 Roxbury was an absolute treat. I will definitely be returning the next time I'm in Boston for work or play!
As someone who likes to cook her own meals even whilst on the road for work,it was great to have a fully functionally kitchen to be able to do that in.,,,,
Being minutes away from transit was beyond convenient. And so was the fact that parking was readily available.,,,,,
And the hosts made me feel so very at home. Being away from home for extended periods of time for work is always difficult,but their welcoming nature really made the house file like a home.,,,,
Jay,"you're amazing. 5 STARS ALL THE WAY!\"",,,,
8238404,49192359,2015-10-01,20270577,Conor,"Jay is a great and accommodating host. He was very reliable and flexible at check in! He is very open to suggestions and wants to know how to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The listing is a 5 minute walk to the orange line, making it very convenient!"
8238404,52602951,2015-10-31,23198740,Shoitsu,Great host but little bit noisy outside the street during the night. Recommend book second floor rather than first.
8238404,53225983,2015-11-06,45399139,Curtis,"Great experience, host was accomodating, no issues"
8238404,54066978,2015-11-15,4533623,Mari,Jay was great. The place was exactly as presented in the listing. A couple minutes walk from the subway. Jay was friendly and accommodating. The room was clean and comfortable. I would recommend this place to anyone!
8238404,54301702,2015-11-17,49038859,Matt,"Jay was a very good host, very welcoming. There was a slight issue getting into the property, but Jay remedied the issue quickly and was very apologetic. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable."

8238404,63534235,2016-02-23,59988681,Quela,"Donovan's response to my request was very timely and welcoming. Both the room and neighborhood are true to description, and as a second time guest I was very happy with my stay."
8238404,64185816,2016-02-29,40160406,E,I can only say wonderful things about Donovan and Erika. There was a small change needed on my reservation and they quickly responded to my need. Upon arrival my key was ready and the place was squeaky clean. I would ABSOLUTELY stay with them again and
I will be referring my friends and family.,,,,,
"Thank you guys for a peaceful stay!\"",,,,,
8238404,64970991,2016-03-09,2027377,Cherry,Very comfortable experience. The apartment is quite near to Longwood area. Orange T is just around the corner. I would choose it again if next time here around. Thanks..
8238404,65089060,2016-03-10,18013103,Victoria,"My boyfriend stayed here while we were looking at schools and doing some apartment searching and it was perfect. It's maybe a 5 min walk to the T so we could get around the city so easily. The room was nice, we had access to the kitchen and a bathroom, and there was a TV with access to Netflix! I had no issues about the place and I will definitely stay here the next time I visit Boston. Oh and eat at the place next door. Their food is GREAT. Thanks Donovan!"
8238404,65469405,2016-03-13,46024609,Joseph,"Donovan is unquestionably one of the best hosts. He's always available to assist with anything needed. My, stay as always, was comfortable, clean, and enjoyable. He's a great guy and I recommend stay at his place. You'll be getting glad you did!"
8238404,66110045,2016-03-19,34417604,Ginu,"This place is quite cozy, A nice bed, a TV, a nice internet connection. There is pretty much everything you will need. It should take you under 5 minutes to get to public transport. The neighborhood is quite diverse. On St.Patricks day, there was a bit of a noise outside, but apart from that, for the most part it's a nice place to stay. You get some really good food around as well."
8238404,68042020,2016-04-01,58215693,Jeff,"I did not meet the host, but I was exhausted so that was a bonus. The directions about accessing the house were clear and the process was simple. Very nice, large, private room! Very convenient to the T, clean, well appointed, inexpensive, in a multi-guest house (hostel-like, but much nicer than that). I was lucky to get a room at late notice because this place is typically booked. Lively neighborhood with great Somali restaurant next door."
8238404,68226948,2016-04-03,9963921,Lauren,"I didn't meet Donovan personally, but all of his communications and arrangements were well organized. The rooms were very clean. Everything was great. Highly recommend."
8238404,68561935,2016-04-05,64293498,Toan,Neighborhood looks quite sketchy. We didn't feel that safe walking.
8238404,69287968,2016-04-10,64069658,Brett,This was a great location! Two blocks to the T and just minutes to anywhere in Boston. Room was as advertised. The place was clean and and had all the basics. The communication before arriving was excellent! I arrived in Boston early and they even recommended a great place to hang out until the room was ready.
8238404,70120778,2016-04-16,65830623,Rob,Very welcoming and comfortable little place! Hosts were very helpful and accommodating during my week-long stay. No issues whatsoever!
8238404,70389316,2016-04-17,4568225,Ana,"This was overall a great experience! Excellent communication beforehand, easy instructions, and a very clean and neat room in a house. Good location, just 10 minutes away from Fenway/Longwood. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others"

The common living room and kitchen were nicely set up. Plenty of hot water and good water pressure. Great access to the T (subway) and bus, and a great restaurant right next door."

8238404,72425691,2016-05-02,5245120,Jediah,"The best Airbnb I've been to so far in Boston. The moment I walked in I knew and felt the owner really cared about the tidiness, cleanliness and experience of their guest. I was shocked how put together the place was. Easy access with the wifi password thingy, to the hotel style key setup. I loved it. For the price it was amazing. I had fun with the Roku setup both in the room and the living room area. If it was sunny I would have been hanging outside on the padio style setup. I was blown away. The shower head was my favorite. The place looks small from the outside but don't be fooled. It's very accommodating. 5 stars all around. I could say more but I'd here all day. Great communication and availability. Loved it, I'll definitely book again. Good work guys keep it up."
8238404,72948860,2016-05-05,67581701,Stefan,Good room closed to subway.

8238404,73764630,2016-05-10,56353956,Yegor,Unbeatable value for $30. Highly recommend .
8238404,74089026,2016-05-13,2315991,Loren,"The place is truly close to the T (train) and generally pretty affordable. It's also on the well-lit street, so I'd say generally felt safe walking there at night. As the description says the neighborhood is very up-and-coming, but if you don't know Boston, probably not the best place to wander around. The bed is large and comfortable, the desk is adequate, but not ideal for a 6-hour study session (go to BPL of that). I only interacted with the host via text, but they were definitely responsive. All in all, a good and economical experience."
8238404,74197986,2016-05-14,59165321,Emily,"Great experience.  The rooms were neat, the house is beautiful.  Everyone we came across was very nice. Extremely affordable. Thanks"
8238404,75025324,2016-05-18,63755138,Maria,"Great experience! We needed a place to stay for one night pretty close to the center, and this place was perfect ! 5 minutes from T train, we arrived late at night ad everything was set up! Very comfortable bedroom and nice and very clean place! Highly recommend!"
8238404,75425931,2016-05-21,69331284,Charlie,"My experience in room A1 was great, the linen was clean, room was immaculate, and I loved the small office desk. I often used that desk, for my computer and work material I brought back here with me from my job. Being on the groundfloor is alwaya best for me. The guests were interacting, the subway station is less than a minute away. There are just so many surrounding amenities to this location."
8238404,75664722,2016-05-22,5840644,Peter,"The hosts never appeared.  This is not someone's home.  It is a kind of rooming house, with several rooms to let plus a living room, kitchen and two bathrooms.  I would have had some difficulty getting in and finding my way around if it had not been for a long-term resident who happened to be in at the time and was very helpful."
The room was not particularly clean.  It was on the ground floor so there was street noise,but not enough to bother me for the one night I stayed.  There was no remote for the TV so I could not use that.  I accessed the Wi-Fi (the password was posted on the hall wall) but when it connected,I got a warning message from McAfee telling me not to go there,so I gave up on Internet connection.  It was a cold night and there was no heating in the room.  A couple of the electrical outlets didn't work.,,
The kitchen was well equipped,the two bathrooms were OK.  The neighborhood is not great but seemed safe enough and the people I spoke to were friendly.  There is nothing to do or see anywhere near but the Roxbury Crossing station is just a couple of blocks away,so getting around is easy,just don't expect much nearby.,,
The rate for this room is low compared to Boston in general,which is an expensive place.  So if you are on a strict budget,"you might consider this place.  But you get what you pay for - the \"\"A1\"\" refers to the room number",not the experience.,,

8238404,77595808,2016-06-02,69129984,Ivan,Overall the stay was okay. In a good location for the price. Uber and Lyft weren't as expensive as other cities. The room was decent size and clean. There was a tv but it didn't have an antenna connected so I couldn't watch NBA final games. only Roku streaming was available. The restroom was clean and maintained daily. My gf and I weren't in the room much as we were being tourist. I however forgot my work phone and didn't know until I was at the airport. I contacted the host and he said that the lady that cleans found it and he would ship it to me the next morning as I told him I couldn't pick it up anymore. He hasn't sent it to me and I have tried to contact him multiple times. Overall the person staying at the house seems nice and didn't bother us at all.

I just got in on a sleepless red-eye flight in the AM from Seattle and,with the previous person having checked out several hours earlier,Donovan was able to help me get all settled earlier than my check-in time. It was nice to be able to take a nap pretty quickly and get adjusted.,,,

They only negative thing was the squeaky front door if you are in A1 room and traffic outside. But I would definitely stay there again.  I did not get a chance to see upper level. The host was very accessible and very friendly! Thank you for great stay!"

This room was clean and spacious. The bed was very comfortable. It can get loud outside because there is a restaurant right next door. Perhaps it is more quiet on a week day. Nevertheless, we slept well and it was overall a pleasant experience. This place is conveniently located within walking distance from the T."

Este quarto é no térreo,o que facilita com relação a carregar mala e o banheiro é praticamente privativo. A cozinha também fica ali.,,,,

The location of the unit is really good at a great value, it's close to everything but at the same time a relatively quiet place where I was able to sleep easily without the loud city noises. I would definitely stay again!"
11169560,66092281,2016-03-19,58939616,Sheng,The room is really good! Compact and very good location! We enjoy our staying here.

11169560,70635224,2016-04-19,22621322,Ryan,Great location! Host was always available and helpful. Recommend!
11169560,71436172,2016-04-25,61450597,Dennis,"The place was as described. One bed and a couch that pulls out to the size of another bed. Perfect place for 2 people. It has the student life feel to it. In the heart of the booming Chinatown. Surrounded by lots of good places to eat. Jacinto was an absolutely amazing host as well. Although he was not actually there, he was a phone call away. One of the nicest guys I met there. Very accommodating and laid back. Would definitely give more than 5 stars if I could."
11169560,76905157,2016-05-29,57944776,Liz,"Jacinto y su novia Amy fueron excelentes anfitriones. Estuvieron disponibles durante mi estadía y respondieron con prontitud mis mensajes. El studio es exactamente como se presenta en las fotos, muy práctico y con excelente ubicación. Puedes encontrar farmacias, supermercados, bancos, estaciones de tren y muchos restaurantes a solo pasos. Recomiendo sin duda este studio y  agradezco muchísimo la hospitalidad de los anfitriones."
11169560,79378091,2016-06-12,9144266,Kunal,"Jacinto's friend had come to pick us up and was on time...She had explained to us how to travel by subway, metros and bus and also things to see, good restaurants nearby etc...  The apt was located in the heart of the town and was easy to commute to all places by subway, and buses...and even it was close to the bus terminus too... we had come for conference but had good time.... only thing i did not like the furniture which was old one and bathroom door was not easy to open...but had good amenities in the kitchen... I will highly recommend .."
11169560,81206506,2016-06-21,13104415,Olivier,"Excellent sejour, dans l'appartement de Jacinto; l'accueil a été super sympa et amical; tout à été simple que ce soir pour l'arrivée ou le départ (merci à Amy pour ode départ!) l'appartement est vraiment bien situé et conforme à la description: au 10 e etage. j'avais choisi Chinatown, pour cela, et vraiment c 'est génial, j'ai pu tester de nombreux restaurants asiatiques, pâtisseries asiatiques, et pas loin , le boston common (parc) mais aussi de nombreux magasins, à deux pas (MACYS); il y a aussi de nombreux bars à vins."
Si je retourne a Boston,j'iris volontiers chez Jacinto!,,,,

11169560,81498154,2016-06-23,8844801,Raul Arturo,The host canceled this reservation 41 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
11169560,85856950,2016-07-13,17374020,Andrew,"Great location (especially if you like Chinese food--recommend Gourmet Dumpling House,) close to South Station, Boston Common, and a 15 minute walk to some nice bars in the South End. Host was quick to respond and friendly--thanks for everything!"
11169560,87527313,2016-07-20,74394210,Ashleigh,"Initially there was an issue trying to get into the apartment that was worsened by the character of the neighbourhood at night time. I would not recommend being in the area after dark. However, after the issue was eventually resolved I enjoyed my stay. Jacinto's apartment is very well situated, and is in walking distance to most attractions I visited during my stay. The apartment was small and in an older building, but was all I needed during my time in the city. I would recommend it to anyone who plans to be out most of the day and wants to enjoy convenience."
11169560,88919540,2016-07-26,34349069,Ruth,It was in a great location close to Boston Common and amazing restaurants in Chinatown. The apartment had loads of room for 2 people and the pull out couch was very comfortable.
8275122,48774137,2015-09-28,25076918,Dorine,We had a very pleasant stay in this beautiful apartment in a very nice area. Juliet is a great host. I highly recommend without any hesitation ! Thanks again for your hospitality
8275122,49358647,2015-10-03,42046775,Anna,"This room is very conveniently located to the T and in a very nice neighborhood. Juliet is a great host and helped us with everything, even bought us umbrellas when the weather decided to not play along."
The room has a private bathroom,just not en suite. We could use the fridge /kitchen and living room as well,which was really nice... We felt right at home. Our schedules worked out pretty good,"since we went to bed early and she had to be at work early. Next time we are in Boston we would love to stay here again.\"",,
8275122,49711055,2015-10-05,10732602,Ian,Juliet was an excellent host! As soon as we arrived she offered us hot tea and homemade quiche. She helped us plan out our stay in Boston and pointed out fun spots to explore in the city. Her apartment was beautiful and my fiancé and I felt very much at home. After a night out walking around the city it was great to return to Juliet's place and get into the hot tub! Highly recommended.
8275122,49857477,2015-10-06,8081673,Mary,Great location easy walking to eateries and a fun part of JP. Bikes galore in this area with a bike lane! Clean - so clean- and comfortable room and bathroom. I have found my 'go to' spot in JP.
8275122,51326028,2015-10-19,6222445,Laetitia & Sebastien,"We had a wonderful time at Juliet's home. She is a wonderful host, very respectful of our privavy, and very helpful to give many advices to us to enjoy our stay in Boston. The house is very clean, quiet and well-organised as we had our own bathroom close to our bedroom. We also used a kitchen to prepare our breakfasts and one dinner once. Her house is well-located from the commercial street of Jamaica Plain where there is an organic supermarket, and from the train station where you can reach downtown in 15 minutes. For sure, if we come back in Boston one day, we'll be back at Juliet's home!!"
6444138,38168208,2015-07-13,5266355,Andre,"PERFECT!! As advertised, very clean and well kept. Great apartment and location, across the street from a Hubway station and close to the T. They accommodated my special requests and e had a great stay."

8454985,48353744,2015-09-25,17777299,Meghan,"Jianmin's place was quiet and clean which was great for our use. Although the very immediate area is not very lively, it's easy to hop in an uber and get anywhere. We also walked to a couple great pubs, less than half a mile and a very easy walk."
8454985,48625222,2015-09-27,1233939,Philip,Excellent host and great place to stay.  Stylish and modern flat.  The hosts went out of their way to meet me and make sure I was comfortable and ready to see Boston.  The apartment is a 10-12 minute walk from the downtown area.  Very quiet area.  Highly recommend staying here.
8454985,51255403,2015-10-18,21623482,汉lo Ng,Wonderful experience in Boston . Very historic and nice place . Jianming helped me a lot .

8454985,89369197,2016-07-28,6964757,Kristin,"Very convenient location for Spaulding visit.  Nicely renovated building.  Unit is comfortable and spacious.  Owner was very accommodating and responsive.  We had a couple cleaning glitches attributable to quick turnover from prior rental, but Owner readily addressed the issue to my satisfaction.  Would rent again."
8454985,92052483,2016-08-07,28657062,Mary,Cute place! Pictures don't do it justice! We checked in at 1 am and Jianmin was very responsive late at night. The place was clean and the main bed was comfortable. Jianmin was able to get us a parking spot in the garage too. Would definitely stay here again!
3052935,18234327,2014-08-24,15480103,Andrew,Great place to live whether just visiting Boston or staying for a few months like I did. The apartment is within a couple minutes walk of the T (subway) that can take you everywhere you would want to go within a few minutes. Nathan is a nice guy who listens to his tenants and quickly addresses their needs. I had zero complaints the entire time I was there and had a great time!
3052935,18461053,2014-08-26,8806917,Gianluca,"Nathan and his wife were really kind and collaborative hosts. The room was absolutely clean and comfortable, located in a suburban area, but five minutes walk  to red line station, that takes you to downtown Boston in 10 minutes. Thanks to Nathan, our stay was really pleasant!"
3052935,22458748,2014-11-07,20038607,Gang,"It' a wonderful experience at Nathan's place.The room is clean and big.The place is near to the subway red line.Nathan is warmhearted and helpful.中国老乡,推荐!"
3052935,22596116,2014-11-10,19423432,Genki,"Located in quiet residential area, and so close from the JKF/UMASS red line station, it is easy to access to both downtown and airport, and also comfortable to stay in. Although the size of room is not big enough for more than 2 person, it is ok concerning to the size and the room is tidy."
Among many rooms or apartments in boston which is relatively expensive,"this one is good in terms of prices. the only problem was there was not any wifi in the apartment.\"",,,,
3052935,25331544,2015-01-12,25367179,Aaron,"This was my first experience with airbnb and I must say it was a great one. Nathan was a wonderful host, he met me at the apartment on the first day to let me in and show me around, in addition to always being quick to respond and very accommodating. The apartment is very cozy, clean, and just as described. I always felt safe in the neighborhood and I don’t think I can fully express how convenient the location was (2-3 min walk to JFK/UMASS red line train station and UMassB bus line #1) which made getting around Boston a breeze. Although admittedly a novelty factor for me, one of the neatest parts of my experience was showing up in an unfamiliar place and getting to live in a neighborhood and act like a local for a week. Overall, I had a wonderful time and pleasant stay in Boston and would definitely stay here again. Thanks Nathan!"
3052935,36813162,2015-07-01,11735580,Frederick,Places was exactly as it is described. Room was comfortable and easy access to get to downtown via the Red Line. I would recommend this place to someone looking for a place to stay.
3052935,38352789,2015-07-14,35696318,Sole,"Nathan fue muy amable al responder los mensajes y al recibirnos. El barrio es residencial y tranquilo, a sólo dos cuadras de la estación  JKF/UMASS, lo que permite llegar al centro de Boston en pocos minutos."
La habitación era amplia y confortable,pero no estaba correctamente limpia. Las sábanas tenían olor a humedad y había suciedad en el piso. Lo mismo ocurría con el baño.,,,,
............................................................................................................,,,,,
Nathan was so kind answering our messages and welcoming us. He is a nice host. The neighborhood is residential and quiet,just two blocks from the JFK / UMASS station,allowing to reach downtown Boston in a few minutes.,,,
The room was spacious and comfortable,"but was not properly clean. The sheets had musty smell and there was dirt on the floor and in the bathroom. \"",,,,
3052935,40909898,2015-08-03,2478667,Myra,"Felt welcomed by Nathan. Apartment is in a clean, working class neighborhood. Some cleanliness issues in the bathroom, frig, and under bed upon arrival, all fixed within a day. Smoke alarms installed 4 days after arrival. Colorful roommates. Nice back porch. Easy commute to UMass-Boston up and over staircase or JFK/UMass T station. 10-15  minutes door to destination downtown or UMass. More dorm-room like atmosphere than traditional Air BnB."
3052935,41530721,2015-08-07,1639865,Karen,"Nathan was a very accommodating and considerate host, and the room was clean and quiet. The common areas were treated with respect by the other guests, too."
3052935,41834799,2015-08-09,30795027,Gloria,"The woman who is the permanent resident/renter was there to welcome us. She was friendly and showed us around. This is a very plain apt. - no frills - and the neighborhood is somewhat seedy, but not dangerous. Many homes have peeling paint, trash in back yards, things in disrepair, weeds growing in sidewalk."
3052935,42787567,2015-08-15,36940147,Michael,"I meet Nathan when I first arrived at his place, he was friendly and welcoming. The room was clean and as described, with the bonus of a very comfortable bed!"
3052935,43428246,2015-08-19,16869971,Han,"I was very warmly welcomed by Nathan and I think he is great. He was very nice introducing the environment around to me, including transportation, good restaurants and supermarket. After I checked out he also nicely allowed me to keep my luggage in the room, and asked what he could help more. The location of the house is indeed good to the price, as the subway station (~15 min to downtown door to door) and the supermarkets are close, and everything is there if you want to cook in the house, plus the neighborhood is quiet and people look friendly. The room condition matched well with the description, and was clean and comfortable for me to stay. I recommend the place, and I think I will stay there again if I were touring in boston in the future."
3052935,93197479,2016-08-11,49042331,Adel,Nathan is a nice guy. The place was OK. It would be nice if Nathan mentioned that laundry is not free and it costs $2 per load.
5146451,30398756,2015-04-21,5282109,Johan,"Great value for money. The room is clean, large, and the property is only a short bus ride away from the city center."
5146451,31154723,2015-05-02,5539991,Moiuz,Sarah was a great host. Room and other available amenities where found as listed in her description. Space (shared and not shared) was clean and welcoming. Sarah was a pleasant host to work with and she made my short stay enjoyable. I would highly recommend staying in her listings. Thank you!

5146451,31849547,2015-05-10,24809301,Angeles,Sarah's house is nice an the room is big .
I oly saw Sarah for about 2 minutes,but she seemed very nice and told me where by phone where to get more blankets. The house is well situated,"there is a bus near by than runs frequently and takes you to downtwn and South Station\"",,,
5146451,35794806,2015-06-22,31852463,Alberto,"I stayed in this room for 1 month. The place is as it is described in the web. It is big, clean and you have all the facilities. There are superparkets and laundy nearby in the neighborhood. My workplace was in a walking distance from the apartment but if you want to go to the downtown you will need to take the bus. However, there is a bus station (Dudley) very close, so you have easy access to other parts of the city. Sarah is an excellent guest. She answers all your questions almost immediately. I arrived to the house quite late in the evening and I was given all the necessary instructions to get inside."
5146451,37125300,2015-07-04,1226736,Chris,"Great place! A hidden gem among the thousands of Airbnb listings in Boston. I would come back anytime, extremely convenient, clean and a responsive host."
5146451,37995112,2015-07-12,35067434,Ryan,"Sarah is a wonderful host and such a wonderful person!  She was very accommodating and kind.  The room was clean and private, spartan, yet functional.  There is no AC, but even though it was in the 90s while I was there, I was not uncomfortable and the place stayed cool.  The neighborhood struck me as being on the rough side, but I had no problems while I was there.  There is a substantial police presence, and it is well-lit at night."
5146451,39840240,2015-07-26,38198826,Francois,"Bien situé par rapport à la station Dudley. Quartier un peu intimidant. La chambre ne possède pas d'air climatisée même si l'annonce en fait mention (uniquement dans le salon mais on ne couche pas dans le salon!!!) Aucune circulation d'air. Les fenêtres ne sont pas vraiment accessible même si elle nous a offert de les ouvrir le lendemain. l'annonce stipule pour 2 voyageurs mais elle charge un extra pour le 2e...30$ par jour. Lit confortable. Salle de bain correct. 3 chambres sur airbnb dans cet endroit donc la propriétaire n'y habite pas. Cependant, elle semble disponible. Facile d'accès avec les clés dans un cadenas à l'extérieur. Je ne recommande pas à moins de vouloir sauver des sous à tous prix!"
5146451,39943632,2015-07-27,25504384,Katy,"Sarah was very sweet, even though we only saw her for a second. The place is a short walk to the buses to go down town, and the rooms are very large and private. Great for the price!"
5146451,40189622,2015-07-28,39628486,Paul,This place was great. It felt like a hotel almost. The temperature was cool enough to sleep comfortably without fan. Sarah was very welcoming.
5146451,40398328,2015-07-30,38689082,Miles,"Had a fantastic stay. The room was as described, perfectly clean and very comfortable. The bathroom was also extremely clean. Location was perfect with an Uber in to the city costing an average of $10. Our stay could not have been any better."
5146451,42556942,2015-08-14,31355733,Stella,"Amazing host! Sarah is very friendly and extremely responsive. The room was nice, clean, and as advertised. Thank you!"
5146451,43244979,2015-08-18,34767186,Arthur,I stayed at Sarah's for four nights with my girlfriend travelling as young students. We enjoyed the stay very much and Sarah and her son were lovely. Normally as guest you do not get to see her very often but now she was staying there as well due to her moving. This way we got to know her better and she was very friendly and welcoming (even driving us to the supermarket the first day!)
At the same time we did have our privacy as well,which was good.,,,,
The neighbourhood was a bit far from the center,but the bus connection went smooth. The room was clean and had space enough to put our luggage. The bathroom was also clean and good to use.,,,,
We certainly enjoyed our stay to get to know Boston from there,"thank you Sarah! \"",,,,
5146451,43851522,2015-08-22,41218954,Andy,"This is my first time using airbnb and I honestly had no idea what to expect. All I wanted was a place to stay for a night, nothing more."
To be honest,I wasn't very thrilled when I got there,especially because the neighborhood is a bit on the ghetto side. However,Sarah's place is cozy,homey and VERY secure. WiFi is included and she even graciously gave me a towel for bathing. I even notified her that I wouldn't be departing until 2:30 pm the next day and she graciously let me stay longer - all I needed to do was to communicate that clearly.,
For what the neighborhood and community lacks,Sarah makes up by being an outstandingly kind and accommodating host. There were some miscommunication between us,but she resolved it as soon as possible.,,,
I don't know what everyone else looks for in an airbnb experience. Maybe its to meet locals to get a better perspective on the city. However for me,I knew exactly what I wanted to do in the short time that I had and accommodation to do so is priceless.,,,,
For that I thank Sarah,"despite me being a somewhat mediocre resident for not being around at all and asking for so much. My apologies!!\"",,,,
5146451,44262295,2015-08-24,40751877,Austin,"Sarah was very welcoming and responsive, and answered all my questions quickly. She put in the extra effort to accommodate my stay and solve a few issues that came up. The room was very nice and clean, had a comfortable bed and was decently sized - exactly as described. The neighborhood had abundant parking and everyone I met was friendly and polite."
5146451,46088311,2015-09-07,42930853,Michelle,"Didn't get to meet Sarah, but she was very kind and answered messages promptly. Check-in was easy, room was nice. Public transportation was close but I opted to use Uber instead, it was under $10 to the South area of Boston. I would definitely recommend Sarah's place!"
5146451,46589266,2015-09-12,6156757,Chris,"The neighborhood isn't the greatest in the Boston area, but inside the home itself is very nice. Very spacious rooms, and the basement location meant that it was nice and cool even in early September."
5146451,47494565,2015-09-19,35097234,宗一郎,She is so kind.  And the room is so comfortable. That made my trip so gooood.
5146451,48201439,2015-09-24,42609222,Bryan,"This place was as described, clean and simple, a fine place to stay. It meet my needs very well. Some other reviews mentioned issues with the keys, I'm not sure if things changed or not, but I only used the lockbox keys to access the apartment the first time, then had my own keys with my room key I got once inside. Sarah let me drop my bags off in the morning which was great, even though the room was not available for a while."
5146451,48418390,2015-09-26,42351879,Jacqueline,"Sarah was very easy to stay with. The room was quite large and the bed was comfortable. Although the neighborhood is not thought to be safe, I did not feel threatened."
"It was clean and neat.\"",,,,,
5146451,49791698,2015-10-06,42210905,Melody,"Sara was welcoming and friendly. Easy to contact with questions and requests for information before and during trip. The apartment we had was downstairs. It is in easy access to bus station. We used Uber for evening transport and did not spend much time at the apt. Simple, no frills."
5146451,50454652,2015-10-12,35281733,Clarence,"While I did not meet Sarah in person, she was easily contactable through messages and was more then willing to answer any queries I had. I was very pleased with the place as it had what I needed and its location to Dudley station was welcome when trying to get around Boston."
"Room was very large as well so that was a plus. \"",,,,,
5146451,50895715,2015-10-15,13760962,Shahrouz,"It's one of the best places you can live in Boston.  Sarah is helpful,  generous.  Her    place is clean and I believe you will like that."

5146451,54255648,2015-11-17,23637087,James,"For the price, it was a very nice place to stay.   I never actually met Sarah, but her communication through the AirBNB messenger was good, so I knew she was available if needed.  The apartment itself is very pretty, simple, but well decorated.  There are 3 rooms which are all rented out (the other 2 were vacant while I was there, so I had the place to myself).  The living room had a TV with local channels.  The kitchen was really nice.  My room was in the basement on the street side - it could be a little loud at times, but I'm a deep sleeper, so it wasn't a huge problem.  The bathroom wasn't amazingly clean and there were a couple things that needed repair or replacement (a light bulb in the shower light fixture, the handle of the faucet in the kitchen sink), but these were minor and not a big deal.  Biggest downside to the place is that it's probably not in the best part of Boston, so I walked during the day and took Uber back to the place at night, no big deal."
5146451,55002033,2015-11-27,38485838,Sandeep,The place is very clean and spacious. You'll feel at home once you settle in.
However,the neighbour hood isn't the best in Boston. Finding a good restaurant you can walk to will be difficult,but a short uber ride will get you to the best places.,,,
In short,"a clean and spacious living space 15 min (drive) away from all the best places in Boston :)\"",,,,

5146451,94498559,2016-08-15,61849527,Lia,"I actually lived in another place in the same street which is Sarah's sister's home, a beautiful house with green grassland and clean room. Sarah and her family are very nice! I went to the wrong apartment and was anxious due to I happened to have neglected Sarah's message, she and her sister communicated really quick and her sister even came out to picked me up. The place is cozy and tidy, besides there's no air conditioning in the room and it was hot at the first half night, then the opened window helps. Another thing just to mention, do check the surrounding before make the booking, I personally found not comfortable to walk along the nearby streets or wait at the bus terminal, thus I had some extra spent on uber (car pool price is fine)."

13363171,84029248,2016-07-05,18338334,Krista,"Alexis was so welcoming and accommodating. Her place was great for a duo and we loved the vibe with her decor and art - the pictures don't really do it justice. My boyfriend and I stayed for a wedding in Jamaica Plain, so many of our friends were staying in the neighborhood and the location was perfect. The orange line that takes you all the way to the city center was also right around the corner. Check in/out process was easy breezy."
11397952,66211637,2016-03-20,58912741,Meliza,Jeffrey & his wife were fantastic!  I came in late and they were warm and welcoming as they (and their adorable labradoodle and kitties) showed me around their lovely flat in beautiful Jamaica Plain.  They were both very happy and excited to offer ideas for where to go for food or for adventures around Boston.  Their place is easily accessible by bus and train and I had little trouble finding it.
The bedroom is exactly as pictured (and clean,too!),with plenty of natural light coming from the two windows looking over their backyard.  I love my mornings with lots of light to get me started,so this was a perfect set up for me!  The bed was quite comfy and I was happy to have their friendly kitties come to hang out with me while winding down.  That said,the room is all yours if you want your privacy from the pets.,

The bed was so comfortable and everything I needed was happily provided. Emily even gave me some home made pumpkin bread. Jamaica Plains is an amazing city-I enjoyed it so much more than the time I spent actually in Boston, and I never would have found it if j had not stayed here, so I'm very happy I did. Very calm, lots of trees and nature, very artsy. Please do yourself a favor and check out Boomerang thrift store while you're there."
11397952,68438988,2016-04-05,10721766,Jennie,"Had a lovely stay here -- room is so inviting and comfortable, and the location cannot be beat! In the heart of JP and a quick ride by T or bus into Boston. I didn't interact much with Jeffrey but Emily was incredibly generous in her hospitality. They do have three pets, who are all quite friendly. Me being an animal person, they made the space even more homey. I was out and about for much of my stay but it was a perfect home base."
11397952,70236030,2016-04-17,6778885,Leah,Our communications prior to the stay were excellent.  The descriptions were accurate. The neighborhood is lovely and inviting.

My bedroom was very comfortable with a nice double bed and I slept like a log! I appreciated their tips about nearby pubs and restaurants which were all within easy walking distance. Parking was easy.

I am a local and it still felt like a treat staying here. Not to mention Jeffrey and Emily are so welcoming and sweet. The room is beautiful, everything is so nicely decorated and comfortable. Panda is the sweetest cat you will ever meet and Pip warms up to you after awhile :) Thanks again to the both of you for a great weekend."

Jeff and Emily made check in and check out very easy, and were easily accessible hosts throughout the entire stay. The location makes downtown Boston very accessible through the nearby bus and subway stations. Jamaica Plain is also a great area, with numerous bars and restaurants if you want to stay close. I highly recommend staying here!"
11397952,84911755,2016-07-09,22399439,Leslie,"This was a lovely house on a quiet tree-lined street. The area was wonderful and as described in the listing, full of nice restaurants, coffee shops and my favorite, Boomerang Thrift Store. The room was spacious and the bed was super comfy. The animals were adorable and affectionate. Jeffrey and Emily were very helpful in describing local eateries and attractions. This worked well as a home base for me to visit family in the Boston area."
11397952,88383314,2016-07-24,17457378,Franziska,I would definitely recommend staying at this place.
It is very conveniently located if you have to go to the Longwood Area (bus stop very close,direct connection). Everything was as described and Jeffrey and Emily very welcoming hosts. The pets were great,too. They also gave some helpful recommendations about cafés,bars and restaurants nearby. I found it especially nice to be able to walk around the Jamaica pond just at the end of the street after a long day - very relaxing.,,
Communication was excellent also prior to my stay with quick and very helpful replies by Jeff.,,,,,

Our hosts provided us with recommendations for things to visit, places to eat, etc. They were very helpful and easy to communicate with. Be prepared to be welcomed by Gatsby (wow), Panda and Pippin. It was a great experience sharing our room with Panda, the cutest and most friendly cat ever (it's also no problem if you don't like to have pets in your room, Jeff and Emily will take care of them).

I walked from Fenway Park to their house during daylight hours and felt for the first time, since I landed in Boston two days prior, a bit nervous about walking at night. My cousin who used to live fairly close to the neighborhood (in Jamaica Plain) advised me to take an uber car back that night because he was aware of the area. The guys were very social and easy going. They were easy to contact via text messaging when I had questions as to how to use or find things I needed.

Just 3 minutes walk from the T orange line which takes you to downtown. However, if you are sensitive to cleanliness, I do not recommend here. I've been to several air bnb houses in the US and this place was the dirtiest place. There were dirt and stain everywhere you go. Kitchen, bathroom, and the living room floors everywhere. Also there were spiders and flies sleeping with me. The worst part was the towel they offered me, which had awful stink. They'd better not offer the towel if they aren't available of washing them.

Connor was friendly and welcoming (Ronnie was away), and it was a fine place to stay overnight. It was a five-minute walk from the T station, and a 10-minute walk from a Stop n Shop and some restaurants. I was very glad for the reasonably priced place to stay. I had the living room space to myself in the evening, and the Wifi was strong. The apartment was not very clean, and the sheets on the sofa bed were somewhat damp. The air conditioner was noisy and the outdoor lighting shone in through the windows, so if you are sensitive to light and noise when sleeping this is probably not the best arrangement.

6066455,36797015,2015-07-01,21941187,Nicole,Our stay in Beacon Hill was just fantastic. The location is perfect -- right on Charles St between the T stop and the public garden. And the apartment is beautiful -- with the bonus of super comfortable beds/bedding and an entertaining foosball table. Just perfect. Thank you to the Post family!
6066455,38112863,2015-07-13,31555397,Ellen,"Amazing location & home, roomy and comfortable for our family of five. This neighborhood was a highlight of our trip, convenient to many  attractions and sites. Jason was helpful and responsive both prior and during our stay, and stopped by day one to drop off a wii for our children. We appreciated the foosball table and all the other amenities that made our stay all the better. Would definitely return to this property and recommend it to friends traveling to Boston."

Functional, comfortable, well decorated, and well-lit (high hats & natural sun).  Best location - close proximity to F&B, sites, roadways, etc.  Will definitely book again next time in Boston.  Jason's hands off approach works well and allowed us to enjoy the place as if it were our own.  The rental guide & instructions are very helpful in getting acclimated to the apartment and neighborhood.  Great trip."

The kitchen is fully stocked, the linen and bedding is very comfortable and the location is wonderful. The loft even has a foosball table and a nintendo Wii.

6066455,60099926,2016-01-18,9293003,De Fu,We had a great stay at this beautiful duplex thats conveniently located. Everything is within walking distance. The neighborhood is nice and quiet enough yet there are tons of good cafes and restaurants near by. Jason was very thorough and responsive. He was extremely helpful with my parking needs. The description/pics of the home was exactly what we got. Thanks for making our  first visit to Boston nice & pleasant. We'll definitely come back.
6066455,60848435,2016-01-28,35014586,Brennan,The location and the house itself were amazing. The upstairs space is unique and super conducive to sitting around chatting. Instructions were clear and the house was extremely clean. Couldn't have asked for more.
6066455,61075344,2016-01-31,18222960,Christine,Jason's Penthouse Apartment in Beacon Hill was absolutely wonderful!  I would definitely recommend his home for your trip to Boston.

6066455,61519111,2016-02-05,3042509,Bridget,"This is the best Airbnb rental I have ever stayed at, and I've rented through Airbnb more than twenty times! The process was seamless, and Jason was available for questions that I missed reading about in the extensive welcome package. The welcome package really hit the major attractions and, my favorite, the local restaurants that should not be missed with specific ordering recommendations. I was impressed!"
The condominium itself is located in one of the most beautiful quintessential villages that make you feel as though you are in Europe. The charm just exudes from Beacon Hill,and it's one of my favorite places in the world. The condominium has enough space to fit three couples comfortably and if you aren't fussy,then four couples because the fourth bed is located in the oversized second living-room.  We had tickets to go see Bruce Springsteen,but we did not want to leave this beautiful place! We were just having too much fun listening to a two year old play foosball. No,the place isn't child proofed,but that was not our concern. We had enough adults to be happily entertained with our two year old while keeping him safe.
All of the furniture in the home comfortable and great quality. The beds were comfortable and the linens appeared to be high thread count too.,,,,,
"This place was just spectacular! \"",,,,,
6066455,62171274,2016-02-12,6955945,Emily,"Jason's Beacon Hill apartment was perfect for our family of 8.  The location is amazing - walking distance to Boston Commons, the Charles River Esplanade, and the T stop.  The apartment was also very clean and true to the pictures.  The beds were very comfortable, heating worked wonderfully, and the apartment was warmly and tastefully furnished.  Jason was always quick to reply to my questions and gave clear instructions about everything in the apartment.  When I asked if there was a blender in the kitchen, he went out and bought a new one for our stay.  Our family loved our stay and we hope to be back again this summer!  Thank you, Jason!"

The living spaces are very relaxing and we loved the foosball table upstairs!  The host provides keyless entry, which is a great relief, because I'm always afraid of locking myself out when I'm visiting somewhere!"
6066455,66189313,2016-03-20,58183287,Hayley,"Jason and his gorgeous apartment were everything my girlfriends and I could hope for. Jason was very quick to respond with every question I had leading up to the rental night as well as the day of.  He gave us great spots in Boston to check out.  The apartment is located right next to a garage which was extremely convenient, since finding parking on Charles St can be near impossible.  Overall it was a great stay, great apartment and great host.  I would rent again from Jason in a heartbeat."
6066455,68279019,2016-04-04,36410814,Alexander,"We were made to feel exceptionally welcome by Jason, who could not have been more helpful in the run up to and during our trip.

Jason was responsive and helpful with any questions we had and even provided suggestions as far as local activities/dining spots. I couldn't have asked for a better place to call home for the weekend. Starbucks is right across the street and the historic homes/alley ways are a stones throw from the (URL HIDDEN) pictures listed here are amazing but they don't do the property justice. If you are looking for a large apartment in Boston...stop looking, this has everything you could possible dream of. A huge thanks to Jason and his wife to going above and beyond anything I could have dreamed of. I will absolutely be recommending this to anyone heading in that direction."
6066455,73678970,2016-05-09,7632608,Nina,This is a great apartment in Boston.  It is right  on Charles Street and within walking distance to most of Boston.  The check in was easy and we were proved with accurate information on how to get into the apartment.  The pictures are very accurate and the apartment itself is lovely.  It is difficult finding larger places to stay in Boston and this place is definitely one of the best.  We had a larger group for part of our visit and the apartment easily accommodated us.  Jason was a good host.  He was easy to contact and responsive to a minor request we had.  I would not hesitate to recommend this apartment for a larger family or group on a trip to Boston.

The location is fantastic - easily accessible by public transit, garage parking just steps away (it's not cheap, but it's convenient), close proximity to great dining - all in a charming, walkable neighborhood.  The apartment is immaculate; it's spacious and comfortable - with great beds!  Best of all, Jason himself was accommodating and gracious.  His welcome packet was the best we've seen from any host."

The space was perfect because we all had good bedrooms and the extra living room was great for tween girls who want a spot of their own.  The host was incredibly responsive when we had questions, etc.  we will be back!"
6066455,83951804,2016-07-04,42938980,Sittiporn,"Jason was excellent at communicating with me and give clear instruction on how to get into the building. He has left a list of restaurants, which was very helpful. The amenities were comfortable, as if you live in your own home."

Jason highlighted this issue to me but my car was booked already.  Anyway, we spend two great night in that apartment, thanks for all the preparetion. This was my first AIRBNB experience, very much enjoyed."
6066455,85685750,2016-07-12,38312776,Kate,"Fabulous stay here.  The location can't be beat--we walked down to the Public Garden almost every evening.  We had dinner at a different place on Charles St., every night and each was better than the last."
Apartment was comfy,easy living.  The air conditioning works beautifully,which was key when you're in the top floor.  Ample space.  Very comfortable beds.,,,
My only complaint was that I think proximity to the hospital makes for a pretty high siren rate at night and there was also quite a bit of construction noise nearby.  But my kids slept like rocks,"so I think that was only an issue for the extremely light sleeper of the group (me).\"",,,,
6066455,85971468,2016-07-14,73380169,Kent,The property is beautiful and well maintained.  Trendy neighborhood and close enough to popular city locations to walk.  Great communication from the owner.

6066455,92907151,2016-08-10,50796227,Juliette,It's a great apartment - don't judge the apartment by the hallway when you arrive - my mum was really concerned but once you get in the apartment it's beautiful. Very spacious. The beds were lovely and comfy - lovely bedlinen. The storage was great. The facilities very good. Very comfortable base in a great location. Air conditioning very good and quiet downstairs. A bit noisy for the upstairs one but we are not used it as we come from UK. Jason was a great host and very responsive to our requests. I would recommend this apartment to anyone wanting a central Boston base.
10905777,71259446,2016-04-24,33705813,Preston,We had a great experience staying at Mike's place while attending a convention at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center. The location was a quick and easy walk to the convention center but was also a great location for dining and nightlife.
The loft was the perfect size for our 2 person group and had all the amenities and comforts that we could hope for and 10x the visual appeal of any hotel room (the exposed brick is amazing),,,,,
Mike was very flexible and accommodating of our schedule and worked with us for our check in and check out times.,,,,,
"All in all it was a great experience \"",,,,,
7540480,46321744,2015-09-09,41882454,Peggah,"This is an AMAZING place.  Absolutely fantastic location, great for South End restaurants and bars but also a really quick walk into Back Bay/Copley/Newbury Street.  Not to mention - it is brand new!  Newly renovated with high spec kitchen, TV, internet, etc.  Honestly, it has everything you need - from towels and spare linens to a dining room table (e.g. it is a BIG 1 bed)."
A very special thank you to the many hosts ;) they were real sweethearts and really looked out for us.  We flew in from abroad and I was given mobile phone numbers in case anything went wrong which was a huge comfort.  That being said,it was so easy as the logistics and directions were really simple and clear.,,,,
Finally,a very quick note that I got a chance to check out the other two properties in the building and those are also as beautifully done as the first floor.  All have beautiful decks but the top flat is the jewel with a huge roof terrace.,,,,
If you are thinking about coming to Boston,"I would wholeheartedly recommend this extremely charming flat!\"",,,,

7540480,48709566,2015-09-28,40209991,Guido,Ethan's apartment is near to perfection. In fact it was perfect for three guests like us. We enjoyed the new refurbishment as well as the modern kitchen and the nice bathroom. Everything was light and clean. The location is very near to the historical Center of Boston you can reach just by a walk. We spent the evening at the deck with a great view to the gardens in front. Ethan was very helpful and responsive.

The apartment was lovely and looked just like the pictures. It was equipped with all the amenities of a hotel (hair dryer, iron, TV) plus the comforts of home (kitchen stocked with lots of utensils and everything you need to cook). The house is beautiful and the neighborhood is awesome. Tons of restaurants within a two minute walk."
7540480,50173657,2015-10-10,34304428,Jennifer,"Being a first time user of Air B&B I  was nervous, however Ethan made the process very easy! He was always quick to respond to any of my questions.His place is beautiful and in a great area in Boston! There were a few things I should note for future travelers, due to the age of the front windows and the building itself, whenever anyone smoked outside it came into the apartment,it quickly dissipated after whoever smoked outside stopped. I am Asthmatic and was ok, since I had my inhaler, however our friend who slept on the futon by the window on the first night had to deal with it more. Also my husband after a long day sight seeing wanted to watch Some of the baseball playoffs on TNT, sadly there are not many channels past the basic ones. Staying here you were around some wonderful restaurants and bars we recommend Masa for their brunch, Picco for some awesome wood fired pizza and house made ice creams, and The Franklin for a cool bar dinner vibe. We had a wonderful stay in Boston and would use Ethan's place again!"
7540480,50501006,2015-10-12,4302887,Shumway,"From the brick-and-tree-lined street in a central location to the 100-year old doors and view of the Hancock Tower, this place is quintessentially Boston. The place was impeccably cleaned and Ethan was incredibly responsive, often within minutes.  Great for a single or couple."

My sister and I came into Boston for a weekend girls trip. I slept on sleeper sofa,"and sister took the bed. It worked out perfectly because we both had our own space (living room is separated from bedroom by dining room). We had a great time and were able to walk the city easily from this spot.\"",,,,
7540480,51565645,2015-10-21,45476668,Kathy,"This South End apartment was wonderful and so were the hosts.  The apartment is clean and remodeled with a well-appointed kitchen, including new cooking and eating supplies.  Excellent neighborhood shops and restaurants were all around.  The T (Back Bay station) is just a short walk away and I got anywhere I needed to go in about 10 mins.  The hosts were responsive and accommodating.  I am looking forward to staying here on my next trip to Boston.  Thanks for a perfect stay!"

7540480,52507529,2015-10-30,36119085,Jo,"Hadde et kjempefint opphold i denne leiligheten sentralt i Boston i forbindelse med jobb. Leiligheten er stor, ryddig og ren, og med alt man trenger av fasiliteter, inkludert en veldig komfortabel seng. Det meste av Boston sentrum er tilgjengelig til fots for voksne. Leiligheten ligger i en rolig sidegate med bare bolighus, og man finner mange gode, uavhengige restauranter, bakerier og kaffebarer i nærheten. Ethan er veldig hjelpsom, og svarer raskt på alle spørsmål."

It was close to everything we needed, including delicious food and fun bars (we recommend mike & patty's for bkfst sandwiches, and bucher shop for wine). Apartment is just as described, clean and really pleasant. Careful though going to the back porch in the winter - it's icy boston after all. Ethan was a great host, and we hope to come back!"

We found everything we needed in the kitchen, the apartment in general is clean and comfortable. Grocery stores and even the city centre are just a stone's throw away. The communication with Ethan was really good, he replied immediately to all messages. Thanks again!"
7540480,62544811,2016-02-15,42644634,Patrick,"My stay was excellent as always. The location is perfect -- on a very quiet street but minutes away from everything in the South End. The unit is very nice -- comfortable bed, well-equipped kitchen, nice towels. I am already booked for my next trip."

The apartment itself was very clean and well-lit. The amenities provided were modern and comfortable. Ethan was a great host! He allowed for early check-in and late check-out as to allow us a place to store our bags before we had to catch our flight.
7540480,65957499,2016-03-18,647056,Monica,Loved staying here! Adorable place and neighborhood. The apartment was exactly as described.
7540480,66231261,2016-03-20,15877541,Ziwei,"My two friends and I stayed at this beautiful apartment during our visit to Boston. We absolutely fell in love with South End. The apartment was everything we needed for the trip. It was clean, quiet, spacious and the neighborhood was very quaint. The apartment is also well located with top restaurants and bars all just around the corner. Although we did not see the hosts they gave us detailed instructions prior to our arrival which was extremely helpful. The only problem we did notice with the apartment was that we were unable to lock the door to the shared balcony. Overall this was a wonderful apartment!"
7540480,66776791,2016-03-24,42644634,Patrick,"As always, a wonderful stay! This is an ideal location -- close to everything in the South End, but on a very quiet side street. Nice bathroom, comfortable bed, well-equipped kitchen suitable for real cooking. I've already booked for another stay in May. Highly recommended!"
7540480,66945898,2016-03-25,28690668,Guy And Karen,"My son and I had a wonderful stay at Vika's! It's a very sweet brownstone one bedroom, super comfortable and clean.  It's in a wonderful location--a very quiet street tucked between two major streets that have great cafes and restaurants.  It was very easy to access with the directions Vika provided ahead of time. She also was super accommodating and let us leave our bags after check out to retrieve on our way to South Station after spending the morning at the Science Museum. I couldn't recommend it more highly and would stay again on our next trip."
7540480,67599090,2016-03-30,61370498,Rick,"The arrangements for entering and getting the keys were clear and easy to follow. The apartment was just as advertised, large, comfortable and very clean.

The apartment is very good,nice and clean,and there is everything you need for your staying. And it is exactly like in the photos,so no surprise (as,unfortunately,sometimes I had) !
"I do recommend this apartment and this host!\"",,,,,
7540480,69950328,2016-04-15,55011969,Sarah,"Wir, 2 Erwachsenen und 2 Teenagers, haben uns sowohl in der Wohnung wie auch im Quartier sehr Wohl gefühlt. Die Beschreibung und Ausstattung entspricht voll den Angaben und Bilder. Obwohl wir der Vermieter nie persönlich begegnet haben, hat alles geklappt: von der Übernahme der Wohnung bis zur Lösung eines technischen Problem in der Wohnung während unserem Aufenthalt.  Wir haben auch geschätzt, die zur Verfügung stehende Waschmaschine und Tumbler vor unserer Weiterreise verwenden zu können."
7540480,70695787,2016-04-19,3053347,Nick,"This is the perfect spot to stay at if you are running the Boston Marathon. You can literally walk 15 minutes to get to the runner's bus pick up to the starting line. And , to make it better, you can walk back from the finish line , too as that's also a 15 minute stroll. As for the inside, it's got plenty of room for 4 people and was very clean and comfortable."
7540480,71479338,2016-04-25,50144718,Asia,"The listing was very nice, light, airy, and clean on a quiet block not too far from South Boston Station and the Convention Center. It was exactly as I expected from the photos and reviews!"
7540480,72297430,2016-05-01,11852716,Robert,"This place was perfect!  Ideally located in South Boston and close to great restaurants and within walking distance of the Freedom Trail.  Our host was very responsive and helpful when we had questions.  The apartment was clean, the bed was comfortable, and we had everything we needed.  Just a great experience all the way around!"
"\"",,,,,
7540480,73520485,2016-05-08,41659264,Jennifer,"This is a lovely place to stay! Gorgeous, clean and very centrally-located within Boston. We came without a car rental and easily walked to everywhere we wanted to go."
7540480,74068798,2016-05-12,13319416,Janet,"Boston was definitely a highlight of our trip so far. The apartment was perfect - comfortable, clean and in a lovely street close to everything. We couldn't have been more satisfied. It was especially helpful to have the little booklet with great suggestions for activities, bars and restaurants in the local South End area, as well as elsewhere in Boston."
7540480,75168238,2016-05-19,61070231,Roger,"Very helpful communication prior to stay; information regarding apartment was clear and there were no problems or issues.  It was our first Airbnb experience, and a most positive one.  The apartment was very comfortable, and ideally situated both for local amenities, especially bars, restaurants, bakeries and small shops - quite an arty, slightly alternative area, and also quick to central parts of Boston either on foot, or by public transport or Uber which we used a fair bit.  There were very useful notes of restaurants, shops, etc. in a guide compiled for apartment guests.  We loved the back decking/balcony - where the view juxtaposed community gardens with skyscrapers - excellent for an aperitif or breakfast, and the interior was well and comfortably furnished with plenty of space for a couple.  Our son who is studying at Boston College visited a few times and loved it too.  We much preferred staying here to a room in a hotel which we felt would have been more restrictive and less spacious, and probably not in such an interesting neighborhood.  We found people around there very friendly and helpful, and would certainly stay again - it was our first proper trip to Boston and we'd love to come back!"
7540480,75932698,2016-05-23,61652369,Peter,"The arrangements were easily made and well supported with frequent emails and messages.  Vika was quite helpful in recommending new restaurants.  We know the South End and Back Bay well, but are always looking for new restaurants.  This place is a perfect balance of quiet comfort on a class, tree-lined street -- while still being close to lots of action, in all directions."
7540480,76914486,2016-05-29,39867711,Carlos,"Everything was perfect. The apartment has a lot of space, light, is very clean, beautiful deck and the location is great!! A 10!"

7540480,79755531,2016-06-14,75485207,Greg,"Overall a great first Airbnb experience. Vika and her assistant were responsive and very helpful in pointing us to parking, suggesting local eateries (all excellent), and receiving a package delivered in advance of our arrival. The neighbourhood is lovely and Unit was as advertised and clean; arrival instructions were clear. The sleeper sofa was not very comfortable, but not many of them are. Footfalls from the unit above resonate."
7540480,80129418,2016-06-16,16570416,Akaki,"Great apartment, Very responsive host, amazing neighborhood and a very nice and large patio right outside the bedroom. great place, Highly recommend"

7540480,88691663,2016-07-25,38846847,Kate,"Zyka always responded to my queries quickly and cheerfully.  The apartment was just the right size for my daughter and me, and clean as a whistle, well supplied, comfortable bed, and helpful notes and brochures."
7540480,89401976,2016-07-28,35436336,Douglas,"We really enjoyed the apartment, it is in an excellent Boston location and has the character we enjoy with high ceilings, dining room and hardwood floors."
7540480,91038721,2016-08-03,223456,Marina,"Our family of four with two small children visited Boston from our home in Brooklyn, NY for three nights. We loved South End for it's proximity to the Public Gardens, Wholefoods, a playground on the block, great dinner spots in the neighborhood and charming Victorian row houses. The apartment had most of what we needed for a short stay. The back patio was great for drinks and a snack before dinner. We loved sitting in the parlor floor room when the afternoon sun came in. They had a hardcover version of Make Way For Ducklings, which my daughter loved."
7540480,92036298,2016-08-07,371277,Jay,"simple, clean, quiet apartment.  great stay."
7540480,93515174,2016-08-13,50385863,Zachary,"This was a wonderful place to stay.  It was comfortable, spacious and just as described.  I really appreciated the amenities, like french press, hair dryer, shampoo/body-wash, iron.  Vika really provided everything I needed to have a great stay.  The bed was comfortable and the kitchen was perfect for my needs.  I'll definitely try to stay there again when I come back to Boston."
7540480,94681392,2016-08-16,85701674,Felicity,"The apartment is in a great location, in a lovely street and walking distance to the city. I wouldn't recommend it as a place for a third adult as the sofa bed was very uncomfortable according to our son. He has been backpacking for 6 months so it must be pretty bad! The apartment's wifi did not work while we were there which was a real nuisance. We were advised to use the upstairs wifi which worked intermittently, but my husband had to go to a nearby cafe to catch up on emails. Having said that there were lots of good restaurants and cafes within walking distance."
7540480,96426213,2016-08-22,26181155,Kim,"What a great stay! The apartment is just so charming, and the porch out the back is such a treat, looking out on a community garden and set right in the middle of the cross streets, not close enough to either to be bothered by the noise. The kitchen was stocked well enough to enjoy breakfast before going out for the day, and the whole apartment was clean, bright, breezy, and comfortable. The bathroom might seem a little challenging for a taller person, but completely manageable, and very clean. There is mostly private parking on the street, but we stayed just for the weekend and grabbed a spot in the visitor parking section near the corner of Shawmut Ave, making everything way easier than dealing with a local parking garage. Walking distance to a few great cafes, to the SoWa Market on Sunday, to some excellent places to eat. Easy to get into other parts of Boston, we used mostly car service as Uber and Uber Pool were incredibly cheap, no matter where we were headed or when. Overall, I would absolutely recommend this place, great experience!"
7540480,98110688,2016-08-29,2335233,Amber,"I rented Vika's place for 4 days with a friend visiting from abroad who had never been to Boston. The apartment is exactly as pictured on the site, and you really can't beat the location - we were walking distance from some of the best restaurants and bars in the city. When we arrived I couldn't figure out the lock box (user error) and Vika was immediately responsive over text. The only down side was that the upstairs neighbors (not sure if they were also renting or if they lived there) were quite noisy and you could hear them throughout the night. It is an older home so this is to be expected to some extent - I live in NYC so am used to noise and always wear earplugs, but even I noticed it. Otherwise an overall great experience!"
1113272,9449145,2013-12-29,7570656,Emma,Great place to stay. Wonderful host. Will use again.

1113272,12108129,2014-04-23,1692787,David,We loved our stay at Roberto's apartment and felt so at home during our stay. Roberto was there to greet us after our long flight to Boston from the UK which was reassuring and it was great to meet him. Roberto was very friendly and introduced us to the apartment and then happily left us to it and we had the whole place to ourselves during our time there.
The apartment had all we required and was a lovely place to come back to after some sight seeing. It is also on a quiet street in the neighbourhood.,,,,,
We loved the JP area of Boston,there are a good selection of shops,bars,restaurants and cafés.,,
Use Roberto's apartment and you will not be disappointed.,,,,,

1113272,14542523,2014-06-21,4357669,Hoa,"Roberto's place is indeed beautiful and true as described. Though we call in the last minute asking to stay (my first listing fell off because it was too dirty and we couldn't stand it), Roberto tries his best to clean and prepare everything we'd need ahead our arrivals and made us feel like home. He's easy to communicate with and Mom and aunt were really happy staying at Roberto's place and would definitely love to come back if we have a chance."

1113272,15111996,2014-07-02,6261257,Katie,"Our stay at Roberto's place was absolutely perfect. He was prompt and thorough in communication before and during the stay, flexible with our arrival time, and incredibly friendly and welcoming. The place itself is spacious and gorgeous - it was like vacationing in my ideal home! We had access to everything we needed. The neighborhood was lovely, and we were close by to the parks and public transit. Roberto's guide to neighborhood favorites also led us to several fantastic meals out. The well-appointed kitchen allowed us to cook a great meal in."
1113272,15974674,2014-07-19,16798958,Ursula,We've had a good time in Roberto's really great and spacious apartment - perfect for us as a small family. Jamaica Plain is a nice mixed area outside downtown Boston. Roberto was there when we came and introduced us to everthing. We definitely recommend the place.

"Highly recommanded!\"",,,,,
1113272,16359103,2014-07-26,78689,Kathleen,"Roberto met my brother and I right on time, gave us a complete orientation and took time for a chat and let us know the best local places.  The place was very nice - just as pictured.  The location at the end of the street, and next to a neighborhood park made it very quiet.  We found good places to dine, a great coffee, pastry, sandwich shop a few blocks away and a good grocery store too.   Because we had a car and no downtown destinations we did not use the MTA but there is a stop very close.   I would recommend the place highly."
1113272,16916613,2014-08-04,17166277,Alexandra,"\"Un très bon moment passé chez Roberto. Nous ne l'avons pas rencontré, ce qui peut être \"\"pertubant\"\" quand on arrive dans le quartier de Jamaica Plain. Mais une fois les marques prises"

1113272,19686229,2014-09-16,6802978,Edward,"This place was perfect for my wife, myself, and our nearly 2-year old toddler.  Good amount of space and very clean - certainly someone's home, but unobtrusively so.  Easy street parking, and right across the street from a community garden and park that was a great play spot for our toddler.  And definitely try Canto 6 bakery just up the street!"

Roberto's place is walking distance to the T line, coffee shop, small grocery store, Doyles if you want a beer and there is a nice park near by. Roberto met us and he also gave me some flowers. Very nice.  It is in a quite neighborhood. If we go back to Boston, I would stay at his place again."

1113272,41964783,2015-08-10,19861197,Neil,"Roberto was a very good host, explained all that needed to be explained, left good written instructions and information. Responded readily when I needed to contact him. The apartment was very pleasant, quiet, on a safe street, right next to a community garden. It had all that was needed. Very enjoyable. The only thing not quite satisfactory was the mattress on one of the beds, which was somewhat uncomfortable for an adult (though probably fine for a child). Overall, very positive experience here."
1113272,44640056,2015-08-28,34186498,Monica,"We had a comfortable stay at Roberto's place. The apartment is located in a quiet neighbourhood, right next to a community garden, as you get the whole apartment to yourself, it's very private. There is a 15 minutes short walk from the apartment to T line, and the nearest grocery shop is about 10 minutes away (but I would recommend to get groceries from central Boston, as there are more choices) Overall our experience was good."
1113272,46821588,2015-09-13,643602,Aleksandra Sasha,"Beautiful, cozy and spacious apartment! Very clean and located in a quite neighborhood. Keep in mind, it's 20-30 mins away from downtown by car though. Really loved my stay there. Highly recommend. Rob is a great communicator."
1113272,47716037,2015-09-21,10188647,Jaime,Roberto is well organized. He had documents that describe all processes. We like the list of places to go for social activities or to eat. Directions for public transportation were great. He also took time to check from time to time if anything was needed. Not very intrusive but just timely.
1113272,57682262,2015-12-28,7570656,Emma,"Roberto is a fantastic host and has a wonderful apartment. This is the second time my family has stayed there (4 adults) and we couldn't be happier with the location, space, or accommodations."
1113272,58216644,2016-01-01,8243891,Johanna,The listing was very accurate. Roberto instructions were very helpful.
1113272,70657760,2016-04-19,4506840,Noah,"We had a great stay at Roberto's apartment! Roberto was unable to meet us for check-in, but gaining access was simple with his instructions and he was very responsive via text. There were even a variety of snacks left for us (crackers, tea, coffee, etc), which were highly appreciated after travelling! The apartment was awesome, the beds and sofas were very comfy. The kitchen was a great spot to hang out with the island in the middle, and the open flow to the dining and living rooms was very cool. We found it easy to get around to other parts of Boston from Jamaica Plains."
1113272,71152347,2016-04-24,14250600,Jayson,"This place is awesome! Quiet neighborhood, good parking and an easy drive into downtown. The house was very comfortable and set up perfectly! Would definitely recommend staying here!!"
1113272,72337014,2016-05-02,60640331,Jodi,"This place was terrific! Very comfortable very clean and it really felt like home. The neighbors are friendly it is in a nice area within assessable park, walking distance from good restaurants, and the train.  Roberto was not there to check us in but made it very easy to check in and out.  Manual available to describe things you need to know during your stay.  We weren't bothered by any of this in the least however if you need complete silence this apartment is on the bottom floor of an older building and you can hear people walking around and sometimes talking upstairs in the old radiators do make some noise… but none of that is pervasive in any way.  Highly recommend."
1113272,72633545,2016-05-04,14767584,Jennifer,"Roberto's apartment was perfect for my two kids and I while we made a quick visit to Boston.  It allowed us a good landing spot between our outings.  The place was clean, nicely decorated and spacious.  The kitchen had all the things we needed to be able to cook a nice home meal and breakfast when we didn't dine out.  The park across the street was a good spot for my son and I to have a game of catch...the back yard would have been good for that too.  The bike path that was a few blocks away was a bonus for a nice evening walk/scooter ride.  I used to live in JP, so felt right at home.  The hassle-free parking was a huge plus as well."
1113272,74517256,2016-05-15,68396698,秀花,Roberto's place is warm and nice for family. We didn't meet him in person but we really had a great stay. The house looks exactly like the pics and the beds are so comfortable.
1113272,75276001,2016-05-20,70660071,Yi,"Roberto's apartment is great and we enjoyed our stay in his place so, I definitely recommend people to chose Roberto's apartment. However, Roberto's apartment is located next to Roxbury, I strongly recommend people not to go out after 8 pm. Roberto is a very thoughtful host but  could respect his tenants' privacy more. He entered in his apartment in the early morning while we were still staying his apartment."
1113272,76427685,2016-05-27,58396885,Javier,Robertos apartment is really nice. We have such a good time in there. The neighbours were really polite with us. I recommend this apartment.

1113272,85482417,2016-07-11,69005091,Jane,We really enjoyed our stay at Roberto's place in JP.
- booking process was extremely efficient (quick and friendly),,,,,

1113272,89918519,2016-07-30,17786100,Robert,JP was a lovely neiborhoood. The distance from this location to my conference downtown was quite convienent.
1113272,92800906,2016-08-10,77115956,Melanie,Roberto's apartment was perfect for our family holidays with a toddler and a baby. Playgrounds are around the corner and the metro station nearby.

It was very clean and comfortable and we had everything we needed. The location was great and the neighborhood was gorgeous. We walked most everywhere or sometimes took the train or a cab, we didn't drive once. Everything was pretty close! Communication before and during our stay was excellent and so helpful! Their place is really nice and we can't wait to stay there again. Thanks again for everything!"
8970393,71862644,2016-04-29,68092882,Juan,"I have to say all around it was a great trip. A very comfortable setting in a trendy neighborhood. In the morning I took a short walk to Madeleine's bakery and had the most delicious ham and cheese corsant and a great coffee, very chic. I hung out and relaxed on the patio a few hours, even though it's in the middle of a city it was a private patio with a nice garden to look at and help me relax while I did some work. Thanks so much, next time I'm in Boston I know I'll try to stay here again."

13100828,77295380,2016-05-31,73248647,Marissa,Ada was an amazing host! My boyfriend and I were actually her first guests and she did a great job. I have no complaints. She offered to let us use her coffee machine and checked in to make sure we were doing okay and that the apartment was working for us. She was very flexible with arrival times and check out times and we were very grateful for that. She also gave us some great recommendations for the Boston area and things to do during our stay. Her apartment was supremely clean and spacious and the listing was 100% accurate. Couldn't be happier with our stay!
13100828,77927896,2016-06-04,21964189,Magnus,A very lovely apartment in a great location. It has a fantastic view over the bay to Boston. Parking wasn't a problem and there is a train stop next door.

Her apartment is in a great location, super close to the T (one stop away from the north end, and two from the old state house).

Ada is so friendly and took very good care of us, giving us suggestions for local activities and showing a good amount of patience when I got turned around finding the place, she stayed with me right till I got to the door.

This apartment was exactly what we were looking for: spacious and comfortable in a beautiful, central part of Boston. Our stay could not have been better. Paul was there to meet us and tell us about the apartment and nearby eateries, etc. He stocked the apartment with fruit, a variety of snacks, soda and even a bottle of wine.  I would recommend this place to everyone looking for a private, cozy place in the heart of Boston that feels like it's your own."
3890373,19884061,2014-09-20,19220627,Manoj,The apartment was amazing and Paul was a great host. He was able to recommend some great sites in Boston and some great places to eat.

The apt itself is a good size,both the bed and pull out couch were very comfortable. It was very clean. Well stocked with everything you need,including some treats / coffee / water ...,,,
The location is awesome - it is a great area of the city! Apt is central to most attractions in Boston - and we walked the city for the most part. Subway stop is a 5min walk away,so when needed,it was there.,,,

We had a problem figuring out the Kuerig machine and Paul sent his son (who lives close) over to demonstrate how to use it.  He let us drop off luggage earlier than our check in time.  He was very accommodating.  Would definitely stay here again!!!

3890373,21768462,2014-10-23,3045286,Seth,"So, I had to come to Boston, as that's where my company meets.   Normally, I would stay at the W Boston, but it was completely booked, and other hotel rates were simply insane ($400+ per night)."
With little time to spare,I came to my trusty friend AirBNB,looked for something close-ish to the W,and found this wonderful little apartment.  You know how sometimes the pictures are taken under the best possible conditions,and don't really represent the place you're going to get?   Not so here!  The apartment is tastefully decorated,with a very nice little kitchen
Wireless connectivity was great,the hosts were marvelously accommodating (dealing with a particularly late arrival,compounded by a delayed flight).   The location is really great,the apartment is quiet and conveniently located,and the local restaurants are quite nice.,
I particularly appreciated the little touches like robes in the closet,"and slippers for my feet.  I come from a \"\"no-shoes\"\" household",so,I really appreciated the thought they put into that.   Having menus and such for local restaurants was nice.  There was milk for me in the fridge and coffee easily available (I drank the milk,but not the coffee.  :) ).,
"A+++ stay.  I'm not ever going back to the W unless this place is booked.\"",,,,,
3890373,22235110,2014-11-02,4056191,Leonel,"location, cleanliness and comfort of the apt was perfect, as it is the pictures and more !. Paul is very helpful and our stay was outstanding fine. We have received some details that make a difference. Obviously the rating is excellent and certainly recommend it to all the traveling community"

Paul met us on arrival to show us the space and welcome us to Boston.  He's quite a character!,,,,,
The condo is within walking distance to many great neighborhoods in the city.  We visited quite a few restaurants (I recommend Neptunes for oysters).  We ate at a few italian restaurants in North Town which is less than a 15 minute walk,and had coffee at The Thinking Cup a couple of times.  They serve delicious Stumptown coffee from Portland) and there's a Whole Foods down the street (doesn't sell beer or wine but there are a couple of liquor stores down the street).  We walked miles and miles both north and south and only took a cab (uber) once - our driver arrived within 5 minutes of our request.,,,,
Thank you,Paul,for providing such a comfortable place to stay and for your kind welcome to your great city,"Boston.\"",,
3890373,23008818,2014-11-20,22221361,Steve,"Our stay in Boston was great!  Especially thanks to the location of this apartment!  The neighbourhood had character and was close walking distance to all of our travels; sightseeing, restaurants, shopping, TD Gardens. I usually don't like to stay in the same place twice but considering what we experienced it would be hard to pass up."
Paul was very nice and accommodating.  He communicated well with us prior to and on arrival.  The apartment was just like in the pictures.. Clean,quiet and had all amenities.,,,,
"Thanks Paul for a wonderful stay!\"",,,,,
3890373,23762991,2014-12-09,21891848,Katie,"We had an absolutely fantastic stay in Boston & the apartment really made the difference in our trip. Paul was communicative, helpful & accommodating - especially with our planned early arrival that turned into a later arrival due to flight delays. He sent an Uber invite that provided us with a free ride from the airport & met us at the apartment with the keys. The ground floor apartment was exactly, if not better, than it is pictured; clean, comfortable and cozy. There was coffee, teas, a basket of snacks & bottled water in the fridge; towels, soaps and lotions were provided in the bathroom."
The apartment's location was perfect. A 5 minute walk to 2 different T stations & just up and over the hill is Boston Common. There is a CVS,Whole Foods & Rite Aid nearby,as well as a couple of liquor stores & a number of restaurants. If you like Corned Beef Hash,check out Harvard Gardens for brunch. It's the best my dad has ever had (and he used to own a restaurant). The nearby Red Hat is a great little bar/restaurant that's been in operation over 100 years & survived prohibition as a speak-easy. You want a place where the locals go,this is it. The North End is a 15 minute walk from the apartment & has a plethora of dining options,not to mention TONS of character. It's a must-visit.
Dad & I agreed,Paul's apartment is officially our place to stay in Boston. We plan to come back for a longer stay in warmer weather. It was worth every penny,and was much more economical than staying in a hotel where we would have had much less space & wouldn't have been nearly as comfortable. I couldn't recommend it more. Thank you so much Paul!,,,

He was generous with his time to answer our questions (he gave us a great sushi recommendation- Douzo!) and made sure we had everything we needed.
The apartment looked exactly like the photos. There was plenty of space for us (a couple) and everything was so clean and well thought out... from the welcome basket to the robes hanging in the closet.,,,,,
The bed was really comfortable and the soaking tub was enjoyable. We appreciate a great shower and it did not disappoint. We went to Whole Foods (so close!) and got bubble bath. In fact,we went to Whole Foods daily and enjoyed picking up drinks and food items. The walk to the common was easy and Thinking Cup coffee was our first trip each day. We walked to the North End one night for dinner.... Carmen was a great restaurant.,,,,

3890373,29381882,2015-04-07,24250147,Beth,A fantastic apartment in lovely Beacon Hill- we were so glad we stayed here rather than in a downtown hotel. There are lots of nice places to eat on nearby Charles Street and Boston Common is minutes away.  Breakfast at The Paramount was fab!
The kitchen in the apartment is well set up with everything you would expect though we didn't really make use of it.,,,,,
Paul was a great host- quick to respond to questions. Collecting the key was straightforward and everything was set up as described. The beds were comfortable- a great sofa bed.,,,,,

3890373,30659121,2015-04-26,22377701,Paige,"First off, THANK YOU so much Paul. The place is in a perfect location and is in mint condition . My parents and I stayed here for about 5 days and we were extremely satisfied with everything. Paul is great at communicating and is there if you need anything ! Getting the key was smooth and easy and the day we checked out... We got to chat with paul some more and even were able to leave our bags in the front closet bc our flight didn't leave till a little after check out time. The apartment is close to just about everything . We could walk anywhere ! There are great restaurants nearby and a Whole Foods literally right across the street . The neighborhood is super safe and beautiful ! I highly recommend this airbnb to any couple looking to spend some fun time in the city ! We cannot wait to come back and visit again! Paul is super awesome and welcoming ! Thank you Paul again from Martin , Lynn and me (Paige !) !"

We recommended it!"
3890373,32047250,2015-05-13,26248822,Kieran,"We had a very comfortable stay at Paul's apartment in Beacon Hill. We are a family of four, two children both aged just under four.  The apartment is very comfortably furnished and has plenty of equipment to help you make the most of your stay. We arrived quite late (especially for us as we flew from the UK) so we're very grateful for the sundries we found on arrival. Good coffee, some milk in the fridge etc. we here happy too when Whole Foods opened and we could get some breakfast. Just one minute walk. The only downside was that we didn't find the apartment as quiet as some of the other reviewers, as there was quite a bit of coming and going during the night and you are quite close to the building's front door if you sleep on the sofa bed. The bedroom is set further back and may not have been noisy but we put the children in there. I think we may have been unlucky though as it was graduation weekend. We would firmly recommend to other travellers."

It was conveniently and centrally located in the beautiful and historic Beacon Hill neighborhood and to the places we needed to get to in the city. The apartment itself was absolutely spotless, extremely well organized and thoughtfully laid out. We felt welcome and comfortable as soon as we arrived! Paul was very easy to communicate with and responded personally with guidance on parking, the operation and location of specific amenities and was generally very friendly and available if we had questions. We were lucky to have found his place and spent a restful night there before a hectic day out and about. And as an Airbnb host myself, this was my first experience as a guest! A fabulous first experience!!"
3890373,44652976,2015-08-28,14650953,Cecilia,"Paul's apartment on Beacon Hill was our home away from home for 4 nights. It was very nice, very clean and in an amazing neighborhood. Safe to take a walk even at night. Close to a lot of must see in Boston."

My husband, my 7 month old son, and I arrived at 10 pm in the evening and he arranged for his son to meet us at the apartment and let us in. He also left us dinner, a roast chicken from Whole foods. It was wonderful to not have to go out with an infant at 10pm to get dinner. We greatly appreciated his kindness. Our entire stay was pleasant. We are recommending this place to friends."

He made sure we got in town safely, had transportation to his beautiful home and had anything that we needed when we arrived.  He checked on us during our stay to make sure things were going well.  I will never stay any place else when we come home to visit.  The apartment could not have been cleaner and had everything we needed for our stay.  It was so nice to be able to cook breakfast in the morning and start our day.  Enough towels for our 10 day stay and more.  It was nice to be able to do laundry if we needed. The convenience of walking to so many places from his home was great and being in such a historical part of Boston was beautiful.   I can't say enough about Paul as a host and person."

Paul es súper buen anfitrión. Nos recibió con frutas, agua fresca, café y todo lo indispensable para cuando uno llega a un lugar nuevo. Había mil clases de te y si hubiéramos querido cocinar la cocina estaba súper equipada. Todo nuevo y limpio! La única contra es q la calle tiene inclinación y hay q hacer ejercicio para llegar, pero la casa es en planta baja...muy importante si llegas con dos niños en carrito. Hay a 100 metros un súper muy lindo, farmacia donde podes comprar las provisiones q necesites. De volver a Boston, no dudó en volver a la casa de Paul !!!"

3890373,54917285,2015-11-25,48293048,Penny,We loved staying in Paul's apartment! We were in Boston for college visits but were able to be tourists as well being so close to Boston Common. The location was perfect and the apartment very clean and spacious. We hope to stay again soon. This was out first airbnb booking and we could not have been happier.
3890373,55182796,2015-11-29,7746944,Randall,"My wife and I reserved Paul's Beacon Hill apartment for her parents who came to visit us for Thanksgiving. We had a wonderful experience from beginning to finish. Paul approved us within a minute or two of submitting our request and warmly welcomed us to use the apartment for our Thanksgiving dinner. We met Paul at his office nearby the apartment to get the key the day our reservation began. He was very friendly and wanted to be sure that we were pleased with everything. He even checked the apartment temperature using an app on his phone and said he was happy to adjust it if we would like. There was no need, however, since the apartment was pleasant and warm during their whole stay. The apartment was lovely. Everything is remodeled so nicely. It was both beautiful and very functional. The kitchen had lovely new appliances and a quality gas range. The bathroom had a large tub/shower and pleasant lighting. The kitchen was also full of high-quality utensils and dishes. It was so nice even to have a brand new Keurig brewing machine with a number of coffee pods included with the stay. My wife's parents really enjoyed their stay at the apartment and they kept telling me to make sure and leave a very nice review. It was a lovely setting for our Thanksgiving dinner. After dining in the apartment, we went for a very nice walk through the beautiful neighborhood of Beacon Hill and also took my wife's parents through the Boston Commons, Public Gardens, and Newbury Street. We came home afterward and enjoyed our desert sitting together around the couch. Also to note is that the apartment is very close to Whole Foods. It is less than a minute away by foot, almost just across the street. My wife's brother was also staying with her parents at the apartment and used the pull-out bed, which worked quite nicely for him. I imagine the apartment would be a bit crowded with more than four people, but for three it was perfect. Hope all this is helpful!"
3890373,55714375,2015-12-05,652585,Joel,Paul was easy to coordinate with and a great communicator.  The apartment was perfect for my needs met all expectations as advertised.  Recommended.

3890373,56811708,2015-12-18,2546464,James,"Paul's place is fabulous! Tasteful decor, ideal location, immaculately clean - truly an incredible value. Paul was quick to respond to any questions and checking in and out was easy. I stayed there for a couple of days while on a business trip and was so comfortable - Whole Foods and a drug store were just a two-minute walk away, and a great restaurant and brewhouse, Tip Tap Room, was also right down the street. A convenient MBTA stop by the river, and Boston Commons a few blocks the other direction. One day I took a nice walk through the Commons and down Newbury Street - totally delightful. Once back at the cozy and quiet apartment, you've got a big jacuzzi bathtub waiting for you, a solid internet connection, an extremely comfortable bed, soft cotton robes to lounge in, a Keurig coffee maker w/ plenty of tea and coffee pods, chilled water bottles in the fridge, and even some apples and little snack packs of baked goldfish crackers. There is no doubt in my mind where I am staying the next time I'm in Boston. Thank you again, Paul - I'm looking forward to coming back!!"

Lovely little playground nearby and easy to get to the T (though there are many great things within walking distance). I would recommend this to anyone, and will probably rent it again if we come back for another city fix."
3890373,67856913,2016-04-01,6082693,Alison,"This Beacon Hill apartment is wonderfully appointed with everything that you could possibly need.  My daughter and I were very comfortable even though Boston was rainy and cold during our 3 night stay. After a day of sightseeing it was great to have such a cozy place to return too. A short walk through the historic neighborhood found us on Charles street where we ate breakfast at an amazing bakery Tatte everyday. The location was located close to public transportation too, just a couple of stops to the airport and major attractions. Paul was a terrific host - and very responsive to questions we had as we prepared for our trip. Checking in and out was easy and efficient thanks to Paul's thorough organization of the process. You can't go wrong with this apartment or host."

My husband and I, along with my son and his fiancé, were in town to go to Fenway Park.   We found the bed and sofa bed very comfortable and the sheets and pillows were high quality.     Although there was only one bedroom and bathroom, the 4 of us never felt cramped as the apartment rooms are large and the furnishings well planned.   We enjoyed sharing a bottle of wine at the round table and watching the big screen TV.   Everything in the apartment is new and super clean.  Paul has many luxurious touches in the apartment like fluffy white robes, spa quality white towels and Basic Earth soap and shampoo.  We appreciated the bottled water and snacks that welcomed us.  The apartment was so convenient to the subway for the trip from the airport and to/from Fenway Park.  We walked from the apartment to restaurants close by  at Fenieul Hall and Little Italy.  There is a farmers market within a 5 minute walk on weekends where farmers sold amazing organic strawberries and blackberries at low low prices.   Whole Foods is also just down the street.   We truly were sad to leave.   We hope to get back to Boston soon (hope the Astros can do better against the Red Sox next time).  We will definitely book Paul's apartment again!"

There was even a big basket of chips as we arrived that our kids gobbled up immediately.  The apartment was immaculate.  The building is a 19th century home with an amazing history, yet it feels very modern inside with well done renovations and updates.  The kitchen is beautiful with all new appliances.

In addition to everything else mentioned on the website and in people's comments, my wife really appreciated the high-quality bathrobes.  Both Paul and his son Matt were a pleasure to deal with.  It really couldn't have been better."

3890373,98582843,2016-08-31,59966510,Stephanie,"What a great first Airbnb experience!  This apartment is in the perfect location.  It's a beautiful, historical neighborhood and you can easily walk or take public transportation to anywhere in Boston you would like to go.  We were pleasantly surprised at how nice the inside of the apartment was.  What a treat to stay in a very old building with a completely remodeled apartment.  The bed and sheets were very comfortable,  The shower was great. The pull out couch was perfect for the kids. Paul left out some snacks and bottled water which was a nice touch.  The kitchen is great and allowed us to eat some meals at the apartment.  Whole Foods is across the street so easy access to groceries.  Paul was friendly and checked in on us to make sure we had everything we needed.  This was our first time to Boston and staying in such a nice place, in the perfect location really helped make our trip wonderful.  Thank you Paul!  We will definitely recommend your apartment to anyone traveling to Boston."
12286410,72626933,2016-05-04,29153272,Robert,"The apartment was pretty much as described and, if anything, a little bigger than I was expecting.  The high ceilings and generous layout gives a good feeling of space and luxury.  The apartment was nicely decorated, well furnished and well equipped with plenty of bedding and towels.  For a commercial let, the kitchen was reasonably well stocked.  The bathroom was clean and compact.  Some more toiletries would, perhaps, have been welcome.  The apartment is in a great street in a great location.  Overall, a very good stay."
12286410,80264541,2016-06-17,39875504,Timothy,"This location was great!  I used to live in Boston and really enjoyed the feeling of staying in the city again, rather than in a stuffy hotel.  The property was extremely nice, with plenty of room and very nicely decorated.  I would definitely recommend this to friends."
12286410,87908795,2016-07-22,27551489,Hugh,"Description and welcome/access materials were accurate and helpful. We didn't communicate during our stay because there was no need. Kitchen had more than we had expected. The location is great -- and expensive, but not out of line with other options."

The house is clean and you are welcome to use their kitchen anytime (Mike had provided muffins for their guests which where delicious). A huge plus you get your own bathroom and there is public transportation right next to the house."
Regarding the room,they provided clean sheets,towels and pillows. The room in general is very light and the bed is large,great for two people.,,
Overall it was a wonderful experience to stay with Nina and Mike.,,,,,

3021446,14802210,2014-06-26,13174299,Fergus,"Nina and Mike were great hosts, very talkative and welcoming and full of ideas as to what we should do. Their house is in a lovely, quiet suburb of Boston which is only a 5 minute walk from the subway train that will take you into town in about 15-20 minutes. For those who fancy walking, it's also a reasonable 45 minutes to the Fenway area. All in all a great experience."
3021446,15016092,2014-06-30,6237370,Julie,"Nina's place is great. We got to meet Mike and he was very nice and helpful. He gave us some good advice on what to do and where to go in Boston. The room is big and clean, the bed is comfortable and you get your own bathroom ! The metro is right next to their place wich was very practical. We were very happy with our stay and we would go back anytime. Thank you Mike and Nina!"
3021446,15201733,2014-07-04,17379616,Mani,This was an excellent place to stay for the four days I was in Boston. I originally came for an orientation for my new job at Boston medical Center.
They were very flexible with my arrival time as I was on the road and hit some traffic. When I arrived,we graciously greeted me,and didn't feel very welcome and their home. They made sure the room was prepared. There was water waiting for me in the room,with a set of keys for the apartment,and an excellent list of instructions on how to get around in Boston and in the neighborhood. Additionally,they had Charlie cards or essentially bus and train passes that you could refill at a station to get around Boston.
They supplied  me with clean sheets,towels,comfortable pillows,and my own bathroom for the duration of my stay. Regarding my room,the sheets were clean and comfortable. There were more than a couple pillows available to use. And the bed was large and comfortable,and could easily accommodate two people as needed.
Given that this was the beginning of July,they had a nice fan that was in the room waiting,in addition to having central air-conditioning. Throughout my stay,the air conditioning was nice and cool,and the fan was hardly needed at night. This is all in the middle of a very hot and muggy week in Boston.,
Their location is right next to the T line as needed,however I drove in from New York and had ample parking and could go and come as I pleased without the need for searching for a parking spot.,,,,
Overall,I thought my stay with them was excellent. I would recommend that anyone from single,two couples,"two friends traveling together utilize their availability. I think that they done an excellent job in providing a clean comfortable environment to enjoy your stay in Boston.\"",,
3021446,15592199,2014-07-12,16790657,Jacques,"Nina and her husband Mike were very gracious hosts during our two day stay, even though we arrived late and not being able to inform them ahead of time... The apartment is large and spotless. The private bathroom is a plus. The bed was comfortable. The A/C was well appreciated since the daytime temperature in Boston during our visit was on average 90 degrees F."
3021446,15705654,2014-07-14,2186561,Diana,The neighborhood was nice and it was more of a suburban environment which was peaceful.  It is on a hill so if you are driving to the location be wary if you have a manual because there is only parallel parking.
3021446,15970491,2014-07-19,8322514,Robert,Nina and Mike were just delightful! The bedroom and bathroom were clean and comfy. I was helping out my daughters family with nanny duties so I left at 8am and returned at 9pm. Their apartment was a three minute walk so very convenient. I plan on staying there again.
3021446,16130574,2014-07-22,4432518,Selina,We could have easily stayed longer than the three nights.
First,Nina and her husband are really great hosts. They were very well prepared,extremely helpful and friendly. They even offer a little breakfast,what we especially appreciated.,,
Second,we really enjoyed the room and bathroom,everything was perfectly clean. They offered as well towels,showergel and shampoo just for free.,,
Third,the location is also absolutely fantastic. The public transport (subway into towncentre about 10 to 20min) is just about 3-4min by foot.,,,,
"We thank Nina and her husband a lot for this fabolous accomodation and the nice hosting. We can not tell anything critical about it :-)\"",,,,,
3021446,16309426,2014-07-25,17301902,Peter,Nina and Mike were fantastic hosts. They were incredibly well prepared and very willing to answer all our questions. The room was very comfortable and the apartment is very conveniently located just a couple of minutes from the T station. Thank you both for a great stay

3021446,17287354,2014-08-10,17529024,Fangying,"We stayed at Nina's place for three nights and it was really a wonderful experience. Nina and Mike are very nice and friendly. The bedroom is bright and clean. The private bathroom is also great and Nina carefully prepared clean towels and shampoos for us. Overall, it is a lovely place located in a convenient and nice neighborhood. It is a very good choice to stay in Boston."
3021446,17784687,2014-08-17,13391021,Loretta,Michael was there to welcome us even at a very late check in time.  He took the time to tell us about the neighborhood and restaurants close by.  The small bedroom was comfortable.  The shared living room and bath were just fine for us.  We didn't see anyone except for arriving and leaving.  Located in a charming hip neighborhood near great transportation.
3021446,18063644,2014-08-21,1804565,Leanne,This location was great and it was really easy to get into downtown Boston. Nina provided a lot of helpful information for Boston like a travel book and cards to use for the metro. The downsides to this location is the bedroom is very bright so be prepared to wake up when the sun comes up. The bedroom was quite hot and stuffy because of the morning sun. They did have a fan which helped a little. As for Nina she was fine to stay with and provided great amenities like a jug of water for the room but we didn't feel overly welcomed by her and felt sequestered to our bedroom. Overall it was a fine AirBnb experience.
3021446,18334578,2014-08-25,18544140,Yanhong,"Nina and Mike were kind, and would provide any information we needed. The house is about 6 km far from downtown center and just 1-2 minutes to subway station. The place is convenient and relatively quiet. Nina's house is      clean. The room is bright and bed is comfort. Thanks for Nina and Mike's accommodating!"
3021446,18543520,2014-08-28,18011275,Anastasia,It was our first experience with air bnb and it turned out great! Our room was  simple but clean and comfortable. The house is located near subway which was very convinient. Nina and her husband are very nice people. They made us feel at home at their place!
3021446,18921086,2014-09-02,20525197,Isidoro,"Mike and Nina made the stay very pleasant. The house is clean and organized and very well maintaned for guests coming from outside the area. The Stony Brook T stop is a block away, taking about 10-20 minutes to reach DT Boston depending on the T frequency. I recommend this room for anyone on a budget and wants to see other things than the typical Boston tourist locations."
3021446,19040417,2014-09-05,19929480,Hans,"We greatly enjoyed staying at Nina & Mike's appartment. Everything was neatly prepared for us, very clean, and a lot of nice touches (flowers, water, fresh tomatoes). Unfortunately our schedules did not overlap much but we enjoyed talking to Mike one morning at breakfast. We also liked the neighborhood a lot. Definitely a recommend and would consider again. Thanks Nina & Mike"
3021446,19198074,2014-09-08,17874673,Andreas,"Nice apartment in good neighborhood. Parking is free and the subway is 5 minutes away. Many good restaurants are 10 minutes walking distance away. Nina and mike were very helpful and gave us tips for eating places and activities. Not a good place for people who can not sleep in noisy environments because of the AC and the subway, as mentioned, 5 minutes away, but it as totally fine with us."
3021446,19347609,2014-09-10,20432844,Tomas,"This place is exactly as advertised. A bright and beautiful place, it's easy to reach by car and has convenient parking (though watch out for street cleaners!). We stayed on weekdays, so we didn't see much of our hosts, everything was very well taken care of and conveniently labeled. We had use of a separate bathroom. Everything was clean and nice."
This place was perfect for our needs,as we were spending two days exploring Boston. Easy to park,"close to the Orange line subway station (3 minute walk). There were even subway cards provided for added convenience. Would definitely recommend.\"",,,
3021446,19464414,2014-09-13,3030645,Megan & Jariel,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Nina's and Mike's apartment in September. Their place was conveniently located next to the T and only five stops from Back bay. The area was very friendly and safe, whether you arrive day or night, we had no issues."
The apartment was large and clean,plus Nina and mike had bagels,milk,fruit for breakfast. Our room had plenty of space and the beds were decent. The room can get very bright in the morning,so if you prefer to sleep in a dark room,it's best to bring a sleeping masks.
"All in all it was a great experience. \"",,,,,
3021446,19595231,2014-09-15,6015354,Brenda,AREA:  The private room is in the Jamaica Plains area of Boston. It's about 44 minutes by transit from Logan Airport and 25 minutes to the Boston Commons area of Boston. The area was quiet and quaint. There are cure cafes around and Whole Foods.  The private room is about a 2 minute walk to the orange T line.
HOSTS: Nick and Nina are very nice people. There were about to greet me earlier than the normal 6pm check in time. They made their home very open and available for usage.,,,,,
PRIVATE ROOM: The room is very spacious and bright. There is plenty of room for two people. There is a private bathroom for use. I was gone for most of the day so I have no idea if Nick & Nina are around much... my only contact with them were right before I left... they were kind enough to allow late check out.,,,,,
"Recommend! \"",,,,,
3021446,19880507,2014-09-20,19718260,Anna,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay in Nina and Mike's flat. The room and private bathroom are a good size and very clean. The neighbourhood is very nice and quiet, with a few restaurants nearby and very convenient for getting in to the centre of Boston. The bagels and scones for breakfast were a very appreciated (and tasty) addition. Nina and Mike are clearly very experienced Airbnb hosts, and they provided lots of information which we found really useful.  The room let in a lot of light, which made it bright and airy but did occasionally wake us up quite early."
3021446,20193183,2014-09-25,15200549,Carrie,"I had a delightful stay at Nina and Mike's home. They were friendly and helpful with information about getting around. In my charming room they provided a great map and book about Boston, as well as water, Charlie card, and pen. My room was  clean and bright with a comfortable bed. It was also nice to have a private bath with soap, shampoo and hair dryer. This Air BnB was right next to the Stony Brooke orange line subway stop and a short walk to the Forest Hills location where all the buses stop. I felt safe and comfortable."
3021446,20495545,2014-09-30,4425893,Janet,When we arrived on Saturday neither Nina nor Mike was there.  We had to use a lock box to get the keys.  Nina asked us to say we were friends visiting if any neighbors asked.  It made me feel uncomfortable because we didn't even know their last names and she was asking us to be untruthful.
We were able to park on the street very close to the apartment,but had to be sure to leave on Monday before 8am because the street sweeper was coming and the car would be towed if it was still there.,,,,
It was a walk to get to restaurants,but there were lots to choose from and there was a Whole Foods to buy any food or snacks.,,,,
We went to Fenway Park for a Yankees/Red Sox game.  We took a taxi to get there and it only cost $12 plus tip.,,,,,
We were told there would be bagels in the freezer for breakfast,we could not find any.  There was a french press coffee pot to be used to make morning coffee,but no instructions.  Not everyone is familiar with them.  We had to (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) it to find out.,,,
The dish washer was full of dirty dishes and the dish drainer was overflowing with clean ones so I left dirty coffee cups in the sink even though we were asked to clean up after ourselves.  I did run the dishwasher but did not attempt to put anything away.,,,,,
The bottom of the bath tub was not skid resistant.  When I took my shower,I slipped,but did not fall.  When Dean showered he slipped and fell pulling the shower rod down and landing on the floor.  Fortunately he did not injure himself,but he has 2 knee replacements and he was lucky.  That tub is dangerous.,,
Names of restaurants they recommended were left for us,but no addresses.  We had to look them up on our computer.  What would someone do if they did not come prepared?  Not everyone has a smart phone.,,,,
We never met Nina. Both Nina and Mike returned later on Sunday,"but Nina was not feeling well so was in her bedroom when we got there after going to Fenway Park and dinner.  Our only knowledge of her was in e-mails.  We did talk with Mike.   \"",,,,
3021446,20609506,2014-10-02,19916441,Susanne,The apartment is located in a very good area to explore Boston. The Orange 'T' Line stop 'Stony Brook' is a 2 minute walk away and connects you with the City Center in less than 15 minutes. We enjoyed the Jamaica Plains neighbourhood with all the restaurants and bars on Centre Street. There's sufficient parking around as well and we felt leaving the car on the street was very safe.
We just met Mike briefly,Nina not at all,which we didn't mind because they left basically all necessary information on a print-out in the room,including two 'Charlie-Cards' to get cheaper fares for public transport.,,
The room itself was clean,"and you get a private bathroom which is a nice touch. \"",,,,
3021446,20838960,2014-10-06,20571889,John,Nina's apartment is exactly as described.  It's clean and comfortable and our bedroom and separate bathroom were ideal for us. The apartment is located in a nice neighbourhood - very handy for the T to go downtown and also for local restaurants and stores. Nina and Mike made us feel welcome and were helpful but unobtrusive. We stayed two nights and would happily go back if visiting Boston again.  John & Ros
3021446,21038294,2014-10-10,20869850,Lin,The stay at Mike's place was very pleasant. My boyfriend and I went to Boston for my birthday and Mike even bought us a cake! The place is very clean and the location is very convenient. It was very easy for us to take the T downtown and do some exploring. Sam Adams Brewery is only a few blocks away! Mike also gave us recommendations to some restaurants in back bay which turn out to be really great! we enjoyed our stay in their place and loved Boston!

3021446,21787184,2014-10-24,21332730,Mary,"This was a bit like subletting an apartment for a few days.  We had the place to ourselves after we checked in.  They supplied bagels and yogurt, we bought milk, cereal, and fruit.  The place was generally nice if a bit cold -- luckily they provided a comforter to keep us warm at night.  The sheets and pillows were a bit old, but ok.  It was close to the T and to Whole Foods.  (The downside of that was it was noisy during rush hours.)   Generally an ok place."
3021446,21941243,2014-10-27,18741661,Venkata,"House and Room met expectations as advertised. Did not interact much with host, since we ourselves were very busy. Very close to Stony Brook T station. Did not feel dangerous even though we arrived at 11pm with luggage using the T. Bathroom was not attached to Bedroom, but was private in the sense that Hosts did not use it, but had to walk through common areas from room to bathroom. Towels and Linens were provided and were clean."

3021446,22145115,2014-10-31,21456010,Darwin,"Nina was welcoming and gave us recommendations on places to eat and areas to stay away from at night (although the nearby park seemed quite safe for running). The house apartment was great, the room was clean, and the amenities and conditions matched the description. Having our own bathroom was great too, with complimentary soap and shampoo. She also provided complimentary milk, frozen bagels and cream cheese (although you have to microwave the bagels or they defrost rock hard in the oven). We also were provided an area of the fridge to store our food. Internet was reliable and quick enough to stream movies. Nina seemed to like the living room windows left open and still walked around in shorts and a tank top, but it got a bit cold for us spoiled Californians and we layered up at night. Convenient location near the metro line, and Nina provided some Fastpass cards for us to refill and use while there."
"Overall an enjoyable experience; I would stay again.\"",,,,,
3021446,22359655,2014-11-04,21006546,Ross,"This was our first experience with airbnb and really didn't know what to expect.  The bedroom and bath were neat, clean, and. comfortable.   Street parking was plentiful.  The bedroom was on the corner of the block so there was some street noise either late at night or early in the AM, but then it was Halloween."
Our hosts were friendly and quiet and helpful.  They made us feel comfortable sharing their home.  Even Henry seemed to like us.,,,,,
All in all it was a good experience.,,,,,

3021446,22589648,2014-11-10,21896808,Julia,"This was my first trip on airbnb and I was very nervous about it. My boyfriend and I wanted to stay in a safe, picturesque neighborhood that was close to the city. Nina was very accommodating, as our flight was a red eye and we were able to check in early. The room, bathroom, living room, and kitchen are exactly like the pictures. The T stop is a two minute walk away, and the Sam Adams brewery is a five minute walk away. Jamaica Plain is a beautiful neighborhood, just a fifteen to twenty minute ride to the city on the T. The cafes and restaurants a short walk away. If you have any questions where to eat in the city, feel free to ask Nina. She gave us some really yummy recommendations. The bed was was comfortable, the water in the shower was warm, and the room was fairly large. We had bagels every morning we were there, which was very nice of them to do. Just eat and go, don't have to worry about grabbing breakfast elsewhere. If you're looking for a place close to it all without being directly in the city, then this place is for you!"
3021446,22746551,2014-11-13,23216244,Alexa,Nina and Mike were extremely gracious hosts who are clearly seasoned Airbnbers. The process from booking to checking out was seamless. The private room (king-size bed!) and private bathroom are clean and spacious. Their place is a block from the orange line and a nice bike path and Whole Foods and a Hubway bike share station are just a few blocks away. Perfect place to stay- we will absolutely stay here again if we return to Boston!
3021446,23271987,2014-11-27,22857125,Gareth,Nina and Mike were great hosts. They have a lovely place in a nice neighbourhood. We didn't see a great deal of them (we were out a lot) but when we did they were willing to advise us on Boston and also printed off some Boston Celtic tickets for us.
3021446,29291903,2015-04-06,28517793,Andrea,"Mike and Nina were good hosts, even though we had the place to ourselves most of the weekend as they were out of town.  Mike showed us around the place when we arrived and gave us recommendations of nearby restaurants.  We tried a few places in Jamaica Plains that were very tasty.  We also went to the nearby Whole Foods to pick up some food for breakfast.  Their place is very convenient, less than a 5 min walk to the Stony Brook T stop, which is only about 8 stops to downtown Boston.  Also, their puppy, Teddy, is so adorable and friendly.  I loved having him around for a day!"

They were very flexible when we were having some check-in punctuality issues, gave us a quick tour around their apartment when we got there, and were just great hosts in general. Their apartment was very clean, the bedroom has a big closet, the bed is comfortable, and the private bathroom is well lit, spacious, and well taken care of. Jamaica Plain seems like a really cool neighborhood and their place is just a block from the Orange Line T stop, which Steph and I used a lot.

3021446,31397754,2015-05-04,1094297,Navin,I had an outstanding experience at Nina and Mike's place and highly recommend it to all! Their place will likely be my first choice if I visit Boston again.
Nina and Mike are incredibly warm and friendly hosts. I felt comfortable from the first moment I checked in. I really enjoyed getting to chat with them both in the lounge for a little at the end of a day of exploring the city.,,,,,
The place is beautiful and clean. Nina and Mike have clearly put a lot of thought into making their guests' stay as easy as possible. For instance,they had a rechargeable subway card ready in the room when I arrived,solving the first puzzle I usually face when visiting a new city. Another example is how they have clearly labeled the shelves and cabinets in their kitchen,saving me lots of confusion when trying to find or put away things.,,
"Also Teddy is absolutely adorable.\"",,,,,

The room we stayed in was exactly what is depicted in the pictures; clean, light, with a large and comfortable bed, and enough storage space."
Moreover,you are allowed to use the fridge to store your groceries. Nina provided us with bagels,and we were able to use anything on the airbnb shelf (in our case yoghurt,milk,coffee and some granola bare). We were pleasantly surpised! Also,Nina provided us with useful suggestions for places to eat or to see in Boston and Cambridge. She provided us with two charlie cards (public transportation cards) we could use during our stay. You only need to top them up before they're ready for use. With these cards your fares are lower than single tickets. The house is only a block away from Stony Brook T-station. The metro trains there takes you directly to Boston city centre in approximately 20-25 minutes.

I was up and out of the apartment well before the hosts."

Greeted on arrival and explained the layout, keys, nearby food and travel options, and just a nice couple all around.  Communication was good.  Teddy the dog is a friendly little guy."

The property is located in a charming residential neighborhood, and it is only steps away from the subway station. The bedroom and washroom are very clean and spacious. Bed is big and comfortable. I am very happy with the decision of staying with them rather than staying in a hotel!"
3021446,37391592,2015-07-06,36672614,Hye Jee,"Nina and Mike were very kind hosts, making sure my sister and I found everything we needed. As we stayed over the weekend of 4th of July, they recommended us to go see the fireworks and we surely enjoyed it! Their house is in a beautiful neighbourhood with very easy access to the subway, making it super easy to get to places. They also provided us with Charliecards making it even more convenient! And of course, their dog Teddy is the sweetest, so we'll definitely be going back if we ever visit Boston again."

On a vraiment l'impression de déranger, en particulier nina qui dit rarement bonjour. Mike est juste poli. Ils ne font aucun effort pour nous accueillir et que nous aussi on se sente bien. Leur appartement n'est pas du tout fidèle à l'annonce et aux commentaires des autres voyageurs. Le salon et la cuisine sont sales et en désordre. Nous n'avons pas osé cuisiner vu l'état de saleté des plaques de cuisson et l'encombrement présent autour. C'est  un défi de réussir à s'asseoir sur le canapé. Il est recouvert de draps de protection qui ne sont pas accueillants car le chien s'y repose et Nina y est régulièrement allongée pour regarder ses séries."
La climatisation tourne à fond et Nina refuse d'augmenter la température ou de l'éteindre.,,,,,
L'appartement est très bruyant. Il n'y a pas de rideaux pour la lumière,on est réveillé dès 6:00 du matin.,,,,
La seule chose fidèle à la description est la proximité des transports en commun.,,,,,

"\"",,,,,
3021446,51151067,2015-10-18,31551906,Mary,"Nina's place is in a GREAT location/neighborhood about 2 minutes from the T.  The Jamaica Plain neighborhood reminded us so much of NW Portland, a neighborhood we love at home that's filled with beautiful old Victorians and a lot of walkability.  We felt very safe in this neighborhood, regardless of time of day. Navigating to the apartment was easy, and check in was quick and informative."
The room and bathroom were very clean and as described; the shower had excellent water pressure and was always nice and hot - this was a welcome retreat after long days of tourism!  Her husband Mike was especially welcoming and emphasized that we were welcome to the common areas of the apartment as well as several breakfast options; he showed us where to find bagels and cream cheese,cereal,oatmeal and toast; they also had milk specifically for airbnb guests. We took advantage of the breakfast 1 of 3 mornings we were there,mainly because the bed was so comfortable that by the time we got up we wanted to get out the door and on to explore the city!,,
There was a helpful information sheet in the room with restaurant recommendations and such. We walked to Chilacates,a Mexican restaurant that was delicious and cheap. The owner of the restaurant was really nice,welcoming and chatted with us quite a bit. There were also phone chargers in the room for iPhone and I think for a Samsung galaxy (it would've fit my galaxy,I have no idea if this is a standardized plug for other android phones though!).,,
The only constructive feedback I have is to include another blanket in the room,either on the bed or in the closet. I woke up really cold a couple of times but didn't feel it was worth waking up the hosts for a blanket at that hour!,,,,
Checkout was easy,and they let us leave our luggage there while we went to a nearby Saturday market and had the most amazing bagels for breakfast,at Mike's recommendation. Overall,this was a great stay and I have no reservations recommending staying with Nina,Mike and their sweet dog Teddy!,
This was our 3rd airbnb stay,but our first staying in a private room in a shared space. I was a bit nervous about it,"but this was a great experience and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if I'm back in Boston soon.\"",,,

Bathroom is clean and private for guest.  Mike, Nina and Teddy (a cutie little puppy) are very friendly. Mike went to pick us up at the airport at the first day because we arrived late night that made us feel very appreciated. We would recommend who will visit Boston to stay in Mike and Nina."

They not only provided coffee and breakfast items, but also offered suggestions for nearby eateries and tips about the community. They also suggested a great place to get bagels - I've had a lot of bagels in my day and these were literally the best bagels I have ever had. The bedroom and private bathroom were perfectly sized, very clean and comfortable. Their place is just a minute away from the T, which is perfect for commuting around the city. I'd recommend their place to anyone visiting Boston!"

They are clearly seasoned hosts who have thought of everything to make their guests comfortable.  The bedroom is spacious, bright, and stocked with guidebooks for Boston.  They include a Charlie Card you can use for the nearby T stop which was super helpful. The location is great with stores and excellent restaurants all within easy walking distance. The private bathroom is big, clean, and stocked with fresh towels and yummy shampoos.  We didn't use the kitchen much, but got a full tour and there is plenty of room in the refrigerator to store food along with small snacks like yogurt and cheese you can help yourself to.  Both were kind and helpful hosts and Teddy sure makes the stay extra special!   Highly recommend!"

I was nervous about staying in a house with strangers, but quickly got over that. We didn't even see each other after the initial check in but I'm sure if we really needed something they would've been there. They gave us advice on where to go and what to do since it was our first time in Boston. Definitely a great experience! Thanks guys!"

Mike and Nina texted all the info about how to get into the city from the airport and on to Stony Brook up-front so we'd know where to go at the airport.  Mike greeted us at the metro station which is really right around the corner from the place. The neighborhood is really nice, quiet enough to sleep in if you have to and sufficiently lively to find a number of recommendable places to eat and drink within walking distance. In the clean apartment you get everything you need, a private bathroom, (guide)books, charges, wifi, breakfast and open-minded hosts that'll provide you with tips and recommendations. We even got to stroke the dog :-). All in all if you don't mind a quick train ride to get downtown look no further..."

Mike showed me to the room (which was large and lovely) and explained all the details (wifi, guidebooks, umbrella, towels, etc.). There's a separate (spacious) bathroom for guests (AMAZING) with basic toiletries and a hair dryer. The kitchen has coffee, tea, snacks and drinks set aside for guests as well.

400067,8487254,2013-11-02,9394333,Katharina,The room as well as the apartment itself were indeed very spacious. The place was clean and the bed comfartable. You can get to the city centre easily by bus and train.
"ToRena is a warm and friendly person. She was always willing to help and very understanding. She is a lovely host.\"",,,,,
400067,11778481,2014-04-14,1267648,Gregory,"TeRena was very responsive, nice and accommodating."
400067,12019230,2014-04-21,13762407,Adisha,"ToRena's place is neat, clean and nice. It is a quiet residential neighborhood with very nice hosts. She and her husband were very helpful in making my stay comfortable and easy. I loved the sweets she put outside the kitchen for everyone. The fridge and kitchen are well stacked with things that you may need. They provided me an extra blanket when asked. They also lent me there iPhone charger during my stay which helped me stay connected. The place is a little far from the main tourist places, but there is connectivity through bus and they guided me well on the right stops and buses to take. Overall it was nice staying there."
400067,12408940,2014-05-01,14064686,Kleber,"E point is ToRena and her husband Cabral are very kind. I stay with then for 10 days. They are very correct and give me all that I need. When I arrived ToRena show me a house manual (with all house rules) ad  guide (with some restaurants  flyers, laundry and transport directions).  It is a big house and the room is very large and comfortable. If you think in stay some days in Boston, I sincerely recommend ToRena's house."
400067,13089038,2014-05-19,13167801,Lilia,ToRena is a kind and lovely person.
I planned my arrival according to the check in time which is stated for 3pm. But I had to wait for one hour outside and arrived late to my first conference that day. But since it was her graduation I guess that is okay ;) (Congratulations!! btw) The public transportation is very unreliable in the afternoon. My bus was 20 minutes late.,,,,,
"With my European mindset I might be preoccupied but I felt very uncomfortable in the neighborhood since I have been insulted as a \"\"bitch\"\" 10 minutes after I left the subway in that area because I didn't respond to two strangers asking me \"\"Hey beautiful","what's going on?\"\" :D So please (!) if you are not familiar with Boston check out the area online first! I didn't have other bad experience than that though (but maybe also because someone was dropping me off and picking me up by car).",,,,
Since I was very busy at UMess the whole time I really enjoyed how uncomplicated ToRena was. When I left,I removed the bedsheets,made sure that everything was nice and just left the keys on the desk.,,,
The apartment was very spacious indeed! I liked the room a lot. It was clean and the bed was very comfortable.,,,,,
However the bathroom and especially the kitchen would need a bit of cleaning... And you shouldn't be afraid of insects like ants and centipedes  :D,,,,,
But in the morning you wake up to the beautiful sound of a lot of singing birds which I liked a lot.,,,,,
You can not lock your room. I lived with 3 other guys together for three days whom I just heard but never met and therefore it feels weird if you leave the apartment with all your stuff without being able to lock your room.,,,,,
In general it was a nice stay for a short time. If you are picky,"busy in Boston and stay longer than a couple of days I would recommend something closer to the city. \"",,,,
400067,13712254,2014-06-02,15912626,Peter,I really liked the accommodations. The location is also within a very short walking distance to the Four Corners / Geneva station and so really close to downtown. I also liked the breakfast and the attention received. High recommend.
400067,14245871,2014-06-15,15993436,Erich J,The place was wonderful and wonderfully quiet.
400067,14799423,2014-06-26,16902177,Stephanie,"I had a very nice experience staying with ToRena.  She was hospitable, helpful, and checked in with me to make sure my stay was enjoyable.  The neighborhood was not ideal but I ultimately felt safe in the apartment.  The rooms were comfortable but were pretty hot, as there was no air conditioning; however, I did have access to fans.  Overall, I would certainly recommend this listing!!  Thank you for hospitality, ToRena!"
400067,17866640,2014-08-18,18903577,Yanbing,"Rena was very nice, and I enjoyed staying there. The place is close to bus stops, and easy to travel to downtown. I have my own private place, which was very nice.  I was very appreciated that Rena also provided breakfast. Even though during my staying there, the bathroom was under repair, so I need to go downstairs to take a shower. It was a little bit inconvenient. But before I left, the bathroom was ready to use."
Anyway,I enjoyed staying there. Thank you,"Rena.\"",,,
400067,18823313,2014-09-01,19627961,Yiming,I've experienced a wonderful time in this house with Torena and Cabral. They showed me great hospitality and help me get adapt to the city in the past 10 days.
The house is located in a quiet street,and therefore is an ideal place to live in. All the rooms are pretty clean. Torena and Cabral have prepared almost all of the necessities for me so that I did not need to buy them the first day I arrived. That's greatly helpful especially for a student who came to the city for the first time.,,,,
It's also convenient for me to get access to facilities nearby. There are restaurants,markets,laundries within 5 minutes walk. What's more,the house is pretty close to the Franklin Park,where you could go jogging and have a picnic or bbq.,
They also helped me to explore the city a lot. Although the house is not at the downtown,it is quite convenient to take a bus there. Torena and Cabral prepared detailed transportation information for all the guests.,,,,
All in all,"I've enjoyed this period of time living with them and would greatly recommend this house for my friends.\"",,,,
400067,23327312,2014-11-29,21266566,Clib,"Host Torena was excellent. anything i asked for, she and her husband Cabral were readily available to assist. They dont invade your space either.Excellent time there. Quiet neighborhood and great area to get away from the hustle and bustle. Transport to downtown wasn't that difficult once you understand where you need to go:and the drivers were also kind to me. Really enjoyed my 5 nights there and wish it was longer. Certainly recommend this listing to anyone visiting, and I will be sure to visit again."
400067,25679244,2015-01-23,23091909,Ugo,"ToRena and her husband are great hosts! They did everything to help me and make my stay pleasant. The room and the living area are clean and spacious. The house is in a quiet neighborhood, close to transports."
400067,46787475,2015-09-13,38601432,Rouhollah,I think ToRena is a great host.  My flight got delayed and I arrived pretty late. But ToRena was patient and he opened his house to me.  The house was pretty clean.  The room was a little bit hot but the bed was very comfy.
400067,50296183,2015-10-11,1688872,Heidi,"It was simple and had good access to the commuter rail station and the buses. Laundromat was just around the corner, which was great as well. Kitchen is well stocked and sometimes if all three rooms were taken there was a bit of a joust for freezer and fridge space but it's to be expected."
400067,51636742,2015-10-22,45213275,Alexandra,"Room as described, with adjacent kitchen and bathroom. Clean, tidy, on the top floor of a large house. ToRena waited up for me to arrive (even though it was well after midnight before I came) and was very friendly when I arrived."
Good,strong shower and no problems with hot water. Wifi access easily available.,,,,
The only thing is this particular room (of the three available) is adjacent to the breakfast area - consider one of the other rooms,which are not adjacent if you are a light sleeper and wish to have a lie in.,,,,
"Overground station within walking distance (although trains not very frequent). Get a taxi from the airport when you first arrive - not very expensive and saves the hassle of navigating the trains/buses.\"",,,,,
400067,54276595,2015-11-17,45395024,Donato,The host was extremely kind and welcoming. A veritable home from home!
3905508,30743407,2015-04-26,31565241,Celia,Margaret was an absolutely lovely host. The private apartment was exactly as listed and very charming.   I especially loved the big kitchen with lots of cooking utensils. We were able to cook a lovely dinner and had everything we needed. The unit was quiet and well insulated. I enjoyed my stay very much and highly recommend this place.
3905508,33377549,2015-05-27,24167640,Adam,"We stayed with Margaret and her husband for 3 weeks and couldn't be more pleased.  She was very accommodating and made us feel at home.  She was very responsive via text and helped us in our transition to a new city.  The place was roomy and private, with a comfy bed too.  I would stay with her again anytime."
3905508,37152203,2015-07-05,25038659,Cyndee,"Margaret provides a great 2nd floor apartment w/beautiful garden patio and deck for eating/relaxing! Very clean and modern apt w/kitchen, full bath and ceiling fans in kitchen & bedroom. Easy city transportation access we used every day. Highly recommend for your next Boston visit!"
3905508,38519525,2015-07-16,24718311,Walter,"We enjoyed our 4 night stay in Margarets apartment.  It was spotless and well equipped, including some yogurt, fruit, granola and coffee in the fridge.  Working a few days, partially from the private balcony over looking the little green oasis out back was a bonus.  I recommend a walk down to the Dogwood for a brick oven fired pizza, right across the street from the subway station."
3905508,39414719,2015-07-23,2497911,Suzanne,"Lovely friendly welcome.  Margaret met us at the door and showed us where things were in the apartment, including some delicious extras in the fridge.  The apartment was clean, bright, pleasant, spacious, well equipped kitchen, lovely linens - everything we needed to be more-than-comfortable.  No AC but (though it was in high 80's) the fans kept us comfy and windows let in cooler air in the evenings.  It was about a 20 min. walk to the  trains but a delightful neighbourhood to walk through and worth the walk (if only not to have to take a car into Boston!).  The walk added to our enjoyment of the area.  This was Airbnb at it's best.  Lovely hosts, lovely home, lovely stay.  THANK YOU."
3905508,41108749,2015-08-04,639509,Connor & Constance,"Margaret greeted us at 11pm. The space is .9 miles from the Orange line T station which is a nice walk through mostly quiet residential area.  That location is key to a quiet escape from city while allowing easy access to city. the decor is eclectic and the space is in excellent condition.  Fresh flowers in a vase were on the dining table on the deck . The fridge was stocked with yogurts, waters, butter and jam as well as the usual coffee and tea.  Fresh bread was offered too. I used maps and museum info to get around and plan my day.  I really enjoyed the quiet neighborhood and the garden space."
3905508,46697736,2015-09-13,579269,Roberta,"We stay at Mocky and Brad's home for a month and we could not find a better place where to stay in Boston. The apartment is very nice and super-well equipped, with a nice terrace and a garden. There is everything you could need."
The location is just perfect in a very nice and secure neighborhood. In about 40' downtown Boston could be reached by metro and a car is not needed to move around.,,,,,
Last but not least,Mocky and Brad are very kind hosts. We have really become good friends during our stay and we hope to be able to exchange their hospitality when they will come to see us in Italy.,,,,
"It has been a real pleasure to stay with them. \"",,,,,
3905508,50485554,2015-10-12,43625358,Roger,"\"Margaret made our three-night stay a very relaxed, pleasant experience. We appreciated the spaciousness of the kitchen and bath area along with the comfortable bed. Whether it was coffee/fresh fruit in the refrigerator or an extra blanket in the closet, Margaret made sure we had what we needed for a \"\"home away from home\"\".\""
3905508,52728450,2015-11-01,4195583,Mary,"Margaret is a wonderful host. She met us upon arrival, showed us the essentials and was available when contacted. The apartment is in a lovely area of Boston and close to interesting shops and restaurants. The space is plenty big for two people and Margaret provided breakfast items to make us feel welcome."
3905508,66211621,2016-03-20,21837579,Alice,"Margaret was great in communicating with me via email and text.  She met me at the house the minute we stepped out of the car.  The apartment is spacious, clean and comfortable and she even put some breakfast items in the fridge!"
3905508,68992326,2016-04-08,50393691,Philip,"Margaret was waiting for us on the sidewalk when we arrived at about 9:00pm, and immediately made us feel welcome. We discovered a nice selection of food in the cupboards and the fridge that allowed us to just relax at home rather than rushing out to find a place to buy food."
"The apartment is even more lovely and appealing than it appeared in the photographs on the web site. The title that Margaret uses (\"\"Home Away from Home\"\") is perfectly appropriate. The rooms are beautifully furnished",with bookshelves full of interesting books,and interesting art on the walls. When we were out for the day,"we thought of returning \"\"home\"\" for the evening.",,
The neighbourhood is very pleasant. It is about a 5 minute drive from the Forest Hills subway station,or a interesting 20 minute walk.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
3905508,70686032,2016-04-19,10943941,Jim,Margaret made us feel welcome the second we arrived welcoming us and showing us around the apartment. The apartment was clean and  and had everything we needed to feel at home. The neighborhood was quiet and beautiful. It was one of the best Airbnb experiences I've had!
3905508,71525417,2016-04-25,14694561,Ellen,The gracious next door neighbor greeted us and showed us around.  The apt was clean and roomy.  Personal touches included food and most important coffee!  I will be happy to stay here again.
3905508,73101512,2016-05-06,42615723,Emily,"Margaret was a very gracious host -- the place was peaceful and clean, in a cute neighborhood, and the breakfast snacks she provided were so thoughtful! Would definitely stay here again."
3905508,74098075,2016-05-13,44015831,Bruce,"We had a lovely time at Margaret's home. She was engaging while providing our privacy. Her backyard, from her porch, provided a liason with nature after a intense day of vacationing allowing us to both unwind and prepare for our next adventure. Her unit was comfortable, had a good bed, really great shower and her homemade Raspberry jam was outstanding. Definitely a repeat visit is in order."
3905508,74952068,2016-05-17,9807669,Beatrice,"We loved Margaret's beautiful apartment! It's a calm and luxurious oasis after a busy day of sightseeing or, in our case, graduation festivities. From the small details: the fresh breakfast loaf, the excellent shower, the raspberry jam, to the large ones: the beautiful garden, full kitchen, and comfortable, quiet bedroom with excellent bedding and towels, Margaret has thought about her guests' needs. Margaret met us at arrival and  showed us around  the  apartment. She readily answered our text queries. The apt is in a quiet, safe neighborhood. It has easy street parking and is close to shopping. It was plenty large for a couple and our 23-year-old son. We found this one of the top two airbnb sites we've rented (the other is noted as such by airbnb) and we would gladly return."
3905508,76641083,2016-05-28,7199113,Sandrine,Margaret et Bradley sont des hôtes fantastiques ! Très amicaux et prévenants.
3905508,77983115,2016-06-04,65773578,Michael,"Everything was great, Margaret met us later in the evening and showed us the apartment. She even provided fresh fruit and yogurt in the fridge. Neighborhood was quiet and a short walk to the orange line."
3905508,78916004,2016-06-10,8526538,Annat,I was surprised when I arrived - the photos in the site didn't do justice to this beautiful place. Apart from that it fit the description fully.
The neighborhood and garden are green,pleasant and quiet.,,,,
It's really nice to just sit and relax in the porch.,,,,,
I enjoyed walking in the neighborhood and loved the Forest Hills cemetery!,,,,,
The apartment itself is well organized,well equipped,very spacious and spotless clean!,,,
For me the kitchen is important and it is fully and generously equipped. What I didn't expect was the snacks,milk,coffee/tea,fruit in the fridge and more - which felt so thoughtful and welcoming especially since I had arrived after a long journey.,,
The bathroom is fully and generously equipped as well,there are also umbrellas for use,brochures with helpful information about Boston and more.,,,
Last but not least,Margaret was a great host - warmhearted,helpful,caring and super generous. Hospitality at its best.,,
I arrived very early in Boston and Margaret agreed that I check in much earlier,she's very accessible and responsive in case of need,easy and pleasant to communicate with.,,,
It was a pleasure to be her guest.,,,,,
Bottom line,"'Home away from Home' is a very appropriate name :)\"",,,,
3905508,80362094,2016-06-17,3363783,Anette,"I communicated very well with Margaret before and during my stay. Unfortunately, I did not get to meet Margaret and Brian in person as I was arriving much later than my friend. However, he reported that he had a very pleasant interaction with Brian who was very helpful and gave good recommendations."
The apartment itself was very nice and clean,"with a porch to sit on in the evenings and in a beautiful residential neighborhood. The apartment had all the amenities. I was very happy with our choice.\"",,,,

It was lovely sitting on the back porch looking at the garden.  Margaret and her husband were very gracious, helpful and generous.  When we arrived in the late evening there was yogurt, fruit, milk, and orange juice in the refrigerator so that we didn't have to worry about breakfast in the morning.  Margaret had also left us some snacks and a chocolate bar!  Margaret's house is located in a lovely neighborhood and convenient to public transportation.

The location was great-- just a 20 min. walk from the train station-- and the space itself is clean, beautiful, comfortable, and very much feels like a \"\"home away from home.\"\" There's a great kitchen if you want to cook there and even a lovely porch if you want to sit outside to read or eat or just relax. Margaret went above and beyond what was expected of her. She was very communicative before we came and during my stay. She left us homemade granola"

Although I never met her, she was so easy to reach and incredibly hospitable and considerate.

This house is close to the city and the airport which was convenient. However, the house was pretty run down and didn't feel super safe. The bathroom could have been cleaner."
13325983,84233359,2016-07-06,28861560,Chelsie,This was such a great stay for my husband and I.  Sun Young and her Mom were very accommodating and kind.  I highly recommend their place.  They are also very clean.  I would definitely stay here again.  Everything is as it appears in the images.

13325983,85638913,2016-07-12,4056878,Oliver,"Suns place is located in an apartment complex right next to the harbor in south Boston. Communication was adequate and friendly. Interaction with the host was kept to a minimum. Simple airbnb experience in a basic and neatly clean room. Well worth for exploring Boston without living directly in the center, but with good public transport nearby."

13325983,92406256,2016-08-08,59704472,Sandra,The neighbourhood was nice and the beach and shore were near. We liked our private bathroom. But the walking ways were long. If you keep that in mind it's ok.
13325983,93259627,2016-08-12,25212692,Marcus,"Contact ok, place as described but used bedsheets etc. are a no-go!"
14367134,93227547,2016-08-12,58270400,Mikayla,"Jason seemed very friendly and welcoming in our conversations. We only communicated through text which was fine with me. His apartment is perfect if you will not be spending a lot of time inside. It's small but perfect for someone looking to explore the city because it's so close to many attractions, but far enough away for some peace and quiet. The only issue I had with my stay was that there wasn't air conditioning. It was extremely muggy when I stayed here so it was uncomfortable to sleep and get ready when it's so warm. Jason had multiple fans throughout the studio though. I am not sure if there is wifi, but I wasn't provided with a password. I was there for such a short amount of time that I didn't need it but it would've been nice to know. The stairs up to the lofted bed are somewhat steep so be careful! Also, the door to the apartment does not shut unless it is locked. Just some things I noticed in my short stay! Overall it was a great experience."

The house is very clean and nice. Her dog Luca is a wise ole lady. The location is super convenient to reach from the airport and go into the city.

14178758,91643791,2016-08-06,24841555,Colleen,Theresa was very friendly and helpful with local information. She made us coffee in the morning in her cozy and very clean apartment. We especially enjoyed her sweet dog and that she accommodated one of our very late arrivals.

All the expected amenities were provided, and more. Monica was very prompt and communicative before the trip as I booked only a few hours before my travel. She sent me detailed instructions with a map of how to get to her place which immensely helped as I landed at 2 am and walked to her apartment from the airport! She was very accommodating as she let me leave my luggage in her apartment even after check out hours. Thank you Monica!"

6436334,40698071,2015-08-01,11629040,Jackie,The room is very near the airport - but it was quite hard to find- fortunately somebody helped me.  Sadly when I got there I was unable
to open the key box to open the door to the place and never made it in. It was late at night and while I called and texted the host,I received no response.  I had to leave and find a hotel.   I obviously can't judge the place itself but would suggest that people have a firm arrangement to be let in by the host.,,,,

The first night at Boston is good. And we also booked the last night at her apartment because it is very convenient to logan airport. I think I would like to choose this place when I come to Boston next time.

The room and space was kept very clean and the location was fantastic for site seeing.  The neighborhood felt very safe, we felt safe walking back late at night from the train stations The cafe beside the room was amazing, the food was fresh, local and very healthy, the prices were unbelievably great.

6436334,52021885,2015-10-25,47072839,Yoko,"Great location and price! I had an early flight leaving Boston, so I wanted to stay close to the airport. Monica's place was just a few minutes walk from the rental car complex, where you can take free shuttle to the terminal. The train station is about 10 minutes walk - it could feel longer when it's cold, but when I was there, it was not bad at all. Her cafe is really cute, and had lots of organic, fair-trade vegan items which I totally appreciated. It seems like a nice option in that neighborhood of East Boston. Her room was clean, simple and decent. The living room area was really cute - decorated with antique furniture and lots of folk art. Communication with Monica was prompt, and she seemed very sweet though I did not have much time to interact with her as I was busy out in the city. Overall, I would recommend staying at Monica's! It is so so close to the airport and the train stop to the city, and the price is right - when all the hotels in the city is unbelievably high, and far from the airport."

Though there was no ac,"Monica made our stay as comfortable as possible by providing fans. The quick walk from her place to the rental car area allowed us to \"\"sleep in\"\" an extra hour for our 0600 flight. Her place is also close to the T",which allowed us to spend the previous day all over Boston and the North Shore area. And the neighborhood felt safe enough to walk back late at night and to the airport before sun rise. Can't beat the proximity to the airport at this price!,,,

6436334,89426625,2016-07-28,59362813,Le Ann,"The description was accurate and Monica was lovely.  The rental is literally a 5 minute walk from the car rental complex.  Likewise, from Monica's apartment, I was able to easily access public transportation for my appointment in downtown Boston.  Although there is no ac, I rested well and found the bed and linens comfortable.  After checkout, Monica allowed me to leave my luggage so that I could enjoy a free day in Boston before catching my evening flight home.  It is extremely expensive to stay this close to downtown with access to public transportation and I believe that Monica's room provides a great alternative to those ridiculously high prices."

It is a little out of Boston but that's why I came and the transport links are pretty good. The park is very close by and a lovely place to walk and run.

She willingly offers help whenever she can and gives great tips about activities or places to see in the area. She is also a good cook and she shared food with us. I enjoyed dinner time when we shared food and held interesting conversations with one another. Her house is located in a quiet and safe neighborhood and is close to public transportation and village shops. It is clean, spacious, and comfortable. I especially liked the big and nice bathroom and kitchen. If I return there someday, I would choose to stay in her house again."
3968797,62237980,2016-02-13,12662486,Valentina,"Jennifer is an elegant host and sensitive person. I received her grace and generosity as a gift within my personal memories of Boston. Without mentioning her full mastery in pastry-making, which played a crucial role in defying my winter-y blues and turning it into a sense of sweetness and recovery."
Jennifer's retreat is more of a state of mind than a sheer place,and one that everyone would want to experience at least once in their life. Living there by the time I was conceiving of my book prospectus has been a blessing - as it was having the Arboretum,a tiny gem of a yoga school,and small groceries offering standard as well as Greek and Middle Eastern flavours just a few steps from home. The connection to downtown works perfectly (30 minutes by bus and metro). Once you get to know Roslindale Village and the close-by areas,such as Jamaica Plain,in all likelihood you would start reassessing your mental map and perceiving the Prudential Centre
I had comfort time and food sharing with Jennifer,her son Lucas for a few days,and another housemate. No nonsense or idle talk,but a profound flow of true communication.,,
The bedroom is quiet,beautifully and frugally decorated,with bounty of sunlight; as it is the whole house,which features solid wood sheeting; artistic and architectural creations; underfloor heating in the large,restful bathroom; and a high-tech and fully-equipped kitchen to the delight of absolute beginners as well as seasoned cooks. You will never get tired of standing there,in front of one of the large windows
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.,,,,,

3968797,79993154,2016-06-15,18342733,Marcelo,"The appraisals posted here about Jennifer are nothing short of accurate. Jennifer makes us feel truly at home. She takes real care of her guests, being always generous, loving, tactful, and attentive. Her house is spacious, distinctive, and has a welcoming ambiance. We loved chatting with her over a good meal and wine, and eating the fresh eggs the chickens from her chicken coop laid almost every day. Staying there is like being part of a big family, where she's the center, interacting with other guests, when they are there, and with members of her own family, when they go visit her. Roslindale is a charming village, near an enormous, fantastic park, and many other pleasant points of interest, like Jamaica Plain. Commuting is easy to downtown Boston and although it is a bit further away from other places like Cambridge, the journey is still completely doable. We had a wonderful time there, and we've definitely created memories that will cherish forever."
3968797,80642147,2016-06-19,47405752,Kalindi,"Everything was wonderful. I was so comfortable, and Jennifer was lovely to stay with. The room was as described, and the house was quiet. I will definitely stay here again whenever I can !"
3968797,82025756,2016-06-26,72307441,Beth,"This was our first airB&B experience and we are SOLD. Jennifer was a wonderful and warm host. She contacted us via text (our preferred method) before our arrival to make sure our arrival time was coordinated for our convenience. Our room was bright and cheery. The bed was very, very comfortable. The bathroom was huge with a wonderful shower, two sinks, and great laundry machines that Jen let us use. The Forest Hills (orange line) transit station was a quick few minutes drive and all day parking was only $8 / day.  We could have walked to the station, but knowing we would be in Boston late into the evening and tired from the day, we opted to park there. Jen opens her home up to her guests and every morning we enjoyed coffee in her peaceful screened in back porch. Yes, Jen's neighborhood is quiet and safe with ample street parking. Jen is warm, kind and knowledgeable for the traveler that needs advice getting around Boston. Jen goes above and beyond for her guests and when we come back to Boston we will be staying with Jen again. No doubt of that. Enjoy."
3968797,90027991,2016-07-30,49439868,Abraham,"Jennifer is a great host. She sent us messages before our arrival and gave us directions how to get to her house. The house is spacious and close to public transportation. We had wonderful time staying there. My son loved to play in the backyard, made water bombs, fed chickens and picked up eggs.  Jennifer was very generous and treated us like family. We had some activities together, for example we joined Jennifer and Richard for their motor show in downtown Boston and we had great time having Sushi near Copley Square. Hope you will enjoy this place just like we did!"
3968797,90838992,2016-08-02,78692413,Oscar,"Jennifer was very kind. She even offered to pick us up from the rail stop because she was concerned that carrying our luggage up a hilly street would be a struggle. She was always available, offered us free passes to a museum, even offered us to eat the eggs from the chickens she raised in her back yard."
She also rents 2 other adjacent rooms so there were times we had to wait for the bathroom to be cleared. But it wasn't much of an inconvenience. She lives in a nice quiet neighborhood in a lovely town of Roslindale. We had to take a 10-15min bus ride to the nearest Metro T stop or a $4 Uber ride.,,,,,
Overall it is a great stay considering how expensive it is to lodge in Boston.,,,,,
"People are very nice. Would definitely stay with her again. \"",,,,,
3968797,91856804,2016-08-06,29643183,Cécile,Jennifer est adorable et nous a accueillis malgré notre arrivée tardive. Sa maison est dans un quartier résidentiel calme.
3968797,92666477,2016-08-09,649776,William,Jennifer was accommodating and friendly.   It was a great stay.  We would recommend  to friends.

Sie gab uns jederzeit das Gefühl, willkommen zu sein. Alles in allem ein äußerst angenehmer Aufenthalt. Wir freuen uns schon sehr auf das nächste Mal!"
3968797,97482432,2016-08-27,40909829,Hanbin,"It was a great experience to stay in Jennifer's house as my first-time trip to Boston. The place is located near Forest Hills, which is away from downtown but easy to find by taking subway. It is a nice house and the room is on the 2nd floor."
3968797,97789337,2016-08-28,58336790,Lisa,Jennifer's place was really nice. She welcomed us warmly and helped us with the directions to downtown. Although we had a shared bathroom we didn't have any problems with waiting  times because the other guests left early.
4916260,32605149,2015-05-19,13138595,Ab,A nice place with exceptional location. You can see Fenway park from the window! Tons of restaurants and nightlife near by and easy access to the local metro. There is a grocery store near by and several quick eats right beside the house. It's a 20 minute walk to the 'Copley' area  with all the shops and several attractions. The place could use a little tidying (some boxes and luggage around the house) but all in all a nice place for a Boston weekend. The building lobby and areas near the elevators could a spruce up but that's a bit out of Andree's hands. You also have to watch your head on your way up to the loft bed as it is easy to hit your head on the ceiling.
4916260,35339618,2015-06-17,34852639,Roseanne,"my host was very imformative. met me on time, look time to explain all the info rlated to the workings of the apartment. view and location of the apartment is fantastic!"
4916260,38849653,2015-07-19,34098365,William,"The is a great place to stay if you are visiting Fenway Park.  It couldn't be more convenient.  It is close to the action, so I recommend that you bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper.  The spiral stair case to the bedroom loft is a tight fit, so keep that in mind.  I would certainly stay here again for a Red Sox game or concert."
4916260,52466817,2015-10-29,14328654,Roe,Andree was a great host.  The loft was clean and inviting.  I had never stayed near Fenway before while visiting Boston and I loved the area.  Will definitely stay in her loft again.

4916260,66017340,2016-03-18,25350815,Alexander,"Andree was a great host! She was extremely communicative and easy to work with. We had a few snags with Airbnb, but both Andree and Airbnb were both extremely helpful in remedying the situation. The place is exactly what she listed and said it would be. I would definitely stay there again when I make another trip to Boston."

It's pretty neat to be able to look out the window and see Fenway! There are some good restaurants around, not to mention a giant Target. Easy wall to the T."
4916260,70617056,2016-04-19,44465059,Paul,Andree went out of her way to accommodate us. The room was exactly as described and in a great location. She even offered for us to have a late checkout so we could grab some lunch. If your coming in for a game or the marathon this is the place. Thank you!!
4916260,81433628,2016-06-23,71157687,Michael,Andree was a wonderful host she made us feel welcome. Nice apartment with view of Fenway Park. Easy access to the T and all of Boston. I would stay here again.

Located next to Fenway park, it is also very convenient. Even though she was not available to check me in herself, she arranged to have a friend there when I arrived and made me feel welcomed. I would recommend her listing to anyone wants a good stay in Boston."
4916260,89350396,2016-07-28,85818618,Morgan,First—Andree is awesome! She went through a lot of trouble to get us into the apartment early with a same-day booking. Saved our butts!
Second—the apartment is in the perfect location to experience Boston...literally about 12 feet (!!) from Fenway Park and nearly as close to shopping/restaurants. We were able to attend two Red Sox games during our stay with ease. (Andree even helped us find tickets!),,,,,
Third—we were very pleased with the cleanliness and amenities of the apartment. Very spacious and comfortable loft apartment with full kitchen,sitting and sleeping areas,beautiful high ceilings with lots of natural light,easy-to-work television,phone charger,hair dryer and

We came in for two events at Fenway and this was the perfect place to stay- within walking distance to everything!!!,,,,,
The apartment was cozy and clean. The bed was soft.,,,,,
The only negative feedback I have is that there are so many windows it is hard to sleep in after day break. Luckily I had a sleeping mask with me!,,,,,
"Thanks for everything Andree!\"",,,,,

11905849,69506135,2016-04-11,42644634,Patrick,"This is a perfect location -- very quiet but a short walk to everything in both Back Bay and South End, public transit one block away. It also felt very safe, as there is a locked gate to a courtyard, a second locked door into the building, and then of course the unit door lock. Comfortable bed, nice looking deck (though too cold to use during our stay). Would highly recommend!"

I would have like to see some dish soap and perhaps a small bar of soap in the shower.,,,,,

Brent was responsive, quickly offered alternative unit in the same building for the days when the requested room was not available. Instruction of door code, wifi and others were sent via email a few days in advance. I want to chose Brent's unit for my next trip to Boston."

The apartment was neat,and felt very welcoming. We were a party of four and between the cozy bedroom and the living room,the place although not large,offered comfort. The small kitchen provided everything that we needed for our stay.,,
The nearest metro station is just a few minutes away on foot. The apartment is also very close to many of the city's attractions,easily accessible either by foot or by a short cab ride.,,,,
The place does not offer parking,but since we were there over a weekend,we managed to get a spot for parking on the street for long duration,luckily just in front of the building. On weekdays,there is a two-hour restriction. We were informed that there are other garages not far away from the property.,
I did not meet Brent in person,but he was quick to respond to my messages. He even helped me with a few questions I had about parking.,,,,

10381729,64735524,2016-03-06,22449918,Katie,The space is inexpensive for a reason. David is very nice but the space is about 25 minutes (cab/uber). I didn't end up staying there because it was too far from anything I wanted to see in the city. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is traveling alone. Also there was a chirping fire alarm going off the whole time.

He even tried to tap dance with me! His roommate was nice, polite and quiet. The apartment is neat and has everything you need. It is quite a long commute from the house to downtown Boston (about 40 minutes on bus and subway), so if you're looking to go out a lot, you might want to look for something a little closer to Boston. But this room is very affordable, complete and the wifi is very good! They also fixed all the smoke detectors, so there were no beeping or chirping fire alarms during my stay."

I had a few problems getting in to Boston (I missed my train and wouldn't be arriving till really really late), but he made me feel comfortable. I am sure that me arriving so early in the morning (or late in the night depending on how you look at it) was an inconvenience for him, but he was completely gracious."
And after waking him up so early to get in the apartment,he still took the time to drive to the train station so I could get to my conference the next morning.,,,,
The apartment is not in the city center of Boston,but it is easily accessible by bus and train. I had no problems navigating the public transportation system while there.,,,,
The apartment is clean and comfortable. Large enough that you don't feel cramped. And I never felt that I was in the way of inconveniencing anyone.,,,,,

10381729,81653505,2016-06-24,64061697,Cassandra,David was very welcoming and made me feel at home - house is on the older side but has all the amenities and a nice private room. Only down side is that it is located quite far away from the central city which does require the use of public transport  (which isn't the best service in Boston!)
10381729,82780426,2016-06-29,48714185,Sandra,The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
10381729,84545824,2016-07-07,78467026,Jason,David was a great host. Comfortable bed. Boston was going through a bit of a heat wave and he brought in a window AC unit to help cool the room! Great value. Neighborhood is older and felt quiet and safe. I didn't spend much time in the neighborhood during my visit.
10381729,84652875,2016-07-08,5703547,Hector,David was such a great host and a super conversationalist. We shared a pizza together and discuss life  -- it got deep. What a great host!!!
10381729,85740802,2016-07-13,75648387,Dennis,David is a very gracious host. He was very helpful to me about the train routes and directions of places I wanted to go. I would recommend him very much.
7194793,43326799,2015-08-18,26918876,Jethro,"My stay with Brady was great. Perfect location in the Back Bay area of Boston which is pretty central to everything. The room was very nice and clean. With its own out door patio. Brady and his wife are also extremly friendly, so you get the feel that you are staying at a long time friends home. This is a prime Airbnb room in the Boston area."
7194793,44704855,2015-08-28,27408311,Jinhee,"Brady and Malinda were great! Such kind people. They were very accommodating and quick with their replies. The house is in a great location, making all of Boston easily accessible. I highly recommend staying here!"
7194793,45606696,2015-09-04,810054,Matthew,"My time at Brady's place was great.  It felt like I was staying with friends rather than people I had just met.  The room was very clean and I was afforded everything I would need during my stay there.  The whole apartment is very nice, clean and well set-up. The neighborhood is great and within walking distance of great sites and places to eat.  Overall, my experience at this AirBnB site was well worth it and I would recommend it to anyone looking to spend some quality time in Boston."
7194793,46622211,2015-09-12,18437184,Steffi,"Brady gave me an exact the description how to get easily to the appartment. Their home was very nice, the pictures show perfectly what it looks like. The room was clean, well-prepared with Wifi information and a towel. Whenever I met Brady or his wife Malinda I always had very nice conversations with them. I felt completely comfortable at all times and at home. The area is very quiet, nice and safe, also as a women it was o.k. to walk in the neighborhood when it was dark outside. I would recommend this accommodation without hesitation."
7194793,47493696,2015-09-19,28368000,Allison,Brady's place was beautiful. My trip in Boston was pretty terrible but that was unrelated to their home. I didn't get to meet Brady or his wife but they provided clean linen and towels and I enjoyed the beautiful porch outside. The location is perfect in proximity to where I needed to be and walking distance to the conference center. The building had a great old smell to it like history and cedar. It was easy to get the key and to return it. Thanks for accommodating me!

Pudimos cruzarnos solo un dia con Brady,y nos ayudo mucho en como manejarnos en la ciudad con los transportes,igualmente nos escribimos por la aplicación constantemente por cualquier duda que teníamos,siempre muy amable. Con Malinda no pudimos conocernos pero fue muy atenta con nosotros un día que llovía mucho nos dejo una nota y un paraguas en la mesa. Gracias por abrirnos sus puertas.,,

Highly recommended!!:)"

7194793,52909065,2015-11-02,30984566,Irene Yaxian,The room is on the top floor of a beautiful brownstone building. The apartment location is convenient for us to go most of the tourist attractions. It's a private room and the bed is comfy. Brady and his wife are a very nice couple. They gave us many advice on visiting Boston. We stayed 2 nights in Boston and we had a great time there.

7194793,55724055,2015-12-05,47481192,Katherine,"Everything was really great at Brady and Malinda's. The room was nice and clean, the neighborhood was an easy walking distance to great food and Hynes Convention Center. Both Brady and Malinda were very accommodating. Pictures very accurately show how the home was kept and laid out. I was able to come and go as I needed (which in my case was very helpful since I had strange hours during my stay). I don't think there's anything they can do to improve their listing."

7194793,64798638,2016-03-08,3277262,Abigail,"I had a brilliant time at Brady's place. The old brownstone house is beautiful and Back Bay is lovely. From his apartment I could walk the shops, into the centre of town and up to Harvard, so it was a brilliant pitstop for exploring the city."
The bed was so comfortable and the room was great! Sadly I didn't get to use the lovely little balcony because it was snowing!,,,,,
Brady was super helpful with instructions on how to get there and was constantly in touch throughout the weekend with help and suggestions. He also was happy to let me store my suitcase there while I explored on my final day which was great.,,,,,
I would not hesitate to stay at Brady's place again,"I had an absolutely brilliant trip!\"",,,,

7194793,66512562,2016-03-22,48576097,Michele,"Brady's apartment was the PERFECT place for us to stay during our 3 days in Boston. The location in the Back Bay is unbeatable, just a few blocks from the high end shops and restaurants on Newbury. We spent a good amount of time downtown and either walked (30-40 min) or took an easy 5 min uber. The apartment is both beautiful and comfortable.  The guest room has a lovely balcony that, if weather had permitted, we would definitely have utilized. I highly recommend this apartment to any Airbnb users and would without hesitation stay here again during future visits!"
7194793,67253453,2016-03-27,7419820,Valérie,"Brady's place was perfectly situated and very cosy. We only got to meet him and Malinda at the end of our trip because of conflicting schedules, but they were accommodating throughout, checking up on us periodically to be sure everything was going well. They are a lovely couple with a beautiful apartment and they made us feel right at home."
7194793,68318427,2016-04-04,13915355,Andrew,"Brady was a perfect host - warm, welcoming, and very friendly. The room is nice, clean and spacious. Beacon St. is about as central as it gets in Boston - close to shops, restaurants, cafes, and probably most important of all - Trader Joe's!"
7194793,69136124,2016-04-09,40247638,Mengjie,The place is located in a historic sites. The location is good. The room is clean and cozy. Brady and Malinda are very nice.

The room and the bed were very comfortable.  Brady and Malinda made me feel welcome and were gracious hosts. I  have already recommended their place to several of my colleagues who travel to Boston. The next time I'm in Boston,  I hope I can stay in this beautiful Back Bay brownstone!"
7194793,75351250,2016-05-20,48761219,Vane,"Habernos hospedado en el hogar de Brady y Melinda fue la mejor decisión que tomamos en nuestro viaje a Boston. En primer lugar Brady y Melinda son excelentes personas y grandes anfitriones. Fueron muy amables y nos ayudaron con toda la información que necesitamos para nuestra visita a la ciudad. El departamento es muy acogedor, con una decoración bonita, bien cuidada y agradable. La habitación es muy confortable y luminosa y se ve que sus dueños están atentos a los detalles. El barrio es excelente. Muy seguro y muy bien ubicado para acceder desde él a los mejores restaurantes y paseos turísticos. El check in /out del departamento fue muy sencillo gracias a las indicaciones de Brady quien de una manera muy práctica nos facilitó el proceso. Todo lo que imdica el aviso está reflejado en la realidad. Definitivamente volveríamos a hospedarnos en el hogar de Brady ya que todo lo que hay en él hace que la estadía supere las expectativas.

Their place is beautiful, as you have seen from the pictures shown, and the room was sparkly clean. We even had wifi access in their home. The neighbourhood is safe and is a stone's throw away from the lots of amenities, malls and cafes. I would say it's in the midst of everything. Definitely worth staying!!!"
7194793,79154762,2016-06-11,6424431,Carina,Aardige mensen die we niet veel gezien hebben omdat ze ('s nachts) werkten. We konden keuken en zitkamer gebruiken. De kamer is prettig met een goed bed en een heerlijk balkon. Iets meer ruimte voor onze spullen was fijn geweest.
"De buurt is erg leuk met eettentjes en winkels dichtbij en op looptijd van metro  maar ook van bezienswaardigheden.\"",,,,,
7194793,80502419,2016-06-18,51451272,Emily,"Had a wonderful stay with Brady and Malinda. Our schedules meant that we saw each other mostly as the other was leaving or coming home and vice versa, but they were kind and accomodating, even when my flight was delayed and meant I'd be getting in around 1 in the morning.  The best location in terms of safety and accessibility- plenty to see and do in walking distance, with Cambridge a short (and cheap) uber ride away. Great food and shopping on and around Newbury street, lots of wifi hot spots out and about as well as at home. Felt absolutely spoilt with the bed and blankets, was very comfortable and often drew me in for afternoon naps. Overall a fantastic location and good if you want a more private stay experience."
7194793,81527164,2016-06-23,16791453,Joni,"Brady was great at communicating before and during our stay. The apartment is located in a very nice neighborhood and was in a convenient location to both attractions and restaurants. Both Brady and Malinda were friendly and accommodating during our stay.

Staying in the Back Bay Area allowed us to walk the city and to take in so many experiences.  Brady was on deck for any questions we had and had coffee ready in the morning!  A hearty thank you to our host a d hostess for a very fine Airbnb experience, which included a comfy bed!"

Brady's apartment is in a beautiful old building but with a modern interior. Our room was very clean and comfortable,and Brady and his wife made us feel very welcome - and they gave us some good tips for our trip.,,,,

Great location.,,,,,
Very clean & tastefully done apartment.,,,,,
cons -,,,,,
no elevator. we had a fair amount of luggage & it was a good workout :-) actually the listing clearly mentioned this & it was my oversight in not reading it carefully.,,,,,
parking is a pain in all of Boston,so avoid renting a car unless absolutely necessary. Brady was kind enough to guide us to the nearest public parking.,,,,
I would definitely recommend their place to any one going to boston.,,,,,

77691,324523,2011-06-20,117565,Charles,"Hermina is a gracious host and her house in Dorchester is very comfortable to stay in as well as being convenient to the Red Line of the Boston MBTA. I was put in one of the two basement rooms, which disappointed me at first, since the pictures all seemed to show light and airy rooms on the second floor, but the actual room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. The room had a bathroom/shower just outside, which is shared with the other downstairs guest. There is also a handy washing machine ($1.00) and drier ($1.50) in the shared hallway. The only disadvantages to the downstairs room is that there is not a lot of sunlight coming through the tiny window, and the room is a bit damper than the upstairs part of the house. Breakfasts were hit and miss, as there are often many other guests and eggs and bacon and juice can disappear quickly. However, there was always something to eat and I certainly didn't starve. The wi-fi worked well, so I was able to do my email and check out the weather and other Boston activities. All in all, I'd say it was good value for $55/night in an outer neighborhood in Boston."
77691,329399,2011-06-22,706482,Greg & Denise,"this is a great place for the price, close to the city using the t-rail. We stayed in the basement on a warm night and it stayed cool. The only issue is with an old house you have the creaks of everyone walking, the pipes running with everyone using water. But that was part of the charm of staying in an victorian house in Boston."

She has several units,in the same building.  The one I was in was a basement unit,which was great for July,because Boston was HOT.  The unit was very cool,and had a nice shared bath with the other basement unit.  It had a little kitchenette,loads of space

The neighborhood is pretty neat, but off the beaten path, so if you want to stay in a more touristy part of Boston, go elsewhere. However, if you like authenticity and good Vietnamese food, stay here. Although it is not close to the airport or South Station, it is an extremely convenient ride on the T and a short walk from Fields Corner station. I had no trouble getting there even with my heavy suitcase."

We were put in one of the basement rooms, there was a double bed and a fold out sofa bed, with a shared bathroom with the other basement room. The room was quite dark but suited our needs fine. we were 4 young travelers exploring boston and this was a good place for us, the room was not the best room in the house and some people may be disappointed by it. The house is located just around the corner from the tube station which has good links to downtown boston. Breakfast was included and use of the kitchen was allowed which made eating very cheap."

77691,520165,2011-09-11,805495,Garrett,"For the price you cannot beat this in the Boston area.  Reasonably close to Boston, 45 minutes on T or if you take a cab it's $20 and it still takes about 30 minutes depending on traffic."
Just remember this is an AirBnB stay.  Everything is nice but it is not perfect.  It's better than the Fenway Park Howard Johnson's for quality but it is definitely not a 4 star hotel and the price is appropriately reflected.,,,,,
One issue that we'd like feedback from the host on.  There was no key to the individual rooms.  I had some items I would prefer to keep locked but there wasn't a key available.,,,,,

77691,590801,2011-10-02,237059,Heidi,Don't risk your time and money.  Here is my unbiased review:
This was a misleading experience with bad room condition,worse condition than $20 hostels I've stayed at abroad.  The room location changed twice,and upon arrival at the second confirmed room location,the key we found under the mat (as instructed) did not fit in the door.  Upon calling Hermina (the host),she said that the person might still be occupying the room that was reserved for us (she wasn't sure),and said she had another room for us.  It was not a room
We were confused and disappointed,but didn't complain,being it was late and we were tired and none of the rooms we were promised were available.  We reluctantly slept on the uncomfortable air mattress in the attic,and booked out of there asap in the morning.  I wish there had been an alternative.  For $70,this is nowhere close to the condition I would have expected.  Though it's conflicting that there have been good reviews for this host and location,it's possible no one else has had to sleep in the creepy attic.  So
I have used AirBnB before,and my past experience was by far- much better than this one.  I really enjoy giving great reviews,"and am disheartened to have to report this as a bad one.\"",,,
77691,599957,2011-10-04,1190048,Janusz,The host canceled my reservation 11 days before arrival.
77691,625173,2011-10-13,183917,Jim,"Very inexpensive price and convenient location to central Boston. I would recommend the rooms in the basement/cellar which are 2 larger rooms with kitchenettes and a full bathroom shared between them. There are 4 rooms upstairs which share 1 full bathroom and there is an additional half bath (WC) downstairs next to the kitchen. The attic/loft room is quite large. For those who prefer a room and bathroom which is well cleaned on a daily or so basis, you may want to stay in a hotel."
77691,701296,2011-11-07,107522,Stefania,Unfortunately we didn't know Hermina personally but we spent a nice time in Boston. The house is great and the location is perfect.

77691,1116718,2012-04-12,1903064,Kathrin,"I spent ten days at Hermina's and enjoyed her company and care. Her hospitality really exceeded all my expectations, she shared her dinner with me, took me for a walk on the shorelines and was helpful and generous in many other ways.The house is spacious and beautiful, and so was my room. Commuting downtown and also to the Harvard campus was relatively fast and convenient - the train station is very close by and all  important spots in town can be reached within 30 minutes. I also enjoyed the very relaxed check in policy - my plane arrived quite late in the eveninng, so Hermina just sent me the door code so that I could let myself in at any time."
77691,1259221,2012-05-10,1138376,Carlos,"I was in Boston for interspaced job interviews so i hung at the place for over a week, at the best price in time. Hermina is simply cool, she is friendly w/o being intrusive, she's not a big talker, but has big eyes and a sunny disposition, the house is wellkept,  rather free and trusting. The neighborhood has now a large Vietnamese presence, and if you are up to it, you can meditate at 5:00 am in the Buddhist Center across the street. At nite, the trek from the metro to the inn is comfortable, about 3 blocks, and largely safe, but there are a couple winos on the corner, that warrant being cautious, though not afraid.  The House has beautiful floors, and the rooms vary from large to small, according to space requirements and budget, but they are al clean, comfortable and either cool or warm, as you please. The big plus is the washing, dryer machine.  The kitchen is tea oriented, and there is an abundance of honey, and that description just about says it all. In sum, for its price, there is nothing charmer. Enjoy."
77691,1287195,2012-05-15,2212443,Yangshen,"Hermina is a very nice hostess. Her house is so great and everything is well organized. She provided all we need when we stayed in her place. The house is located in a safe area and it's easy to each red line subway. In a word, I am really enjoy my stay."
77691,1327435,2012-05-22,2051114,Alejandra,"We visit the house in May 2012 with mother and boyfriend. The house is nice and relatively clean. Hermina was a nice host, but she didn't spend too much time in the house because the house was full of visitors. The neighborhood is a little bit scary at the beginning but nothing bad happens there really. The Vietnamese restaurant at the corner is great!  And the subway is close enough.  The rooms were big and clean, and very comfortable. The only problem with our rooms was that it was very close to the bathroom and other visitors woke us up in the middle of the night when they use it.  The other issue was the breakfast (that was included) the second day there was no bread, milk... that might have been also because there were lots of visitors. But overall I think is a good choice for Boston."
77691,1341134,2012-05-24,1569281,Door,"Hermina is very friendly and makes you feel totally welcome in your house. We were only there in the evenings, very comfortable bed and air bed for third guest upon request. Not in the center or very touristy part of Boston, we would recommend going for something bit more central if you want to be in the buzz (takes 15-20 min by subway to South Station). Also, don't expect a clean cut hotel room; you are staying in a house with a personal touch."
77691,1399830,2012-06-02,2223981,Jiang,Hermina is such lovely person I met and make great company with.
I was lucky when she was in weekend she took me to the beach we did walking around,that is just perfect for me.,,,,

77691,1644777,2012-07-06,2341140,Maggie,Hermina has a lovely house. The bedroom we used is big and the bed comfortable. Breakfast is minimal. We met Hermina briefly. Her instructions for reaching the house and accessing the room are good. The neighbourhood was noisy with firecrackers for 4th July.
77691,1661038,2012-07-08,835797,Tim,A great room with convenient transport connections (about 25 minutes on one subway line) to the center of Boston. Hermina's communication before and during our stay made things very easy.
77691,1779324,2012-07-23,2741854,Gianfranco,"We stayed two nights in Hermina's appartment. The bedroom, with shared bathroom, was clean and comfortable enough. Unfortunately, we asked for a three person accomodation but we got one bed only!. We tryed to contact Hermina (that was not in Boston in that period) but we were unsuccessful. So one of us had to sleep on the floor for two nights! Very unseemly!!"

77691,3685151,2013-03-04,4818890,Ingrid,"I stayed in Hermina's house in the first 4 weeks of a longer stay in Boston. Hermina is very nice (she offered dinners several times), the house is big and reasonably clean, and my room -- it must have been room B -- was big and very comfortable. Dorchester, the neighborhood where the house is located, is not the richest (and also not the most expensive) place in greater Boston. In any case, the red line (with the field corner station really close to the house) enables a quick connection to downtown Boston. While I have moved to another place in the meantime (mainly to avoid to commute every day), I would definitely return to Hermina's house for a shorter stay."
77691,3740958,2013-03-10,5266084,John,"I really enjoyed my stay at Hermina's home. There was a brief mix-up with the room at first, but Miller, who helps Hermina out, promptly resolved the issue. I had no difficulties locating the house. It is very pleasant and comfortable, located just a short walk from the train station. The room was a little cool, but there were enough blankets to keep warm. I hope someday to return, and maybe get the chance to meet Hermina in person."
77691,4354551,2013-04-29,2394642,Steffan,"Hermina excels at giving that true Mediterranean warmth and hospitality. Upon entering her home you immediately feel welcome and I just had to take my shoes off at the door because its like coming home to Mamma! The kitchen is filled with delicacies and me and my two sons felt like princes our whole entire stay. Keep up the good work, Hermina!!!"

We were able to leave the car parked near the house while we bounced between downtown, the harbor, Harvard, and Fenway. So convenient and safe that the price was such a steal! Hermina is great and I would recommend this to anyone on a tight budget :)"

77691,6133554,2013-07-31,2837565,Adam,"Did not get to meet host as she was out of town, but she did provide us with people to contact in Boston if needed. Instructions to house were good and got into house OK. We were not told which room we would be staying in - as there are several that she lets out - and had to contact host's friend. When we found our room the door was locked and there was someone asleep in our bed! We arrived after 1pm (which Hermina told us was the check in time) to be told by the woman in our bed that Hermina had said she could have the room until 5pm as she had just worked a night shift!! The lady kindly let us leave our massive backpacks in the room but we had to take all valuables with us. We were not informed of this by the host."
When we came back later that evening,the room had been vacated. The room was nice and spacious and the bed was comfortable,although there was a random mattress leaned up against one of the walls.,,,
We were then woken up at 1.30am by two of the other guests washing and drying their clothes in the machine. As the bathroom - which is where the machines are located - was right next to our room,the noise was extremely loud and we had a lousy night's sleep. I spoke to the girls who apologised,but then kept going!!,,,
Even though the house is next to a police station we did not feel 100% comfortable coming back to the house in the dark because of the neighbourhood and so came home early.,,,,,
"Hermina clearly uses her house as some sort of hostel. We were not expecting this. The sheets and towels were thin and there were dirty sheets on the landing and in the front room. Would not stay here again. \"",,,,,

Except for a young group of inconsiderate people that came in after midnight and all took showers, our stay was comfortable and enjoyable.  I believe Hermina would have been able to take appropriate action if she was home.  Her assistant Christina responded to my text after midnight and was willing to come over and speak to the young group, but I decided to wait it out.

Hermina did the right thing by issuing a partial refund, which I appreciated, given the annoyance of crowding everyone into one room.  The house is very clean and nice.  The neighborhood is a lower income area of Boston, which new visitors to the area might want to be aware of.  We were perfectly comfortable walking around, plus there is a police station right next door."

Hermina was very kind and always help us quickly if we had any questions. We stayed on the second floor of the house and shared a bathroom with 3 other rooms with multiple people in each room, so there were definitely days where we needed to wait to have access with the restroom. Some nights got a little noisy if there were a lot of guests staying at one time.  It is a 5 minute walk to the train and bus stop, less than 15 minutes on the train to downtown where we could transfer if needed. 30 minute train ride to Harvard if you are going that way. We tried to get back to the house before 8 or 9pm because the neighborhood did not seem the most safe, but we never had any trouble. We liked eating at the Vietnamese place close by and there were couple very small convenience stores and a dollar store close by as well. All in all a good deal for a big city like Boston."

Couldn't really make breakfast as I had a hard time finding the oil and there was no milk, but there is a McDonalds very close by.

The house itself is BEAUTIFUL and spacious. The location is perfect. It's right around the block from the Fields Corner Red Line station. On the way,you'll see all sorts of restaurants and a quaint little park. The neighborhood is safe and secure.,,,,
The house is also clean,as Hermina has a personal assistant who stops by the house every day to work and make sure that things are in order. Top notch service! Even if you never see anybody else,you'll have directions for things posted all over the place. The space has access to a living room with cable tv,a full kitchen,with everything from a fridge to a rice cooker... it's just the best.,
There's even a guest book near the front door. You can see that throughout the years Hermina has had literally hundreds of pleased visitors who were so thankful for her excellent hospitality.,,,,,
"Five stars aren't enough! \"",,,,,
77691,12867440,2014-05-12,10572493,Thomas,Hermina's place was fine and the room comfy! There was even breakfast & coffee available. :)

77691,14498160,2014-06-20,114538,Gerardo,easy clean and comfy
77691,14648011,2014-06-23,16592984,Alexis,"The room was clean, and as pictured. The house is conveniently located near the T stop. Hermina was out of the country and our only contact with her was via email but she was very courteous. There was a bit of a snafu the first morning we were there because the keys that were left for our room did not actually work our door, and it took a little over an hour to get in touch with the person who manages the house when Hermina isn't there. Once this was straightened out our stay was enjoyable."
77691,14762978,2014-06-25,1443858,Antoine,"Very nice stay, convenient and clean :) Loved my time in Dorchester thanks to Hermina !!"
77691,15238684,2014-07-05,17167170,Sara,"Great accommodations, good location. Very enjoyable stay."
77691,15366375,2014-07-07,17382346,Siyu,I visited Boston on my own and stayed in Hermina's house for two nights. It was very cozy and beautiful! The neighbourhood is quiet and the house not very far away from the Metro station.
77691,15854575,2014-07-16,18089863,Madlin,"Thanks for an easy and comfortable stay! Though we didn't see Hermina and missed the moment to speak to Donna the contact and answers we're very quick, helpful and kind. The neighboorhood was quiet and serveral supermarkets are right behind the corner. We felt very welcomed and had a pleasent stay! Next time in Boston we'll come back!"
77691,16647357,2014-07-30,14414928,Silvia,Highly recommended accommodation 15 minutes by metro from downtown Boston!
The house is big but cozy and quaint.,,,,,
There are lots of bedrooms but we hardly met the other guests,so privacy is kept.,,,,
Our room was huge,light,clean and nicely furnished and so it's the whole house.,,,
The kitchen is very well equipped and some basic ingredients for breakfast are provided.,,,,,
The host does not (always) live there,so we recommend not arriving too late at night for the check-in.,,,,
Metro station and shopping mall are 5 minutes walking distance but are not very recommendable places to hang around,especially at night.,,,,
We loved staying at Herminia's,"thank you!!!\"",,,,
77691,16745051,2014-08-01,14688439,Lauren,"Overall, we had an average experience. Donna, the woman who takes care of the house was more than helpful the entire time. Somehow, there was a mix up with bookings and we were unable to check in to our room because someone had decided to stay an extra night. Donna quickly got us into another room and even moved our luggage to the room we were supposed to be in the next day. The only other problem we had was a little mouse who ate a bit of some bread that we had in a shopping bag in our room. Donna told us that she was already handling that problem and it should be fixed soon."
77691,16815168,2014-08-02,189584,Richard,"Nice room, great proximity to the T.  The only downside is 2 bathrooms shared by about 5 sets of guests."
77691,17102372,2014-08-07,17105107,Clara,"Very nice place situated in Dorchester, really next to Boston. The house is big, luminous, the room B that I occupied with my mother was large and comfortable."
Hermina's help,Donna,was there when we arrived and she explained us our room and the rules of the house.,,,
We had everything for breakfast,fruits,cereals,jam,coffee,tea ...
"The location of the house is very convenient because the \"\"T\"\"",the Boston metro,is at 5min walk. Within a few minutes,we are in the center of Boston.,,
Careful though,the neighborhood is fine by day but at night,don't hang around.,,,
Finally,we had a wonderful stay in Hermina's house and we definitely recommend it.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
77691,17188064,2014-08-08,15230345,Heather,"Nice place to stay for the price. It was a little far from the airport with all our luggage so it cost about $80 to get there & back with a taxi.  If you're able to take the train though, it seems like an easy route as the instructions from host are very clear. The area felt safe, it was right next to police station."
77691,18045435,2014-08-20,6409759,Sushrutha,"We had a very nice stay at Hermine's place. The place looked exactly like in pictures. Every small detail was taken care of including towels, access key, internet code, breakfast etc. Though we did not meet Dona (house in charge) during our stay, she helped us a lot over phone including telling us where to park and sharing pictures to ensure parking is fine."
Cleanliness: The house was very clean and tastefully decorated,,,,,
Neighborhood: Even though house is minutes away from subway,we did not  always feel very comfortable walking home during late hours,,,,
"\"",,,,,
77691,18133246,2014-08-22,114538,Gerardo,"Stay all the time, its always great"
77691,18351867,2014-08-25,19656976,Brenda,"The place was clean and confortable. I dont have any complaint to do. Even we did not see Sra Hermina, everything was ready to us. I really recommend you."
77691,18574935,2014-08-28,19638382,Emily,"It was very nice being able to stay at Hermina's place.  She wasn't there, but we knew that in advance, and that was ok.  The room was ready and clean and everything was organized.  The house has, I think, 6 separate rooms for guests, and we ran into several other guests in the common areas at various times -- all really nice people.  (by the way, no air-con, but we were ok with the ceiling fan and a small fan in the window...)"
Dorchester has not-the-greatest reputation and the neighborhood could make someone nervous,but we felt fine at the house itself (next to the police station and across from a Buddhist center.),,,,
"The only \"\"negative\"\" was that breakfast supplies get set out the day before in the kitchen by Hermina's friend Donna (we didn't meet her but had contact via text message.)  Apparently the food and coffee she had set out prior to our arrival was almost completely consumed by the various guests before the morning of our first breakfast.  (no milk",no bread,no fruit,no coffee,no yogurt,"no juice...)  That was kind of a drag.  It was great that the kitchen was available for everyone and that there were spices and condiments and basic ingredients there.  And I can understand that having a stock of 10 cans of coffee in the cupboard would be an invitation for people to take a can with them... but there ought to be some way to \"\"budget\"\" breakfast items so that they don't run out.  Anyway"
Even if there was no breakfast included,"this would be a great place to stay... as long as you are aware of the situation...  We would definitely recommend.\"",,,,
77691,18610081,2014-08-28,10776001,Martín,"The house and the room were very nicely decorated. The room was spacious. One thing that made me uncomfortable was the requirement not to wear shoes in the house. One should at least be able to wear flip flops, which wouldn't damage the floors. The house seems to function like a self-regulated guest house, and not like a private residence. I would have liked to know this in advance, or that this had been made explicit in the ad."
77691,18761677,2014-08-31,20235045,Michael,"Well decorated, clean, well stocked kitchen, our first time, we were delighted, happy to stay there again.  Pre arrival email communication was detailed, accurate, host was responsive answering our questions."
77691,18958422,2014-09-03,1104388,Gwladys,"We've been hosted by Hermina and Donna for 3 nights. It was our first in time in Boston. The house is close to the station (Fields corner) which is good and it is located next to a kind of police warehouse. Sometimes you will hear the alarm, it is very disturbing, I remember that a sunday morning the alarm didn't stop to ring."
We were located in room B. When we arrived nobody was there to welcome us. We knew Hermina was out of the country and Donna the house-keeper but we didn't have the chance to meet her during our all stay in Hermina's house. We didn't have a very good experience unfortunately. When we arrived room was not clean  (however we knew it,we arrived in the morning around 10.00 am) and bathroom as well (hairs were on the washstand and bathroom,it was not very pleasant to take a shower). The first day,we had to leave the door of our room unlocked  for Donna to come and clean the room. When we came back from our first day,we couldn’t find our luggage in the room,we were very frightened! We found them in the living room (Donna probably moved them…). The same night
77691,19290988,2014-09-09,14325032,Clémence,"La nuit s'est bien passée. Appartement très bien situé, chambre agréable. Hermina s'est montrée très disponible pour répondre à nos questions et organiser notre venue."

77691,20219394,2014-09-25,21641242,J.T.,"It's a good house to stay.  It's also very close to the subway. It's so convenient for us to travel around and the environment around the house is quiet at night.  The house is clean, and comfortable.  I really recommend this house."

77691,20981252,2014-10-08,6465392,Varsha,"We made a last minute reservation and were initially skeptical about the neighborhood after hearing from friends, but we had no other option so booked it anyway and I am glad we did. We arrived late at night and found someone else in our room, but hermina was quick to sort it out. The room is very clean, spacious and comfortable with a shared bathroom next door. I appreciate the fact that Hermina provides everything (not the case for many Airbnbs): washing machine, dryer, bath products, breakfast, fresh towels, heater etc. It is a fantastic deal also because it is only a few minutes away from the station. There are a few eateries nearby too. Just a note: you can hear street sounds at night so maybe not the best if you are a light sleeper. Didn't bother us at all. Also the stairs to the room are a bit steep so consider that if you need to. Otherwise this was the perfect place and I would definitely stay again."
77691,21064257,2014-10-10,22195044,Irene,"My host Hermina,  met me at the door.  She showed me where to park and parking was easily available."
I stayed in an area separate from the main house,right around the side.  This was to allow me to bring my bike into the house.  This space was clean and neat,though not Victorian.   My bedroom was welcoming and the bed comfortable.  I had a good nights sleep.  The bathroom,"shared was clean and convenient.  There was a very lively couple there who shared that floor with me.  All good.\"",,
77691,21369678,2014-10-15,1395613,Konni,"The house is very nice, big and spacious so I felt good there. Had some good conversation with Hermina. The neighborhood is nothing special maybe but the train stop is close by and quick access to the city."

Donna, lo mejor de la estancia!  es muy amable y nos resolvió todas las dudas. La habitación es igual que en las imágenes, amplia y limpia. El único problema es que se escuchan bastante los ruidos de los demás inquilinos de la casa."
Se puede usar la cocina y por la mañana Donna nos invitó a desayunar con café,"fruta fresca y pan. Muy recomendable para quedarse en Boston! \"",,,,

The place is in excellent condition, less than five minutes walk from a metro station and therefore quite easily accessible from downtown Boston."

"\"",,,,,
77691,23551896,2014-12-04,18854380,Holger,It is very easy to describe my feelings. Hermina is a courteous and helpful hostess. The room are spacious and in the kitchen I could work like in my own apartment.
But I have to mention her commitment on my departure day as there were a problem with my rental car. It was towed. She supported  me and did many telephone calls. Without her support,it would have been difficult for me to get the car back right in time,because I was on the way to the airport.,,,
Once again many thanks to her support,it is certainly not self-evident.,,,,
Best regards,"Holger\"",,,,
77691,32716088,2015-05-20,32747327,Cheri,We had a great experience. The house and room were extremely clean and Hermina was able to accommodate our timing needs. Have already scheduled a return visit.
77691,32928240,2015-05-23,30643420,Christos,"INsgesamt sehr schöne Unterkunft und ein geräumiges Zimmer, dass nicht nur mit dem Nötigsten ausgestattet ist. Die Küche kann man tatsächlich sinnvoll nutzen, falls man das möchte, da Dinge wie Öl oder Gewürze, die man nicht unbedingt für einmal Kochen kaufen möchte, vorhanden sind. Wärmstens weiterzuempfehlen."

Hermina was really great - she sent me detailed directions on howe to get there and as soon as I arrived she welcomed me, helped me with my stuff, and we enjoyed a cup of tea and a lovely chat together, joined by one of the other guests as well. She gave me pointers on what to see during my stay in Boston and always had a kind word when we saw each other, and on my last day she even drove me to the bus station on her way to the shops. If I ever go to Boston again I'm definitely booking with her."
77691,34745754,2015-06-11,35011300,Longfei,This is a good place to stay. And it's quiet and clean room. Clean restroom. The place is very close to subway station so that you can go to any places in Boston very quickly.

There was a minor miscommunication (we hadn't received the code to enter the house beforehand), but everything was sorted after a phone call, which she answered immediately. The room was clean, and the bed was comfy. The house is also conveniently located near the subway. Hermina also allowed us to leave the luggage in the house after checkout time, which was a huge help!"
77691,36463420,2015-06-28,36213036,Scott,"We came to Boston from the west coast, and stayed at Hermina's place for three evenings."
We were uncertain in our arrival times and etc,but she was warm and welcoming,and gave us via text and email,all of the information we needed to arrive  whenever.,,
The room was clean and quiet as was the bathroom. Its's safe,the Boston Police Headquarters is a block away. We used both a car as well as the T,and found both easy to manage.,,,
There were not a lot of local breakfast,lunch-type places,but we did not spend much time in Dorchester anyway.,,,
If you seek a simple,quiet,clean place to sleep,I think this is a good choice. Its not fancy,"but it is quiet and comfortable.\"",
77691,37619359,2015-07-08,5577384,Helene,Hermina was nice and gave all the necessary information to reach her place. Unfortunately I had to cancel but she was very professional.
77691,37720328,2015-07-09,36996005,Theo,"Hermina was very quick with her replies, and made it easy to find and access the house. Once there, it appeared she rents multiple rooms, each designated with its own letter (A-D I believe). A door with a key code provides access even when she's not  at home to receive her guests. We shared a little bathroom with two other rooms. Although fully functional, the bathroom has visibly served for quite some years. Location is 5 minutes from the subway, which takes you to the city center in about 10-15 minutes I believe. Bedroom B itself was clean and the bed was ok, no AC but it did have a ceiling fan."
77691,37823096,2015-07-10,27751597,Falgun,"Hermina was very kind, professional. I stayed one night at her place. She gave a good overview on her property. Showed me where the essentials are that I need. I will most certainly stay at hers if i have to."

My husband and I arrived from the airport in the evening and I was worried about not having an exact arrival time for Hermina as it was my first time flying into Boston Logan and taking public trans.  However, Hermina was very kind and let us know that whenever we got in was fine.  I've found that not all Airbnb hosts are that flexible with arrival time!"
She left us detailed directions on how to get to the house from the airport so transportation there was much easier than I think it could have otherwise been!  The house is about a five minute walk from the T station.  The walk from the T station was a bit sketchy,so I wouldn't arrive late at night as a single female or cart around a ton of luggage.  I was with my husband,though,so I was fine.,,
The house is beautiful and looks like the photos that Hermina has displayed.  I loved walking into a Victorian home!  You can tell she takes a lot of pride in her place and makes it nice for travelers.  My room was already pretty cool when I arrived,which was great on a hot and humid summer day!  I appreciated the desk,closet,and dressers to unpack in.  I used the shower to clean up after a full day of travel.  The water pressure was good.  It is a shared bathroom between I think two or three rooms,so be aware that you may need to be flexible.  There are some stores just a few minutes from the hosue,which is convenient.  Unfortunately

There were plenty of food (toast, milk...etc) in the kitchen on the night we arrived, but we probably woke up late because in the morning most of them were gone. So if you expect to have a hearty breakfast, wake up early. Generally speaking, this is a great place to stay in Boston. Definitely recommended."

It was absolutely perfect for our needs. We had a very nice room, nice small amenities, a fridge to store our food and we could also cook. Hermina's home is in the most PERFECT location. It's a VERY short walk to the T-Line. As first-timers, my friend and I navigated our way very easily throughout Boston and even to Salem. There are many local bakeries, restaurants, pubs/bars within walking distance of Hermina's home and all of a great variety. Thank you so much, Hermina, for hosting us! It was an amazing trip of a lifetime and we can't wait to go back to Boston!! -With Love from Arkansas"
77691,52064603,2015-10-26,27561823,Patricia,Entrance instructions were easy to follow. Hermina was out of town so we did not meet her. She did send an email asking if we had arrived. The second floor bedroom was large and spacious. Bed was very comfortable.  Two chairs and a mirror in the room. Not easy sharing one shower with five rental units. Kitchen was welcoming. Very close to the T station on the red line which goes directly to Cambridge. No problem finding parking on her street.
77691,52303591,2015-10-27,673334,Liana,Overall: met our needs and was a comfortable and clean stay; I didn't feel it was the best value but my BF thought it was great. Read below for details and decide for yourself:)
Best parts: bed was great (firm-ish,king size in room 2B); room was clean and comfortable overall; did not meet host but she was communicative and helped with parking. Parking was readily available,especially by Boston standards. (Just have to check signs for alternating street cleaning in the morning),,,
Other notes:,,,,,
House is as-described as far as neighborhood goes.,,,,,
bathroom was clean. One of our towels smelled slightly musty.,,,,,
Walls were thin so you can hear others on that level out in the hallway,,,,,
Pictures make it look more cosy and homey than it felt in person. In person it felt a little 'cold' - that's just me though. There are little signs all over the house letting you know things which is helpful. There was also one in bedroom to ask that you not move thermostat above 68 degrees because 'heat is expensive.' - not the most welcoming,,,,,
"We got there late so it was a little 'shady' walking up to the place. No lights on out front and no one to greet us. So felt like anyone could have walked in. Not a serious concern but not ideal\"",,,,,
77691,52467201,2015-10-29,41010583,Lindsey,Hermina was helpful via phone. The house caretakers were also kind and helpful. The house was just like the photos.
The neighborhood is okay. I felt safe walking to the subway after dark. Very close to public transportation,yay!,,,,
Some waiting for the shower in the morning. As expected,more like a nice European hostel than a hotel.,,,,
"Good value for the price relative to Boston area.\"",,,,,
77691,71383471,2016-04-25,21503402,David,"Hermina has a beautiful home and was a great host. My co-workers and I needed a place to stay for a weekend conference, and our room was spacious and cozy enough for all 3 of us. The amenities were nice, and she was great with communication. There are also plenty of stores and restaurants in the area, with street parking available around the block. We would definitely stay again."
77691,73940749,2016-05-11,45077926,Jeremy,Hermina was kind and accommodating for my last minute stay; she even upgraded my room to a larger room which was a welcome surprise. Her home is in walking distance from the Forest Hills station for the Red line which made getting to work easy.
77691,74724811,2016-05-16,63759007,Martin,We had a great time at Hermina place  The house was very nice and Hermina made us really feel at home. She provided everything we needed and was very helpful when we were deciding what to see in Boston.
"We can definitely recommend her and her house to anyone!\"",,,,,
77691,81676060,2016-06-24,50277818,Sean,"Hermina's home was great for our two days in Boston. It's very close to a Red Line train station, and the place was clean and convenient. The room was large and easily accommodated our group. It was also great value for how quickly we were able to get to downtown Boston and Cambridge, considering how expensive it can get the closer to the city center you get. Would definitely consider staying here again."
77691,82942183,2016-06-30,71796339,Jesse,This place is nice and close to all sorts of things.  Well kept and clean.  I will be staying here again in the near future.
77691,83776434,2016-07-04,40446828,Virginie,"Good emplacement, near subway, easy to find a parking with a car. Big house, but we were with some other people. Nice for meeting other people!"
77691,89637147,2016-07-29,63724988,Didier,Hermina si really helpful and very kind. Her house is great and our bed was huge.
The neibourhood is a bit noisy at night and having no air conditionner during the heat wave,we had to sleep with the windows opened. Anyway we enjoyed our stay and the place is 15 min to town,"which is good when you don t want to lose too much time on transport. \"",,,
77691,89893025,2016-07-30,85902385,Hiroko,"She was really a  friendly, kind lady. and the room was spacy, and comfortable, yes it is a pretty house."
I felt the area Dorchester a bit rough at first but it wasnt so much after all.I liked that her place is just  next to the police station ; ),,,,,
It is multicutual area at the same time,you can get good Vietnamese foods in this neighbor!,,,,
There are 3 other guests while I was staying,they are open,"nice people easy to get along.\"",,,
77691,90835135,2016-08-02,14077593,Lisa,Très bon séjour à Boston. La maison est à côté du métro ce qui est positif. Hermina a été très disponible. Je recommande.
77691,91251484,2016-08-04,77968186,Elizabeth,"We never saw Hermina, but everything we needed was available and it was easy to find things like extra towels or linens. We enjoyed our stay and accommodations were nice."
77691,92037945,2016-08-07,45615536,Anita,"Room B in Hermina's place is very large and fits three guests easily. Although it was quite warm, the room was comfortable with the ceiling fan and windows on various sides. The house is well located for public transport, parking is easy. You will meet other guests but there is enough privacy. Good place for exploring Boston."
77691,92874485,2016-08-10,37354840,Manuel,"Excellent experience in Hermina's house, such a great person and really clean a comfortable house. The only thing I'd add would be an air conditioner in the bedroom but other that that, awesome house."
77691,93173720,2016-08-11,76596519,Christophe,"Quartier moyen, sans charme. Maison sans charme, chambre ultra basique, pas de clim, bruyante. A coté de la police locale, certes sécurisant, mais gyrophares et bruits de radio toutes les nuits sous la fenêtre. dommage, les photos donnaient l'impression d'une maison traditionnelle Bostonienne, on en est loin."
77691,94145581,2016-08-14,86441208,Sophia,"Hermina was a very accommodating, kind host. However there is no A/C in the room and during our stay we made the mistake of leaving the windows open. It was extremely noisy, but after closing the windows the noise was less of an issue. I also did not feel safe walking home from the T at night."
77691,94890282,2016-08-17,70699118,Rohana,"Hermina was sweet. The location was not the best, but it was a very close walk to the Red Line so that was great. Our main problem with staying there was not at all her, it was mainly the fact that she over-books. The room was clean and beds were very comfortable. There is no AC so beware, during the summer it is quite hot upstairs (where all the bedrooms are). Our problem was that there in only 1 1/2 bathrooms in the entire house and there were several groups of airbnb people staying there, not including herself and her two young kids. It was almost impossible  to take a shower and get ready in the mornings and evenings, because as soon as one person gets out, another gets in. Her washer/dryer are also located in the main bathroom, so people are in there doing laundry while others need to shower/use the restroom."
Her house is also right next to a Boston police station,so we could hear dispatch and cars often opening and closing. If you need quiet to fall asleep,this is not the place you want to stay.,,,
Overall: it was an alright experience,"but I would not stay there again. It would be a much more comfortable experience if Hermina stops overbooking her place. \"",,,,
11983535,87481085,2016-07-20,34025419,Valery,"We had not so many questions, but Kara was always available and expeditiously helped us to resolve issues."
4461111,75122514,2016-05-19,70167692,Jeff,Great room in a wonderful house. Everything was clean and I enjoyed the company of Mohammed and the other Tennants. I felt welcomed and the room was clean and ready when I got there.
4461111,78629856,2016-06-08,61959108,Ola,Mohamed was a great host and is very accommodating. Nice person to talk to and knows the area very well. The place provided everything that I needed. Everything was nice and tidy/clean. I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a cheap place to stay within the Boston area.
5146447,27984426,2015-03-15,6946983,Daniel,"The room (and the apartment) were lovely, everything very new and clean. The house is close to the Silver line bus. Sarah was very welcoming and helpful. Everything was perfect."
5146447,30656874,2015-04-25,31831954,Ado,Very clean place with Sarah being a really kind host. Great location to access public transport as well.
5146447,32669265,2015-05-19,20085885,Michael,The room listed was very large and clean. I met some nice people while there and would stay again
5146447,32733055,2015-05-20,13833760,Rachel,"It wasn't exactly what I was expecting. I knew there were multiple rooms in the house for people to stay in, but I did not expect to find someone on an air mattress in the living room when I got in after a lot of flight delays. The room was nice and did have locks. Sarah was also very responsive to my messages, which was good. I didn't meet her during my stay."
"I later found out there was a hostel closer to where my conference was that was about $20 cheaper per night.\"",,,,,
5146447,33513052,2015-05-29,30483437,Andy,Sarah was a fantastic host. The house had a full kitchen available to use and the room was large with access to a nice bathroom.
5146447,33639705,2015-05-30,29986159,Mark,The room was great and Sarah was very accommodating. It was a very last minute booking and Sarah changed her plans to make sure the room was ready and she was able to meet me with the keys.
5146447,34146130,2015-06-05,33016308,Giulia,I am not happy about this experience.
I spent 6 days in Boston,and I have never met Sarah,not even when I arrived.,,,
The room was clean,but when I arrived the bathtube was very dirty,and the bathroom in general was not highly clean.,,,
In the kitchen and in the fridge there was food left from previos renters,and some was expired months earlier.,,,,
"\"\"Breakfast included\"\" simply meant you could use the food left from the other people (without knowing who bought it",when and since how long was it opened). I initially found some milk,but it was over after few days,and it was not supplied more.,,
Similar situation went for the shampoo (the leftover).,,,,,
The flat is close to the station,so it was easy to catch a bus,but the neighboor was not the best. I did not feel safe when I was going back home at night,but this is probably one of the general problems in USA,if you go out of the city center.,
The only positive remark is that when I asked Sarah (by email) if I could use an extra towel,she provided one.,,,,
I would sincerely not suggest it to a friend.,,,,,
"I travel a lot and often stay in hostels or in other people´s  houses; I have had more pleasant experiences and meet better hosts.  \"",,,,,
5146447,34263893,2015-06-06,12830076,Rodrigo,"Sarah es muy buena anfitriona, la habitación es perfecta para el viaje, es cercana al centro de la ciudad lo que es muy importante, mi paso fue muy tranquilo no escuche nada de ruido y pude descansar muy bien."
5146447,34793317,2015-06-12,33210592,Gabriel,"The apartment was easy to find with Sarah's instruction, and my room was quiet, large and comfortable. Being a basement-level room, it was a bit cold; Sarah had planned this and added a radiator, but I did not in fact need it. The bathroom was clean, and comfortable. Would recommend."
5146447,35153660,2015-06-15,27657714,Ryan,"Didn't get a chance to meet Sarah but she was very helpful! Sarah has a great system that works. Easily get your keys and leave them at your own convenience. This worked great for me because I had really early and late hours working. The place was nice and clean. Neighborhood was good. Close to bus, or take UBER."
5146447,35583321,2015-06-20,19055601,Desiree,Sarah was awesome! She made my stay very easy and I felt right at home. She was very helpful about letting me know good spots to eat in the area and how to get to some of the spots I needed to visit for my trip. Thanks Sarah!
5146447,35745750,2015-06-21,35386477,Anja,The room was exactly as I expected. Everything was clean and nice. The location is okay.
5146447,35993011,2015-06-23,33500469,Gary,"The room was as described. Though I never met Sarsh, she was easy to reach and prompt to respond."
5146447,36158468,2015-06-25,25165889,Jyarie,"It was a great stay , sarah is a great host and has a beautiful home the communication is very good and the other roommates that was staying there was very nice I highly recommend this place to anyone"
5146447,36642243,2015-06-29,36759841,Delilah,Experience here was very awesome ! Place was very neat and clean . Even more better than pictures. I loved it !
5146447,37025941,2015-07-03,37259604,Lina,"Solo nos quedamos una noche, No nos sentimos seguros en el barrio, quizá porque llegamos muy  tarde y aunque Sarah estaba muy pendiente de los mensajes, no la conocimos."
5146447,37916802,2015-07-11,20203561,Josue,Listing was accurate and host was very acomodating. Sarah is great and I had the pleasure to meet her upon my arrival. Location is conveniently placed about a 5-7 minute walk to Dudley station. Room has a nice temperature in the summer and it is bigger than what is shown in the picture. The room was completly clean. There is a bathroom that is shared with another room but the bathroom is enormous.
5146447,38561462,2015-07-16,38040470,Tabitha,I needed to book very last minute and I was very nervous. I didn't have anything to worry about. Everything was wonderful!! I had never stayed at airbnb before and I had a fantastic time. When I had questions Sarah responded very quickly. I would highly recommend!!
5146447,38903830,2015-07-19,10179505,Pillias,La communication avec Sarah via airBnb c'est effectué sans encombre. Nous avons également pu la croiser peu après notre arrivé.
Les lieux correspondent bien aux photos présentés sur le site.,,,,,
Il y'a également un lave vaisselle (appréciable),ainsi qu'un PC dispo sur place.,,,,
Cependant la propreté reste à désiré : cuisine un peu crasseuse,poêle collante,cheveux qui traine sous les lits,dans la douche,dans les coins. Baignoire crasseuse,ect...
Manque également un peu de matériel pour cuisiner : poêle,fouet,récipient,"et un grille pain.\"",,
5146447,40366295,2015-07-30,37049662,Daniela,"Sarah is an amazing host, she makes it really easy for you and helps out wherever she can. The location of the house is pretty good too, the walk to the bus station is just about 5 minutes and the bus takes you in 20min to Boston downtown."
5146447,40958871,2015-08-03,11130952,Charlie,"Sarah texted me right before I arrived asking me if I could stay at a different location than I had booked.  It was close so I agreed, hoping for the best.  When I arrived, Sarah welcomed me outside and showed me into her unit at the Roxbury complex at 33 Bethune Way.  The area could be considered dangerous by some people who are not use to low income communities, and Sarah asked me not to speak to the people hanging outside, but I eventually spoke with a few of them on my way in and out of the apartment and was happy to find them very friendly and helpful.  In fact, their hospitality was the highlight of my stay there!"
It was not the nicest place I have stayed on Airbnb and it was a bit pricy for what was offered,especially since it was $30 extra per night for a 2nd person totally $90 a night,but it was close to my job site downtown and within walking distance of a convenient store.  There was no AC in my room,but the box fan worked ok.  I was given one clean towel for my 4 day stay and when I asked for a second one,it took a couple of hours to get it and it was damp.  Aside from that,"I had the basics of what I needed and Sarah was nice enough to both me and my guest.     \""
5146447,41273004,2015-08-05,28210121,Moo Hung,"Stayed only one night at Sarah's listing and left very early the next day.  Didn't meet Sarah but she sounded nice via text, and her replies were always prompt. The house including the room was clean, but basic. Wished that the wifi signal in the basement room had better connectivity- It was reassuring that the main entrance had a coded key system and there were locks on the doors. The bathroom was big and air-conditioned living room was comfortable."
5146447,42488141,2015-08-13,21069809,Sona,"Sarah is a nice host but that is not enough. When I booked this room I did not know (and it is not in its description) that it has no windows. Well it does not and also no aircon. A simple small fan does not change the fact that air in the room is bad. Futher, the area is not safe, especially in the evening and early morning (when we had to leave for a train). When I found out that the towels we were provided with smelled bad, it was already too late in the evening to ask for them to be changed."
5146447,43203132,2015-08-17,33442849,Junkwan,She is so helpful .
I was so comfortable.,,,,,
"And the room I stayed was huge and clean. \"",,,,,
5146447,43406928,2015-08-19,38266344,Fusayo,"I stayed at the Sarah's place for two nights. She welcomed me and let me check in earlier than her check- in time kindly. Since I arrived in Boston in the very early morning, I had asked her to let me put my luggage in beforehand.Her young son was also nice to me. I could be relaxed and enjoy my stay in Boston. Thank you!"
5146447,45351028,2015-09-01,39296780,Hanyu,Sarah was a nice host willing to help. She gave me a ride when I checked out with three huge luggages finding no cabs can pick me up. Really saved me.
The room was exactly as the description shows. It was clean and comfortable,despite that the signals of cellphone and wifi were a bit weak,"everything was great. \"",,,
5146447,45682871,2015-09-05,39678749,Nina,"Our staying here was with no problem. Place was clean, exactly as described. We never met Sarah but everything was prepared."
5146447,46793016,2015-09-13,39968253,Brian,I stayed with Sarah for two nights over a weekend and she was very accommodating with my late check-in. I was able to easily find parking right around the corner and comfortably use the T throughout my stay. The bedroom is away from any outside noise and I was able to comfortably sleep with the fan she provided.
5146447,47598556,2015-09-20,3513076,Paolo,"Sarah was helpful with the check-in process, and everything was as described. Good value for money."
5146447,49033390,2015-09-30,43155177,Frank,"Sarah 人非常好,热情好客,房屋与Sarah的描述完全相符合,出行方便,距离公汽车站Dudley Station很近,前往Ruggles转乘地铁也较便利,周围环境不错,旁边还有一家公共洗衣房。我在这里度过了我在波士顿的第一个阶段,对于波士顿逐渐由不适应转而适应,这里也让我感受到了家庭般的温暖,今后很长一段时间,我仍将思念在这里住居的日子。"
5146447,49302695,2015-10-02,17173607,Monty,Great host.
5146447,50899370,2015-10-15,38491312,Mandee,"Sarah was great in responding to me as I made plans for my trip and her listing has a great self-check in process. My room had no window, but otherwise it's a great space for someone looking for an easy place to come and go. Short walk to the bus station."
5146447,50999042,2015-10-16,598150,Tracy,I never met Sarah but her son was so adorable and a big help. the bedroom was nice and check it was smooth.
5146447,51802669,2015-10-24,43985978,Adnan,"I think once the booking is done successfully, Sarah should tell the guest in advance about how exactly to enter the house instead of at that time when the guest arrives so tired after a journey. It took me a lot of time to enter the house as she was on work and i couldn't understand how to enter the house. She kept on explaining me such long things on call which i wasn't understanding as the signal was so bad in that area. Eventually she messaged me which she could have done 1 week earlier and i would have known what exactly to do when i arrived there. The room was so clean and seemed newly made and so was the toilet. Great value of money. Its 5 minutes walk to the T bus service which takes you to the nearest subway/metro station but the house is located in south Boston and it hasn't got the best neighborhood in Boston. Some people in Boston warned me about the area but unfortunately i was staying there. Its entirely the area of African Americans. It was good for me to get introduced to Sarah but i have to say that she was not at all cooperative. She doesn't has any humanity in her. By mistake, i left my room keys inside the room when i was checking out and she didn't have a spare key. I tried to ask her for a solution but she didn't help me at all. She just wanted me to leave the house ASAP. I am sure that if she had come back and see it, we could have definitely opened it together but she didn't even ask me to stay there and wait for her. I paid the bloody 150$ to open it which i can never forget in life. She refused to cooperate at all. She just kept on saying that i have to find a solution on my own, which wasn't very polite at all. She didn't say even a single time to wait for her until she comes back and we find some solution. This is the first time in my life that i went on to live in such a house whose rooms had no spare key. In the same money that you would pay to stay at this house, you can definitely find a safe and a similar location near to the train station, in other areas of Boston as well but still i believe the room was even better as shown in the pictures. The apartment was very beautiful, clean and well organized. The internet was so bad. It was the worst i ever used in my life. It hardly worked for a couple of seconds and then the browsing used to be stopped. As i said earlier, the room is really nice but worst location and area of Boston and worst internet so i suggest you to have a better person as your host who listens to your..."
5146447,51964407,2015-10-25,45105868,Emmanuelle,She was able to give me instructions on how to get into her home and it felt like I was in my own home.
5146447,52556040,2015-10-30,22375463,Kat,The price is right for a simple space in a 3 bedroom unit.
5146447,70411819,2016-04-17,3171840,Kegan,"the place was clean, and in a pretty good spot. definitely recommended for your stay in boston."
5146447,74596114,2016-05-16,9204142,Sean,"I never had a chance to meet Sarah, but communication online with her was quick and easy.  The apartment is very clean and well maintained. However, one should be aware that the surrounding area is somewhat sketchy. If you are ok with the neighborhood, then I would recommended this place, but it is something one should be aware of before booking."
5146447,78533614,2016-06-07,70176482,Nelson,Listing was described accurately. I never had the chance to meet Sarah but all communications through messages were done in a very timely manner.
Room is clean,big queen bed (but the mattress is very noisy),small desk and closet. This room was located downstairs of the house so there are no windows. The room can be very dark. Neighborhood doesnt actually looks that safe,but nothing happened to me.,,
"Location is not far from Dudley Station and that can be very helpful in getting around.\"",,,,,
5146447,80243779,2016-06-17,44538053,Kim,Had a good overall experience. Clean and well kept. When we only had one towel let Sarah know and she had more for us by the time we got back. Only negative to this room was there was no window. I felt like I could sleep forever (but there is a door to outside)! I would stay here again.
5146447,80888786,2016-06-20,51903253,Nicholas,"Staying with Sarah is easy and pleasant. Street parking is available for commuters, and checkin/checkout was very easy. The room looks exactly like the photos. Super comfy, very clean and cozy place and private setup. Thank you Sarah!!"

Wi-fi is available, reliable, and fast. The room I stayed in was perfect -- wonderful bed, and stays very dark for peaceful sleeping. The room has its own private access, as well, separate from the rest of the house. Perfect place to stay in the Roxbury/Dorchester area. Highly recommended."
5146447,87256470,2016-07-19,66949471,Elio,Sarah made my stay as easy as possible. She tries to be helpful all the time and promptly answer my emails/messages. She is a very nice and active person. The house is clean and organized.
5146447,87692212,2016-07-21,78296172,Robson,I got a comfy room and its description at Airbnb gives simility.
Unfortunately,I did not enjoy only one thing... the sheets and pillow case were not changed before and during my stay... I had to use my T-shirt as pillow case and my own blanket.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
5870309,39299536,2015-07-22,5807530,Patrick,"We stayed here 2 weeks with our family (2+2) and enjoyed it. It's probably worth mentioning that this is not a normal airbnb listing, but a housing company (Churchill Living) that has multiple apartments. Nevertheless, the place was as advertised (not the same as in the pictures, but very similar, and in the same building). The best thing about the place is probably the location, which is the best in Boston! Just a block away from the Prudential (incl. the subway station) and Copley Place, with all the shops and everything close, but still in the best neighborhood, in the brownstone blocks of South End. The building (Garrison Square Apartments) has a doorman and we felt very welcome. The courtyard (square) was great! And the children's playground by the apartment was much appreciated. The kitchen could have had a bit more equipment (only very basic stuff), but it was ok. The shower curtain was a bit worn-out, but worked. Kara was forthcoming and provided us with all the needed information. We had some problems with getting the living room TV working as well as getting a 2nd set of keys, but Churchill Living worked them out finally. The washer & dryer were very good and in frequent use. The wifi was at times (often) quite slow, but it worked. All in all, a very good experience."
5870309,47914094,2015-09-21,28682202,Cynthia,"The apartment is nice and clean and it has a high ceiling in the living area which is nice. It's run by a company in NY. Just one issue during our first three-night stay was when I arrived at the apartment, the keys were not in a lockbox as instructed but was left on the kitchen counter. The doorman was very nice and he let us in. That was how we found the keys. Other than this, the location is perfect for anything."
5870309,49053723,2015-09-30,40383726,Linchi,"Garrison square is an amazing property in a nice neighborhood. It's walkable to public transportation and nice restaurants. The apartment is cosy, clean and the beds are comfortable. Kara also responded my messages very timely. It makes my family's visit more fun. I highly recommend Garrison square."
5870309,50302647,2015-10-11,9485926,Elle,"The parking was very inconvenient. The concierge insisted on a money order to pay the $40/day fee.  It could not be paid for along with the nightly rate.  The check in was a lock box (one of dozens) attached to a gate, none of which could be identified as the right one but all had he same code!  Was concerned about safety not knowing who might have had access to the suite.  Still have not been able to get a receipt that shows taxes paid (for company expense purposes).  I won't be using Airbnb again."
5870309,56523400,2015-12-14,49577933,Susan,Great location for walking and eating. Nice view over the SW corridor path. Definitely a corporate rental. Clean and quiet. No problem getting the keys.
533114,2247052,2012-09-10,735468,Scott,This condo is in excellent condition and is state of the art. Top notch and top class.
533114,15666814,2014-07-14,11969810,Lesley,"This is an absolutely beautiful, modern, and updated unit. For us, it was also very centrally located as we visited family in Southie, Quincy, Falmouth, and took in all of the Boston sites. We rented a car and easily found parking directly in front of or across the street from the unit. But we mostly utilized the T, which was a short walk away. We loved the neighborhhod and often walked to the Savin Scoop, a little ice cream shop a short walk away, near the T stop. There were plenty of towels for our group of five and having a washer/dryer in the unit really helped with packing light for the trip. We would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone wanting a quiet, convenient location in the Boston area."
533114,22178756,2014-11-01,16265815,Sumeet,"\"The apartment was great - well furnished, clean and a great place overall. The instructions were also very clear and crisp. Would love to stay there if am in Boston anytime. The accessibility to the \"\"T\"\" is also very convenient as its just a 10 min walk. Great place to stay if you are in the Boston region and need access to the \"\"T\"\".\""
533114,24359689,2014-12-27,14407854,Sally,"Our stay at The Sawyer was amazing!  We booked the unit for the week of Christmas, and I can say that it certainly worked as a home-away-from-home for the holidays.  The unit was spacious, clean and organized, and all arrival and departure instructions were clear and simple.  Kitchen appliances were up-to-date and there was enough eating space for about 10 people, which made it a perfect space for holiday celebrations.  There were five of us staying in the unit, though I'm sure it would comfortably accommodate six, if needed.  Beds were comfortable and there were extra clean towels, which made us feel like we were on a true vacation.  We also had no trouble finding the nearest T stop (Savin Hill), which was clearly outlined in the Swank Properties App.  Above all, the host service was excellent - I received prompt replies in all email correspondence, and the host made me feel very comfortable to reach out if I needed anything.  I would definitely recommend this unit to anyone looking for a place to stay in Dorchester!"
533114,27757026,2015-03-11,5273615,Tom,"Even with all the snow, we had a wonderful stay in Boston. Lance is a super host and even has an app to make things easy for the guests. The rental is beautiful and in a brilliant location, close enough to access everything with a quick trip on the T or uber, but far enough to have somewhere quiet to unwind after a full day."
533114,77178058,2016-05-30,34116185,Tamara,"Apartment was great!  More spacious than the photos suggest, clean, upscale and fairly well-equipped. (Could use more glasses and coffee mugs.). Stayed 6 days and always found street parking within s couple of houses. Wonderful place for my 87 year old mother, my 18 yr old son, and my husband and me to put down roots while in Boston."
533114,80179558,2016-06-16,67581370,Sandy,"The house was like the pictures. There was plenty of room for our family of four to spread out. It was a great alternative to a hotel. We didn't have a car so we used the T every day, which worked great. It is a bit of a walk but was fine for us. We would stay there again."
533114,94863610,2016-08-17,62955201,Katherine,"Nice apartment, close to Boston. The apartment is spacious, well maintained, clean, beautiful. We were two families, four adults and three kids, enough space for all of us. Lance provided everything you will need, towels, sheets, detergent , hand soup, dishwasher detergent, laundry detergent, a new sponge for the dishes, paper toilet, bedding, etc."
7553969,43283643,2015-08-18,10691443,Kathleen,Great location. Andrea was very easy to work with and communicated often to ensure our visit was going well. The studio was very clean and tidy.  I would suggest a curtain on the shower window...we felt a little exposed using it. Also a few more towels would be nice. It was pretty hot when we were there. 83 degrees at night... A fan for such an event would have made a big difference. We had a great visit to Boston and would definitely stay here again.
7553969,50650338,2015-10-13,22642888,Patrik,Truly amazing!
The mail exchange before our stay was good. A week before arriving Andrea send us details on how to get the keys,short information about the studio as well as suggestions on what to do in the area.,,,,
Unfortunately my girlfriend and I couldn't meet Andrea in person but the handing over of the keys was organized very easily.,,,,,
The studio is located in a superb area to discover Boston. There are plenty of small shops and restaurants in walking distance of about 5 min. If you walk a few more minutes you get to the beautiful see side of Boston or Newberry Street crossing the beautiful city park of Boston.,,,,,
The studio is perfect for 2 persons,Andrea provided fresh towels and blankets as well as stationery and paper to take notes and basic necessities for the bathroom.,,,,
Overall we loved our stay in Andrea's studio,"we recommended it to friends of ours and would choose it again :) \"",,,,

7553969,92029007,2016-08-07,38800295,Danny,"The location could not have been better! The apartment was unbelievably close to the Charles river (which is a beautiful place to watch the sunset), the city (which, even after being in Boston for two years, never gets old), and a multitude of shops and restaurants. It was honestly a wonderful place and met our needs perfectly. It allowed us the comfort and coziness of a one room apartment but also felt spacious enough for us to spread out. There aren't very many plates or cups in the kitchen, but if you're eating out most meals (like we did) this shouldn't really be a problem. We loved it and would highly recommend to anyone else."
7553969,99843875,2016-09-06,39235233,Bernadeta,"Location, location, location. The studio is located on a 3rd floor in a really nice part of the city.

8988506,53834124,2015-11-13,38834830,Paul,This was a great apartment. The building and furnishings are all brand new and everything was very comfortable. Toiletries and coffee (with sugar and cream) were provided by the host which was a big plus. We utilized the nearby Whole Foods which is literally 50 feet away but unfortunately we did not have a chance to check out much else in the neighborhood.
8988506,54023699,2015-11-15,46390613,Annika,"We enjoyed our stay at Josh's apartment. It was clean and nice. The location was good as well, we didn't have any problems going into the city. We didn't meet Josh in person, but he was very helpful when we called him (at first we didn't get into the building, but this wasn't Josh's fault). We recommend this apartment and would choose it again."
8988506,54398080,2015-11-19,1742026,Friederike,I booked the apartment for a business trip for 2 of my colleagues. For me the whole booking process was as easy as (URL HIDDEN) Josh was very quick in responding to questions.

The Ink Block is a newer development toward South End which puts it an easy jump from most places you might need to go.  The apartment was perfect for our group of friends, and the term \"\"huge terrace\"\" doesn't really do the outdoor space justice.  We could have had a block party up there.

We found it nice and quiet there as well and had no problems with noise from neighbours and slept well. The location is great,we were attending a trade show downtown at the Hynes Convention Center  and it was only a 20 minute walk.,,,,
Parking on Sunday was free and there was a reasonable amount of on-street parking at the metres. Of course it is Boston so free parking does not exist,so we just tossed our vehicles in the nearby parking garage and left it so no issues there.,,,,

It was clean and it had towels, toiletries, hairdryer, iron, etc.. what you could expect from a hotel room. The space was perfect, and the bonus terrace was great. It was nice having a washer & dryer even with soap to use, only minor down side was dryer took several (like 3) cycles to dry small set of clothes. We also had an issue with a/c on one side of apt. We suffered some heat in morning trying to get ready, however the issue was fixed the same day when we were back by evening. The one major issue that bothered us the most was the LOUD noise from construction crew that started at 6am everymorning during our 3 night stay. It sounded so loud it seemed like they were inside the apt. So uncomfortable that even once awake it was annoying. We didn't appreciate having to wake up so early during our vacation this way. I communicated by text/email with \"\"Josh\"\" and he apologized"

8988506,92639237,2016-08-09,56661926,Peter,"Loved it for location, size,  clean,  pool,  convenience,  parking under highway nearby... great experience!"
8988506,93426179,2016-08-12,64930998,Janet,The place is very nice. Definitely a modern up and coming area. Having the Whole Foods right there was very convenient! We were there in the middle of a heat wave so use of the pool was great. For what we planned for our stay most of our travel was by Uber. We stayed up at Beacon Hill earlier in the week which was very convenient for what we did at the beginning of the week.
One very important thing to remember is to ask about parking in advance if you are brining a car. This was not the hosts fault as I didn't even think to ask. We arrived late and did not have any parking so we parked up at Boston Commons parking which the concierge had suggested although I would say is very inconvenient when you have kids and there is a heat wave. We finally connected with Josh and he was very responsive in helping us to find a parking space that he owned and happened to be available after some miscommunication on which space belonged to him. Bottom line is ask about parking in advance if you are bringing a car.,,,,,
There is also a couple of up and coming restaurants that were under the Ink Block condos. Fuji at Ink Block was amazing and open until 1 am weekdays and 2 am on weekends.,,,,,
"Over all the stay was great. The place was very nice. \"",,,,,
8988506,94336295,2016-08-15,31761314,Lana,Loved this apartment. 5 of us girls stayed very comfortable for two nights. It was very hot out and the air conditioning worked great. We choose to park in the garage which was under building one where we got the keys. We were able to uber to TD for about $1O and walk or quick uber to everything we wanted to do. Very convenient that whole foods is next door. The terrace was huge and had a table and chairs. It does look over the parking lot but I'd have to say it was quite entertaining. Everything from dishwasher to laundry and clean sheets. This apt has it all and if in area again I will have no problem booking again. Josh answered all my texts quickly and the concierge was avail 24-7 if we needed any help with anything. You will not regret your stay here.
8680170,51195164,2015-10-18,25435077,Michelle,"This was my first experience with airbnb and I think now my bar is set way too high. This was also my family's first night away at a non family members house so I was nervous about logistics with my infant daughter. To say this experience was great would be an understatement. Chris was very quick with all his communication and consistently went above and beyond to make us feel (URL HIDDEN) worked out that his family has a young baby so the crib, changing table and some other toys made the trip that much more special. We were also able to use their parking pass, saving us money and headache in a tough to park neighborhood. The apartment was beautiful. The pictures don't do it justice. And we were greeted with a bottle of wine, sweet note, and everything laid out for us. I would definitely stay again on our next trip to Boston!"

We stayed over only one night, but because of missing our connection in D.C.--we live in New Orleans--we didn't arrive in Boston until late, very late. Nonetheless, she waited for my wife and me to arrive until after 1:15 AM. The room was as we expected, which is to say all that we wanted. We slept well; the bed was comfortable. My wife is also interested in becoming part of Airbnb, and Jennifer was helpful in her advice and responding to our questions. Because we arrived so late at night, we only saw the neighborhood as we left in the morning. It looked safe and possessed character."

The interior architecture is designed by the host and will be appreciated by anyone with a design background.  The home is spacious and quiet as is the neighborhood that it is in.  As a bonus there may be fresh eggs available only hours old.  A great place for parents visiting children in college or grandparents visiting nearby grandchildren.

Jennifer is genuinely kind, a great conversationalist and has a very bright personality and this shines throughout her very unique home. She has done quite a bit of  cutom architecture design to improve the look and feel of her home and she goes out of her way to make you feel like her home is your own.  I really felt comfortable staying here, it was as if Jennifer was a distant cousin or Aunt I had not yet met. She even went out of her way to make me some delicious coffee in the morning as I was leaving for work. There is a bus stop right at the end of her street for very convenient access to the T. The commuter rail is only a few blocks away as well. If you stay here make sure to visit Roslindale Village for great food, shopping and just a good old fashioned walk. I loved the neighborhood and I would highly recommend staying here. I know I will be booking with Jennifer again!"

I think Jennifer's home is really nice. The transport is convenient (a mile away from subway,she can give you a ride to the station). The breakfast is an unexpected surprise. We had eggs from the chicken in her back yard! Jennifer is a nice person and her room is worth to try out! Airbnb asked me to write this comment in Chinese,"don't understand why.

We came in very late and she was kind enough to leave us a key so we could come and go as we pleased. She has chickens that lay fresh eggs and we were able to cook breakfast using those eggs and it was great. The bathrooms are shared amongst other AirBnB guests (if any) so not 100% private, but it didn't seem to cause any trouble for us. Location was great for us and provided good walking nearby in the Arnold Arboretum."

The house is exactly as pictured and the bed and pillows were so comfy we always fell right asleep! Jennifer provides cereals, eggs, milk, OJ, and other things for breakfast and the kitchen is open to guests. The bathroom on the second floor is very fancy and the whole house shows a sense of style. :) Also, when we were not sure which bus to take to get to the main street, she even turned on her computer to check the schedule for us. We stayed for 3 nights and 4 days, and our experience at Jennifer's house was just amazing! I think the walk to the main street would have taken about 5-10 minutes but because we didn't have time to walk or wait for the buses, we used uber. The neighborhood seemed safe even at late nights like around 10-11. One thing was that the room felt a little cold, but i think it's because we always forgot to ask her how to change the temperature. Overall, we had a great time at her place and will definitely stay there again if we visit Boston."

Other than that,the neighbourhood is safe and quiet. The house is near Green Street T,which makes exploring the city easy. Although to be honest,because we were a huge group,taking Uber was a more convenient yet affordable alternative.,

It's clear that the host is renovating the building,so this is a work in progress.  I think a little walk around and some thought on what a guest needs would do the trick.,,,,

I arrive Saturday expecting it to be clean and in fairly good condition.  What I got was an old,"disgusting \"\"apt\"\" with a ratty-old couch.  It should be noted that although most listings involve apartments the host actually resides in","this \"\"apartment\"\" is strictly a business one",designed to be rented out.  With that in mind,expect it not to be kept in tip-top condition.,
It happened to be the coldest weekend of the year,however,I expected some insulation to keep the heat in and the cold out.  But no,I got 55 degrees in the living/bedroom area,and 40-45 degrees in the kitchen/bathroom area due to lack of insulation around the rear entrance that leads to the parking spot.  The heating was almost non-existent.,
Don't believe that parking is free because this guy charges $30/day...can we say false advertising?  Chef's kitchen? What a joke... just because you install a stainless steel stove and hood,doesn't make it so...I know what a chef's kitchen is because I HAVE ONE IN MY HOUSE.,,,,
After trying to contact his partner a couple of times the following morning with no response,I left because my boyfriend was on the verge of getting a cold from waking up to the cold and lack of (URL HIDDEN) fact,you could see your breath when exhaling!,,,
Shortly after 11 AM,his partner contacted us,presumably so the host could charge us another day,but luckily,I left already.  While talking and before I said we left,I was instructed to turn the oven on until he can bring a heater.  Turn on the oven...what is this
After contacting this scumbag for a partial refund of 1 day,initially he agreed to refunding half of the fee.  But after coming home,he turns around,says that he contacted an AirBnB resolution specialist,and was told to refund only some of the monies.  Then,after further argument
Bottom line,and point of this story folks,is if you want to freeze,and deal with a scumbag,then you have found your apt so you should rent from this guy.,
PS.  In one of his messages,this scumbag told me that I should stick to hotels because I'm taking advantage of AirBnB...talk about hospitality and nice manners,eh?  Sorry,"but I would like to be alive and not freeze.\"",,
7630346,65920013,2016-03-18,62046875,Fang Ni,"The host was very welcoming, where there was someone in the house to show us around the place. He even gave us a quick overview of what we could do in the area and places to visit. He left his number with us, and we were told to feel free to contact him if we needed anything."
The area was very convenient,with subway stations within walking distance. The area was quiet at night and it was overall a very good experience.,,,,

7630346,67969318,2016-04-01,32780492,Oliver,Alan's apartment was perfect for my family and I especially in terms of it being open-plan (important for our 2-month old daughter) and its accessibility to places of interest. Equally it was also very quiet and relaxing in the late evenings when we returned back to the property.
Although we did not meet Alan he was very helpful in providing suitable recommendations for places to eat / have breakfast. In summary,"we made a good choice in picking Alan's place!\"",,,,

7630346,73385474,2016-05-08,61794486,Richard,The owner met us at the apartment when we arrived (even when we were over an hour late). He explained the unit and the surrounding area...was very helpful. The unit was very clean and as described in the listing. It was pretty spacious for a studio. Pretty convenient to the train and to some nice coffee places.
7630346,73886207,2016-05-11,37939988,Chau,"The location was great, it's just a short walk away from the Boston Commons and a few blocks away from Chinatown.  The unit itself, however, is a different story.  Photos are a little deceptive, we felt as we were staying in a cheap motel.  Parking was also a disappointment as we were required to pay $30 a night when it was a parking spot on their private lot!  For the amount of money we paid for the room (200+ a night), we would have expected parking to be included.  Nonetheless, Eddie was great (although we did have a pillowcase missing) and the location was convenient."
7630346,74777141,2016-05-16,5742612,James,"Alan was extremely prompt in his communication which made us feel important. His property manager, Eddie, also communicated very quickly with us the day before our arrival and the day of our arrival.  We were in in the apartment only in the evenings for sleeping. As such, it met our needs and was convenient for meeting up with friends in the city. It was also a more economical option than the nearby hotels."
We arrived on a very early flight and Eddie pre-arranged to have the apartment ready for us. That was a HUGE plus!,,,,,
Note: The hooks on the wall were enough for our clothes. If your needs are less basic than ours,though,"you need to consider bringing clothes hangers. \"",,,
7630346,75220333,2016-05-19,68078396,Chris,"The listing is on a relatively quiet street right around the corner from the Hospital and the Theater district. It's a short walk to Boston Common, Beacon Hill, and other great locales that we made sure to visit during our stay. We were impressed by the general comfort of the studio apartment, and enjoyed the stay. We were very happy with the listing, and would gladly visit again if we were to come back to Boston in the future."

The apartment was true to the description and an easy 15 minute walk from South Station (which is on a free route from the airport). We found it easily located next to many T stops and within walking distance of some great restaurants and historic sites."

Also walkable distance to Boston Commons, grocery store, several restaurants. Quiet neighborhood, we felt safe walking back and forth to the T and from other areas. Shower had lots of hot water and good water pressure, bath towels were nice and thick.  The bed was comfortable; the sofa bed mattress was a little thin, however since it was a queen (? large double?) and I was the only one sleeping on it (5', 115 lb), I could sleep diagonally and be comfortable.   Check in and check out was quick and easy."

Definitely for the price the best thing about this property is how central this location is.,,,,,
You are right beside Tufts Medical center,which is right beside Chinatown. You are a hop skip and a jump from most tourist sites.,,,,
There place is old and on the ground level.   Between the creaking and the people walking by the front window in the morning this makes it noisy. But at night the street is very quiet. The air conditioner is very old and loud.  It works and we didn't have a problem with it.,,,,,
The place is relatively clean and has all the amenities for a short stay.  If you plan on staying home all day then this might not be the property for you.  But we were out all day and used the place to sleep and shower.,,,,,
There is a professional range and hood (full kitchen) but we don't use it.,,,,,
We drove in and paid the $30/day to park. It is expensive but compared to garages close by it was the same but you have in and out privileges.,,,,,
Alan had good communication.,,,,,
"I would recommend this to short stay travelers without hesitation.\"",,,,,

Alan is very responsive with communications, check-in was a breeze, and we found the first level apartment was exactly what we were looking for in an AirBnB."
Located within a 5 minute walk to the orange T line,Chinatown,and (most importantly in the morning) several coffee shops,the neighborhood felt very safe.  We paid for and utilized the parking spot,as we drove into town from Maryland.  This was one of the features that we were looking for,and while we were happy that we were able to park

7630346,93014687,2016-08-11,66595885,Tan,"Convenient location but paper thin ceiling and windows. One can hear conversation from pedestrian walking by, noise in hall way, and almost every movement up above you. Very difficult to sleep if you are a light sleeper. Boston is an old city so some of this will be expected but guests should be aware of these conditions."

7630346,96460729,2016-08-22,80588766,Ahad,Communication with Alan was always straightforward and prompt from the initial enquiry through to checkout. Alan was always keen to answer questions and was courteous and helpful.
The apartment was centrally placed and convenient to reach from the station with local shops and amenities only steps away.  The space was excellent for my daughter and I and the kitchen and bathroom were both well equipped and clean.,,,,,
Entry to the apartment using a combination system was very convenient and Alan's associate Eddie was always locally available to help with any questions and he personally came over to resolve an issue with the Internet service.,,,,,
I would suggest perhaps a deep clean of the rug in the bedroom area though this wasn't a big concern,it would further add to the already positive impression of this accommodation.,,,,

Also the Flatbook team was very accommodating when I forgot to leave the key as instructed. I will look to stay again and this time not take the key :) . I highly recommend this apt.

When we got there we realized we didn't know the apartment number  and it took well over three hours to get a response from the 24/7 customer service after calling/emailing/(SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN). Lucky there was a deli right nearby that we were able to wait in for a response. There was unfortunately no local information booklet that was advertised either.

However,the place itself was NOT as advertised,a couple of the important features were not accessible:,,,
First,we could not access the gym in the building.,,,,
Second,the roof deck was also inaccessible.,,,,
Both of these were because the building was being renovated. That is fine BUT it should have been advertised as such!,,,,,
If we would have known these things in advance we would have chosen a different place!,,,,,
I should point out that the host was very kind in trying to find alternative solutions,but these were unsatisfactory.,,,,

9840919,79081044,2016-06-11,15437940,Anna Maria,"Con mio marito abbiamo soggiornato 3 notti in questo appartamento nella prima metà di giugno. E' un grazioso appartamento, arredato con bei mobili, in un contesto gradevole di case vittoriane. La zona abbastanza tranquilla e comoda, ha una metropolitana a 10 minuti a piedi. Ci sono vari negozi e locali nei pressi.  Carino il living; la cucina un po'  essenziale. Il bagno un po' troppo piccolo, molto minimale.  Letto comodo in una stanza spaziosa. Non abbiamo incontrato l'host ma  abbiamo comunicato via email. Unico inconveniente è stato il rumore persistente proprio fuori dalla finestra della camera da letto, che le prime due notti, soprattutto la seconda, non ci ha permesso di dormire bene. Abbiamo scritto alla proprietaria che ha provveduto immediatamente e l'ultima sera siamo riusciti a riposare."
9840919,80416726,2016-06-18,7155523,Jane,Our arrival time was iffy and they made access easy with great communication. The neighborhood was quiet and within walking distance to both Fenway Park and the Harbor. I would definitely stay here again!
9840919,85851094,2016-07-13,74104496,Henry,"Very lovely flat- really enjoyed our stay. The host was very accommodating, and her recommendations were brilliant. Would definitely come back! The area is great for accessing all areas of Boston, both on foot and by the T with the nearest station only five minites walk away."

"Thanks to Ned.\"",,,,,
6554785,37080291,2015-07-04,19201012,Xiomara,"Thank you thank you Ned! Amazing apartment and in prime location. We walked to everything from here. The unit was immaculate which worked well since I'm a clean freak :) Apartment stayed cool, rooftop deck was a bonus and appreciated the netflix. Internet would stall a bit but never the less very grateful. This will definitely be my destination when ever I return."
6554785,37596635,2015-07-08,26207129,Christa,"This apartment is ideally located, especially for us since we were visiting our daughter who live nearby.  It was easy to walk to all the major tourist attractions and is also close to the subway entrances so that you can easily access other parts of the city.  We parked at the end of the red line and took the subway into the city.  Much cheaper!  The apartment was clean--really important to me--and felt very safe.  Ned was quick to respond during the pre arrival time.  We did not meet, but everything was ready for our arrival and since we had been to the area before, we didn't need much help.  Thanks, Ned, for a great visit.  We would be happy for the opportunity to book your apartment again.  It is a beautiful building and so well located.  We loved the rooftop access and watched sunsets over Boston as well as having a picnic up there for dinner one night.  Definitely a plus!"
6554785,37882941,2015-07-11,35958135,Steven,"Great place to stay. Gorgeous building with a lot of history, location is perfect, clean and well kept.

6554785,39032191,2015-07-20,35336833,Caitlin,"First time using airbnb if every experience is like this then we will likely never book a hotel again. Ned's place was neat and clean with all the proper amenities. The studio's location could not have been better. Two minutes walk from a main transit hub, tons of amazing food and shopping, the beautiful Boston Common right across the street and the view from the roof top deck was stunning. Anyone looking to experience Boston would be missing out on the best place to stay if they did not book with Ned. Getting in was easy and the area was safe and secure. The history of the building itself was even fascinating. Great experience overall."
6554785,39236230,2015-07-21,32437206,Michael,I arrived at the apartment late in the evening and left first thing in the (URL HIDDEN) loss because it was a superb place.  It reminded me of an awesome pre-war building I lived in in NYC.  The building and apartment were both immaculate and the location couldn't have been better.  I'll most certainly be back.

6554785,39779096,2015-07-26,33721875,Leah,"Ned is communicating very clear. We found a printed version of the house manual with additional details and also recommendations on restaurants, pharmacy, transportation etc. mostly helpful! Ned was a responsive host, replying our questions almost immediately.  Important to note that the apartment was very clean!! like in high-grade hotel!! the bed was comfortable."

6554785,40281061,2015-07-29,39154743,Jenny,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Ned's apartment for one night while seeing a concert in Boston.  The apartment is incredibly clean, comfortable, and very charming.  Ned takes great care in making the experience as seamless as possible - he even provides a binder with very helpful information (similar to a hotel information book), including check-in/out process, apartment rules and guidelines, and suggestions on places to see in Boston.  The bed was very comfortable, and the AC unit was working wonderfully, which was a huge benefit since it was 90 degrees on the day we visited.  The kitchen is nice and bright with a beautiful large window that overlooks the street below.  The rooftop deck provides breathtaking views of the state house and Boston Commons.  We have absolutely no complaints.  This was our first airbnb experience, and we are convinced that we will avoid hotels in the future since this went so smoothly.  We would love to stay at this apartment again.  Close to everything and absolutely beautiful!  We highly recommend."
6554785,40757405,2015-08-02,35211554,Brittany,My boyfriend and I stayed here on a short 4 day trip to Boston. I highly recommend staying at this listing! The apartment itself is located close to everything Beacon Hill has to offer as well as close enough to public transportation to travel around! Apartment was VERY CLEAN and AC window unit works great! Ned was a very gracious host providing great recommendations for things to do as well as places to dine! Very easily accessible. Great amenities in the apartment! Having laundry in the building was an added bonus! After a long day of sightseeing and walking it was nice to be able to enjoy our favorite shows on Netflix provided on the TV! I would stay here again and I will recommend staying here to anyone! Overall great experience!
6554785,41217017,2015-08-05,23974191,Belen,"Ned es muy agradable y logró que nos sintieramos muy bien. Ned dejó una carpeta con información sobre el edificio, el departamento y recomendaciones. El departamento es exactamente igual a las fotos y aún mejor. El edificio es hermoso y muy limpio. El departamento estaba muy limpio. Me encantó la cocina. Su ubicación es espectacular.

6554785,41411883,2015-08-07,37817592,Elaine,Perfect location to explore Boston. Host was very responsive and along with friendly doorman our check in was easy. They held our bags in the lobby while our unit was prepared. The apartment has everything you need for a comfortable stay in Boston.
6554785,41960944,2015-08-10,32779680,Véronique,"Ned nous a rapidement montré le studio qui est très agréable et très bien équipé. On sent que tout est neuf et propre. Le classeur laissé à l'intention des invités répond à toutes les questions et fournit plein de conseils (Whole Foods, restaurants, etc). Le studio est vraiment idéalement placé pour tout visiter à pied ou en métro (ligne rouge). La vue depuis la terrasse du toit est fantastique. Le service de concierge ans le hall de l'immeuble est aussi très pratique (je recommande le très sympathique Michel qui parle très bien français car il est Haïtien !). A recommander sans hésiter."
6554785,42420493,2015-08-13,37929679,MaryEllen,Absolutely perfect apartment close to everything with all the comforts of home!  Loved the views from the rooftop and our ability to walk everywhere from that location.  The information booklet provided by our host was top notch!  We highly recommend this apartment!
6554785,42686910,2015-08-15,35710933,Dan,"Our first time using Airbnb and a great one!  Ned was super responsive, the location was top-notch and we walked everywhere in the city with the apartment as a comfortable place to end a fun day.  We felt very safe and encountered lovely people in the building.  We took advantage of the sunsets on the rooftop deck.  We loved having a full kitchen to cook and save some money.  The linens, bed, etc were new and very comfortable.  We really appreciated the welcome book which gave all the important information we needed - like where to find a grocery store - Roche Bros. is awesome by the way.  We used Uber for the first time which was also a great experience.  Thank you so much!"
6554785,43386957,2015-08-19,36331152,Hannah,Ned has a truly awesome location close to all the attractions in Boston. He was very helpful in sorting out self check in procedures when we had a late flight. The place is comfortable and spotlessly clean.
6554785,43930838,2015-08-23,5272514,Sharon,"This place was so perfect for my parents' 5 day stay in Boston. My husband and I happen to live in the same building (Hotel Bellevue) and this studio met all of their needs -- right on the Freedom Trail, safe due to there being a concierge btw 9a-11p, a beautiful new open kitchen with gorgeous light with windows facing the Athenaeum, a big open studio space and a comfortable bed. Ned checked in to see if we had everything we need and responded quickly when I reached out. We will definitely book this place again when we have other friends/family members visit."
Note: Amenities we found particularly home-y were strong wifi,free use of a Netflix account,a dishwasher,"and a coffee maker with Columbian coffee for our use.\"",,
6554785,44448004,2015-08-26,25795076,Alyssa,"Good location, clean apartment, easy communication. Only note is that the AC is a window unit so it can get a tad warm when it's really hot out, but nothing you can't handle."
6554785,45661974,2015-09-05,35285553,Romi,"We spend ten days in here, feel like another (URL HIDDEN) true that Apartment close to everything !

Ele fica em uma excelente localização na cidade,  próximo a locais históricos,  bares, restaurantes,  farmácias e estação de metrô.  O apartamento é limpo, bem arrumado e tem tudo disponível para uma estadia bem tranquila. O contato com o Ned também é excelente: rápido e eficiente.  Recomendaremos o esse local para nossos amigos e, se voltarmos a Boston,  ficaremos nele novamente."
My girlfriend and I loved staying at Ned's apartment. It's in a great location,neer historical places,bars,restaurants,pharmacies and T station. The place is beautiful,clean and have everything you need for a nice stay. Communication with Ned was also great: fast and effective. We'll recommend this place to our friends and

Clean, neat and cozy apartment, spacious and very comfortable, more than just a studio because the kitchen is separated from the other room."
The price is so much cheaper than every hotel in all Boston area!,,,,,

6554785,50189504,2015-10-10,43193437,Katherine,"Ned was really great to work with. My husband and I were flying in late and then had a two-hour delay at the airport, but Ned was super accommodating for us. The only downside for us is that this unit does not have central air, nor a fan. The street is a little busy, so keeping the window open at night was just a little loud for us. Other than that, the unit was super spacious, very clean and comfortable!"
6554785,50432462,2015-10-12,34722533,Boyd,We really enjoyed our stay in Ned's apartment and would stay there again without a second thought.
The Good:,,,,,
- This apartment is perfectly located to walk,or take a train,to anywhere. Seriously,it doesn't get better.,,
- Comfortable bed and lounge,,,,,
- We didn't meet Ned,but we didn't need to. He was easily reached by phone or text,and check-in was made easy because the building has a doorperson.,,,
- The view from the roof is amazing - you should go out there straight away on arrival.,,,,,
The Not-So-Good:,,,,,
- The convenience store next door is horrible - not Ned's problem,just saying ...,,,,
- It takes 4 minutes for the water to get hot in the shower (but,once it gets hot it is great),,,,
"- Kitchen window needs a curtain - think about your mode of dress before going to the kitchen   >:-D\"",,,,,
6554785,50918495,2015-10-16,33139478,Dawn,"The apartment was perfect for our needs. It was much bigger than it appeared in the listing pictures, and the building is very smart with an amazing roof terrace. In terms of location, it really doesn't get any better- walking distance to the whole of central Boston and close to the transit system which was very easy to navigate."
We would definitely like to stay again,"thanks for making the booking so easy.\"",,,,
6554785,51694343,2015-10-24,34117059,Xander,Ned was a privilege to have as a host. His place was exactly as advertised and we were both thrilled with it! The neighbourhood is perfect for anyone visiting Boston for the first time (or any time for that matter!). It's close to everything and easy to locate. The rooftop patio was also a huge plus!
6554785,51792599,2015-10-24,30739094,Jordan,"This Airbnb was perfect. It was spotless when we arrived. The bathroom was spotless and looked to be brand new. It was smack in the center of Boston, literally across the street from the state house. It was directly above a little convenience market and a couple bars and close to absolutely everything. Very highly recommended. Absolutely painless check in and check out."

Very central in Boston, and easy to either walk to the main sights, or there is a very convenient metro stop just a short walk away, so very easy to get around. The view from the roof terrace is awesome, and a real highlight of this booking. A good spacious apartment with a nice comfy bed. Simple and clear arrival instructions, plus lots of detailed info about where best to park etc which we found really useful. We enjoyed our stay."

Not to mention it was so clean you could literally eat off the floors. All in all this made our weekend and we will definitely be back. Highly, highly recommend. Way better than any hotel and much more accommodating and affordable."

6554785,59097902,2016-01-06,51695479,Luling,"The location is great, and the house is nice and clean. The only problem is when I had leaved the bathroom after shower, the pole for hanging shower curtain just fell itself."
6554785,59577111,2016-01-12,4407145,Ana Elisa,"Staying here was awesome. Ned was extremely easy to be in touch with. The building has a staffed front desk, so I was fine leaving my bag there until I could check in to the apartment--then Ned was kind enough to make arrangements and email to let me know I would be able to check-in earlier than expected. Thanks to the front desk, check-in and out was seamless. The building was also very easy to find."
"The location was close to everything: the \"\"T\"\"",buses,Boston Common,museums,downtown,restaurants
The apartment was incredibly comfortable and the photos are definitely accurate. I would just add that the closet is walk-in and definitely roomy and the kitchen is also great: large for a studio apartment! The bathroom was as pristine as the rest of the apartment,and the shower had great pressure (hey,I can't be the only one that cares about this!). The bed made it really hard to get up in the morning :) The street can be busy during the day,but it definitely quiets down by around dinner time so this light sleeper had no problems getting some rest.,,
The building also recycles,which was great to see.,,,,

The location was fantastic, walking distance to many great venues and necessities like the grocery store and CVS.  There's plenty of light that comes through the kitchen and main room windows, so the place is bright and cheerful, even on a winter's day.  The bed is very comfortable and there is a large walk-in closet to stash luggage and such out of the way during your stay."

Literally a block away from the Park Red Line train stop that is a main hub and will take you almost anywhere. Ned's place was clean, comfortable and convenient. He has everything you need at his place- yes - everything, right down to saran wrap so I could wrap a new tattoo. The front desk guys are sweet as pie and the area is safe. We dug staying at Ned's. 10/10."

The location is superb - under 5 minutes to grocery, shopping districts and historical sites. We didn't get to meet Ned in person, but he is very responsive by texts and answered all the questions that we had. Thank you for everything Ned! We'd be very happy to stay here again."
6554785,64819517,2016-03-08,56883974,Eric,"It is a great place in a very desirable spot in Boston right next to the Boston Commons and the State House. Very easy public transit options since it is so centrally located. There are lots of restaurants, bars, and entertainment in the area."
The space itself has everything you need including a fully equipped kitchen and TV/Internet. It is probably best for up to two people since the bed and living area are in the same room.  It is in a beautiful building with a door person available for questions or to keep your luggage while you are exploring Boston.,,,,,
Ned was able to quickly and accurately able to answer any question we had,making our stay that much better.,,,,
"Great spot to visit Boston for a long weekend!\"",,,,,
6554785,65771658,2016-03-17,49271573,Michael,"The Statehouse (the free tour's great} is the official centre of Boston and as this apartment is next door, it really couldn't be more central. In fact, our intention was to get a weekly ticket for the T but didn't bother as we could walk (Boy did we walk!) to anywhere of interest."
Boston's a lovely city for a short break and this was a warm and welcoming base to return to after a long days sightseeing. Furnished and decorated to a high standard and cleaned to within an inch of its life,it felt like a home from home. The building itself has great charm. As well maintained as the room and a frisson of the gothic such that you half expected Mia Farrow to be in the laundry or Ruth Gordon to call with cake.( IMDB 1968 if you're too young}.,,,,

It was exactly what we were looking for and was so close to everything we wanted to visit. It was right on the corner of Boston Common. The apartment was spacious and quiet and the was very secure - a doorman was on watch. The roof terrace was a real treat and we enjoyed spending some time up there watching the sunset.

At most it was a 15 minute walk from every place we wanted to go, including the North End, Financial District, and Seaport. Beautiful building with very nice doormen. Even held our bags when we arrived early and after we checked out so that we could explore the city before our flight. In walking distance to restaurants, bars, and groceries on the street and around true corner. Right next to Boston Commons. Looking forward to coming back. Thanks Ned!"

Their neighbourhood was very quiet, safe, and charming.  Their guest room looks out from the top floor and is bright, airy, and spacious.  Their shower had good water pressure and temperature.  There were several excellent, well priced breakfast spots and bars within walking distance.  During the snowstorm, it was a quick 3 block walk to the Orange Line so I didn't miss out on anything even when the snow hit."
10253591,69304162,2016-04-10,3168406,Miguel,"Very good option for a budget stay at Boston. Sarah and Bill were nice hosts and their place is pleasant. The room is comfortable, with a nice bed, and the apartment is really just around the corner from Stony Brook station (less than five minutes walking). From there, you get to downtown in about 15 minutes, and to the Museum of Fine Arts in 5-10 minutes. You can also find good places to eat at Jamaica Plains, such as The Haven Scottish pub and ULA cafe."

10253591,73070372,2016-05-06,62840420,Susan,Not an awesome experience but certainly not terrible. The room was nice and clean with towels provided. They were also kind enough to let us store food and drinks in the fridge.
Our main complaint was that she called us two days before our arrival and offered money for us to find another place because they had a surprise family guest. We had booked a month in advance. Totally understandable but we hadn't the time to find a new spot in the area and were hoping for some sort of a discount or consideration for the adjustment in space and time. The guest ended up sleeping on the couch. Also the address was given incorrectly and we knocked on the wrong door for a time before calling Sarah and being led to the correct place. What if she had not been there?,,,,,
The toilet paper ran out after the first day  and was not replaced ever and we couldn't find any hiding about,not a huge deal but frustrating.,,,,

The instructions that were provided were clear and easy to follow. The description of the listing was spot on. The home was extremely comfortable. The kitchen was particularly well equipped and made meal preparations enjoyable. The neighborhood was quiet and central to many interesting sites (the house is only blocks away from the James Blake House, the oldest residential structure in Boston). It is also located very close to the T-station for easy access to most parts of Boston. We will certainly look into staying again when we are in the area. Meaghan was a great host."
3394437,30324038,2015-04-20,12434151,Stacy,"Our stay here was perfect! The house and neighborhood were exactly as described. Meaghan provided every detail needed via email and was easy to reach by text and email. Our group of seven guests fit very comfortably, and it was great to have three full modern, clean bathrooms available to use. We were there to cheer on our friend who ran the Boston Marathon. One of us arrived by plane, two by Amtrak, and the rest of us drove from Delaware. Getting there was a piece of cake by all methods. Walking to the T to go downtown was also easy, although we chose to drive when we went in on Sunday for the Marathon Expo. There are a variety of options in the neighborhood for eating breakfast, lunch and dinner. We ordered Indian delivery one night, and ate at Harp & Bard another night. McKenna's was a perfect local breakfast hangout. Everything was comfortable and clean, and tastefully decorated. We especially enjoyed Meaghan's quirky taste in artwork. The alarm system made us feel secure since we were unfamiliar with the area, but it is a gentrifying neighborhood with many beautifully restored Victorian and American four-square style homes."

We're a family of 4 with two teen daughters. The house is huge! We took over the dining room to open all our suitcases for easy access. One consideration for some might be the stairs. There's a flight from the street/driveway parking to the front door. Then another to the second floor bedrooms & family room, and another to the third floor bedroom and bathroom. Although there are 3 full bathrooms in the house the shower in the 2nd floor bath is being renovated. The remaining 2 were fine for us but if you must have 3, ask M if the renovation is finished. The 3rd floor bedroom had no air con and was too hot for sleeping (we visited in July). But the sofa in the aircondioned family room was comfy for our younger daughter."
The immediate neighborhood is not the greatest for food,shops,services,etc. But Boston is a compact city and we navigated to a variety of great spots with the help of our constant companions: (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) and (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Maps.,,

3668038,20637158,2014-10-02,4575512,Jonathan,Wonderful! Great place and people.
3668038,21023615,2014-10-09,4575512,Jonathan,"Great people, clean place would definitely recommend!"

3668038,23609327,2014-12-06,22386885,Jeffrey,"My stay at Kathleen's was a fantastic experience.  She was very accommodating with my check in time. The room was warm, bed comfortable, facilities worked as expected. I found street parking not too far away."
3668038,25065001,2015-01-05,3285646,Sarah,"While Kathleen & co weren't there due to the terrible weather, I had a lovely time with their cat, Kina. They were able to be reached, the parking was available and overall it was great."
3668038,28684173,2015-03-28,29812777,Samantha,"The house was clean and very pretty, the room was comfortable and clean as well, and it's especially nice that Kathleen leaves cold drinks and some toiletries for her guests in case they forget things.  That extra touch was really nice.  I appreciated her hospitality, and she answered my questions about getting around town very well."
3668038,28762426,2015-03-29,29922548,Rachel,I couldn't have asked for a better first Airbnb experience. Kathleen was very welcoming and the room is very cute. The little touches like a fridge with cold drinks were very sweet.
Additionally,"the animals are adorable. There's a super sweet corgi - need I say more? \"",,,,
3668038,34181263,2015-06-05,1226736,Chris,"Five stars all the way! Kathleen was flexible on the check-in time as I was running a bit later than expected and gave me a tour of her place, which is beautiful. The room is very comfortable and cozy, I slept REALLY easily. She has two beautiful dogs that are friendly and playful. Everything was extremely clean, the room, the house, the bathroom... and the location is great. Although it may look far on the map, it's actually well connected to popular touristy areas in Boston. Less than two minutes from the house is a bus that will take you into the Boston area, and you can make connections from there to go to places like Harvard Square or the city of Somerville. In Brighton, there's a good variety of places to go dining and go out to the bars. Also there's a delicious and cheap breakfast place about 15 minutes walking, which is where I had to catch a direct bus to Harvard Square, making it super convenient for my needs. I highly recommend this place!"
3668038,34261782,2015-06-06,3511334,Robert,"This was a perfect match for me.  Friendly and interesting hosts in a quiet neighborhood.  Small, but comfortable room with access to the rest of the house and walking distance to the center of Boylston.  A nice BNB experience and a great value."
3668038,43462878,2015-08-19,41632929,Jessica,Great place!   Kathleen was a very gracious  host .  She was very insightful  about  Boston . And very prompt responding to my last minute (36hr) request for booking. Her home was very clean and her pets are very friendly. I would definately  recommended  this  listing .
6709682,35160495,2015-06-15,35105325,William,"I had a really nice stay, my bed was super comfortable, the room was really beautiful, and the apartment is very nice. Emma, the host, is friendly and will respond to any question about the place very quickly. The neighborhood is a convenient location and safe. it is a 8 minute walk to the orange line and right next to North Eastern campus.  It took 15 minute to get downtown. I totally recommend staying here. :)"
6709682,35510682,2015-06-19,3333197,Roland,"I had a great stay at Emmas. The apartment is very comfortable, really neat and superclean. Nice dining & living room with HDMI connectable TV. Fast internet, comfy bed, full tactical kitchen and a hot power shower. Just what I needed for my 3 day stop in Boston.   Supermarket, restaurants and even a liquor store right outside the door and the subway station around the corner. I was lucky...Emma cooked me a tasty soup the first evening of my stay. Thank you for everything Emma...I will be back !!!"
6709682,37357894,2015-07-06,33696090,Mauro,"This was my first time using airbnb and I was not dissapointed at all. The room and the apartment in general were very clean and organized. The location was great as well given that it's very close to Northeastern. Overall, I had a very comforting experience and I would definitely recommend this to anyone!"
6709682,38327677,2015-07-14,2537192,Angel,"Staying at Emma's was great. She was very friendly. We stayed for 4 nights and never had any issues. The apartment was clean and in a great area. It was close to the Northeastern campus. As others have noted it is about an 8 minute walk to the orange line, many restaurants are also in walking distance. This place is a great value for the location. I would definitely stay again if I was doing another quick tour of Boston."
6709682,38754430,2015-07-18,35150372,Yuichiro,She warmly welcomed me during my entire stay! The location is   very convenient and easy to get around the city. I was satisfied with the room where it was clean and comfortable. I hope I would stay her house again while stay in Boston next year.
6709682,41963503,2015-08-10,33251840,Mathieu,"Bonne chambre, bon quartier, bien placé, tranquille"
6709682,42431354,2015-08-13,37382342,Santiago,"Emma was very attentive to us. We had a little problem with the keys, and she answered very quickly. The room and the house are just as they show in the pictures. The neighborhood is 20 mins walking from town center. Neighborhood is safe but not very fancy. There are not many restaurants nearby, but we found one very nice and crowded of young people in the evening, and a very interesting so-named charly's cafe jazz-club with 5 dollar beers!"

6709682,44304232,2015-08-25,36675610,Gloria,"Fue muy sencillo comunicar con Emma, que entre todo es muy simpática. La habitación es como se veía en las fotos y en general la casa estaba limpia. Recomendaría esta habitación."
6709682,64208029,2016-03-01,36057043,玮,"From Jan 29 to February 21. There is a pub just 70 ft far away, and it is noisy during weekends. No laundry within building, need 15 to 20 minutes walk for washing cloths. Normal day will be fine, but it will be challenging after storms. TV only have several local channels, and unfortunately I missed the super bowl and all star games this year."
6709682,65987686,2016-03-18,60967877,Meg,"I did not meet Emma in person, just emails but she was a really nice host. Check-in instructions are clearly given by emails. It is really close to bus station so it was easy to move around. The room was really clean and private, I really had a good time staying here."
6709682,67641666,2016-03-30,50547477,Allen,"Overall, my experience at Emma's place was wonderful and as described. The location was as described, nearby the downtown Boston area for convenience. Emma was not around, but maintained very good contact by text messages that turned out rather helpful. The location is around a campus so outside the apartment, it can be rowdy, but perfectly quiet indoors."
6709682,69200686,2016-04-10,52673219,Raya,"Although I never met Emma, she was very helpful in her descriptions of how to access the apartment. The location was superb and the accommodation was very clean."
6709682,72032556,2016-04-30,52385412,Immanuel Amrita,Lovely room In a very central area. Very close to Massachusetts avenue and ruggle tube station. Room was cleaned and maintained well. All amenities provided and available and good internet. Emma was easily contactable and gave very good information welcoming us in. Very organized. Room was a little small but convenient and we didn't really mind it eventually. The area is a bit rough around the edges but I wouldn't call it unsafe. Overall a good stay.
6709682,82459830,2016-06-27,44766837,Cyrielle,Our stay at Emma's place was great! The room was clean and comfortable. We enjoy the possibility to cook and there is a supermarket very close to the flat which is super convenient . If we come back in Boston one day we'll book at Emma's place again
6709682,83624032,2016-07-03,46902996,Felix,"Gute zweckmäßige Unterkunft, günstig gelegen und ein guter Preis in sonst recht teuren boston. Perfekte Kommunikation und Einweisung durch den Gastgeber. Sauberkeit absolut einwandfrei. Klimaanlage Baubedingt etwas nervig da direkt auf betthöhe montiert aber sonst wirklich alles bestens dort."
6709682,85209702,2016-07-10,66531834,Eileen,"Emma is lovely. I didn't meet her in person but she answers every question very patiently. The house is easy access, nice and perfectly clean. The area is not absolutely pretty but close to most sights (20 min walk to prudential tower). Would definitely book again with her."
6709682,85866299,2016-07-13,58031912,Antonia,The room at Helen was fine. After difficulties with the key everything was good. The apartment was clean and orderly. Our room was small but for two days it was okay. The bathroom was clean. Thank you for the nice stay at your apartment.
6709682,87942455,2016-07-22,28092527,Jethro,Emma was elusive but her place was well kept and convenient. There are plenty of nice cafes and good transport link within walking distance. I would recommend for the solo traveler looking to visit Boston/Cambridge.
6709682,89496756,2016-07-28,68447023,Lynn,"I enjoyed my stay, the room was good size and the bed was comfortable, was a close walk to NEU, no AC in living room/kitchen so I stayed in my room most of the time. Towel, shampoo, hangers provided. Check-in was easy. Wifi, tv, full kitchen. Great deal!"
6709682,90432508,2016-08-01,30314356,Véronique,"My stay was very nice, everything was clean and well organize. Emma was very nice with us. The appartment isn't too far from downtown. My only negative point is that the bed was unconfortable."
6709682,91100648,2016-08-03,71969718,Carlos,"The room is as described in the ad. It is in an apartment with other rented rooms. We didn't meet Emma but we neither needed her during our stay. Previously, she quickly answered our doubts by email. The room is very clean, with a quite comfortable bed and well wifi connection. However, the apartment is located far away from city centre and the neighbourhood is not cosy nor lively."
6709682,92453403,2016-08-08,58556748,Marie,We stayed for four nights and everything went alright. The room was nice and Emma texted back right away when ever we had questions. Thanks for hosting us.
6709682,93546890,2016-08-13,40534309,Ryan,"We had an excellent (EMAIL HIDDEN)munication was great. We were missing a towel, issue was resolved within half an hour."
"Location is close to a train station and only a few stops from the city centre or a 40 minute walk. Also close to Fenway Park.\"",,,,,
6709682,94706262,2016-08-16,53388122,Franziska,"Getting inside the building and the apartment was very easy, as Emma provided us with all the information we needed beforehand. The apartment was just the way as viewed on the pictures, maybe even with more space than expected. Although sharing the apartment with other guests, it was always quiet and we had our privacy. The kitchen was very well equipped and we even got to cook there. The neighbourhood seems safe and very nice. The place is close to public transport but also walkable to downtown in 30 minutes. We enjoyed our stay."
533152,11737165,2014-04-14,11403568,Spencer,"I had a fantastic experience with this apartment. Our host was flexible with our check-in time, and we had no complaints during our stay. Also, the balcony overlooking downtown Boston was really neat. I would definitely stay at this location again."
533152,21080959,2014-10-11,20269964,Philipp,"We had a very pleasant stay in this very comfortable, sunny and modern apartment. You can drive by Bus or take a short walk to the metro where Downtown is just 3 stations away. We can recommend the restaurant next to the house, very good meals!"
533152,33578267,2015-05-30,7867192,Mark,Beautiful place in a great location.  Love the balcony.  Highly recommended.
533152,55061448,2015-11-27,17021345,Johannes,"Lance's place was fantastic. He was flexible with my check-in time, there was nothing to complain about during my stay. The place is beautiful in a great location. Amazing balcony. Highly recommended."
533152,58289662,2016-01-02,24237958,Dee,"This is the BEST experience I have with Airbnb so far. Mobile check-in & check-out, no need to carry keys around, Metro station within walking distance, great view on the balcony. Detailed instructions and suggestions can be found in their mobile app.  I highly recommend it and would definitely stay in Lance's place again."
533152,66976601,2016-03-26,39956185,Mick,We stayed here for 2 weeks and everything was perfect. Great location for train service or just to walk into Boston centre.

533152,68210570,2016-04-02,989673,Paul,"Thanks for a fantastic stay! The apartment was beautiful, well furnished, and well maintained. The bed was particularly comfortable. Check in and check out were very easy. All around a good experience."
533152,72371208,2016-05-02,69341261,Carrie,"\"I had such a great stay at \"\"the Penthouse\"\" - I highly recommend it for anyone looking to stay near downtown Boston.  I needed to be accessible to the city for the weekend and needed someplace quiet and comfortable to get work done and this space was perfect!  Lance was very responsive to any inquiries I had and"
533152,76077562,2016-05-24,33605327,Rafaela,"The company was the only problem we had during our stay, we scheduled an extra day because we were going to arrive very late in the night, but the code sent was not working and we tried to contact the company through email, all the available phone numbers and the app, but nothing worked. At the end we couldn't access the unit until the next morning, when, finally, someone got back to us. The apartment is great and the location is good, but not so close to main atractions of Boston. If you are going to arrive on a weekend or not in business hours I woldn't recommend based on my experience."
533152,78118437,2016-06-05,37986803,Gaëlle,"The appartment was absolutely great and very clean, all furbished, only a little bit noisy (but then, Boston is a large city with a lot of traffic, so I suppose this can't be avoided). Messages from our host on what we should do on arrival and departure were very clear and we had a wonderful stay."
533152,81529259,2016-06-23,35509321,Pam,"We did not meet Lance or anyone from the company, however, the service was excellent. Wonderful apartment, great views, space, clean & well stocked. Nice neighbourhood & easy to get around on the T line. Traffic noise was the only negative."
533152,88873184,2016-07-25,66524574,Tina,Communication with Lance was quick! He has wonderful customer service and was willing to accommodate special request (Ie. Late check out). The apartment was clean and met all my needs for my trip to Boston. Thank you Lance and Swank Properties!
11255643,64655211,2016-03-06,57720826,Jaakko,"My first experience with airbnb. Grace and her friend are nice and helped me to get around in Boston. Good connections with bus and subway (T-line). Many restaurants, shops and markets around. Good kitchen and bathroom. Bed and desk in living room. Old house with some precautions in use of electricity and toilet paper."
11255643,65073253,2016-03-10,34649258,Jiaying,"the house located in a very great district, which has plenty of supermarkets including Asia supermarket. and the traffic of the district is convenient. although the room which I rented for 3 days is in the living room, it's still private and comfortable. And I like the layout of the room. Grace, who has the same first name like me, is a nice girl and a nice owner.^^."
11255643,65844289,2016-03-17,60289696,Xianzhou,"The heat in the apartment is pretty warm, just like my two hosts. Grace and Shao are such nice hosts that we turned out to be good friends. They drove me to an alpaca farm, and we had a lot of fun there. My room is super clean, same as the restroom and kitchen. Although the bed room is converted by a living room, I didn't feel any inconvenience because of the shields. Little surprises were every where. Grace left cute notes for me on walls and mirrors, making me feel welcomed. The transportation is super convenient. I have visited Boston for several times, and Grace's apartment has the most convenient transportation with both bus station and train station right next to the apartment. Both Chinese market and American market are in one-minute-walk distance. In a word, I have met the five-star hosts and the five-star apartment. Highly recommend to people visiting Boston. You will fall in love with the place and the hosts."
11255643,66068769,2016-03-19,59082477,Jay,"I was in Boston to visit the BU campus and Grace's apartment was in an ideal location. It is a quick walk from both a bus and subway stop (Packard Square). Grace was flexible with my travel plans and was able to accommodate my check-in and check-out times. The apartment and bathroom were clean, well-kept, and quiet. The bed was also warm and comfortable. Grace was helpful with advice regarding where to eat and how to get around Boston. This place is ideal for solo travelers such as myself who wish to avoid the steep prices of Boston hotels. I would definitely recommend this listing."
11255643,66747073,2016-03-24,40409036,Roberto,"Grace and Shao were wonderful hosts. So very nice and helpful. The apartment is lovely and the room was perfect.  Sharing the bathroom was not a problem at all.  The apartment was very clean and had great access to the public transit system just a few steps away. Overnight parking is an issue if you have a car, but that goes for most of Boston. I would love to stay here any time. I would give them 10 stars if I could."
11255643,67958017,2016-04-01,39601849,Shuhui,Grace and her roommate are super nice host! The location is convenient for both food and transportation.

11255643,68942229,2016-04-07,44884608,Rose,I stayed for just one night but Grace made me feel very at home. I felt almost like a roomate. She explained quickly the rules of the house and walked me to my room. It was very lovely. Not a lot of privacy but it was perfect for a short stay.
11255643,69866728,2016-04-14,33323873,Qi,"Grace and Shao were really nice hosts, very flexible when trying to accommodate your schedules. I booked the room for my parents. They really enjoyed their stay. The room is clean and spacious. Location is very close to a Chinese supermarket, which makes shopping for groceries really easy. And it's just 1 min away from T stop, so quite convenient to commute to downtown Boston."

11255643,70235989,2016-04-17,54537934,Tyler,"This was a nice apartment in a great part of town (Boston University). Grace and her roommate were extremely nice and willing to do whatever was necessary to ensure I had a great stay. They have 1 bed in a closet-like room if you want privacy, as well as a bigger bed in the living room area. Overall, it was great."
11255643,70655463,2016-04-19,59026203,Tsukasa,Grace and her roommate were very friendly and nice host. The location is very convenient to go to down town by train. The room was clean and comfortable. I visited there for the Boston Marathon. I was very grad to see the message of their cheer that was written on the bathroom's mirror.
11255643,72078394,2016-05-01,46343372,Adrien,The host canceled this reservation 25 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

They also provided lots of information about getting around Boston, restaurants and food in the area, and answered all my questions both during the booking process and after I arrived. The room was very clean and exactly as described. The location is near a T stop so it made getting around Boston super easy. I would highly recommend this listing for young people looking for an easy and convenient place to stay in Boston."
11255643,77781335,2016-06-03,53588799,Layne,The room was exactly as described. Grace was an extremely welcoming and accommodating hostess.

11255643,83451364,2016-07-03,71310571,Sylvain,Grace and her roommate were very friendly hosts. They helped me find the place and made sure that I was comfortable. I stayed only one night but I found everything I needed. The only downside is that the room on the picture was not entirely private (but separated from a common space by a curtain).
11255643,84669242,2016-07-08,2323018,Nicolette,"Grace was an exceptional host! She personifies what Airbnb was started for, a simple and efficient service where customer value is at the centre. The apartment was incredibly clean from the bathroom to the room and was a very welcoming space! I stayed in the bedroom (not the portioned off space) and it really was like a hotel experience! I hardly heard Grace during my stay and using the bathroom was never an issue which made everything so private."
In terms of location,Packard's corner T stop is literally across the street and makes touring Boston really simple.,,,,

La cama es mejor que lo que se ve en la foto, donde aparece un futón, lo que en realidad hay es una cama de dos plazas. El sector es un barrio universitario, muy cercano a la Universidad de Boston, parecía seguro, hay varios restaurantes y está a pasos del Metro (T). En lo malo, la dirección que aparece no es la que corresponde a su departamento. La dirección corresponde a un restaurant oriental. Al llegar hay que llamarla por teléfono para que ella te vaya a buscar, por lo que hay que tener teléfono habilitado. No hay aire acondicionado, ni ventilador y tampoco acceso a cocina."

11255643,91709413,2016-08-06,37976324,Ellen,"Grace and her roommate are very nice and accommodating. The room is very clean so is the bathroom. The location is perfect for tourist like us and yet very quite in the evening. Although there is no AC the hosts provided us with a big fan and it wasn't very hot in Boston during our stay.   It was a lovely stay, thank you~"

The room does not have air condition, but the outside air conditioner machine of other rooms made a big noise, together with the noise of the fan of our own room, made us difficult to fall asleep. No towel prepared. No TV, no table, and the living room is small. The rest room is shard."

5999291,33263975,2015-05-26,31226624,Genevieve,My boyfriend and I came to Boston for the long weekend and we were absolutely thrilled with the apartment! The online description was exactly what we found when we unlocked the door. The entire place was very clean and well decorated. Allison was very responsive to all the questions I had both before and during our trip. We spent all Sunday morning just relaxing on the couch and it was so nice to have the space instead of being in a tiny little hotel room. Towels were laid out when we arrived and there was plenty of room in the fridge to store some of the leftovers we had.
We felt comfortable with the neighborhood which was quiet but close enough to downtown so we had no problem getting where we wanted to go. Parking was a bit crowded but after a lap around the surrounding blocks we found a (free) place to park without much difficulty! We felt very safe leaving our car as it was clearly a nice area.,,,,,
"This was an awesome experience and I would definitely suggest staying here if you are in Boston.\"",,,,,
5999291,36441014,2015-06-28,2368544,Helen,"Beautiful 1Br with everything you need for your stay, Allison was a great host and was super responsive both via airbnb and text. She left easy instructions for our arrival and an info sheet for our stay. The apartment was clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is pretty and quiet, about 15 min walk to the nearest red line stop and under 10 min for coffee, food etc."
While you are on a residential street,"everything was fairly easily accessible. Overall great experience! \"",,,,
5999291,37184149,2015-07-05,21745479,Tim,"The apartment is very nice -- cute, spacious, and in a nice neighborhood. Indeed a 8$/10 minute Uber ride from downtown which was great for getting into the city. Allison was very helpful and accommodating to our travel schedule."
5999291,38267612,2015-07-14,15895614,New,Cute and convenient!  Apartment was easy to find and walking distance to many stores and public transportation.

Great location to get to all areas of the city. Allison and Josh couldn't have made our first air bnb experience any better!
5999291,41953727,2015-08-10,14164675,Karen,Allison's apartment was great--very clean and located in a great neighborhood close to public transportation (and the beach!). We would definitely stay here again.
5999291,43080748,2015-08-17,18760261,Shane,This trip couldn't have been any easier! The entire process from start to finish was incredibly easy. Not to mention that the location of the apartment was ideal.

5999291,78094929,2016-06-05,7706956,Michelle,Allison's apartment was exactly as advertised. Getting the keys from the lockbox couldn't have been easier and the apartment was spotless. It was in a great neighborhood close to public transit to take you to the city (or a $7.00 uber ride if you just dont feel like bussing it). We found parking for our weekend stay about 4-5 blocks away. I would definitely stay here again or recommend it to someone.
5999291,83347071,2016-07-02,39425499,Meghan,"Allison's apartment was amazing, the description was entirely accurate and the space itself was bright, clean and very homely! The bed is comfortable and the massive tv is a great bonus. Allison made sure our arrival process was as smooth as possible and even left a list of her favourite places in the area. Thanks so much for letting us stay and if we are back we will be in contact!"
5999291,87055497,2016-07-18,74153723,Rebecca,Alison and Josh did a great job of prepping the apartment and making me feel welcome (complete with flowers!)
The location was great for me (I was taking a class near the convention center and walked there and back every day.) Easy bus access to downtown was literally a block away. And the most pleasant feature to me was that there's a beautiful sandy beach and waterfront path just 2 blocks away (which was great,as I was there in the midst of a bit of a heat wave- nice to get down to the water!),,,,
"I really enjoyed my stay in Southie at Alison and Josh's. \"",,,,,
5999291,91465027,2016-08-05,85651089,Alex,This is a super nice apartment exactly as described and pictured. Allison was extremely nice and accommodating of my requests and made sure the check in process was as smooth as possible. The place is in a nice quiet area of Southie only a couple blocks from the beach and makes for a very peaceful and pleasant stay. Highly recommend to anybody looking for a mellow and relaxing stay in Boston.
5999291,92746121,2016-08-09,40725822,Amy,Allison and Josh left me a welcome not with specific instructions. She also communicated information by email. Apartment was nice and surprisingly in a very quiet area of Southie. Was about a mile walk to the T station (Broadway) but a $6.00 Uber ride. About half mile walk to most restaurants. Also close to Bus stop but mostly I walked. Great place and I would definitely stay there again.  Was nice having the A/C unit as it was pretty hot the few days I stayed. Easy access to apartment keys so check in was a breeze.

My girlfriend and I got everywhere in Boston in under 25 minutes including Fenway Park and Boston Common. Even in the quiet neighborhood, Jamaica Plain has a great restaurant area with a bunch of Indian and Thai restaurants only a 10 minute walk from Leo's place. Whenever I'm back in Boston, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again in a second. Thanks Leo!"
2621242,17414358,2014-08-11,19297292,Mara,Leo made us feel very comfortable! Was able to text him any questions we had and he responded very promptly. The listing was very accurate. The apt is small but very lovely. It was very clean and cozy. It was literally around the corner from Stony Brook train station (orange line). Very quiet neighborhood! It was also very easy to find parking every time.
2621242,17888355,2014-08-18,19594071,Ofer,"Cute and quiet apartment, located 3 minutes walk from the Orange Line (local subway). Leo was really nice and kind to us and host us really good!"

2621242,18180198,2014-08-23,17936058,Toni,Someone met us in the apartment when we arrived to show us around and to leave the key with us. The neighborhood is lovely and felt very safe for all the walking around we did at night. The apartment is comfortable and very clean.

It was so nice to be able to make breakfast in the awesome kitchen, have a safe neighborhood to park in, and and have a comfortable bed to sleep in. Those things are not always the case at Airbnb homes. I will definitely be back and would 100% recommend it to anyone staying in the Boston area."
7921649,76281203,2016-05-26,37541659,Ladi,"The house was extremely neat, room was exactly as described/depicted in the pictures. Neighborhood was nice and quiet. Very happy with the service."

7921649,76765722,2016-05-29,2032925,Catarina,"The room was as advertised--clean, well appointed, good closet space--all in all, a great retreat. I wish I had had more time to enjoy the outdoor deck! I would definitely consider staying again during a future trip to the area. Bonus: really solid A/C, which came in handy when one day during our trip hit 91 degrees."
Checkin/checkout was a cinch,and I appreciated the ability to store our belongings during the interim between when we needed to be out of the room and when our flights departed. Bonus: you are able to lock your room for added safety of your person and belongings.,,,,
The apartment is close to a grocery store,a Hubway bike dock,fast food,the freeway,and a short cab/Uber/Lyft ride to Harvard Square. Set aside between $3 and $10 per trip depending on the service and the time. The neighborhood is calm and quiet,though not very trafficked

As the process is entirely automated we did not meet Todd in person,but he was very approachable and available for question.,,,,
The house is very nicely design with a big kitchen and living room. It was a great opportunity to meet the other guests and have nice chats over the morning coffee.,,,,,
The neighborhood is pleasant,though not exciting. It is only one bus to downtown Boston and there is a supermarket and a few restaurants just a few minutes work.,,,,

I had my breakfast everyday on the deck, it was so quiet and pretty."

13113079,75828980,2016-05-23,30129109,Karin,"Staying with Robert was my first Airbnb experience and it was a positive one. Robert was easy to communicate with and courteous to deal with. The room is quite large & private being downstairs with him staying upstairs and leaving you the whole downstairs area, incl. a bathroom. The location is good, and the area quite vibrant with enough types of shops to see you through food and otherwise."
"My only issue was that sound from walking etc upstairs is carried downstairs which woke me up in the night. But overall a good place to crash in South Boston at a reasonable rate.\"",,,,,
13113079,80219942,2016-06-17,12608172,Chandler,This is an awesome place to stay! Highly recommend it. Five minute über to the convention center and walking distance to bars/food. Great room and clean place. Robert was very welcoming and gave us recommendations on local spots to be sure to hit.
13113079,87970795,2016-07-22,77928796,Frank,"My stay was OK, but a couple of issues. I never interacted with Robert during my stay, except for a text message, but he was very nice and helpful. The accommodations were in the basement, where I stayed alone, which was converted into two secluded bedrooms and one bathroom. The issues: the room itself doesn't have a proper door, but an improvised folding accordion door that offers less privacy, and actually made me a bit uncomfortable as it doesn't lock or secure to the opposite wall. Additionally, the basement smells very strongly of something like pet urine, although it may have been a chemical of some kind (there was no visible uncleanliness). Whatever it was, it was enough to give me quite an allergic (sinus) reaction. Overall, I would say that for the $200+ per night total that I paid, I expected a bit more."
11885653,67324476,2016-03-28,64025913,Mickel,Richelle was an awesome host. The Mariott Custom House is one of the most beautiful buildings in Boston with a lot of history. Thelocation was close to everything and was very lively. Richelle was extremely accommodating. Hopefully next time we'll grab that drink.

5714786,29765224,2015-04-12,10766704,Laelia,"\"I was thoroughly unimpressed by \"\"Will\"\" who is actually Boston Short Term Rentals (BSTR). I understand that companies use airbnb and often this is fine - what you lose in character is often made up for in convenience and cleanliness. However this was not the case here."
Firstly,we were not staying in the room in the picture - ours was much smaller and though it had the same furniture,we had a view of a brick wall so there was never any sunshine,and the drawers were so close to the bed as to be inaccessible.,,
"There was no cutlery in the \"\"kitchen\"\" apart from one bent steak knife",no glasses and no pots or pans to cook with. There were tiles coming up on the floor of the shower,and our towels stank of bleach - as if they had not been rinsed properly. Though at least they had been cleaned!,,,
When I phoned BSTR the next morning to complain I couldn't get through the first 3 times. When I finally did,I received no apologies and no offers to move to another apartment,but was told there was nothing they could do about the floor,but that towels and cutlery would be brought round immediately. I am now back in the UK 3 days later without seeing any of the items requested,or being contacted by anyone.,
In short this is the worst airbnb experience I have had,and if i had booked directly with the company,"I would have demanded my money back.\"",,,
5714786,33244090,2015-05-26,8677569,Katie,"The room was not the actual room I booked, though it was in the same building.  It was far smaller, and so cramped it was impossible to open the door more than halfway, as it hit the nightstand.  The owner has the entire building and runs it like a hotel.  He did give me a discount for giving me the wrong room, but it still was very uncomfortable and claustrophobic."
I also got a call waking me up early from the owner because another guest thought they were supposed to be in my room. Again,this company really needs to get a grip on their booking practices.,,,,
However,it was clean,and it is a great location.  Very bare bones and small.,,,
"\"",,,,,
5714786,35646880,2015-06-21,27777189,Sarah,"Our stay in Boston was beautiful, the street was so picturesque and the location was perfect. Everything was within a short walking distance. The bed was comfortable and the shower was powerful. It was really hot in Boston when we visited so the air con in the room really made it comfortable for us. It was also really handy to be able to wash and dry our clothes. Thank you for letting us stay, we would definitely be back again!"
5714786,37974976,2015-07-12,433355,Erica,"Building facade was lovely brick and area was great. Very close to the shopping and museum areas, easily walkable and safe."
Room was small but a good size for a couple. Sheets were clean and closet provided ample space. It is a good place to come back to as a landing point after a long day. AC did a great job of keeping us cool during the humid Boston summer.,,,,,
Bathroom shower was a little on the older side,but everything worked perfectly. Maybe recommend bringing flip flops after the shower if you're more a clean freak,but we were okay.,,,
There is also a little sink and mini fridge to hold any cold drinks or food.,,,,,
"Would stay there again!\"",,,,,
5714786,41202027,2015-08-05,911535,Cristina,"The room was on the small side, but comfortable for 2 people.  The surrounding neighborhood is really charming with some great restaurants and coffee shops close by.  The location is also very convenient for taking public transportation.  We had no issues getting into the room or checking out.  We would definitely stay here again."
5714786,47987026,2015-09-22,24618553,Ryan,"My girlfriend and I were traveling on vacation to Boston and stayed here for 3 nights. It is as described, a small studio with enough room for 2 travelers. The neighborhood was quiet, safe and very scenic. The queen size mattress was also very comfortable. We were around an $8-10 Uber/Cab ride from anywhere we needed to be in Boston. The studio is run by a property management company and they were very responsive via email and when I called a couple times. I would stay here again and recommend this for anyone looking to travel solo, or as a couple."
5714786,51530595,2015-10-21,28480764,Matt,"Check in was easy, as is access to the unit.  Location was very convenient to the Hynes Center, and there are some good restaurants and bars along Columbus that were nice to have nearby as well."
The bed was comfortable and the space,while small,was sufficient for one person traveling for business.,,,
Information from the owner indicated that soap and basic toiletries would be available for one night upon arrival,and nothing was present in the room.,,,,
More troubling,I arrived to an evening of sub-freezing temperatures outside (Saturday PM),and despite morning and evening notes to the owner on Sunday,the heat was not turned on until mid-Monday,which is absolutely unacceptable.  I was freezing cold for two nights,along with my shower each morning.
I did locate a space heater in the closet for the second night,which may have incremented the heat in the unit by a couple of degrees but in no way compensated for the lack of unit heat.,,,,
"This experience makes me wary of future AirBNB experiences.\"",,,,,
5714786,51927336,2015-10-25,44464551,Amanda,"This is a great place for two people to come back to after a long day of sightseeing.  The room was small , clean, and a fraction of what a traditional hotel would cost.   The bus stops and T stations were conveniently located near the room.  Wifi also worked great while I was there.  Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
As others have noted,the room and building is operated by a keyless entry system which entails that there is little to no interaction with the host.  I quite prefer this,but if you are looking for a more traditional airbnb experience,this might not be for you.,,
"\"",,,,,
5714786,53184821,2015-11-06,37239156,Eli,"My boyfriend and I stayed in room 302 for five nights. Our experience was what I expected for the price of the room--it was certainly a less expensive option compared to the hotels nearby. We never saw the host--which by the way is a company, not a person--and that was fine since the codes worked just perfectly. The neighborhood was really beautiful and we were in good walking distance to downtown Boston, and most importantly, just a few minutes from a conference I was attending at the Sheraton. From what I'd read in the other reviews, I prepared for the room to be cramped. It was clean when we arrived, which was great. My boyfriend found the bed uncomfortable, for some reason. I wouldn't advise turning on the ceiling fan--that was covered in a proper sheath of dust and if you open the window, there's a sizeable hole in the screen. On the last night we stayed, we awoke to the sound of a baby rat rustling around in one of our bags. It tried to tear open a bag of chocolates I packed. That was gross, but the little guy didn't do much damage and made for a hilarious story to tell later. To sum up, this room is good for someone who's on a budget, low-maintenance and not afraid of rodents."
5714786,54579588,2015-11-22,43127375,Andrew,The apartment was very clean upon arrival and had all of the necessities for my stay. There were no issues getting into the unit.

We were drawn to the location, right in the middle of the South End with quick access to the Mass Ave T Stop on the Orange Line.  The room itself was very basic and fairly small but based on the price, this was to be expected. No major issues with the room although the TV stand was completely unattached to the TV, which wobbled all over the place and some of the knobs/handles in the unit with loose. My only frustration with the space was the extremely thin walls. It felt almost as if the people staying next door/upstairs were in the same room as us because you could pretty much hear everything. For the price and location, I am overall pleased with the visit, just wish the walls were a bit thicker."

The location in South End was perfect for both walking to Fenway Park and also Back Bay for shopping/dining.  At the one end of his street is SW Corridor Park which was a great way to travel to Back Bay.  The house is very clean and exactly as described. Justin met us upon arrival and was extremely accommodating.  He toured the home and demonstrated many high-tech features to ensure a comfortable stay.   We thought we would spend more time touring the city, however the Roof Top Deck was too inviting.  We relaxed there just enjoying the city skyline.  Justin responded quickly to any questions and provided excellent recommendations for food, beverages and coffee houses.  He is an excellent host and his home is truly a gem."
6972426,40961561,2015-08-03,100160,Shaula,"This home was just perfect for our group-four friends visiting Boston for a weekend event. It is just as described and Justin is great at answering questions. We enjoyed the roof deck thoroughly-the view of the Boston skyline was gorgeous. The home is tastefully decorated. Beds are very comfortable. Kitchen and bathrooms are beautiful. Apartment was spotless when we arrived. It is in a fun neighborhood, lots of restaurants within walking distance. I would highly recommend this home-our visit was seamless."
As with all the brownstones in this neighborhood,there are several flights of stairs to reach the living area. Not a problem for us,"but wanted other travelers to be aware.\"",,,

Justin gave us all the information we needed beforehand, and sent timely reminders to make sure we had no trouble.  He responded immediately and flexibly when I asked for a later checkout time.  I definitely recommend staying here!  Thanks Justin!"

When we arrived, the house was very clean and it had fantastic amenities - a steam shower, a jacuzzi tub, a roofdeck and an entire-home sound system, just to name a few. Justin was also a great host. He answered all messages / questions I had almost immediately after I sent them, and made us feel very welcome at his place."
6972426,47731612,2015-09-21,40598727,Kelly,We absolutely loved the apartment for our weekend in Boston! The location was perfect and the rooftop view was to die for! Justin was very accommodating to our travel plans and we had no issues! Would definitely recommend!!!

It was historical, central, clean, full of character..couldn't have asked for anything more in either the place itself or the neighborhood. The pictures actually don't di it justice. Justin was great to deal with and let us drop off our bags long before check in. Much appreciated."
6972426,51280408,2015-10-19,13108685,Tom,"\"Justin's brownstone rental at 20 Claremont Park, Boston, MA, was fantastic. The description of the rental on AirBNB is completely accurate. Every detail was perfect. The photos of the dwelling on AirBNB look great, but the reality is even better. The place is huge, beautifully decorated and furnished, spotlessly clean, with every modern convenience. The two bedrooms were spacious, the bathrooms pleasant and fully modern, the kitchen and living room gigantic and inviting, and the rooftop deck blew us away... it's got to be the best view of the Boston skyline in the city. This rental is situated on a charming, tree-lined street in central Boston only a couple of minutes walk from the key public transportation line (the \"\"T\"\").  I felt the price we paid was worth every penny"

We arrived very late at night, but it was easy to find and to get in and Justin left a list which answered all of our questions.  He also recommended some  nearby restaurants and we loved the ones we tried.  He was generous in offering items from his home to us and we appreciated that having traveled a long way."
6972426,67688307,2016-03-30,18171725,Bill,"Place was better then listed and photographed. The kitchen is perfect. We cooked a Easter meal for 15 people. No problems. 3 blocks from a Whole Foods. The outdoor deck with grill is a fantastic addition.  Was in perfect condition when we arrived, Justin got back to us right away with directions and questions. A wonderful Brownstone, off of Columbus and Mass. Super convenient for any Boston visit."

The rooftop deck has a superb view of downtown Boston (only a few minutes walking distance) as well as an outdoor grill and expansive seating.  We will return!"
6972426,72232265,2016-05-01,28049291,Linda,Justin's place is absolutely beautiful.  Check-in was very easy and his instructions were detailed and helpful.  We loved the neighborhood and the ability to walk to some great restaurants.  Our only regret was that we didn't book for longer than a weekend!  We'll be back.

No me gusto la cama,el colchón y las almohadas eran muy finitas,parecían muy usadas. No cierran completamente las persianas y entra luz desde temprano. El baño es mínimo,Los techos del baño estaban en pésimo estado,y la pared en la bañera también.,
La comunicación fue buena y amable,y dejé la valijas hasta las 15 hs cuando el check out era mas temprano.,,,,
El precio era menor que la mayoría,podría incluso ser un poco menos. La experiencia no fue mala,"pero. si arreglara algunos detalles ganaría alguna estrella mas en la puntuación. \"",,,

Mark,Allegra’s friend,was super friendly,attentive  and was waiting for us exactly at the agreed time to hand over the keys.,,
He gave us tips on restaurants,markets and bars nearby.,,,,
The apartment itself is very clean,has a good size - bedroom with comfortable double bed,space to fit our 3 big luggage,air conditioning and a dressing table.,,
The bathroom is small and needs touches in the paintings.,,,,,
The fully equipped kitchen is connected to the living room with comfortable couch,nice chair,table for lunch with high stools where it was left for us a bottle of champagne as a gift.,,,
We loved our stay and recommend to all.,,,,,

6432655,35234684,2015-06-16,772330,Bri (Bailey),"We stayed at Allegra's for our apartment hunting trip before we move to Boston later this year. We wanted to get a feel for Beacon Hill, and Allegra's place was perfectly located - easy access to transit (including to/from the airport) and walking distance from the Boston Common, Back Bay and North End (we even walked home from a Red Sox game)."
Allegra wasn't in town when we arrived,but we were able to get the keys with only a small hitch (the cleaner we met was a little bit later than expected) and she was always reachable and responsive to help us out if we needed it. When we arrived,she had left suggestions for cafes and restaurants nearby and a welcome bottle of cava,both of which were appreciated :),,
"The apartment itself suits Beacon Hill - historic and charming. The bathroom is very small (\"\"small and mighty\"\" as Allegra described it) and showing its age",but everything you need works. The bedroom is large enough to keep our suitcases and still move around,and the bed was comfortable. The living room area had enough seating for us to relax after all the walking we did. Allegra's place feels very much like staying at a friend's home - if you're looking for a luxury condo with all the bells and whistles,look elsewhere,but if you're open to some old world comfort and charm inside and out,"this place is for you.\""
6432655,35343829,2015-06-17,10997463,Aaron,"It is a cute apartment in a very good location -- within 10 minutes walk from Boston Commons. Although it is close to the street, the bedroom is very quite. We only stayed for one night but liked the convenience of its location. Allegra was sweet and she prepared everything for us -- even a bottle of wine."
6432655,35572559,2015-06-20,33055577,Michael,A great clean and manageable one bedroom in a great location on the edge of beacon hill. Tons of great spots within easy walking distance and Allegra was accommodating.
6432655,35943126,2015-06-23,26982419,Delphine,"The appartment is exactly as described, very cozy and excellent for two people. The location is perfect, in a great neighborhood and near everything : freedom trail, Boston Common, Boston Harbor. Indeed even The MIT and Harvard are not so far (went by subway and came back by foot). We did not meet Allegra face to face but communication by mail was very easy. We would definitely recommend it."
6432655,36226382,2015-06-26,31661717,Pamela,"Allegra's apt is just the way you see in the pictures. Is a very cozy apt in the most beautiful neighborhood in Boston (in my opinion). Very well located, just 4 blocks from subway station so is pretty easy to get to even if you are travelling with luggage."
The apartment was very clean. The bed is absolutely comfortable,specially if you were walking all day knowing the city.,,,,

Allegra and Mark made the process super simple and seamless (despite changes to my itinerary and arrival time). Excellent location, location, location! The apartment is exactly as it appears in the pictures. My only recommendation is some paint in the bathroom. Overall, a great value for 1-2 people for a long weekend in Boston. Cheers!"

Has everything you may need and the location couldn't have been better!  Steps away from coffee shops and restaurants and better still ... super close to Boston Common!  We walked everywhere and had a fantastic long weekend.  Mark was very available to us whenever we needed him which was great.  We will absolutely book this place whenever we are in Boston!"
6432655,38436299,2015-07-15,37268139,Christian,This is a cozy (and artsy) spot in Beautiful Beacon Hill. A perfect location to stay at and enjoy everything Boston has to offer.

The apartment is in the perfect location, with both the Boston Commons area and Faneuil Square in close distance. The apartment is cozy and a great place to read a book after a long day out. We would highly recommend staying here to anyone looking to explore Boston. We are glad we chose to stay in Allegra's apartment, rather than a hotel, and would most definitely return."

6432655,52045352,2015-10-26,38299885,Mike,"Allegra was very accomodating and responsive. The description of the property was honest and accurate, so there were no unrealistic expectations. (Note: small bathroom, believe it). Everything worked and was clean. The location could not have been better. We walked to everywhere that mattered, except Harvard and JFK library, where we took their very adequate public transportation. Do not rent a car and expect to be able to park anywhere, even at a price. Uber & their subway system are cheaper and dependable. You don't want to drive in Boston anyway! Thanks Allegra, for making our stay in Boston pleasant, and thanks for your tips on local eateries, and directions."
6432655,52782549,2015-11-01,47170712,Tj,Allegra's place was great. Exactly how I envisioned it from the pics. She was welcoming and extremely helpful during my stay. Highly recommend. The only thing I could ask for otherwise would be for her to have baked me a cake. Maybe next time...
6432655,66455366,2016-03-22,1961940,Olivier,"\"De mauvaises surprises malgré une communication très bonne au départ. L'appartement correspond à la description et est propre, mais il est bien difficile d'y trouver sa place : beaucoup d'objets personnels \"\"innondent\"\" le logement"
6432655,68337393,2016-04-04,23294841,Richard,Had good instructions regarding entry to the property (though it took a knack to unlock the doors!) and Allegra was very prompt in to replying to our queries. The apartment was just right for the two of us for our 9 day stay. It was particularly good for relaxing on the sofa and armchair with a nice cup of tea after a long day exploring the area. There was not much room in the bathroom or bedroom but it was not a problem for either of us.
The apartment was conveniently situated on the edge of Beacon Hill within a few minutes walking distance of the T at Charles MGH (for Cambridge) and Bowdoin (for the airport). There were also a few good eating places in nearby Cambridge Street though our favourite restaurant was Grotto,a little further round the corner in Bowdoin Street.,,,,
We enjoyed walking round the streets of Beacon Hill and onto Boston Common nearby. Also wealks by the Charles River very close.,,,,,

6432655,70226901,2016-04-17,52997059,Jeff,"Allegra was very informative about the surrounding area on where to wine and dine.   Great location, nearby the Boston Commons, T stops, Hill Tavern, Starbucks, CVS, and a Whole Foods.   The place is small, but accommodating.  The only downside was the bathroom.  Next time I'm back in Boston, I'll gladly rent out her place again."
6432655,70630882,2016-04-19,56136785,Julian,Had a great stay during Marathon weekend. The place was cozy and clean and in a great location. Allegra was very informative about the neighborhood and recommended great restaurants and coffee shops.  Parking is a bit tricky but not impossible. I highly recommend staying here next time you visit Boston.
6432655,71977052,2016-04-30,43124373,Judy,"The apartment is situated on the back side of Beacon Hill with its own array of restaurants, bars, and coffee shops. And it’s five minutes from Charles Street which is one of Boston’s finest for up-scale restaurants as well as cool luncheon places and intriguing gift shops and boutiques. Charles leads straight-way to the Boston Common and Public Gardens with their duck and swan themes, and from there you have quick access to the Charles River and Esplanade where the Boston Pops gives summer concerts."
The address is on a narrow street two doors up from Cambridge St. which is well-traveled but just that distance is enough to make for quiet nights— at least our three night stay was quiet.,,,,,
The apartment is small but adequately furnished with interesting artwork around. There’s a sink and dish drainer area but with very little counter space. The refrigerator is packed with food needing little or no preparation.,,,,,
Older travelers be advised: there are a few challenges here for people our age. The lock-box is at ground level and we had to kneel on the brick sidewalk to open it. Also the bed is quite low and there are only 6” to 8” on either side due to a storage closet and a radiator,and this can make for difficulty rising.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
6432655,76822386,2016-05-29,325485,Nancy,Allegra was awesome!  She made sure we were able to get into the apartment (a bit of a challenge but fortunately I was used to an external lock box!) and found everything to be as expected.  A couple of easy questions were answered promptly and the rest of our stay was flawless!
6432655,78448737,2016-06-06,34079209,Patrick,"The location is good, we could visit Boston just by walking.The apartment itself is rather small, which was not a problem as such, but there was'nt enough space left for the visitors clothes and items to be stored, I think Allegra should  make more space available, we had to leave our lugage open in the main room...Also the bathroom is far away from today's standards, it would really need to be completely renovated."
6432655,81514968,2016-06-23,50412299,Jason,"Not a bad place.  The bathroom needs  a little help but it's also in the center of town, so it's a decent trade-off.  Just don't have huge expectations and you'll be ok."

The neighborhood is great as well, conveniently located close to Boston's attractions and with lots of nice restaurants nearby.  Shira was easy to deal with despite her being thousands of miles away, and my rental went without a hitch.  Highly recommended."
3601030,18125059,2014-08-22,2147304,Maggie,"If you want a comfortable apartment nestled in a great part of Boston, this is it. I stayed here for 5 days while I took a business class in Copely Square, and I couldn't have asked for a better location or accommodations. It was a lovely ten minute walk to Copely Square (you must check out the public library-great place to grab lunch) and there are many places to shop and eat just outside your door. I recommend the Appleton Bakery."
Shira made the experience even more wonderful by providing membership access to some of her favorite museums,such as the MFA and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum (also must-sees).,,,,
Also,enough can't be said about the delightful kitchen and wonderful outside deck/eating area. Truly a great place to stay,"with Boston at your feet. \"",,,
3601030,19606623,2014-09-15,2938583,Nick,Shira was a wonderful host and went out of her way to help me obtain the keys to the apartment. The apartment was amazing. We especially loved the huge deck and fantastic location. Had a great trip!

She not only has a beautiful apartment, but she even left us notes with suggestions on fun things to do in Boston and 'how-to's about her place.

The old neighbourhood was lovely, the location was excellent. Everything I needed or wanted was provided and the property is interesting and of high quality. Shira provided good information about the locality and getting to the apartment. I doubt that the glitch( unchanged bed and no clean bed linen) would happen again. Shira did all she could to make amends but clearly this affected my stay."

It's obvious from the various art pieces and photos around the apartment that there is a lot of love and warmth in the space. The neighborhood is quite charming and walkable, with several shops and restaurants located within a very short distance."
Shira was very thoughtful in her communications leading up to and even during my stay. I'd be delighted to be able to stay at her place again next time I visit Boston.,,,,,

3601030,22370867,2014-11-04,12794613,Nick,My new wife and I stayed here after our wedding on the South Shore. We are very familiar with Boston and this location was perfect! Walkable distance to pretty much all of our favorite spots in South End. Shira was awesome in setting everything up for us in terms of access. She was very friendly and sent an really cool welcome package email detailing all the places to hit. I know the city and I can agree her recommendations are great spots for people unfamiliar with the city.
3601030,22432369,2014-11-06,14287960,Luce,"Shira's appartment is really comfortable and well equipped, I really enjoyed my visit.mas a host, shira wa very welcoming and organised.mi strongly recommend a stay."
3601030,22887890,2014-11-17,21301253,DeeDee,"Shira was the best host ever.  She communicated well, and represented her apartment honestly (it was GREAT!) and we absolutely plan to go there again!!!  The location is fabulous for getting anywhere in Boston.  Highly recommend!"
3601030,23678803,2014-12-08,20720099,Jeffrey,"Shira's apartment is beautiful, and in a fantastic location. Even her neighbours are nice and helpful. I stayed for a bit over a week with a colleague for a work trip, and the apartment provided for easy walking and public transit around the city. Both the sofa bed and the full bed were comfortable. The kitchen was incredibly well equipped, the bathroom was well outfitted and clean, and each room was beautifully decorated."
We did not have a chance to meet Shira,because she was out of town,but she provided prompt feedback when needed. She was willing to work with our requests,and was a pleasure to chat with. She provided a comprehensive list of nice places to check out and see in the local area. All of the ones we checked out were a lot of fun.,,
We had a minor issue with the door and the phone,but these were easily remedied with Shira,"and shouldn't be a problem in the future. We noticed a light \"\"knocking\"\" sound of the building shifting with the temperature outside switching from warm to cold",but this is intrinsic to some older buildings and not too distracting.,,
Overall,the stay was very pleasant in all respects,"and I would definitely stay with her again the next time I am back in Boston.\"",,,
3601030,25126670,2015-01-07,12788484,Pauline,"My husband and I stayed at Shira's apartment for 10 days in January. Despite the cold outside, the apartment is warm and very comfortable. We could see it had been renovated, very well decorated, and very easy to live in. It was also very clean."
Also we didn't get the chance to meet Shira,we communicated very easily and Shira was the best hostess.,,,,
"We would definitely recommend the apartment. The location is also very good.\"",,,,,

The bed is really comfortable,the bathroom is understated class,and the kitchen is really well equipped and with high-end white goods...,,,
I had a couple of queries which Shira was very quick to answer...,,,,,
All in all,I loved this place... Location was perfect for my needs,and there excellent eating places just a short walk away..,,,
Thank you,"Shira... I hope I can get back one day...\"",,,,
3601030,29488557,2015-04-08,3504790,Angela,"It was truly a pleasure to stay in this apartment.  The host was very helpful and welcoming, and everything worked just as she explained it.  The apartment is lovely, well provisioned, and in a beautiful neighborhood.  Everything went very smoothly, and it made the trip much easier."
3601030,30127151,2015-04-18,10394737,André,"Exceptional apartment and an exceptional host. We adored our stay in the South End. We were travelling with our two small children and the apartment was simply perfect. Shira was extremely cooperative, helpful and generous; she was very available, quick to respond and went out of her way to make our experience unforgettable. Strongly recommended. Thanks Shira ! (p.s. For people with cars, make note that parking in Boston is a bit problematic)."
3601030,30786459,2015-04-27,29299319,Amy,We had a lovely stay in Shira's apartment. The location is excellent and everything was just as described. Shira provided some wonderful dining and shopping recommendations as well. We thoroughly enjoyed out time staying here!
3601030,31164918,2015-05-03,6906024,Jan,"Shira's condo is lovely. It has all modern fixtures of the highest quality. The hardwood floors, bed, and rooms are just as pictured or even nicer. The terrace is spacious with plenty of nice seating and tables to sit outside for a glass of wine or even a picnic."
Shira was probably the most responsive airbnb host we've ever encountered. She also provides a welcome packet of information that is thorough and informative for visitors from where to find extra towels,tp,etc. to the best local places like restaurants,groceries,etc.,
Any additional information requests were answered immediately and amiably.,,,,,
This will be our first choice for future stays in Boston and we have already recommended it to friends.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
3601030,32053509,2015-05-13,28663175,Julian,We can't say enough good things about his apartment - simplistic yet stylish and perfectly located. The balcony provided many a wonderful evening to sit with a glass of wine after a day out and about in Boston.  Beds were really comfortable - the pullout bed was the most comfortable we had ever experienced.
Details of our stay was that it was a mother and daughter in Boston for the commencement week. Apartment was clean,modern and well equipped. Only a couple of small hiccups - the online app for the door didn't work but Shira's contact answered the phone in the first call and provided a solution straight away and this was at 10 pm. Also the location of the apartment is amazing being right on Tremont,"but this means that it can be at times quite noisy - nothing that is in the control of the owner. We would stay here again in a flash.\"",,,
3601030,32313420,2015-05-17,26300433,Amanda,"We very much enjoyed our stay in Shira's lovely apartment.  It was exactly as it appeared on the airbnb website.  Shira was available to answer our questions, and was a helpful and gracious host.  The apartment was in a great location, within easy walking distance of good restaurants, bars, shopping, and transit.  If my travels take me back to Boston, I would happily stay here again."
3601030,33644351,2015-05-31,25797553,Susan,"The apartment was perfect for our extended stay in Boston. It is exactly as presented in the listing. The location was very convenient for all types of transportation and it was close to great restaurants and shopping. When our travels take us back there, we will definitely reserve this place! Shira is very responsive to inquiries and provides useful information for the traveler."
3601030,34763340,2015-06-12,2652990,Anna & Alex,"We had a really nice time in Shira's apartment. It's really homely and really does have everything you need, including for cooking in her really great kitchen which seems to have everything you could imagine tucked away. We also had our young daughter with us and it worked really well, the space is well thought out and very intuitive. The location is great too, right in the middle of everything in the South End and we were able to use her recommendations to eat at some nice places. The deck is nice, getting sun from the middle of the day until it goes down, and we ate out there too. Would certainly stay again and recommend this place."
3601030,35564489,2015-06-20,6562025,André,"Shira is a great host and the apartment is just lovely. Very well furnished, clean and spacious. The area is really cool - lots of nice restaurants and close to the subway. Shira was there to handle the keys. The balcony is amazing to have lunch or dinner. We highly recommend Shira's apartment."
3601030,35900329,2015-06-22,31030040,Anwen,The host canceled this reservation 98 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3601030,37560385,2015-07-08,14638444,Philipp,"Thank you so much for a perfect first AirBnB experience in your beautiful Boston Appartement! Everything was as described and perfectly organized, even though Shira was not personally present. Even the key was sent over to Germany."
The Appartment is decorated so lovely,Shiras style is awesome!,,,,
Only one remark for people who need a quiet sleep: Tremont Street is very busy and noisy and the house is quite old,so the neighbor's steps are often clear to hear.,,,,
But you can handle this easily with Oropax! ;),,,,,
The Appartement is perfectly located. Several sightseeing-spots can be reached within walking distance.,,,,,
"Highly recommended for a Boston sightseeing-trip!!! \"",,,,,
3601030,38366850,2015-07-15,98431,Kristin,"From long before our trip to the end of it, we appreciated Shira's professionalism and kindness, as well as her amazing space! We appreciated the welcome packet she emailed to us several weeks before our trip, and referred to the copy she left in the apartment often as we thought about places to go eat, as well as made sure we were on top of the garbage/recycling/compost schedule of the apartment. The apartment is clean, well-stocked and organized, and the location is absolutely the best. It is also one of the most well-designed and thoughtful apartments I have been in. All the finishing touches are top notch and it is such a calm, soothing space to be in. We often found ourselves back at the apartment in the late afternoon, and rather than head out again to do more things, we would sit on the balcony and people watch, watch the sky change as the evening wore on, have dinner and a glass or two of wine as the night came. We loved being in a neighborhood and getting used to the rhythm of the area. We walked a LOT on this trip and took advantage of the easy access to the bus and train system from the apartment, and spent a lot of time exploring our own neighborhood, visiting local restaurants, cafes, playgrounds, stores, and so on. Three of us stayed - myself, my husband and our kindergarten-aged daughter. We brought her blow up bed and she slept on that on the floor of the bedroom. We used the laundry once and it worked as advertised. The listing is very accurate, the photos represent the apartment accurately. My daughter cried the morning we had to head to the airport to fly home - and my husband and I were very sad, too. We will be back to stay here again!"
3601030,38858689,2015-07-19,29108046,Debora,"Our stay at the luxury South End Apartment was fabulous! The apartment was exactly the way it's shown in the pictures. Very charming and elegant, with lots of attitude. It is spacious, bright, has a brand new bathroom and gourmet kitchen appliances."
In the summer it can be a little warm,but we left the AC on in the living room,turned the ceiling fan in the bedroom and it was perfect. Also,there is a nice balcony facing the street.,,
The location couldn't be better,with a Starbuck in the next corner,a gourmet grocery store within two blocks,many cool stores/boutiques and trendy restaurantes around.,,
Although Boston can be very tricky with a car,we didn't have any problems and could park most of the times right in front of the building.,,,,
It can be a little noisy,because it's in the corner,but again,if you keep the windows shut,it is just the feeling you are in a big city like Boston... The soft sheets,fluffy duvet and all kinds of pillows will make it go back to sleep.
The owner was also very nice and attentive.,,,,,
"Thumbs up! Definitely a keeper.\"",,,,,
3601030,40574176,2015-08-01,9008734,Alejandra,"El departamento es hermoso, muy bien ubicado y con una ubicación casi inmejorable.

Shira, por su parte, es una encantadora y preocupada anfitriona; compartió no sólo su casa, también su ambiente y buen ánimo. Gracias por todo!"
3601030,41081085,2015-08-04,34310309,Mengchao,The apartment was located in a very nice area that we could easily get access to public transportation. There were some great brunch restaurants close to the apartment.
The apartment was in great shape and very artistic. It was cleaned before we arrived and Shira provided us almost everything we needed. We did bring our personal stuff like towels,slippers,toothbrushes,etc. You may ask her what you need to bring before you get there.,,
Shira was so nice that she had a very detailed and helpful instructions about the apartment. She was also very nice and quick for responding our questions.,,,,,
Just a kind reminder: the apartment was located at the corner of a busy and noisy street so if you ever leave your window open at night,"it might be a bit loud for you during the midnight.\"",,,,
3601030,41336991,2015-08-07,32776153,Aldert,"This is an absolutely nice appartment, very tastefully and carefully refurbished and decorated and it has everything you need for a city trip to Boston.

Le logement est charmant et correspond bien à la description. Il est climatisé. Il dispose d'une terrasse très agréable. il est propre et confortable.,,,,,

Shira, although we did not meet her in person, was a perfect host providing everything you need to know in great detail, and being constantly available for information or assistance. If the weather is good (like we experienced) the terrace is truly amazing and a rare find in this area of Boston. Highly recommendable!"

3601030,47958888,2015-09-22,4144390,Bonita,We loved our stay at Shira's beautiful clean flat. We felt welcomed and safe. The flat was very nicely furnished and the kitchen was well stocked. It was so centrally located - we walked to most places - and we tried some of your suggested restaurants - all excellent!  It was nice to have a contact number in case we locked ourselves out! Thank you for sharing your flat on AirB&B!  We hope to return in the near future and stay longer.

Die meisten Touristenattraktionen und der Flughafen sind entweder zu Fuss oder mit Bus/U-Bahn sehr einfach zu erreichen (eine Bushaltestelle nach Downtown ist direkt vor der Tür). Das Stadtviertel ist sehr hübsch, angenehm und auch nachts kann man problemlos dort herumlaufen. Die Wohnung ist sehr geschmackvoll renoviert und eingerichtet und alles ist vorhanden. Im Bett haben wir dank toller Matratze und gutem Bettzeug wunderbar geschlafen."
Alles war super vorbereitet: der Zugang zu Haus und Wohnung war perfekt organsiert,die Wohnung super geputzt,viel Stauraum für Kleidung,eine ausführliche Beschreibung für alles Notwendige lag ausgedruckt auf dem Tisch und das Wlan funktionierte einwandfrei.

She has great taste and there are personal touches and lovingly done woodwork throughout.

We had a minor glitch with the internet service, but she solved it immediately even though she was in Israel! Thanks for everything."

The location is pretty conducive to sight seeing also. Our walk from the apartment to Boston Common was a short 15 minutes. There are many shops in the area,so unless you are going out for something in particular there are not many reasons to leave the neighborhood.,,,,
Throughout the entire experience Shira was very helpful. When the arrangements for accessing the apartment didn't work for me,she made different arrangements. Before the stay she sent me a welcome packet with suggested shops,bars,and restaurants. She was always attentive and accessible.,,

3601030,86428633,2016-07-16,75193880,Jessie,Really nice home and very comfortable! We loved our stay and the host Shira is very friendly and helpful. The balcony is great and the interior is nicely decorated. Thank you!
3601030,87519563,2016-07-20,52826884,Jennifer,Apartment was perfect for visiting Boston. It's close to everything and perfect for public transportation or walking. We felt safe and there were many food options close by. We loved sitting on the balcony and enjoying the Boston skyline! Shira was exceptional and easy to work with!
3601030,87699772,2016-07-21,60635905,Andrew,"Shira is truly outstanding to deal with. She was incredibly responsive and when issues arose she jumped in to resolve them immediately. Shira was proactive, creative and extremely friendly. The place is amazing. The view from the porch of the back bay and downtown is incredible. The unit is very clean and surprisingly spacious and we found it to be extremely comfortable. The location is one of the best in Boston. The neighborhood is very lively and there are tons of restaurants and stores within walking distance. Staying in the unit really gives someone a great feel for what living in Boston would be like. We would return to Shira's place in a heartbeat."
3601030,88896082,2016-07-25,49432901,Clément,Shira nous a vraiment guidés et conseillés durant toute l' organisation du séjour.Elle est facilement joignable. Aucun problème à notre arrivée!
3601030,89455321,2016-07-28,67329097,Julie,"Shira was very contactable and helpful, the area was great, near everything. The only issue for us was not having an elevator - our cases were heavy!"
3601030,91128897,2016-08-04,1363136,Maggie,"Shira sent us a welcoming package by email  before our trip which tells us everything we need to know about her beautiful place and the neighborhoid. And when we asked her for ways to accommodate our late departure from Boston, she was very responsive and worked out with the next guests so we can leave our bags there til later in the day. Thank you very much for our trip so enjoyable."
3601030,93170532,2016-08-11,9429963,Rebecca,Shira is a wonderful host and her apartment is fantastic. Her welcome package (mailed previous to our stay) was full of information about the apartment and the neighborhood.  She responded quickly to questions and was easily reached. We even had the opportunity to meet her in person since she was in town at the same time. The apartment is in a prime location within walking distance to many shops and restaurants. It was great to come back to after busy days and relax on the balcony with wine and people-watch. The apartment is airy and full of natural light. The a/c in the front window works well and there are ceiling fans in the kitchen and bedroom. The furniture is comfortable and the kitchen is well-stocked.  Lots of character and great detail throughout.  We loved having access to laundry on the same floor.  I would not hesitate to stay again and I'm really sorry we didn't book a longer stay.
3601030,94054366,2016-08-14,16437046,Sarah,"Everything about this place is awesome. The host pays attention to all the fine details. The bed was super comfy and the sheets smelled of fresh laundry. The towels were fluffy and the place was extremely clean! The neighborhood was full of shops and restaurants! Very close to the T, only a few blocks away!"
3601030,95139280,2016-08-18,12054896,Jane,"Shira was a great communicator! We received a welcome info package before our arrival detailing everything we needed to know. She was flexible with our arrival and departure times. Her place was beautiful, well equipped and in an amazing location. Well worth it!!"
3601030,96000701,2016-08-21,36072635,Meaghan,"We had a lovely stay at Shira's place. It was absolutely perfect for our needs. Perfectly central to everything, clean, and with a lovely outdoor patio. Shira could not have been more accommodating. We had a late flight out on our last day, and she was very accommodating of our needs. Thanks Shira!"
3601030,98785153,2016-09-01,69147490,Kristen,An amazing place to stay in Boston! Perfectly positioned and simply stunning. Shira was very helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. The balcony was such a bonus too! Definitely a 5 star experience!! Thank you Shira!
7650016,42332186,2015-08-12,32438064,Sindis,"Ella explained to me very well the location and facilities of the apartment. I just met her for minutes, but she was great."
7650016,43199752,2015-08-17,8292225,Jackson,"We requested to stay the day before we arrived and Ella was gracious to accept us. The apartment is in great shape, is clean, is close to the T, and is in a great neighborhood. It's a great deal, but keep in mind you need to pay for parking and it can get pricey if the Sox have a game."
"The minor inconveniences... We know it was August in Boston but the apartment was really hot and the small air conditioner didn't do much to cool it off. We were given only one towel for the 3 of us and we had no wireless access to stream Netflix. We were only there for 15 hours so we didn't ask for more towels or a password.\"",,,,,
7650016,44391093,2015-08-25,42141897,Shawn,"Ella's studio is incredibly awesone, decorated with nice art-paintings, lightened by warm lamps, filled with sweet candle smell. I was like staying in my own house, or say I hope it could be my house. Though that's my first time use airbnb, I do feel the trust and warmth. By the way, Ella is also helpful and warm-hearted. She showed us the local restuarant and subway station, which enable us a convinent trip. In all, good,good."
7650016,45134308,2015-08-31,38606363,Lauren,"My boyfriend and I stayed in Ella's studio apartment for a weekend in August. We met Ella briefly in advance to receive the keys to the apartment and she was friendly, gave great information about the area and places worth visiting, and was always attentive and responsive in a timely fashion when we had questions."
The apartment itself was gorgeous,spacious,clean,and inviting. The area was conveniently within walking distance to the T and a grocery store,"which made getting around/making our own meals incredibly easy. This was out first AirBnB stay and we couldn't have asked for a better experience.\"",
7650016,48708366,2015-09-28,40148675,Andrew,"We were met immediately by the apartment's owner, who gave us a tour of the space and was extremely accommodating - offering up recommendations for local restaurants and attractions and the use of anything in her apartment. The description of the apartment was spot on as well, and combined with the location, this made for a perfect getaway weekend to Boston."
7650016,64925825,2016-03-09,171030,Michael,"Great small but spacious apartment, great Fenway location. Walk to the MFA, the Gardner, Fenway Park, etc. Lots of good restos in the neighborhood. The bed was very comfortable, and there's a full kitchen for those who like to cook. Easy pick up of the key at a nearby store. Just right! Of course, in this area, parking can be a challenge."
7650016,70582673,2016-04-18,29132006,Christopher,"A wonderful little studio apartment right in the heart of Fenway. It's a few blocks away from the ballpark, a few blocks from the T, a couple of blocks from food. A near perfect location. Ella is very friendly and flexible when it comes to checkin/checkout times."
7650016,76226760,2016-05-25,66108721,Duong,My parents were coming to Boston for my graduation for a few days. Ella gave me such an easy time to let me pick up the key and check out the apartment ahead of time. The location was convenient as we use the T and busses to go around Boston a lot.
7650016,78208105,2016-06-05,37515747,Kevin,"Great  location, less than 5 min walk to the T.  Super clean.  Host was quick to respond and very friendly!"
7650016,81073590,2016-06-20,3911648,Corinne,"Ella's correspondence prior to our arrival was so clear and detailed that we had no problem making our way to her apt on the  T.  Ella met us at her cute, bright apt and gave us the tour before she took off to work. She was super friendly and accommodating."
7650016,84032185,2016-07-05,10945162,Holly,"Ella was a very responsive, attentive host. She left the keys for us at a convenient pickup location and was available to answer any questions we had over the weekend. The studio is extremely clean and functional for out of town visitors. We enjoyed our stay right by Fenway and would stay at her place again should we be in town."
7650016,94128488,2016-08-14,37665152,Lea,"This was my first Airbnb stay, and Ella made it very easy! She was communicative, provided plenty of information and opened her home to us for a weekend trip to Boston. Her apartment is in a great, accessible neighborhood in Fenway - made it very easy to navigate the city. I would absolutely reach out to her again for or next trip."
"\"",,,,,
7650016,96525357,2016-08-23,55665856,Charissa,"Everything is exactly how it looks in the pictures! Ella is easy to get ahold of and able give advice on places to go in the neighborhood! Key pick up was easy and convenient. Cute and clean place! Would recommend to anyone visiting Boston, especially the Fenway area."
7650016,98051068,2016-08-29,12617297,Amy,Great location if you are going to Fenway.  Ella was a very responsive. We enjoyed our stay and would stay at her place again should we be in town.

2043261,12654937,2014-05-07,9184698,Betty,We came in after office hours. We found the keys as indicated by Boston Furnished Rentals. Their indications were very clear.
The location was great: the apartment in the italian neighborhood so close to lots of italian restaurants,Mike's Pastry and the waterfront. The Haymarket metro station is 7-10 minutes away. Other good points: the real estate office leaves a folder in the flat,with useful indications about grocery shopping and closest café.,,,
I slept in the small living room/kitchen,on a comfortable daybed. If you sleep there,you need to know that the fridge can be very noisy every now and then. It did wake me up at times during the night. The bathroom needs to be refreshed/painted,as some walls in the whole flat. The shower is tiny. There were spider webs on the ceiling in the rooms as well,stains on table cloths and a hole in my sheet. Even though we could have called the cleaning person,we did not have time for that. The building is old so you can hear people walking in the apartment above and the neighbors as well
Overall,"I recommend this apartment for a visit of the city of Boston.\"",,,,
2043261,16934513,2014-08-04,17757167,Alex,"This is a review for 16 Battery Street, Weston's Apartment."
Pros:,,,,,
Renting from Boston Furnished Rentals was really easy and seamless!  The communication with Jan was great: she was very responsive,with lots of details and information,and very fair. Very patient as I worked through my travel schedule after another host canceled,which I really appreciated. Key pickup and dropoff was simple. The keys were ready for me when I got to the pickup spot (a local realtor) and the apartment was ready when I got my keys,no issues whatsoever.,
The neighborhood is wonderful: safe,vibrant,and full of great restaurants and lots of history. Everyone is super-friendly,too. Very close walk to the Haymarket station (about ten minutes) to get on the T and explore,and fabulous culture right outside your door. GREAT location.,
All linens (sheets,towels,etc) were fresh and clean,and the apartment itself had been wiped clean. Some simple toiletries (shampoo,"\"\"hotel\"\" soap bars) were available. Kitchen is well stocked in terms of plates",cups
Cons:,,,,,
The building and the apartment itself could both really use some TLC - everything could use a deep-clean and a fresh coat of paint. The bathroom is in need of renovation,plus really tiny: a very narrow stall shower and a low sink (no pictures in the listing) but was clean on arrival. The apartment door opens right into the bedroom,and this is not exactly a proper one bedroom as the listing states,but feels much more like a large studio with the open floor plan. The apartment is at ground level,and during most summer weekends in the North End,there is a carnival right outside the window that runs all day through until midnight. If you're looking for peace and quiet
Overall,the process was so simple as were my needs for this trip. I enjoyed my stay,and though I feel it's worth noting that the place could use a bit of refurbishing,it didn't impact my personal comfort level. If I had the same needs in the future,"I would rent again. \"",
2043261,22834242,2014-11-16,7573812,Sarah,This was a great rental.  The host was welcoming and made the check in super easy.  The location of this place is perfect.
2043261,31590658,2015-05-07,29926162,Kirk,"What a great place!!! Old building in a vibrant neighborhood, but the apartment is new, it is clean and airy."
Nice bath,nice kitchen,smaller common spaces.,,,
"I will stay again!!!\"",,,,,
2043261,32754024,2015-05-21,7736832,Robert,"To be honest, The room was musty and dusty. we called it the Cave."
Lost of things where broken,like the tiles in the bathroom. And a bit dirty. Dark room with no fresh air.,,,,
However,"the location is good And the room was really cheap compared to other options.\"",,,,
2043261,42900982,2015-08-16,38379399,Corey,Location was great! Had an amazing time in Boston
2043261,49779531,2015-10-06,40647769,Jonathan,The listing was exactly what we found behind the front door of this cozy North End apartment. We could not have loved the neighborhood anymore. Wonderful restaurants and shops were steps from the building and we were only a 5-10 minute walk from key Freedom Trail stops. We would enjoy staying here again on future trips to Boston.
2043261,51697723,2015-10-24,5863674,Jane,"Location is great. It's in the middle of Boston's Italian neighborhood, great food and a 35 minute walk to downtown. Feels safe. The apartment is clean and a good size. It is dark in the bedroom area and the bed is by the front door so because the building is old when people are coming and going it can be a bit loud while you are trying to sleep. But for the price the place isn't bad and I had a great experience there. Just be aware it can be loud while you are trying to sleep."
2043261,54516059,2015-11-21,28770850,Conor,"Very well positioned appt for seeing Boston. Apartment itself was pretty much as advertised, v small bathroom and smallish kitchen. Bed is fine and comfortable. TV didn't really work assuming due to poor reception. However otherwise good, building safe and secure, good wifi. Had a good time would do again."
2043261,70623307,2016-04-19,5201951,Linda,The keys were easily gotten and we were even able to go in a little earlier than agreed on.  The apartment is in a safe area.
2043261,71714261,2016-04-27,1584295,Ville,"The host switched our apartment to another one in the same building. On the upside, it was a larger apartment, but unfortunately it was in the basement, which meant very little natural light coming in. The apartment was otherwise as described, with a comfortable bed, good amenities and wifi, and clean. The location is great, with many restaurants a walking distance away."
2043261,78148362,2016-06-05,4743307,Laura,"I'll start with the positive-this is a great location: Apartment is located in the North End, which is also the Italian district. Walk less than a block up to Hanover and to the left and you're in the thick of amazing restaurants (all Italian). Mike's Pastry, gelato, convenience stores, etc. You're also about a ten minute walk from Quincy Market, which we did twice. On the way into the city we took a water taxi from the airport which was $12 a person and dropped us off right at Battery Wharf, a two minute walk up the street and we were there. Uber is about $10 which is what we did on the way back to the airport. Key pick-up was smooth with no issues."
I do have to say that the photos of the apartment are very deceiving. The apartment is small,and in my opinion not really suited for more than two people. We had three and the daybed in the kitchen just seemed awkward and in the way. Thankfully we weren't in the apartment often,as it would be tough to have any down time (you would basically be watching tv on someone's bed). I just think listing this for three people is a stretch. This was a really busy weekend so accommodation prices were through the roof,so comparable to hotels in the area I don't think it was necessarily unreasonable,but it still blows my mind a little bit that we paid what we did for what we got. That being said,when we looked at other options they were all around the same.
Apartment was clean,and had everything we needed- iron,hairdryer,dishes,etc. We only had two linens and two face cloths even though it was stated in the reservation we had three people but we made do as we didn't have time to call for more. In the grand scheme of things- not a big deal. Bed was comfortable,air conditioning was amazing to have.
"\"",,,,,
2043261,87461280,2016-07-20,10384444,Paul,"\"It's a very basic and simply furnished studio apartment that was clean and ok for a brief stay.  The location was perfect for me.  AirBnB told me it was available for two nights, but after I had selected in and had arrived at the property, it turned out that it was only available for one night.  This was an AirBnB screw up, not the property manager. The $59 service fee and $85 cleaning fee would be ok for a week long stay, but are ridiculous for a one night stay.  It's NOT a one bedroom apartment as they advertise. The bed is in a wide open interior hallway next to the entry door, which makes it a bit noisy with other tenants coming and going just outside the door.  The bed is exposed to the bathroom door and the kitchen. The bathroom is quite small. The bed in the kitchen is about 24\"\" from the stove. There were no instructions for operating the TV with three separate remotes"
2043261,87496993,2016-07-20,9390941,Kelley,"The location at 16 Battery is a great spot in the North End, and a short walk to the waterfront. Key pickup from a box was easy, and good to not have to coordinate a time with a person."
The unit itself perfectly suited my needs as a business traveler and solo,and was clean & tidy,but it is small and in an old and crappy building. The cost for one night seemed a little out of sync for what the place was,even with the great location,and even compared to summer hotel rates. The bed is right near the entry door,which picks up noise from people coming into other units
2043261,89230504,2016-07-27,84569596,Hesham,It Was great
1183032,6028609,2013-07-27,6402406,Francois,we stayed a bit more longer than one week in July in Mary Kate's apartment and it can be summarised by one word= PERFECT!
All you want is there: Apartment is very confortable,very well furnished and very good size with a bedroom separeted from Dining room . It's also very well located (Prudential less than 10 min by foot and same to reach Grey silverline bus station to join center of Boston with Very good rate also!,,,,
Moreover,there is a terrace on the roof of the building with chairs & tables which is very nice to have a drink after a long day visit with a very good view on Boston!,,,,
At least,Mary Kate is also very lovely women and was very carefull with us. (i.e take care about my wife who do not speek english very well,,,,
"For sure I will contact her again next time I will come in Boston!\"",,,,,
1183032,6741215,2013-08-23,6786881,Stefan,"Beautiful apartment, great location! Mary Kate is a very friendly and welcoming host. The bed might be a bit narrow for two guests but that is the only minor minus."
1183032,7250472,2013-09-13,7999618,Myles,Great apartment- excellent communication pre the visit with Mary Kate the owner.
Perfect for two 26 year old post doc graduates to Boston looking for work.,,,,,
Central location. Safe area.,,,,,
Across street from restaurants,Starbucks,walking distance from the T and Prudential - if lost- just look for the Prudential!!!...Boston is great- so friendly and manageable.,,,
Mary Kate is a super efficient host/owner and once she received us and explained the apartment needs- she left us with confidence to enjoy the location and the joys of Boston,,,,,
Would have no hesitation in recommending Mary Kate to any prospective visitor to Boston -  we look forward to meeting her again when we move!.,,,,,
"Chris and Susan.\"",,,,,
1183032,7896277,2013-10-07,1734538,Soren,I had a great stay at the apartment. Mary Kate was a great host and the apartment and not least the location was really good. If possible I would rent this place again next time I'm in Boston.
1183032,8116253,2013-10-16,4153748,Jacob,Great Apartment. Great Location. Great Host.
We really enjoyed our stay at Mary Kate's place and would happily stay there if we were in Boston again.,,,,,
"Only negative was that we didn't find the bed that comfortable but that's probably a personal thing.\"",,,,,
1183032,8602710,2013-11-07,9515200,Aunty Cat,"It was delightful to meet Mary Kate and stay in her charming, cosy and artistic apartment. The location is excellent and the accommodation very congenial. The apartment was as neat as a pin, elegantly decorated and very well-equipped. Mary Kate made us feel very welcome. We felt at quite at home, had a lovely time and would happily stay there again."
1183032,11753537,2014-04-14,1037641,Paul,"Mary Kate was a wonderful host, with a warm nature that is really reflected in her home. 2 of us were in Boston, and having never been before, can gladly say that the location is perfect; a variety of restaurants on the street itself or nearby, shopping of any kind, and plenty of convenience stores and coffee shops. The subway is also a short walk should you wish to venture further out into MA. With all that said, the apartment itself is so full of character, and homely, you may well just want to stay indoors! It really made our trip - thanks, Mary Kate!"
1183032,13275660,2014-05-24,13836597,Suraj,"What a pleasant place to stay right in the heart of historic south end neighborhood. There are pockets of Boston which are true personifications of the New England Charm, and Mary Kate's Colonial style apartment is definitely one of them."
I was looking for a place to accommodate my parents who were visiting for a week. Since they were visiting Boston for the first time,I wanted to find them a quiet place well equipped with all the amenities(kitchen necessities,laundry,TV etc),easy access to MBTA and walkable from a grocery store. All of these requirements were met well beyond expectation. In addition,Mary Kate gave us a 1 page handout for any further information.  She was kind enough to send us a text mid-week to ensure that my parents were well accommodated.
"I highly recommend this place and will definitely go in for it the next time. \"",,,,,
1183032,14272563,2014-06-16,13821552,Whitney,"Mary Kate's brownstone flat was a highlight of my vacation. Located in a funky part of town on Tremont street, the flat is an easy walk to many good restaurants and bars, cute shops, and the subway. I happened to be there when the Pride Parade was scheduled which made for a fun week- lots to see!"
Mary Kate made me feel welcome with a bottle of lovely wine in the fridge,fresh linens,and a bouquet of flowers. She met me at her flat and showed me around. Her flat was lovely: decorative touches,old charm style,and many interesting books to peruse. The roof deck is quite a hike,but worth the 4 flights of stairs! I washed clothes in the basement.
This was my first airbnb experience,and it was wonderful. Mary Kate is lovely,"and her home was perfect for my week-long stay. I spent 5 of the seven days of my stay alone in her flat and felt safe and secure in her apartment and in the neighborhood. I recommend!!!\"",,,
1183032,15527288,2014-07-11,3491769,Pamela,"Mary Kate was there to meet us with enthusiasm and a warm smile offering us a drink on a very warm summer's night after a very long international flight! She not only showed us around and let us know where everything could be found but also provided a detailed sheet of information which came in handy as a reference over the two weeks we stayed. She emailed us after a few days to make sure we were doing okay and to ask if we had any questions. It was conveniently located to walk to public transportation, shops and restaurants. We felt comfortable and confident staying in her home. It was a relaxing, wonderful oasis to come back to after a busy day in an extremely hot Boston. Ahhhh...We felt at home! Thank you Mary Kate!"
1183032,19470714,2014-09-13,2142994,Gian,"The flat is in a typidal Victorian building and was like in photos, with any confort, cableTv, WiFi, A/C, small kitchen. The location is amazing, near many good bar and restaurants, near bus stop for public transport, 25 min by walk from the Boston Public garden."
1183032,20898468,2014-10-07,16297864,Amira,"My parents really enjoyed their stay at Mary Kate's apartment. The apartment is centrally located and we were able to walk to many places. It was also a pleasure communicating with Mary Kate. We needed the apartment for a longer period and we were able to easily figure out a schedule that worked for us and Mary Kate. Then during our stay she helped us figure out things, even though she was on the west coast!"
1183032,23032389,2014-11-21,20587187,Rosie,"I stayed here for 2 weeks and Mary Kate was an excellent host. My flight got in to Boston late and she was very accommodating in arranging to meet me at the apartment. The apartment is lovely - small but perfectly formed, beautifully decorated and furnished with everything you could need. Perfect for one person and would work for a couple too. The location is fantastic and the building is secure. Felt like a home away from home - I can't recommend it enough!"
1183032,29855129,2015-04-13,28064482,Angela,My host greeted me on arrival with extreme courtesy. The apartment seemed very welcoming and corresponding to the description.
The first impression was confirmed in the following days,living in the neighborhood.,,,,
The area is well connected by public transport. For all 11 days of my stay I always used public transport.,,,,,
Even when you check out my guest was once again extremely courteous.,,,,,

She was very flexible with our check-in time and greeted us with a glass of Sherry despite the late hour of our arrival. The place was about a 10 minute walk from the T station, was very quiet at night, and the location can't be beat, with a large number of restaurants, cafes, and shops right out the front door."

I stayed for two weeks at her flat, and I absolutely loved it.  The place is well decorated, well maintained and full of inviting character and charm.  It has every amenity you could need or want for a comfortable long-term stay.  The flat faces away from the main street toward cozy brownstone courtyards, so even though it's in the middle of vibrant South End, with lots of great restaurants and night life, it was peaceful and quiet in the flat itself.  I would absolutely stay here again on my next Boston trip, and I would recommend it to anyone."
1183032,90197714,2016-07-31,38704782,Alesha,"We had a great time at Mary Kate's place. It was a 30 min walk to Fenway and shopping areas. Additionally It was only a $15 uber ride from the airport and very close to public transit. The apartment itself was beautiful and had everything you need. It was clean and very well air conditioned! Like she mentions in her description, the bed is small but was manageable (we are 5ft7 and 6ft2)."
971393,3982470,2013-04-01,5307536,Leah,My best friend & I briefly stayed in Kate's fab lil apartment! Gorgeous views from roof terrace & we adored how the North End reminded us of our travels through Italy! Kate was a great host & we wouldn't hesitate in recommending people to stay here :)
971393,4248472,2013-04-22,1615130,Micaela,"Kate was the most communicative, helpful and responsive host. We were booked to use her apt the weekend the Marathon bombing was coming to conclusion. Although we ended up canceling due to the unfortunate circumstances, she was so lovely, we're hoping to visit for coffee when we have our make-up trip."
971393,4568391,2013-05-13,5326384,Perrie,I had a fabulous time in Kates lovely apt. Friday night drinks on the terrace watching the sun go down overBoston was magical.

971393,4950244,2013-06-03,4899853,Christina,"We had a great stay at Kate's place in Boston. She was extremely responsive throughout the process, and left us great recommendations.  Her apartment is super cute, and in a great location - easy access to the T, and not swarming with tourists.  Plus the view from the roof was awesome.  I highly recommend her as a host, and we would stay here again in a heartbeat."
971393,5035332,2013-06-09,5521482,Thomas,Would recommend this place without hesitation.
We (2 adults and one toddler) had a terrific time at Kate's place. She's a very good host,serious,generous,attentive to details and she made our stay very easy and agreeable.

971393,5414821,2013-06-29,4819815,Barbara & Mick,"Great location in the North End of Boston.  Kate was very responsive to all questions and was helpful with getting to know the North End and having A/C was really great for the heat wave we experienced.  The roof deck really makes the place, its a great place to enjoy a cup of joe in the morning or a glass of wine in the evening.  Do be ready to climb some stairs, it is a 4th story walk up, but the view is worth it."
971393,5958575,2013-07-23,7564414,Kelli,Fabulous location and very clean apartment. Our stay was great.

So convenient to some of the best eats in Boston, close to the T, the airport and the roof top deck was such a treat! I'm so glad we skipped the hotel scene and got into the real experience of being Bostonians! Thanks Kate!"
971393,7795254,2013-10-03,8583942,Michael,"Michael & I spent five days at Kate's place at the end of September. We were celebrating 50 years since we met at university in Toronto. Kate was a wonderful host, from local info, to maps, to restaurant suggestions, to a chilled bottle of champagne in the fridge & fresh flowers from her rooftop garden!!"
She went above and beyond in looking after us. We lost our cell service & she came to our rescue like Paul Revere and ordered a cab for us. The location was great,"close to the \"\"T\"\"",Faneuil Hall,Quincy Market,the Aquarium,countless great restaurants & the Freedom Trail. Her private rooftop deck was a favourite of ours for morning coffee with fresh pastry and a glass of wine before dinner. From there we could see the steeple of the North Church & downtown

It was also very convenient to the subway. The apartment was clean.  It even has a small kitchen with a fridge, mircowave, plates, utensils and a small dining table.

Very easy to get to from the airport on the subway.  Very clean, with wifi, cable, large shower with hot water, clean towels, friendly doorman etc.  There is also a little fridge to keep your leftovers.  The apartment is on the 3rd floor but there is also an elevator, and there is a nice spot to hang out (in the summer) on the roof with a nice view.  A little expensive but was very nice."
23619,3457674,2013-02-02,3583963,Aure,"Henry and Lisa are wonderful hosts; they helped me out with everything I needed in a timely and thoughtful manner. The studio is amazing, in a perfect location, right in the heart of Beacon Hill. Walking distance to the T (tube/underground station), Boston Commons, shops and restaurant.

"Deborah and Gary\"",,,,,
23619,4361968,2013-04-30,5068490,Christine,"We had a truly fabulous stay at this great studio. The location can not be any better. You are a 5-minute walk to Park Street Station, which has both the red and green lines for the T. You are also steps away from Boston Common, the State House and the Freedom Trail. There is a great convenience store just downstairs which sells just about all you need and a range of local bars, coffee shops and restaurants. Faneuil Hall is a casual 10-15 minute stroll away, Newbury Street about 30 minutes by foot if you take your time through the Common and Public Gardens. There is also a large Whole Foods within half a mile walk. Transfer from the airport by cab is 15-20 minutes (depending on traffic of course!)"
The roof terrace is absolutely amazing,with incredible views and a great way to enjoy your morning coffee or have an evening drink. The concierges were incredibly helpful and polite,we felt very safe staying in the studio.,,,
The room is small but perfect for a couple,with plenty of storage so cases can be put away during your stay. Because of its location,the windows do not provide a lot of light to the room but the location and roof deck more than make up for that. Kitchen facilities are great,including a dishwasher,microwave,grill and range of items to help with cooking. We were surprised as well just how quiet the studio was despite being right in the middle of town and in a large apartment building. Although there are washing/drying facilities just steps away
I would highly suggest staying at this studio - safe,convenient,good facilities,"amazing views and location!\"",,

23619,9671648,2014-01-05,8247981,Petra,"Lovely apartment in a very good location. Close to Boston Commons, Faneuil Hall and the train station and many other sightseeing spots. (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps makes everything seem far away but i really isn't. I walked to MGH daily for work. The building is nice with 2 restaurants downstairs, about 15-20 mins from the airport. The rooftop deck had wonderful views but I didn't spend a lot of time there as it was winter. Most of the doormen were very nice especially Gerald. I didn't have a lot of interaction with the owners but I didn't have any major issues that needed to be dealt with."
The apartment itself was small but very comfortable and decorated to maximize space. I was able to share it comfortably with my boyfriend who is quite tall! :),,,,,
Although the apartment was warm,there was an occasional cold draft from the windows and you do get building noises (flushing toilets,garbage truck outside). However,"it was totally worth the money I paid and I kept getting compliments from my bf on picking a great place to stay! \"",,
23619,10129148,2014-02-02,8933860,Carlos,"We spent a month in the studio and it was great. Perfectly situated, just 2 minutes to Park St. Station and lots of restaurants. The studio is fully equiped with everything you need and has an amazing rooftop view."
"Henry and Lisa are very helpful and nice. If I have to come back to Boston I would love to stay there again. For sure.\"",,,,,

23619,10968897,2014-03-15,12878908,Jenny,"Great apartment! Exceptionally clean, beautiful views of the statehouse and Boston commons from the rooftop of the apartment. The location is fantastic, right next to a major subway interchange, walking distance to theatre district, historic freedom trail and Chinatown. Henry and Lisa responded very quickly and were very helpful with directions and getting from the airport to the apartment."
23619,11074453,2014-03-19,2686279,Annah,Perfect location for those that want to be in the heart of Boston . Hosts were kind and the apt was clean and warm!

Also, the apartment itself is wonderful, very cozy and comfortable. And of course the location is sublime. You can get an amazing view from the roof top on the 10th floor. I would definitely stay here again."
23619,11434882,2014-04-02,1394223,Agostino,"Beautiful, clean and comfortable. It's located in a great position, you can walk almost everywhere and there are several restaurant/cafè and grocery store just beside the building of the studio. I really recommend it and i would stay here again in my next trip to Boston."
23619,11515212,2014-04-06,12781811,Yatrika,Had a great time staying at Henry and Lisa's airbnb. It has a great location and the place was comfortable and clean.
23619,12365660,2014-04-30,11602877,Yosuf,My son and I spent one week in Boston in Henry's apartment.
The location is absolutely perfect,everything is within walking distance. The apartment is nice. Not too large,but for the two of us were rather comfortable.,,,
The communication with Henry and Lisa was perfect and they responded quickly and were very helpful. If one wants to find something that was not at the best,Henry and Lisa might consider changing the mattress,but again other than that it was a really nice stay.,,,
"\"",,,,,
23619,12840543,2014-05-12,14160685,Debbie,"A perfect location for exploring Boston, beside State House and at the beginning of the Freedom Trail.  Everything you will need is here inc. laundry, access to pubs and restaurants within a very easy walking distance."
23619,13027192,2014-05-18,2066912,Peter,"The apartment's location is unbeatable. The amenities in the apartment are fine , just as described on the web site (we particularly appreciated the comfortable bed). Henry and Lisa were terrific, meeting us late in the evening when our flight was delayed, and helping with lost luggage. We highly recommend this  accommodation option."
23619,13236070,2014-05-23,11195748,Kellie,"Fantastic location, walking distance to everything. Great hosts, they responded quickly to my questions. Studio has everything you need. I would stay here again and I highly recommend this place."

23619,13465214,2014-05-28,11446696,Kaitlin,A lovely studio apartment in a great location. It served above and beyond our needs for the weekend...LOVED the rooftop!
23619,14730158,2014-06-25,9831751,Shannon,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this place and these people! The location was incredible; great views, and easy access to the green line... seemed like everything was one stop away in any direction, and we walked to and from the T through the Common which was really nice! The apartment was extremely comfortable, quiet, clean, and had everything we needed. It is small as you can see in the photos, but for two people who really just needed a pillow at night and a shower in the morning, it suited us just fine. The hosts were very helpful and responsive and on time. I hope that if I ever get the chance to be in Boston again, this place is available to stay in because I already miss having my morning coffee on the roofdeck!!!"
23619,14945309,2014-06-30,10475649,Charles,"If one studies the history of the Revolutionary War in Boston, it all happens around you at Henry and Lisa's Condo.  To one side, you have the State House overlooking the iconic Boston Common, that used to be property belonging to Continental Congressmen Chairman John Hancock who was signatory of the Declaration of Independence.  Down the road you have King's Chapel which looms one element in the Revolutionary War as do Tremont St, the nearby original State House and Fennuel Hall.  (Pardon my spelling).  Location GREAT.  When one travels for a lengthy period of time, one can get a bit under the weather.  When that happens, one looks for one's own bed.  This condo was comfortable enough to make us feel at home and get over our 'under the weather' issues."
23619,15248717,2014-07-06,10659639,Julie,"\"I traveled to Boston with my 10 year old son to \"\"adventure"
That flat was as expected - just the the picture. The bed is comfortable,the towels are fluffy and the studio was clean. Don't expect to cook any elaborate meals there,which one likely wouldn't renting a studio flat.,,,
The building is nice and secure - the security personnel at the front were always polite and warm.,,,,,
The best part was really Henry - he was there right when we arrived,putting us at least,showing us around the building,including the most amazing rooftop deck,which he went out of the way for us so we could view the fireworks from there. Henry checked in to ensure everything was OK; he texted to warn us of the change in fireworks display from July 4 to July 3,"and he also was flexible and kind in letting us keep our luggage in the flat until 4 pm since we had an evening flight. I would highly recommend Henry and Lisa's flat in Boston!\""
23619,15576836,2014-07-12,15383721,Eduardo,What an amazing location! Next to Capitol on Boston Commons. Hosts were friendly and place was perfect for us to explore Boston.
23619,15857276,2014-07-17,10670009,Rod,"We were met by the hosts daughter who was delightful and very helpful.  The apartment is small but has ample storage for suitcases which is really helpful when travelling. The bathroom is clean and has ample ventilation and therefore made it ideal for drying those clothes that cannot be thrown in the dryer.  The laundry room and trash room is just two doors down and the machines work really well (cost about $1.75 per load-the laundry card can be loaded downstairs with cash so is really convenient). Full kitchen which is one of our prerequisites as we like to start our days with a cooked breakfast.  Our host was kind enough to supply a toaster at our request. Clean and comfy place to wind down after a long day of walking (try the free walking tours - so  much fun), internet, kitchen with nice little fridge (turn the fridge way up high if you want ice), and above all location/location/location.  My goodness it was perfect.  Restaurants everywhere and some great pubs all within staggering distance.  Lots of history.  Love Boston and love this apartment."
23619,16094143,2014-07-22,16186769,James,Good location. Easy to walk to most attractions in Boston. Flexible hosts who worked with us around our flight schedule. All of these made for a great summer trip to Boston!
23619,16540211,2014-07-29,11054001,Hayli,"My stay at Henry and Lisa's apartment was wonderful. Henry and Lisa are very friendly hosts. I met the couple when I first arrived in Boston, and they showed me to the apartment and explained where everything was in the complex e.g. the rooftop, laundry room, etc. The location is ideal, and the apartment itself looks exactly as it does in the photos. Wireless internet worked perfectly, although a number of cable channels do not get reception. The rooftop views are superb, and I would recommended booking this apartment with the views as a highlight of your stay. The bed was very comfortable, and the shower very large. Henry and Lisa provided a hairdryer, and many kitchen appliances, which made my stay very easy and pleasant. The room is small, but for a short stay, and for two people, the studio is perfect. I stayed here by myself, and could not have booked a more central location for coming home late at night (I always felt very safe). There is a convenience store on the corner, and Beacon Hill has a number of small grocers. I would love to stay here again if I returned to Boston! Thanks Henry and Lisa!"
23619,17213838,2014-08-09,17161166,Erin,"My mother and I just returned from Boston and we could not have asked for a better place to stay.  The location was prime (steps from the State House, Boston Common and the Freedom Trail), the host was helpful and informative, and the apartment was perfect.  We traveled with my 15 month old and she had plenty of space to play."
There are two subway stations within blocks of the apartment building.  One perk that is not included in the apartment description is the 10th floor patio that overlooks Boston Common and the State House...panorama views of the entire city!  Absolutely amazing!,,,,,
Next time I'm in Boston,"I will certainly stay here again!\"",,,,
23619,17574749,2014-08-14,866728,Collin,"The location could not be beat. Close to the subway, Common, Public Garden, and to many attractions. The place was comfortable and cozy and Henry and Lisa made us feel more than welcome. Would stay here again next time in Boston!"
23619,17924328,2014-08-19,13058485,Simon & Christina,Very good location. Perfect for us to explore Boston. The apartment itself is located perfectly in Boston. Very helpful and flexible host. All of these made for us a great summer trip.

23619,18945770,2014-09-03,17978346,Bryce,I can't think of a more perfect place for a long weekend in Boston. The building/security is excellent. The space is definitely studio-type space but still more than we needed for just the two of us. The internet connection was great as well and really helped us stay connected and research places to visit.
23619,19468633,2014-09-13,8003721,Peter,I enjoyed my stay. Great location and a good building with services. Apartment was just as it shows in the picture. I would enjoy staying again.
23619,19797001,2014-09-18,96829,Nikos,"This is a nice/spacious flat downtown Boston. The apartment is exactly as it looks in the pictures and is located at third floor an impressive building with controlled lobby access, very close to the state house, and very close to a metro station with both the green and the red line.  Groceries shop, along with fantastic restaurants, coffee shops is around the corner. The apartment was extremely clean, and is equipped with anything you might need during a short stay.  Henry was around for the check in and was answering efficiently all the requests you might have.  Internet/TV was working without any problems, speed was very good. In general, great stay, great location, great host."
23619,20003844,2014-09-22,16756878,Stephanie,"Henry and Lisa were quick to respond and helpful. The room was just as pictured and was very clean. The bed, sheets, and towels were very nice.

23619,20685925,2014-10-04,16401143,Monique,"Henry and Lisa's place is so perfect for two people exploring the city of Boston. Not only is it clean and exactly like you see it in the pictures, it is in the perfect location. Beacon Hill is in the heart of the city and a very nice and safe neighborhood. You are within walking distance from the T, Boston Commons, Public Gardens, great restaurants and so much more. The best part is that this location comes at an affordable price and is a comfortable place. In addition to this, their building has a 24-hour doorman and a rooftop garden with amazing city views."
We weren't able to meet Henry and Lisa as we took an overnight flight,however,they were very accommodating. We landed at 6am and the person staying there before us was checking out at 8am. They arranged for us to meet their cleaning lady at 9am who let us put our stuff in the room and gave us a key so that there was no delay in getting out to explore the city. Henry and Lisa are easy to get ahold of and provided all the information you needed for your stay related to them and the city. They checked in with us via Airbnb when we arrived to make sure everything went well with the check-in and let us know they were available if we had any questions or needs.,,,
"It was the perfect place for our stay and I highly recommend this place over any hotel. If we ever return to Boston we will choose to stay here over a hotel.\"",,,,,

Thank you so much Henry and Lisa!"
23619,22293755,2014-11-03,9831751,Shannon,"This was my second time staying in this apartment and I am so in love! It is super small, but its quiet and the location couldn't be more perfect. The roofdeck is out of this world (message me if you want pictures- I have shots from the summer and the fall with foliage)! Henry and Lisa are so kind and accommodating, allowing me late night arrival and late check out. I don't plan on staying anywhere else when I visit Boston in the future."

23619,23032587,2014-11-21,21250478,H S,"I stayed at this Beacon studio apartment for 7 nights. The apartment was exactly as in the photo and description, clean and well supplied for guests who want to cook /heat up food. The location is the greatest draw, as it is less than 5 minutes walk to the Park Street T station, as well as 2 streets away from the Whole Foods supermarket , and eateries/cafes are next door/around the corner. Although I didn't get to meet Henry and Lisa who were away,  they maintained constant contact via sms/email. If not for the draft of cold air coming through the gaps around the aircon( which Henry and Lisa offered to fix, but I declined as I could manage by turning on the heat)  , this would have been a perfect stay."
23619,23298979,2014-11-28,22510707,Shaun,"The apartment is just like described in the ad. Henry and Lisa were very quick to respond to messages and were punctual when meeting me and show me around the apartment, the laundry facilities and the amazing roof top deck. The location is very central and if I ever returned to Boston, I would definitely look to rent here again."
23619,23551976,2014-12-04,14489605,Richard,Checking in was easy.  Henry & Lisa had someone there to meet us and show us around.  The location was as good as it gets in Boston.

23619,23888984,2014-12-14,12277577,Annabel,"Great location, very close to Park Street station and Boston Common. Clean and exactly as illustrated in the picture. Great views of Boston skyline from the roof deck. Henry and Lisa were super accommodating and messaged me about one week prior to my stay to organise what time I could pick up the keys. Henry met me and my family in the apartment lobby, showed us around and made sure we had everything we needed. Would highly recommend."
23619,28355070,2015-03-22,22456489,Mike,"Hosts Henry and Lisa were very professional and courteous. They were able to accommodate my arrival time and greeted me at the doors of the building. Upon entering I was also welcomed by the security guard (who remembered me for the week I was there) and we made our way into the apartment. The apartment is as described, smaller than what I was accustomed to but it was certainly cozy and clean. The furniture was rearranged but the overall feeling was warm. The bathroom was also clean and had enough shampoo and soap to last the time I spent there. The kitchen appliances worked very well (I did not get a chance to use dishwasher). I spent 6 nights at the place while visiting Tufts Medical Center. I walked there everyday and it takes on average 12 minutes via Tremont at a brisk pace. I can say that the route and, in general, the  neighbourhood were quiet and safe. Overall the experience was excellent and I will be looking at this place again when I come back to Boston in the summer."
23619,29094834,2015-04-04,17924715,Joel,"At the summit of Beacon Hill, this unit provides excellent value in the very heart of downtown Boston, a few minutes walk from a subway hub, Park St Station, and just a few steps from the State House and Boston Common, where the Freedom Trail begins. It is within a short walk of numerous historic sites, state and federal government buildings, and Suffolk University, and about a 15-minute walk to the financial district, Quincy Market, and the North End (Little Italy). The 10th floor deck offers a spectacular view of Downtown and out into the country, and contains a designated smoking area as well. The studio itself has a comfortable bad and chairs, a large bathroom, and a kitchenette along one wall that is equipped for traditional or microwave cooking. The refrigerator functioned well. The WiFi was both consistent and adequate. The cable TV was essentially local. The hosts maintained contact the day of my arrival so they were able to meet me outside the building to let me in, explain the features of the studio and leave me the key. In conclusion, this rent all is perfect for tourists and those on a business trip."
23619,29684782,2015-04-11,16832799,Maya,Wonderful hosts and extremely accommodating. The place looks exactly like the pictures. Small but with all the necessary amenities and you can't beat the location. We would definitely stay here again

They even generously let us check out a little late when we told them our flight was leaving a little later than the standard 12pm checkout...and they did so on their own initiative. The location of this site is perfect, close to shops, the T, the park, and so on. The building was quiet. The unit was clean and equipped with everything we needed. Overall, a GREAT first Airbnb experience."

The neighborhood is really beautiful. 1 minute walk from Boston Commons. (and a T stop) A convenience store on the corner. Whole Foods was a 10 min walk away. 2 restaurants flanked the building,and many more were a short walk away.  There were so many super fun things to do that were a short walk (or T ride) away.,,,,
The main room was as described. The bathroom was much bigger than we expected. Great large shower. There was also a large closet which was very convenient. The building has security,and feels very safe and friendly. It has a rooftop deck with a beautiful view.,,,,
The neighborhood is really amazing. On the other side of the Commons are some quaint neighborhoods and antique shop areas to walk through. It was also a short walk to the harbor.,,,,,

The location was perfect for exploring the history of Boston,and some of the food! We were able to find our way around (also found some maps and other brochures there in the room that were helpful).  The size of the room for 2 people was perfect,and although we didn't cook as much as planned,we were thankful for the kitchenette space.,,

Right in the heart of everything, and just steps from the North End (where my boyfriend and I went every night--we live in L.A., which just doesn't have great Italian food). I also loved the roof deck-- I was able to take a beautiful nighttime shot of the gorgeous view from there."
23619,44772762,2015-08-29,36315132,Irina,"The building is perfectly located within downtown Boston / Beacon Hill. You can get around easily by foot or quickly reach the Blue (Bowdoin) and Red / Green Line (Park Street). The apartment is very clean and has all the necessary amenities for a stay in the city. Sizewise, it fits a couple well. Wifi    works well,  too. A big plus is the great view from the roof top terrace, which we enjoyed frequently. There's a porter in the building to guarantee security as well."
Communication with our hosts before and during our trip was efficient and friendly.,,,,,
"We would definitely stay at the appartement again and recommend it to friends and family.\"",,,,,
23619,45380572,2015-09-02,37400583,Bryan,"Had a great time, thanks for everything.   Couldn't ask for a better location."
23619,46365918,2015-09-10,30196016,Lesley,"Good communication by our hosts throughout.  Despite delays at Logan we were met promptly at the apartment.  Central location.  Convenience store close by and a short walk to Park Street subway station.  Apartment small but well-equipped.  Large comfortable bed.  Quiet, apart from brief refuse (garbage) collection early some mornings.  Hosts allowed us to leave suitcases in the apartment on day of departure as we were on an evening flight. We would stay again."
23619,48076715,2015-09-23,19170594,Tiffany,"I didn't get the chance to meet Henry and Lisa but I appreciated the consistent and prompt communication with them at time of booking and throughout the period until landing in Boston.  They offered me suggestions on where to eat and what to use for transportation, which was really appreciated! Although it's my first airbnb experience, I liked how they supplied toiletries, brochures, and even laundry detergent if we wanted to do our own laundry!"
"The best things I enjoyed about this place was the LOCATION. It's right in the middle of everything that's going on in Boston and it was easy to walk anywhere and easy for Uber to pick us up.  The other thing I loved about this place was the patio view on top of the 10th floor. We spent a couple evenings up there just having some drinks and dinner. Would recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston for the first time.\"",,,,,
23619,48496962,2015-09-27,14682095,Julie,This was our first experience using airbnb.  Henry and Lisa's friend met us and gave us the apartment keys.  Close to everything and within easy walking distance.  Clean.
23619,53317411,2015-11-08,10734008,Xus,"I spent 6 weeks in the apartment and it was a great experience. The day I arrived, Henry gave me the keys and took the time to show me around the building."
The apartment itself is small,but for one person is more than enough. Kitchen and bathroom are good and the laundry room is in the same floor,so it's easy to come and go.,,,
It's very close to Boston Common and the Park Street subway station,so the location is perfect.,,,,
"Overall I'm very happy with my experience with the apartment and the hosts.\"",,,,,
23619,56656050,2015-12-16,38865955,Michael,"Henry amd Lisa were great hosts. The communication and instructions were very clear. The location of the apartment was excellent, very central and close to restaurants, the subway, and Boston Common. We recommend the Japanese place downstairs, amd tge 21st Amendment pub around the corner. Not a big studio, but tidy and with useable amenities. It worked for us for the month. Extra towels and linen were helpful. We had no issues during our stay. Thanks!"
23619,58667745,2016-01-03,40146017,Giuseppe Andrea,I had an awesome experience with Henry and Lisa. The place is just downtown and it's easy to move from there either walking or with public transportation! The studio is very nice and well equipped. Check-in and check-out processes were very smooth and easy!
23619,64827940,2016-03-08,56781064,Steve,"This is a very, very small apartment -- but very comfortable and in an excellent location at the peak of Beacon Hill, on the Boston Common and an easy walk everywhere.  It also has access to a nice roof deck with great skyline views.  Henry met me at the front door, gave me a nice tour, and I had no problems after that."
23619,65384092,2016-03-13,60153831,Ashutosh,"Henry And Lisa are nice couple , it was a warm welcome. I liked the place I stayed."
23619,66168909,2016-03-20,55817392,Prashant And Selina,"This is a great studio apartment for anyone looking for a stay in Boston and the location is unbeatable. Beacon Hill is close to many of the neighboring districts, historic sites, shopping, and the T lines. Our stay with Henry and Lisa was fantastic, they were quick to respond to any questions we had and Lisa showed us the apartment upon check in. Everything was as described and the pictures were very accurate. We loved our time here."
23619,66720362,2016-03-24,14797723,Antonio,"The location couldn't be better, it's very close to most attractions and the Park Street metro will easily take you to Cambridge and other places. Beacon Hill is also full of coffee shops, places to have brunch and restaurants."
The apartment was very clean,it had everything we needed and the hosts were very accommodating. It does get a bit chilly during the evenings (in winter-spring) the it's the building who controls the thermostat,"so you might want to prepare for that.\"",,,
23619,67883389,2016-04-01,57456683,Brendan,Henry & Lisa's place is WICKED AWESOME.  You would be hard-pressed to find a better location in downtown Boston.
The configuration of the apt has changed and is reflected in picture #5 of 25.  New bed frame,bed is on the green wall now.  Minor stuff.  The place is small,so no more than 2 people could be comfortable here.  The bed is comfortable (not too hard,not too soft) and the hot water never stops.  There are plenty of restaurants/taverns in walking distance.  The other building tenants were polite and security was very pleasant and accommodating.  The building has a great view from the roof deck.,,
To be honest,the location is so great,we didn't spend much time at the apt.  We were able to get just about anywhere in Boston using either the subway or walking.,,,
We showed up a bit earlier than expected and Lisa was very quick to accommodate us,which we appreciated after our long flight.  They were also available via cell should you need it.,,,,
"I would not hesitate to stay here again or recommend it to my friends & family.\"",,,,,
23619,68300776,2016-04-04,52467712,Karen,"This apartment was great! Yes, it's tiny, but the bed is comfy, the shower is surprisingly spacious (with hot water for days), everything is spotless, and the hosts really provide everything you might need. And you probably won't be spending too much time there anyway, because the location is pretty much unbeatable. Zero-minute walk to the State House, the Commons, and the Athanaeum, fifteen minute walk to TD Garden, tons of coffeeshops and restaurants and historical biz. Highly recommend this place."
23619,69712069,2016-04-12,53607884,Adam,A comfortable apartment in a really nice building in ideal location.
Right on Boston Common and the Freedom Trail. 10 min walk from South Station,similar from North Station and TD Garden and a couple of minutes from nearest subway.,,,,
There is also access to a lovely sitting area on the roof with nice views.,,,,,
Henry & Lisa were very good with communication and were there to greet us and answer any questions when we arrived.,,,,,
"I would definitely stay there again!\"",,,,,
23619,71589230,2016-04-26,55294262,Deb,Lisa met us in the lobby and showed us around.  The location was perfect!  The room was very clean and the bed really comfortable. There is a fantastic roof terrace on the 10th floor overlooking the State House - perfect for a glass of wine and sunset view of the city!
23619,72331736,2016-05-02,1180513,Helen,"Henry and Lisa were fantastic hosts.  They made our stay as seamless as possible by meeting us a day in advance to provide us with the keys, and also facilitated a late check-out so that we could make the most of our last day around Boston!  From start to finish we had the most wonderful stay and the location on Beacon street was just perfect for exploring Boston on foot.  The apartment was cosy, clean and exactly as described with every necessity catered for, including some great maps and guide books!"
Thanks for a great stay Henry & Lisa,we'll be sure to look you up again if we're in town!,,,,
"Best Regards - Helen & Ciarán\"",,,,,
23619,74435250,2016-05-15,49033513,Sue,"Communication excellent right from time of booking. Yes very small apartment, more like a bed sitter, but adequate for us. No real lounge/dining space. Great bed, great shower, great location. Ate at both restaurants at street level, both good. So close to State House, in lovely area. Easy walk to Boston Common, Public Garden & Park Station."
23619,75135056,2016-05-19,46368726,Jerry,"地點不錯,但是房間隔音很差,馬路上的車聲很大,半夜還有很大聲的卡車收垃圾聲音,房間很冷暖氣卻無法自行開啟,棉被也太薄"
23619,75852952,2016-05-23,47854723,Oscar,"La ubicación es inmejorable. Muy lindo barrio, cerca de todo y muy atenta Lisa que nos esperó a nuestra involuntaria demora. El departamento es chico pero acogedor y bien equipado."
23619,77407573,2016-05-31,10408457,Katherine,"The apartment is in a great location and served our needs very well! The Beacon Hill area is adorable, and the apartment is extremely accessible to transportation. I would certainly recommend staying here!"
23619,78390888,2016-06-06,7712026,Kristina,"Henry og Lisa var de perfekte værter! Mine forældre lejede lejligheden (da jeg selv er bosat i Boston) og de var ovenud tilfredse. Lejligheden ligger centralt, lige over for Boston Common og tæt på flere T-stop. Faktisk ligger lejligheden i gåafstand til de fleste seværdigheder, så mine forældre fik slet ikke brug for deres metrokort. Lejligheden er ren og rummelig og passer perfekt til et par. Der er også adgang til en skøn tagterrasse. Henry og Lisa er utroligt venlige og meget fleksible når det kommer til check in og check ud. Vi vil helst sikkert anbefale lejligheden til kommende gæster!"
23619,79023887,2016-06-10,56163827,Julie,Nice building great location!
23619,80310076,2016-06-17,7712026,Kristina,"Vi har lånt lejligheden til gæster to gange og vi vil helt sikkert bruge den igen hvis den er ledig. Den ligger helt centralt i Boston, lige på freedom trail og i gåafstand til alle seværdigheder - se evt min tidligere post."
23619,81730915,2016-06-24,57363263,Felicity-Ann,"We were welcomed by Lisa and given the keys & a short tour of the room & building. The room was clean, comfortable & well serviced. Having the laundry close by was really. convenient. Lots of stores nearby to buy food for breakfast etc. Located close to so many interesting areas on the Freedom Trail."
23619,83962034,2016-07-04,4756495,Elle,We loved this apartment. An amazing location and perfect neighbourhood! We highly recommend staying at Lisa and Henry's place.
23619,85196518,2016-07-10,3239568,Leslie,"This was the perfect place to stay for a Boston visit! The studio apartment was located in a beautiful old building right in the heart of town which made all of our sightseeing and excursions very convenient. That said, it was also very quiet and private. Best of both worlds! Here is a bonus-- the bed was so comfortable!  Lisa gave us great directions from the airport. I recommend taking the subway. It was easy and free! And she was right there waiting for us when we arrived. Great visit! We would definitely stay there again on our next trip to Boston."
23619,86274931,2016-07-15,46628915,Rose,"We had a great time in Boston. Henry and Lisa responded to all of our questions very quickly. Lisa meet us on check-in and gave us a brief overview of the apartment and the location of roof top lookout. Everything in the apartment was exactly as described. Lots of dishes for two people. Two towels per person which was great. Nothing worse than only supplying one towel per person. The bathroom was very small but the shower made up for this loss. The bed was very comfortable and supplied with very soft feeling linens. For people who like to watch a little TV at night time after a full day walking around the city, the location of the TV was not positioned correctly. The bed should be rotated so the foot of the bed is facing the TV."
We never used the dishwasher as there never seemed to be enough dishes to place in there. However,it would be nice to provide a drying cloth so you can rinse a glass and dry it quickly instead of using paper towels.,,,,
The location of the apartment is excellent. It is just one block from Boston Common and the Public Gardens. There are two restaurants in the building but we never used them plus a small convenience store. The government centre is a short 5 minute walk with luggage. Therefore,you can easily get subway transportation to Airport. It will cost you $2.25- $2.75,,,,
"The airport is free once you get off the subway train. \"",,,,,
23619,87542873,2016-07-20,51730337,Craig,We had a great time everything was as described. The apartment was located in a perfect area for doing anything you could ask for.
23619,89312650,2016-07-27,58930456,Brian,You cannot beat this location. It's right in the middle of everything. Henry and Lisa were very friendly and accommodating hosts.
23619,90570050,2016-08-01,67532366,Ann,Great place to stay. Lisa and Henry were very communicative and available at all times. Use of space was really good. Location was reasonably central and easy to access everywhere we wanted to visit.
"Rooftop garden was a real bonus. Free view both during the day and night!\"",,,,,
23619,93151526,2016-08-11,39775166,Michelle,"Henry greeted us on arrival and took us through everything and showed us where to find the laundry and the roof balcony (which has the most incredible views, especially at sunset) The bed and pillows were really comfortable with excellent quality satin sheets. The building is beautiful and is in a great location. We were expecting an apartment size but it is only a hotel room size, there is a kitchen but too small to cook anything. The layout of the furniture could be better to allow more room and to watch TV. There is a large cupboard great for putting your suitcases away and hanging clothes. While the building itself is quiet, we did get woken up at 5am by rubbish trucks and road works and air con units are really loud overnight. We had an issue with the TV and Henry was very prompt in attending to it for us."
23619,95735215,2016-08-20,22510410,Joelen,"We had a wonderful stay here and it met our needs. Centrally located to public transportation (when needed), major attractions and in a safe neighborhood with many conveniences withing walking distance, we were happy with our stay and would definitely return."
23619,96807068,2016-08-24,89330428,Trudy,"Great location, good price, we loved the rooftop, we would definitely stay there again."
29155,1441597,2012-06-09,1918544,Edward,"Very nicely renovated, as advertised. No issues."
29155,2245282,2012-09-10,841536,Darcy,"What a fantastic place.  The apartment was clean, comfortable, centrally located, very quiet.  It was easy to find.  The staff was very helpful. We we're able to check in early, no problem. The place truly was the highlight of the trip.  There we're 8 of us and everyone was very happy with the accommodations."
29155,3092097,2012-12-15,4217128,Jeff,"We did not get the room pictured, but it was a nice enough 3 br unit.  Clean, well appointed and had TV / wi-fi.  I would stay there again."
29155,3351786,2013-01-15,2108008,Kaitlin,"Our group of 8 had a fantastic time at this property!  The setup was perfect and there was plenty of room for all of us.  Everything was clean and organized when we arrived and we were all incredibly happy with the space.  The location was great, too.  Would definitely stay there again."
The pictures provided are not of the same unit,"but it is a great 3 BR apartment nonetheless.\"",,,,
29155,3381234,2013-01-21,81783,Molly,"We stayed in a different unit than the one pictured - it's a historic six floor brownstone building broken up into multiple units on each floor.  Great location and really easy to check in (you are given a code to the door).  The unit was bright, clean and modern.  A little banged up in places but overall in pretty good shape. Two of the bedrooms were spacious and sunny, the third was about the size of the bed and dark.  The only real complaint would be that the wall separating our apartment from the other apartment on the floor was very thin - we could hear conversations and children crying as if they were in our apartment.  On the whole though, for 5 adults it was far better than a hotel and we would stay again."
29155,3994018,2013-04-02,3842242,Mark,"Had a great visit to Boston. This is a great place to stay, very clean, quite and convenient to the Backbay area. Cheers Bar is just up the street, and plenty of restaurants within a 10 minute walk."
29155,4782596,2013-05-26,3088104,Jane,"Our group of seven thoroughly enjoyed our three night stay in this Back Bay apartment. It's location is fantastic, right beside beautiful Boston Common and within walking distance of everything we wanted to see. The apartment itself is as seen in the photos, very comfortable, clean and tastefully decorated. Communication with the host was easy and emails answered quickly. We had a minor issue with the air conditioner but this was dealt with promptly. I would definitely recommend this accommodation."
29155,6731652,2013-08-23,6385845,Charlie,"Really spacious apartment in an amazing location. Close to the shops, nightlife and tourist destinations. You could fit 6 in comfortably and 8 if you used the air bed provided. Only negative was that it was really hot even with the a/c on but the host did provide fans"
29155,11507236,2014-04-06,9691507,Carey,"This 3 bedroom Back Bay apartment is a very cozy and comfortable place to stay. It is located in a lovely part of town which is very close to the city and the train, as well as being near plenty of shops and restaurants."
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Boston and had everything more than provided for us,"would definitely recommend staying here to anyone traveling with a group and in need of well located place to stay that doesn't feel at all like a hotel room but more of a home.\"",,,,
29155,12439923,2014-05-02,3160518,Adrian,This was a very nice and clean apartment in a great location.  Within walking distance of the Boston Commons and downtown.  We planned to take the public transit around but ended up walking almost everywhere because it was so convenient.  The arrangements with the key code made it super-easy to check in and out whenever was convenient for us.
29155,15903284,2014-07-18,12880103,Patrick,"Fantastic location right next to the Boston Common, Charles Street, Esplanade and Newberry Street. Very safe and secure neighborhood. Clean, well kept and ample room for the family. Will stay here again in the future."
29155,16890484,2014-08-04,14970024,Nathan,Neighborhood was great. Full kitchen was nice to have. It basically was as advertised.
29155,20090599,2014-09-23,18994029,Nick,"The apartment was in a perfect location, central and close to a lovely park and good shops and restaurants.  However, it was clearly used only as a rental proposition and was furnished in a cheap and very basic fashion and overall the feeling of the apartment was not warm, but rather cold and dark and even in the kitchen there was only a very basic level of supplies and utilities.  The beds were made uncomfortable by the use of plastic under sheets, which I have never experienced before.  Overall, we were disappointed, considering the price we were paying."
29155,20942744,2014-10-07,19808457,Macklen,The reservation was canceled 23 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
29155,25498974,2015-01-18,2587190,Alistair,"The location is perfect. The apartment is a bit of a weird set up, and because the three bedrooms are essentially different parts of the same room separated by just shutters, you can hear everything from each room and it doesn't feel very private. I'd say this is fine for a family, but a bit awkward for three colleagues, and would certainly recommend against this place if any of the rooms have couples in them - everyone else will hear everything."
The flat was also very cold in the winter with no obvious way to turn the heating on,and we were provided with the wrong door entry code when we arrived which caused one of my colleagues to wait outside the flat for half an hour trying to get through to people and have the code reset.,,,,
All in all,it was an ok stay in a great location,"but watch out for the lack of privacy between rooms. \"",,,
29155,25717574,2015-01-24,24864691,Adam,I traveled with a group of friends and felt very welcome here. It was super easy to get into the apartment and check out was easy. This is a great neighborhood with tons of great restaurants within walking distance. This place exceeded my expectations.
29155,26240902,2015-02-08,23676254,Vanessa,"We absolutely loved this place. It was perfect for our celebration. We were close to shopping, restaurants and parking. It was clean and cozy.  I would highly recommend booking with them. Thank you."
29155,30673215,2015-04-26,15156087,Shana,The bi-level condo was exactly what I was looking for and what was advertised. The condo was spacious and open with a authentic rustic Boston feel. There were plenty of linens and towels for all guests. It was located a block from the Boston Commons and a few blocks from Newbury Street so very convenient. Seamless was very responsive to emails prior to my arrival. I highly recommend staying at this location if anyone is coming to visit Boston with a large family/group.
29155,31620383,2015-05-07,30440636,Felicia,"I made the booking for my bosses. Seamless Transition was responsive  with my inquiries and they property is key-less, you can enter a code which is very efficient."
"Great place!\"",,,,,
29155,32967344,2015-05-24,528047,Tyler,"The location is a dream - right in the most convenient part of the Back Bay and just a few minutes walk from the Boston Common Garage. Keyless entry was a breeze. Boston is a small, walkable city, so this was the perfect locale for our Boston long-weekend trip."
29155,36172948,2015-06-26,29916436,Paul,We found there to be a definite problem with noise travelling throughout the property. This was mostly due to there not being good enough sound proofing in the room walls. This meant the sound of the AC and other guests was audible across the property.
However,"i would still recommend this property if you are happy with the above.\"",,,,
29155,41726159,2015-08-09,19774408,Brian,My wife and I stayed at 113 Beacon St (suite 2F) with three other couples (friends of ours) for a two night stay. We had concert tickets at Fenway Park and the location seemed good for us.
As it turned out,the location was excellent,not only for our Fenway evening,but also for a day of exploring Boston the following day. We may have been able to walk to the ballpark,but we decided to take a cab,which took less than ten minutes.
The setup of the apartment was great for us. Three bedrooms and one couple crashed in the living room. Even with the fourth couple,we had plenty of space.,,,,
The apartment is not new and shiny,but it was nice. Some beat up furniture,a kitchen cupboard door broken off its hinge and visible finger writing on the bathroom mirror were things that reminded us that this apartment experiences heavy traffic. That said,when we entered I felt instant relief,knowing the apartment would be perfect for us.,
The only negative came when our entire group was enjoying a pre-dinner cocktail in the living room and a mouse ran behind the couch. We tried to corner it but it ran under the stove and disappeared for the rest of our stay. I understand that this can be quite common in an old building in an urban environment,but this did not ease the embarrassment as the host.,,,,
After we checked out the next morning,I contacted Seamless and their response was as professional and urgent as you could ask for. They got back immediately,assuring me that in 9 years this is the FIRST ever rodent complaint they have received. They also assured me that a crew would be there immediately to investigate and prevent this from happening again. They also offered acdiscount on our stay without me having to ask. While a mouse sighting is never a good thing,their response to the whole situation has left me still feeling positive about our stay. I'm sure for some it's a deal breaker,but we were willing to accept it as a one-off and accept their partial refund.,
I would recommend this unit for your group stay,"confident that this professional and attentive company will eliminate this problem for any future guests. \"",,,,
29155,43369794,2015-08-19,8014849,Julia,"This listing was the perfect choice for our girls getaway to Boston. The photos are exactly what you see when you come in - being able to stay in a brownstone on Beacon St was perfect - walking distance to the park, downtown, shops and more. The ample space made it comfortable for our group to travel to Boston and feel at home. The mirrors everywhere also made it easy for us girls to get ready without being cramped in a small space. There was even an elevator for our luggage to go up and down - as this is an older home and the staircase to get up to the 2nd floor was tight."
Eat in Kitchen as shown - with all the amenities to allow us to cook our own food and relax in the air conditioned space.,,,,,
Would definitely recommend this space to a medium sized group of people - 3 couples could easily stay in this space with access to everything.,,,,,
Fenway is even a short 30 min walk straight down Beacon if you are coming to attend a Sox game! Cheers was a 2 min walk as well. Literally everything at your fingertips.,,,,,
Thank you again for being a great host before,"during and after our stay!\"",,,,
29155,49852860,2015-10-06,28665727,David,"This rental was perfect for what we were looking for.  We were a multi-generational trip (2 kids, 2 parents, and 2 grandparents).  It had plenty of room, and the kitchen was nicely sized.  The location was absolutely perfect, and we had a great time."
This rental was priced to perfection - we really needed at least two rooms for the six of us,which would have cost WAY more in a hotel that wouldn't have included the social space we got to hang out with our family.  It was clean and the furniture was at least as nice as if not nicer than any 3 star hotel.  The Wireless internet and cable worked perfectly.,,,,
The neighborhood was GREAT,with the only problem being parking.  I woke up at 8:00 sharp to move our car on Monday,but found a ticket on the window and a tow truck ready to load it up by 8:02 AM which I can't blame on the owner or the parking authority - but haven't we all made a $40 mistake sometime!  After choosing to use the Boston Commons Garage ($60 for 30 hours),I had perfect peace of mind since we didn't need the car while we were there.,,
The kitchen was fine,albeit a bit unusual - the dishwasher didn't work and the silverware drawer could only be opened when the refrigerator door was opened....,,,,
Other than the parking,which is not a hidden issue,"this place was perfect and we would most certainly recommend!  \"",,,
29155,51657018,2015-10-22,7809340,Elliott,Amazing space! Great location. Very clean. Perfect location!!
29155,56928504,2015-12-20,9265268,Mary,A fantastic place and location. The apartment had character and everything necessary for a weekend stay.  Easy to find and easy entry. The host responded quickly to questions and was accommodating. Would definitely stay again.
29155,57930985,2015-12-30,10212373,Lisa,This was an easy process from start to finish. The communication was immediate  and we were so pleased with the apartment. We spent two nights with our three young children and all of us found the apartment charming and just the right fit for our family.
29155,69235277,2016-04-10,33047036,Mohammad,Very spacious place in a great part of town. Also very close walking distance to a lot of main attractions in Boston. Overall a great place!
29155,73581621,2016-05-08,48851088,Megan,The host was extremely helpful from start to finish. The modern decor apartment was absolutely gorgeous and exactly as the photos show. The traditional decor was a darker apartment but still very nice and exactly as the photos show. Both apartments were perfect for our girls weekend in Boston and the building was in a great location. Would absolutely recommend this host and this listing - we had a fabulous time!
29155,80049132,2016-06-15,5839613,Danielle,Easy check in and clean. Great location! Would def stay again.
29155,93776157,2016-08-13,35493197,Noel,Everything worked smoothly with communications beforehand and entry to appt. Location is just fab. Appt is clean and well appointed and rooms good size. The appt is based upon a v large high ceiling-ed room that has been partitioned into a 3 bedroom appt with 2 beds on and 1 bathroom on mezzanine type floor. All bed rooms are of good size. The only small downside was that the layout and partitioning means that there isn't a great deal of soundproofing or privacy between bedrooms and also with the lounge. All in all a very good appt and would recommend for families (we have 2 teens who each need their own room)
12291029,70340834,2016-04-17,568530,Becky,"My daughter stayed at Nancy's place while attending the BU School of Medicine second look weekend.   The condo was located in a very convenient and safe neighborhood in Back Bay.  Her place was very comfortable and roomy, especially for one traveler.  Communication and follow up with Nancy was timely.  This will be a place we will keep on our short list for future visits to Boston"
12291029,70746189,2016-04-20,67200586,Patrick,Everything was great. Really nice location and Nancy was super helpful. Highly recommend.
12291029,73079250,2016-05-06,2711284,Joel,We had a great time in Boston at Nancy's place. It was very convenient and scenic. Definitely an iconic place to spend some time. I couldn't be more happy with the facilities and the host... the weather was a bit wanting but that's not up to her :)
12291029,74801297,2016-05-16,56755581,Pam,Great location! Nancy went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. Highly recommend.
12291029,76869780,2016-05-29,71565483,Lana,"Location, location, location!!! Nancy, we had a great time. Thank you for sharing your house with us."
12291029,77953208,2016-06-04,68326191,Devin,Nancy made us feel right at home and was extremely nice! The apt. was exactly as described and had great access to the Hynes Convention Center and all of the surrounding businesses. If you love the water as much as we do the apt. is fantastic. Right as you walk out of the door you see the park that surrounds the water which is a great place to unwind. I could not have been happier with my stay.
12291029,78610200,2016-06-07,13791187,Dan,"Owner was there to great us, and show us around the place. House was described perfectly, and we were very happy with the location. Walked to Fenway, walked to places for dinner, drinks. Very happy with our decision to stay at Nancys place in Back Bay."
12291029,79492744,2016-06-13,2102867,Maxine,"The space is set up more like a kid's playroom than an apartment (the family lives upstairs). The main room is basically a worn low sofa/ottoman at one end, bookcase/TV, and lots of children's playthings and furnishings. Probably fine for one night but for tired tourists staying several nights not so comfortable. The bed is very good (bedroom tiny). Parking is VERY difficult for non-residents in Boston, the host, Nancy, was helpful with parking."
12291029,82535270,2016-06-28,6517904,Brandon,Amazing location.  Pedestrian bridge to the Charles river esplanade is right at the door.  Minutes to Newbury street.  Walking distance to Boston Common and the heart of downtown.  Nancy was a very gracious host and so helpful to myself and my family.  She went above and beyond to help provide family friendly necessities that are usually not readily available.  This is the Boston you want to see.
12291029,86713552,2016-07-17,35475557,Casey,Awesome place to stay! Would highly recommend.
12291029,88307998,2016-07-24,73370303,Connie,"This was our first Airbnb booking, so I was a bit nervous.  But Nancy was always quick to respond to my texts.  Her husband was waiting outside for us as we drove up in the cab and was friendly and answered all of our questions.  It was my first trip to Boston -- the main reason was to see the SF Giants play the Red Sox.  But we also wanted to see all the usual attractions (Freedom Trail, Newbury St, Public Garden, etc. etc).  This location was absolutely PERFECT.  We walked everywhere.  Fantastic quiet neighborhood, and we always felt safe. Beautiful Charles River right across the street, and shops and restaurants are within a couple blocks.  The apartment looked just like the pictures and was comfortable for me and my husband.   Thank you Nancy and Bob for a memorable trip to Boston!"

12291029,91250325,2016-08-04,87242052,Jennifer,This is a fantastic central Back Bay location. The bedroom was very cozy & comfortable & the place from the moment you walk in the door is tidy & well-kept. It was also quiet.
This was my first AirBnB experience so I hadn't thought about packing a hair dryer,linens or umbrellas...luckily this was all in place ;) and it was raining when we arrived so the umbrellas at the front door came in very handy.,,,,
Most importantly,"Nancy (and her husband) were responsive to texts & were very flexible with our check-in & out time. We were there for 2 nights and it was a wonderful experience for my son and I.  Thank you so much! \"",,,,
12291029,93066544,2016-08-11,42775594,Etienne,"Perfect location to go jogging in the morning along the river, very good location to go in back bay shopping area still 4 to 5 blocks to walk, zero view from the window so do not expect a city view. Hosts are perfect."
12291029,93730740,2016-08-13,32846217,Kirk,I was very pleased by the apartment and its location. The apartment is very spacious and extremely well stocked. The  place is as cozy as can be.
My plane was delayed yet I had no problems with the arrangements.  Communications with the hosts could not have been better.,,,,,
"Highly recommended. \"",,,,,
12291029,96037022,2016-08-21,82085338,Paul,Nancy and the apartment were great!  Can't beat the location!
12291029,98492467,2016-08-31,74673966,Melinda,"Nancy is an excellent host. She communicates proactively and is extremely responsive too. She helped us figure out some tricky transportation logistics, which was super helpful."
One of the best things about this place is the location - it's close to all the shopping,"restaurants etc on Newbury and Boylston and an easy walk to the Common and sights beyond.\"",,,,
13614982,85549946,2016-07-12,23463301,Molly,"\"Sophia's place was in a FANTASTIC location! The place itself is small and cozy, but perfect for two people. Furniture was all comfy and nice too. The only downfalls were the pillows and towels. The pillows themselves were super flat/not supportive. The towel \"\"problem\"\" was that there was only one for two people for 5 days. I let Sophia know and she offered to have one dropped off free of charge which was much appreciated. Also"
13614982,86864498,2016-07-17,1481756,Becca And Mark,"\"Sophia's apartment was great! It is also in a great location! It is in a historic building directly adjacent to the \"\"T\"\" stop on the green line"
13614982,87697200,2016-07-21,20561566,Yohann,"The location is excellent. It is right off Newbury Street next to great coffee shops and shopping. Sophia, the host, did a great job communicating with us and answering questions. Our flight was delayed, and we flew in very late at night and she was able to make arrangements to get us access."
13614982,88684046,2016-07-25,77697946,Jessica,"My friend and I booked with Sophia for a girl's weekend. We had a blast! Apartment was clean and bright, and it's also located within walking distance of everything you need, including a T station. We were a bit late for our check in due to baggage claim issues, but Sophia was gracious and understanding and kept in touch throughout the weekend. There's a garbage truck that rumbles through at 6am, but we're early risers so it wasn't an issue for us. Would definitely book again!"
13614982,89644277,2016-07-29,82172817,Peerawat,"Sophia's apartment is very spacious, and the location cannot be any better, surrounded by restaurants and shops. The T train is only a minute away from her apartment."
Sophia is a great host; she gave  recommendations for places to eat,sightseeing locations,etc.,,,
"I definitely recommend her place to anyone looking for a place to stay in Boston! \"",,,,,
13614982,97176399,2016-08-26,3883562,Daliah,"This listing is in a very convenient Boston neighborhood. Central and easily accessible. Would recommend this for a short stay only given the space and sleeping limitations (one bed, one air mattress). Bathroom is inside master bedroom so if sharing with friends/colleagues, this may be important to keep in mind."
13614982,99093278,2016-09-03,67656641,Kori,Sophia was nice enough to meet us early and let us drop our bags off before checkin when we got into town. She was so sweet and very helpful! She gave us ideas for where to go and what to do in Boston. Location was PERFECT. So many walkable restaurants and historical sites. We really enjoyed our stay. The water pressure was very nice and refreshing. :)
14035936,97828058,2016-08-28,50308513,Patrick,Amazing location and the best skyline view of Boston and the Charles I have ever seen.  Really a unique and amazing space located in one of the best neighborhoods of Boston.
14035936,98608450,2016-08-31,12703057,Kelly,"This was a lovely stay. The apartment is bright, full of character and attractive. It's located in the best of neighborhoods, in my opinion, which added a lot to my stay. The terraces are a treat! Definitely watch the sunrise and/or sunset from there - you will fall in love with sense of space and calm that has to offer."
The host was extremely kind and responsive. He answered all my questions and concerns promptly. When there was a leak,he called in a technician to fix the problem right away,and left a bottle of wine for me to enjoy,gestures I deeply appreciated.,,
There were some dusty areas that could use a more thorough cleaning. Also,some hand towels int he bathrooms,baths mats and a dish towel for the kitchen would be nice.,,,
"This is absolutely one of the best Airbnb's I have stayed in and I would recommend this to any individual or couple looking to stay in a quiet yet central neighborhood. \"",,,,,
8371115,48802423,2015-09-28,9137430,Andre,My girlfriend and I spent a weekend in Boston and were so lucky to get Jennifer as a host. Jennifer was incredibly thoughtful and responsive both while coordinating and during our stay.
When we arrived,Jennifer was there waiting for us. She very thoroughly showed us around the apartment,answered any questions we had,and made sure we had everything we needed. We didn’t feel the need to call her once during our stay – she covered everything and anything else we needed was in the manual she provided,along with some great recommendations for things to do and see.,
The apartment itself was super clean,bright,spacious,and comfortable. Jennifer had very thoughtfully laid out our towels on the bed along with a welcome card and some treats. We made it back to the apartment in time to watch the sunset on the roof deck,which has an awesome view of the city,and is a great way to relax and kill time before dinner. We felt right at home.
Check out was totally painless – we didn’t really accumulate any garbage the weekend we stayed,so we just had to tidy up enough so things were as they were when we arrived,made sure everything was turned off,left the keys by the entrance,and made sure the doors were closed and locked behind us. Jennifer even checked in on us towards the end of our last day to make sure we found everything okay.,
If you’re deciding on a neighborhood for your stay,pick South End. You can spend a whole day just walking around exploring the neighborhood and the different shops,cafes,and restaurants here,away from all the tourists and students you have to navigate elsewhere. Also,the city is so walkable that you really don’t have to worry about being too far away from anything.
"We had such a great time and felt really taken care of – a completely worry-free weekend. That’s exactly the kind of experience I’m hoping for whenever I use Airbnb. Thanks Jennifer for being an awesome host!\"",,,,,
8371115,49696514,2015-10-05,25805476,Michael,"Jennifer was fantastic - giving us some great restaurant reviews and recommendations in the neighborhood. We really enjoyed the South End, which is the largest remaining Victorian neighborhood in North America (according to wikipedia, so it must be true!). We were only there for a weekend, but would definitely come back."
8371115,51387439,2015-10-19,12008238,Colleen,"We had a lovely long weekend in the South End at Jennifer's home.   So very comfortable  every aspect of the entire apartment, lots of sunlight, furnishings are just as you see them, and the roof deck a bonus.  Kitchen was perfect for the cook, felt like home!  The recommendation she made for eating out was spot on for the South End bistro.  The apartment would be our first choice when we return to Boston."
8371115,72196296,2016-05-01,68233110,Tyler,"We had an absolutely fantastic time staying at Jen's place! Check-in was very easy. Her boyfriend was there the exact time we arrived to let us in. He showed us around and told us everything about the apartment that we needed to know. Even left out fresh towels for us and a guide of the best restaurants in the neighborhood. The neighborhood by the way was very charming and within walking distance to endless shops, restaurants and bars. This was my first AirBNB experience and it was extremely pleasant. Thanks for making it such an awesome trip guys!"
8371115,75832070,2016-05-23,2049356,Mary,"Jennifer and Brandon were two of the friendliest people I have ever met!  They both greeted my friend and I at their house when we arrived to show us the ins and outs of their beautiful home.  They also had a fantastic binder set up with great recommendations for food options in the area, other little details about the house, as well as passes for the metro and renting bicycles!  My friend and I absolutely loved staying here and if we ever got the chance, we would definitely stay there again."
8371115,80544381,2016-06-18,2834805,Stephanie,"Jennifer was extremely responsive and very accommodating.  We really needed to check in early after arriving on a red-eye from Boston, and she and her lovely husband made it work and greeted us on the steps of their home at 8am, ready to provide a tour and hand over keys.  The house was very comfortable, well-appointed and had tons of charm. We really enjoyed the roof deck (I had a nice nap up there!).  The only thing that was disappointing is that we couldn't stay for a longer time.  We would stay with Jennifer again on our next visit, if possible.  Also loved the local chocolate Jennifer left for us. :)"
8371115,86982785,2016-07-18,55974312,Ryan,"We had a great stay at Jennifer's home in the South End of Boston. Having lived in the south end we wanted to stay in a brownstone with a roof deck just like we had when we lived there. What can I (URL HIDDEN) was better than the pictures. Perfect home, location and of course perfect welcome with everything we needed to know. We felt immediately at home and made our weekend visiting with friends all the more special."
8371115,88747159,2016-07-25,79688008,Matthew,"Jen was a great host! She met my friend and I at the steps of her place to let us in and show us around. The place looks even better than the pictures! Very nice neighborhood with tons of great suggestions for things in the area by Jen. With the location, quality of the apartment, and a hospitable host, it'd be hard to find a place better than this!"
8371115,92143586,2016-08-07,24124138,Kyle,"Staying in Jen's apartment was almost the highlight of my entire trip. The location is on a beautiful tree lined street, and the view from the private rooftop deck is absolutely incredible. Checking in and out was a breeze. The apartment was even better than the pictures, and extremely clean!This might be one of my favorite AirBNB's that I've stayed in so far! I give this listing a 10/10 and would recommend it to anyone who is staying in the Boston area, I hope to return sometime again!"
2000797,15072113,2014-07-01,1705196,Marie-Noelle,"Jessica's house is as huge as it is charming and quaint, with pieces of art everywhere, an Harry Potter cabinet and a secret hallway! The neighborhood is beautiful, with lots of trees and big colorful wooden houses, and even if there's not much cafes or nice restaurants around (for what we saw), the house is only a 10 minutes walk away of the train station which makes it very easy to go everywhere in town. We really enjoyed Boston and Jessica's warm welcome."
2000797,16486590,2014-07-28,17341738,Elisa,"Jessica picked me up at the Saving Hill T and gave me a tour of the neighborhood before we went to the house. The room is great - big and spacious - and the balcony makes it extra special. Jessica is quick to respond any time I contact her and has helped me any time something has come up. The T is a convenient walk, the neighborhood is nice, the house is wonderful, and the other guests are all interesting. Great place to stay."
2000797,17359006,2014-08-11,17341738,Elisa,"Jessica is very welcoming and responsive to any issues that arise. We were able to resolve together a problem with airbnb's booking process. The neighborhood is convenient to the T, interesting place to walk around, and a close run to the a local park and beach. Great place to stay."

The room was ok for the price,"the only thing we think needs improvement is the cleanliness of both the bedroom and the bathroom.\"",,,,
2000797,18038841,2014-08-20,18597826,Fallon,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay with Jessica. Not only is her home wonderful and full of character, anyone else staying with her that you meet will be lovely as well. Everything was as described with an easy walk to the T. She sat down with us and made a map/list of good places in the area and good things to see in the city. I would highly recommend booking with her!"

Jessica was very helpful in pointing me out to places  that I needed to visit. Also, the location is central! Close walk to the T and  to nice cozy restaurants. It is also a quiet neighborhood.

2000797,19739893,2014-09-17,8260253,Cecil,"Jessica was welcoming and accommodating. She was flexible, allowing us to check in late at night after we flew in. The property is charming and the neighborhood is quiet. And the house is just a short walk from the T, so getting around the city (and even the outlying towns) without a car was a breeze. Great experience."
2000797,21523140,2014-10-19,1424000,Mike,Jessica accommodated our early arrival and the place was just what we needed.  Quiet at night and in a central location close to the T and not far from good Dorchester restaurants and bars.
2000797,21766148,2014-10-23,22480304,Leonardo,I would recommend Jessica's house to anyone visiting Boston. Her house is 4-5 blocks away from the train station and from there you can go to most of the touristic spots. She was very easy going and made me feel very comfortable at her house. The only thing to keep in mind is that you'll be sharing the bathroom with other guests.
2000797,22120162,2014-10-30,19876839,Tatyana,"It's easy to get to Jessica's place. The area is nice and hilly, people are helpful and friendly. It's easy to get to South station, Harvard, JFK presidential library is close by. There's a small cafe by metro entrance, where you can have a coffee with pastry, and a buffet with great breakfast. Jessica's house is cozy and pretty. I had a room with harbor view (as promised), the bed is comfortable, a few towels. There were several maps placed in the room that helped me a lot during my Boston walks. Jessica is an pleasant person to talk to."
2000797,22276711,2014-11-02,9701197,Jon,"This is a nice house in a good neighbourhood, and very close to public transit and biking distance to downtown. One thing that isn't clear from the description is that there are several other rooms being rented out, so you are staying amongst other strangers. In any case, it was fine for my short stay."
2000797,22486729,2014-11-08,1650908,Louise,"Jessica's house is peaceful and full of attitude, the neighborhood is packed with wooden, fairytale-like houses, there's easy access to and from the city and gorgeous indian food nearby."

It's a very manageable walk from the subway (although you have to climb a hill, which could be difficult with a lot of luggage) and the area is very nice with some great restaurants and bars. It's not far from the beach where you can go running (or swimming, weather permitting...) A great place to stay in Boston! Thank you!"
2000797,23598337,2014-12-06,5087823,Sophie,"Jessica's house is a great place to stay! I stayed there for 3 weeks and immediately felt at home. Everyone in the house is both friendly, up for a chat, and respectful of eachother's privacy. The house is close to the T and in a very safe neighbourhood. The rooms are big but still cosy. Lots of closet space too :)"
I definitely recommend this place,and will come back whenever I'm in Boston again!,,,,
"Thank you\"",,,,,
2000797,27891152,2015-03-14,28082516,Stefano,"Jessica's house is very nice, like the description. It's close to Savin hill subway on the red T line, 10 minutes from the main sightseen. Near the house there are an irish pub, a supermarket and a cafe for breakfast. The room is spacious, clean, comfortable  and has a beautiful view over the area and ocean."
The bathroom is shared with other guest.,,,,,
Jessica is very helpful and kind. She gave me all the information about my trip in Boston.,,,,,

2000797,35319501,2015-06-17,33829550,Theresa,"Jessica was very helpful and thoughtful.  Provided useful tips on nearby amenities and neighborhood history. The location is convenient to public transport, big plus for me. It is a diverse neighborhood and people are friendly.  Overall it was like staying with family. Jessica is happy to see you but has her own busy life to occupy her. So just the right amount of attention. The several storied rambling house is comfortable, not fussy, and all needs are met. Seversl other folks were also staying while I was there, which provided entertaining conversations but it was still quiet in the evenings. There are also lots of books and a lovely sea breeze to enjoy while sitting on the back porch reading! Would stay again. :-)"
2000797,35595407,2015-06-20,21536767,Weizhou,"For the very short time I of my stay, I felt Jessica's place is very nice. It's calm neighborhood, easy to access. I went out running one evening, very good for running also. The house provided everything I needed, very convenient. I did manage to meet Jessica for a very little while. She is a very easy-going lady, very warm and you can easily feel her love of life."
2000797,35807614,2015-06-22,32866280,Elissa,This is a very homey house which feels like it's been in the family for a long time yet has a Bohemian atmosphere.  It almost feels like a farmhouse although it is in an area of Boston that is on the T.
Jessica is welcoming and has a lot of helpful information for you.  Do be aware that she may give you several different phone numbers,and if you need to make sure to call the latest one.  Also,if you have heavy luggage,it is better to arrange to take a taxi to the house because there is quite a hill.  Even with a disability,I did not find the hill impossible once I got rid of my luggage.  There are lots of other neat houses in the neighborhood that you'll see on your way.,
An interesting place to eat breakfast is McKenna's Cafe,close to the Savin Hill T stop.  Very filling and obviously a neighborhood hangout!,,,,
I spent less time in the house than I expected,so only got to chat with one other visitor for about half an hour,but I enjoyed that quite a bit and found my room relaxing,especially with a nice little balcony outside!  Plus,I discovered a new mystery series from some books that Jessica had in the room.  I felt much more at home here than in the fancy hotel I spent the previous two nights in.,
Thanks,Jessica!,,,,

Jessica  qui parle Français nous a donné de très bons conseils pour visiter Boston. Possibilité de garer sa voiture. Nous recommandons vivement.
2000797,39780296,2015-07-26,31039566,Chris,"The neighborhood was good, we slept good.  The room was slightly different than I expected and not for the better.  The bathroom was a little outdated but it worked.  The  balcony from our room could only be accessed by climbing out the window.  (I'm agile so it was no problem, just a little awkward).  The house overall was neat and clean.  I suggest getting a ride to her house though from the train as the house is at the top of a long hill.  We were pooped after pulling our luggage on a hot day.  Going TO the station was no problem though, as it was downhill!"
"All in all the was a good value though and we had a pleasant stay.  Jessica was very nice.   I suggest this place to anyone looking for a good value in a good neighborhood.\"",,,,,

2000797,48383456,2015-09-26,11853395,Kathy,Jessica is a pleasant and informative host who is very enthusiastic and proud of Boston. Contingency plans were given to us prior to arrival in case she wasn't at home which proved most useful. But we did not see her again to speak to during our stay.
Location was quiet and easy to access what we wanted to do by subway.  Carrying luggage uphill would not be easy.,,,,,
However we found the accommodation old,"tired and basic. It was very disappointing and certainly not up to the standard we have been experiencing and expecting from airbnb. The reality of the accommodation did not meet the expectation derived from the imaginative website description.\"",,,,
2000797,48968425,2015-09-29,242967,Liza,"I had a wonderful stay with Jessica!  From the daily cleaning for a spotless house, to leaving the light in the hallway on all night, to the fire extinguisher clearly visible on the stair landing, Jessica has clearly put a lot of thought into hosting and it shows.  I thought I might find her house a bit far from Boston, but on the contrary, I found it very convenient. And it was actually nice to get away from the bustle of Boston and into a real (quiet) neighborhood at night.  It's about a 10 minute walk to the subway, and maybe another 10-15 into the city. Jessica also enforces quiet hours on the 2nd floor, which I loved. You won't be bothered by other guests music or loud talking on the phone here. Finally, I took the red eye and got in at 6:30 am. My room wasn't ready, but Jessica let me put  my bags in the house so I could go out into Boston until my room was ready."

I got the Balcony Room on the second floor with a small wooden balcony facing the ocean. Jessica was there when I checked in. Not only did she gave me an introduction to facilities around the house, to the neighbourhood,  and to places I could visit during my stay by pointing to them at the balcony, she gave me a lift to the nearby supermarket and pointed to metro station and diners along the way. The house was located in a quiet and safe neighbourhood with places to visit such as J.F.K Library and seaside literally a stone away and city centre a few stops away by train. I jogged every morning and enjoyed my breakfast at the balcony and felt awed by the beatific view of the sunset. The house has not only everything you need for a home away from home (fully equipped kitchen with tea and coffee available, laundry, bath with good water pressure, enough closet room, etc), it also has a small garden at the front, a library where you can sit, read or play music (there is a guitar and an African drum). Jessica and her housekeeper Betty has created a very welcoming, relaxing atmosphere. I will come back here when I'm in town again, for sure."

Deborah gave us great directions from the airport and made sure we knew how to get around, plus she greeted us at the apartment even though our flight got in early in the morning!  The location is absolutely ideal, a block from Newbury Street, and literally steps from the Hynes stop on the Green line. Our trip was based around going to a Red Sox game, which was perfect because Fenway was just a short walk away! There were 4 games over the 6 days we were there, and even though we only went to one, we got to see the fans come in swarms an hour or so before the game, walking right outside the apartment.  Deborah was very hospitable and accommodating and we had everything we could’ve needed during our stay, she even stocked the fridge with breakfast supplies for us!  The apartment was perfect size for the two of us, with plenty of space for us to store our luggage in the closet, but it might be a little bit too cozy for more than two people.   We had such a great time pretending like we lived in an apartment in the city of Boston for the week, thanks for everything Deborah! I will be recommending to my friends and family!"

Parking wasnt an issue for me as I had friends n the area where I could leave my car.

deborah is great,the bed is fantastically comfortable,,,,
the apartment is very well set up,user friendly,with storage for your belongings in both closets and dressers. there are a million places to eat and things to do within walking distance. the train is right around the corner,there is a 24 hour mini mart right across the street. she has a great little guide book that she put together herself answering any questions one might have (including restaurant menus,internet woes,television channels....)
very much like a real bed and breakfast.,,,,,

Plenty of clean/plush towels, a nice comfy bed after a long day, & a fully equipped kitchen.

Deborah has thought of everything you might need right down to area maps, menus and brochures. There's even a sewing kit! I was traveling alone and was very comfortable. Perfect for a couple as well. The location in the midst of The Berkeley School of Music is surrounded by all you would need. 24 hour market,coffee shops, all levels of dining and easy access to public transportation. My flight was delayed by 2 hours and Deborah was very gracious in meeting at the later time. I took a cab in Logan for about $35 mid day on a Monday. I took the T train upon return for about $3. I think the train was faster! Very happy with my choice and would stay again."

Deborah was very quick at responding to our enquiries and flexible about meeting us upon our arrival. She explained everything about the flat very clearly and had some great suggestions for places to check out in Boston.,,,,,

36885,610961,2011-10-09,968826,Megan,We had a wonderful time at this apartment in Boston. It is bigger than it appears in the pictures and is very cute. Deborah was a wonderful host and made sure we had everything we needed. She went above and beyond to make sure we had a good stay. I would definitely stay here again on future trips to the area. The location of the apartment is central and there is a ton of great bars and restaurants that are walking distance. Thanks again Deborah! :)
36885,627417,2011-10-14,892639,Elizabeth,"While my stay at the Cozy Corner of Boston was very disappointing, Deborah was pleasant, cooperative and receptive to feedback.  Firstly, the studio apartment is in a very rundown and depressing block, mainly inhabited by students.  The photos give no indication of the worn and dilapidated condition of the furniture and the furnishings in the studio apartment."
With no overhead lighting in the bed/sitting area,the place is dark.  There is very little room in the tiny bathroom to place toiletries.  Although the advertisement for this accommodation indicates that it has an eat-in kitchen,that would only be challenging without either standing up or removing a piece of furniture.  Most disturbing of all for me was the dirt and grime that met me upon my arrival.  For instance,the bathtub had some residue in it,a significant coat of dust clung to the furniture and every door handle and drawer handle was coated in grime.,
When I contacted Airbnb,they dealt with my complaints professionally and sensitivity. I appreciated that Deborah subsequently organized for the place to professionally cleaned.  I was also very grateful that Deborah allowed me a very late check-out time.,,,,

I attended a work related conference - with venues spanning back bay (copley, marriott, westin, sheraton) as well as getting shuttle buses to the waterfront and the new boston convention center.   This cozy little studio was a hop skip and a jump to all.  Steps from the MBTA.  Deborah was warm and welcoming.    We were immediately comfortable in our surroundings.  So much better than a hotel!    Terrific restaurants very nearby too.  Whole foods a few blocks away and trader joes just 2 blocks away.... perfect!   I would highly recommend a Cozy Corner of Boston to adventurous travelers who love city living."

36885,714751,2011-11-13,1374061,Nathan,"I stayed at Deborah's apartment during a work trip to Back Bay and found both location and comfort to have been great. Deborah is a very thoughtful and considerate host, and not only provided a comfortable and well-provisioned room but took the time to ensure I knew how to navigate town from the apartment, what is available for local amenities, etc. While packing to leave, I overlooked my phone charger and left it at the apartment; Deborah was extraordinarily accommodating in helping me get it back. Recommended!"
36885,725827,2011-11-17,1107871,Ruth,"I arrived tired and full of cold but Deborah did her utmost to give me a warm welcome. She took time to ensure I had my bearings, had the necessary information for the apartment and make me feel at home. The apartment is very well situated for a quick walk to almost all the main sights in Boston. Everything was in good working order and well-maintained. I would definitely stay here again and thank Deborah for being such a good host."

36885,815817,2011-12-30,1523483,Matthew,"My first Airbnb experience - couldn't have been better - Deborah is the ideal host, clearly communicative, and the apt. is perfectly named - a super-comfortable queen-size bed, thoroughly outfitted kitchen (and the fridge even stocked with basics), and a really perfect location - at the north end of the Fens (the MFA was a five-minute bike ride away) and the western edge of Back Bay. I had some concerns about parking but the lot next door was reasonable during the day ($18 for 24 hours) and overnight and into the morning, I was able to park on the street right next to the building. I've been to Boston dozens of times over the years and stayed in many places, including really nice hotels, but next time I'm there for an overnight this'll be my first choice - I hope it won't be booked already!"
36885,824903,2012-01-02,452334,Lorne,We really enjoyed our stay at Deborah's place. It is a peaceful place in spite of being in the swirl of urban life. Deborah was a warm but discreet hostess and our stay went off without a hitch. The bed is very comfortable. The neighbourhood was perfect for our visit to Boston on First Night 2012. We would not hesitate to return to this place on our next visit.
36885,867662,2012-01-17,1467105,Pablo,"Deborah was a terrific host. She was very kind and helped us with everything we needed. The apartment is amazing, extraordinarily well located and very comfortable. If I ever go back to Boston, I will definitely try to stay here."
36885,873912,2012-01-20,12592,Emily,"Great spot! Felt right at home right away. Deborah has done a great job making this little apt have everything you need without feeling cluttered, a classic pied-à-terre! We had no trouble getting in touch, and checking in was a breeze. Bed was very comfortable. Would definitely like to return! Great area, very close to the T, Newbury St, and walking distance to a Whole Foods! Enjoy!"
36885,932786,2012-02-20,1601196,Samantha,"Our stay at Deborah's Cozy Corner was our first airbnb experience, and it will not be our last. She is a lovely person, a thoughtful host, and a good communicator. The neighborhood is musician- and student-oriented but not rowdy, with great restaurants close by. An easy walk to the T, shopping, and the MFA. The space is small, but so intelligently arranged that it feels efficient and cozy (that word again!), and not at all cramped. Her eye for decorating is eclectic, and the space has tons of personality. Deborah thought of everything: The kitchen is well equipped, and she generously left coffee, tea, spices, coffee filters, sweeteners . . . Likewise, the living room bureau held tissues, earplugs (the street outside can be a little noisy, but not terribly), and a sewing kit. There were also maps, tourist pamphlets, restaurant menus, an extra laptop and printer, and her own little guide to the apartment. The bathroom was clean, with excellent water pressure, and the bed was comfy. Only negatives I can think of: The TV setup is complicated, and we should have paid better attention when she explained it. It can get warm in the winter, and cracking the windows is the only way to control the temperature. The lighting in the bathroom is a bit dim. (During the day, the apartment gets great light, and in the evening, the many lamps allow you to customize the brightness.) All in all, a great place to stay, and a generous host. We hope to return!"
36885,951851,2012-02-27,1559740,Kitty,"A weekend spent in Deborah's apartment was wonderful - great location and quiet, despite being in the downtown area. We walked everywhere: to the MFA, Newbury Street, Whole Foods... and left our car parked in the parking lot right next door. The apartment was very comfortable, attractively decorated, and provided us with everything we needed. Perfect for two people. The queen bed was very comfortable. We would highly recommend Deborah's Cozy Corner."

We chose the Cozy Corner as an alternative to a hotel room and found it thoroughly relaxing after a day of meetings and conference presentations. The apartment is a few blocks from conference venues – only a quick walk away but far enough to get away from it all after a long day. The desk/work area with Internet access was extremely useful, the kitchen has everything you need (the dishwasher is a bonus), and the freshly ground coffee in the morning was a real treat. There are lots of little restaurants just across the street and a supermarket around the corner. We found a running path along the water only a short distance away and shopping is also just a few blocks down the street. The apartment definitely lives up to its name with a cozy, well-cared for, and lived-in atmosphere. And Deborah is a great host! Thanks so much."

So much charm, and Deborah took care of so many little details, such as snacks in the kitchen, city guides on the desk, a fully-stocked bathroom, and extra umbrellas. She is very friendly and did a great job of checking me, with gracious flexibility after my flight got delayed. The bed is incredibly comfortable, and the apartment is beautifully designed, with lots of light from the huge bay windows.

Even though she was out of town, she made getting the keys and getting situated into the unit extremely easy.  The unit looks exactly as pictured and has everything you need for a comfortable visit to Boston.  If you've never been to the city, this unit is situated in a great central location - everything you could possibly want is within walking distance, including access to public transportation.  I would definitely (and already have!) recommend this place to anyone looking for the perfect place to stay to get the full Boston city experience!"
36885,1751850,2012-07-20,1035115,Silvan,"As Deborah describes her apartment: It might be not so big, but it is definitely a cosy corner - just perfect as a starting point to discover wonderful Boston. The location is ideal to walk or take the public transport system to see all the great things in the city. It is worth not coming by car to Boston as the parking rates are expensive - unless you get a free parking slot next to the apartment. If you can't avoid the car, we would recommend the Symphony Parking close to the cosy corner at Westland Avenue. As a valet parking, it is much cheaper than others."
"I had the chance to talk to Deborah several times by phone as we couldn't meet each other personally. She was always very kind and helpful. She really takes care of her guest: a perfect host!  \"",,,,,
36885,1786755,2012-07-24,2083783,David,We very much enjoyed our stay at Cozy Corner of Boston. The location was ideal for us as we attended 3 Red Sox games and did the standard tourist things around town. Perfect location for walking or using the T. Would recommend this as a great place to stay.
36885,1825989,2012-07-29,1937727,Alana,"We had an amazing (EMAIL HIDDEN)munication was great, the apt was beautiful and it was ideally located  for sightseeing around Boston. Perfect!"
36885,1859856,2012-08-01,2596580,Jenna,"The Cozy Corner was the perfect spot for my husband and me to spend a few days. We couldn't have asked for a better location--easy walk to a T station, Fenway Park, and tons of yummy restaurants. We loved being able to stay in the unique apartment over the standard hotel, and we would definitely stay here again if/when we make another trip to Boston. Deborah was helpful and kind in setting up our stay there and in answering our questions about the city."
36885,1877870,2012-08-03,2320645,Melanie,"Deborah's place was great.  It looks exactly like the pictures, so no surprises.  It is located very close to public transportation.  And Newbury Street and Prudential are within walking distance for great shopping and restaurants.  Deborah was a very gracious host, and even had flowers for us upon our arrival."
36885,1921911,2012-08-08,2042877,Olga,"Our stay at Cozy Corner of Boston exceeded all of our expectations. We are so thankful for Deborah's hospitality. She greeted us, explained everything we needed to know, and she also had fresh flowers when we arrived. We were there for the conference and the location is fantastic, simply perfect. The place is only 1 block away from the Hynes Convention Center but you do avoid all the conference crowds, since the main hotels are on the other side. You are few walking minutes away from the Charles River Walk, parks, and within few walking minutes to all the restaurants and shops, museums, etc. The Cozy Corner makes you feel like you are at home. Deborah's tasteful decorations made it very cozy. The photos you see are showing exactly the place as it is, and it is so much more cozy than you would expect. The kitchen has everything you need, and more. The little office area is perfect if you need to work a bit and she also has a printer and an extra laptop. As soon as you walk on the Boylston Street, you are in the middle of everything. If we decide to come to Boston again, we will definitely stay at the Cozy Corner. I am now reluctant to book a hotel room when I travel, after I stayed at an airbnb place such as Cozy Corner."
36885,1939040,2012-08-10,666234,Natalie,"Really cute, clean flat although a bit on the cramped side with all the furniture. Nonetheless, we really enjoyed our stay in the heart of Boston and Deborah was a great host."
Also,if you're a light sleeper,"this might not be the flat for you as it's on a main road and gets lots of foot traffic from Red Sox games. \"",,,
36885,1967144,2012-08-13,2546331,Alex,"A cozy, incredibly convenient place. Deborah was incredibly nice and accomodating. Figuring out how to get the AC to stay on was the only issue as it was a hot weekend. But would recommend to anyone."
36885,2009056,2012-08-17,2325417,Becky,"\"The name says it all. It was a cozy little apartment with lots of natural light. There are plenty of restaurants, pubs, shopping, and even a Whole Foods market all within walking distance. I would recommend avoiding the convenience store across the street for real groceries, because the prices are very high. It can be loud in the area because it is a young vibe close to Berkley Music college, but the ear plugs provided made that a non issue. The bed was comfortable and the whole experience was really great. It is a trek to the \"\"touristy\"\" spots"
36885,2087626,2012-08-25,97792,Robin,"We were delighted with our stay at the Cozy Corner. The apartment seems far more spacious than it's small footprint would suggest. The design and layout are beautiful and very functional. We appreciated the large desk and good lighting. Probably the best thing about it was the location. It is close to excellent restaurants and public transportation, as well as to Fenway Park. Deborah was a pleasure to work with. Although we did not meet her, she went to extra effort to get the keys to us when our plans unexpectedly changed. We would recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a comfortable, convenient and attractive place to stay."
36885,2168144,2012-09-02,2016493,Yvonne,The apartment was exactly as described and suited our needs perfectly.  Deborah was the ideal host.
36885,2194861,2012-09-04,2283748,Dylan,"We loved staying at A Cozy Corner of Boston! The location was awesome, so close to wonderful neighborhoods. We could hear music students doing wonderful things all around the block. The apartment was lovely and fully equipped with kitchen needs. Deborah's interior design skills are a joy to experience. All around, a great experience."
36885,2228324,2012-09-08,2650146,Michael,Great place to stay in Boston. 5 minutes walk to the closest T Station makes it easy to get around. A Trader Joe's and Wholefoods Market within walking distance.
Some decent restaurants/takeaway just over the road as well.,,,,,
If you are arriving by train to the Back Bay Station the walk is do-able with backpacks,"it took us about 25 minutes.\"",,,,

Great location and a very lovely apartment that has everything you need for a week stay. So much better than staying at a hotel.,,,,,
"Deborah was very informative and quick to respond to our questions and concern so if we come again to Boston we will contact her again for sure. \"",,,,,
36885,2527086,2012-10-07,1264949,Ariane,"I enjoyed my stay at this very convenient little studio apartment. Deborah was great to deal with, and very helpful and responsive to any questions or issues. The apartment is not 5 star, but has everything you need and more. It has plenty of character - think Bohemian with lots of lamps and satin cushions. The free Internet access is great and the location is unbeatable. But do be warned, the street noise is LOUD!  If you are a light sleeper and need a quiet place to sleep, this apartment may not be the place for you."
36885,2668566,2012-10-21,1507181,Monique,"Appartement très comfortable dans un quartier jeune, animé (Berklee College of music). Excellente accessibilité (pédestre, métro, train,bateau) à tous les sites pittoresques de la ville et dans les environs (Salem, Cape Cod..)."
L'abondance des magasin à proximité de l'immeuble facilite les approvisionnements en tous genres.,,,,,
Eloignée de Boston (cause majeure),Deborah a pris tous les moyens de garder le contact pour répondre à nos questions et besoins.,,,,
La visite d'un ami très sympathique et chaleureux,parlant très bien le français a été un plus.,,,,
Notre séjour a été pleinement réussi grâce à un faisceau de conditions ultra satisfaisante. A Cosy corner,"un \"\"bon et joli petit coin\"\" pour rester à Boston.\"",,,,
36885,2783616,2012-11-02,1473401,WeeYao,"The apartment was as described, very cosy and lived in. It suited our requirements very well and was close to food (5 restaurants opp), groceries (whole foods and trader joe's) and to Prudential center. The apt was very functional well maintained."
Deborah's communications were excellent and was very thoughtful in lining things up so that we were not inconvenienced. We also appreciated her giving us early warnings about Hurricane Sandy when we arrived.,,,,,
Overall,"a very good experience. \"",,,,
36885,2817517,2012-11-05,3985363,Rebecca,The apartment was great! Perfect location! Very comfortable stay. Deborah was very helpful with finding parking and getting the keys to us with very short notice.
36885,2862985,2012-11-12,3683971,Sandy,Deborah's place is simply amazing!
It's steps away from a subway station,and Boston has a good public transportation system that you can go any attractions on the subway.,,,,
The location was also perfect and we felt safe walking during nights.,,,,,
The place is well kept and looks really cozy.,,,,,
If I'm visting Boston again this is the place I will be.,,,,,
"It was simply perfect :)\"",,,,,
36885,2904968,2012-11-18,2574970,Abbie,Deborah's Cozy Corner in Boston is exactly as described. Her apt is tastefully furnished with all the amenities and comforts of home a visitor would want. Very central and convenient location in back bay. The street noise is a bit loud but actually doesn't bother me since its cooler weather and I don't need to open windows. Deborah is very accessible and accomodating. It was very helpful having the keys in advance so I could arrange for my own arrival time. I appreciate her flexibility with changes I had to make in my reservation. I look forward to returning for future visits. Far more cozier than a hotel.
36885,3551102,2013-02-16,2574970,Abbie,"Another great stay in lovely Back Bay. Deborah's place is cozy, well decorated, and lacks for nothing. She's attentive and concerned for my comfort, and leaves fresh flowers, every time."
36885,3734827,2013-03-10,4139659,Maud,"Deborah's apartment was ideal for my needs: comfortable, private, and located near restaurants, grocery shops, and the Hynes Convention Center, where the event I attended was held. She showed me everything I might need when I arrived and explained how to lock up at my departure. I would, without hesitation, stay at her Cozy Corner again."
36885,4373704,2013-05-01,2574970,Abbie,"Deborah's place has so much charm and comfort that I intend to come back and stay again and again, and again! She's a considerate, generous host and I've been pleased to find fresh flowers in a vase every time I visit. Great location and lots of sunlight. One should note, however, that there is often the sound of ambulance sirens as they drive thru the neighborhood, though it hasn't bothered me."
36885,4501210,2013-05-09,1030766,Brian,"Wonderful location. A block from the T, two blocks from the convention center, a short walk to Fenway, safe and secure. There is a Trader Joe's about three blocks away, and liquor store two blocks away. If you like to run, it's a short jog to the Fens where you can run pretty much traffic free."
The apartment itself is a small studio with separate kitchen and bath/shower. The bed is nice,and the couch served as a comfortable place for naps. Cable is basic,"and there is wifi. There is a dishwasher. It can be a bit noisy after Sox games but that is over with before terribly late. Our white noise generator took care of that nicely.\"",,,
36885,4698539,2013-05-21,4266087,Sandra,"When I think of our stay in Boston, these words come to mind: comfortable, oasis, special touches, thoughtful and location, location, location!"
36885,68142743,2016-04-02,21612641,Lisa,"All I can say is WOW! Although the apartment is small, it is decorated so well that it does seem like a little Cozy Corner of Boston. You feel at home the second you walk in. Deborah has done a great job in making sure you know where everything is...between the book describing everything from how to get around to how to find the dumpsters and the little notes she leaves around the apartment, there is no questions unanswered. The apartment is also convenient to the grocery stores and multiple restaurants right across the street and only blocks from the closes T stop at Haynes Convention Center. Although I didnt get to meet Deborah in person, she stayed in contact with me before and during my trip so I knew where to go and how to contact her if I needed anything. I will definitely look to stay here again on future trips to Boston as I absolutely loved it!"

The location was great, walking distance to so many great landmarks (the Boston Public Library was one of my favourite), great food, and very close to the transit system."
Deborah was also an excellent host. I fell in love with the character of her place,and felt instantly at home there. She was quick to answer any questions I had,"and made sure the apartment was stocked with everything you could think of (down to earplugs by the nightstand!) Would definitely stay here again. Thanks again Deborah!\"",,,

My husband and I spent 5 nights in Deborah's home in April,2016.  The 2nd floor apartment is accessible by stairs or elevator. The small kitchen has everything you need to make a gourmet meal.  The bed was firm and comfortable. There are many thoughtful details provided.  We have stayed in countless vacation rentals over the years and this is certainly one of the best.  The stand-out for me was the ease of communication with Deborah and her sincere concern in making sure we had a pleasant stay.  She gave me great tips on transportation from Logan Airport and which subway lines to take to specific locations.  Her rental is an easy,"safe walking distance from  major subway stations.  Thank you Deborah for sharing your home with us.  We would love to stay here again.\"",,,

our stay in your cosy corner was just a delight. i was very buzy working at the hynes convention center nearby,and this was the place to be. So well decorated and many little attentions,food,pens,clean place and everything to feel at home or ever better.

36885,81075863,2016-06-20,63712259,Katie,A Cozy Corner is just perfect for anyone looking to visit Boston and comes highly recommended. Deborah made us feel incredibly welcome with her personal touches and excellent recommendations for things to do and places to see. We thoroughly enjoyed our time in Boston and stay at a Cozy Corner.
36885,82824524,2016-06-29,2971929,Bonnie,Wonderful little studio in an excellent location that is close to the T and the convention center. Deborah is a great host who is very accommodating and very graciously mailed me some items that I had forgotten in the bathroom. Can't have asked for a better time in Boston.
"Would highly recommend!\"",,,,,
36885,87207726,2016-07-19,62186770,Heather,"We had a really wonderful experience at Deborah's place. Her apartment was beautiful, very conveniently located, and as far as hosts go, I can't imagine anyone being more thoughtful and considerate. Regardless of what a guest might need, she either has it or has a recommendation where to get it. She was helpful at every turn. Visiting colleges can  mean making difficult life-changing decisions. Her graciousness only added to my son's desire to attend college in Boston. As she describes it, her place is cozy, but feels spacious. I slept far better there than I would've in a hotel, and appreciated having the comforts of home so much."
36885,88519884,2016-07-24,78192342,Kari,"This was the perfect, cozy spot for our first trip to Boston.  So close to so many things--Fenway being one of them.  When we stayed, the Red Sox were in town all week so being in the midst of that was great.  Took us five minutes to walk to a game!  Felt like we lived there!  Everything is so well laid out as well.  One can tell Deborah has been doing this for awhile.  Great explanations about check-in/check-out process, great tips for places to check out and a great, homey environment.  It was so nice to walk into the apartment at the end of the long day and truly feel at home.  We loved Boston and will be back--hopefully we'll have the chance to share Deborah's space again!"

1944976,32531657,2015-05-19,30939199,William,"Diana was a model host: very organized, punctilious, friendly, thoughtful, and welcoming. We shared pots of tea and large gobs of conversation at breakfast and other times of the day."
1944976,33310205,2015-05-26,12508192,Melanie,Diana's was the perfect place for our anniversary get-away weekend to Boston.  The room and location were exactly as described.  We were within 5-minutes walking to the T and numerous restaurants.  It was a very cute neighborhood and Diana's house was perfect.  The room was very spacious and the bed was very comfortable.  Diana was very sweet and made us feel right at home as soon as we walked through the door.  We will certainly be coming back in the future if our travels take us back to Boston!
1944976,34460606,2015-06-08,3031239,Niels,"The house of Diana is nice. Staying here gives you truly an American airbnb feeling: the house is in a neighborhood with wooden houses with American flags, and also Diana's house is one typically from the moves. The metro is 10 minutes walk and then it's an other 10 minutes to downtown Boston."
Diana has a lot of house rules,notice that. It's a perfect house to sleep and cook,but if you are planning to make long hours in the house itself,"then take a look if you are able to commit to all the rules.  \"",,

Would definitely stay here again."
11710680,81630674,2016-06-24,3377126,Josefine,"Lisa's apartment was a perfect choice for us - two couples on a round trip looking for a place to stay in Boston for two nights. The apartment is spacious - especially the kitchen and living room - and is very stylish decorated (Lisa has great taste). The best part about the place is the sunny terrace which we used a lot and the perfect location in the middle of South End. We could walk to a lot of great bars and restaurants. Only minor downside was that the extra bedroom is really small and got really hot. Since the room doesn't have AC, we had to leave the door open during the night. No big issue."
4699828,30376692,2015-04-21,22738822,Brian,"We found Martin and Barbara's home to be nicer than advertised. Martin met us and showed us around and we happened to meet the housekeeper at that time. They were very responsive to all inquiries before our visit. We didn't need to contact them during our stay, but I am confident we could reach them easily. You are truly a guest in their home and they are incredibly hospitable! Martin left us with very gracious welcome gifts on the dining room table and left some small stockpiles of candies for the kids. The place was very clean and tastefully decorated. The kitchen has everything you need and more. You could crawl to the commuter rail station. The T lines to Boston are a short drive away. Dedham has lots of retail to offer and Jamaica Plain has plenty of restaurants to choose from. I do not hesitate to recommend."
For those with kids,there is a neat little playground at a school about 100 feet away. Note there are lots of breakables around so it may not be suitable for younger toddlers without doing some pre-emptive rearranging upon arrival.,,,,

4699828,32234418,2015-05-16,7751965,Brian,"Barbara and Martin have a lovely house that I recommend to anyone looking at staying in Hyde Park. It was nicely decorated, well furnished, with a well-equipped kitchen, very comfortable beds, excellent laundry facilities, and were very generous with provided extras. It felt luxurious. The property is described as an apartment, but we seldom heard the upstairs neighbour, and nothing from the downstairs bedsit."
We were met by their agent and felt very welcome. We didn't need to contact them during our stay,but felt confident that we could have done so readily.,,,,
We used public transport during our week-long stay,and had to use a bus to connect to the Orange line. The 39 bus was often crowded,despite its frequency. The 50 bus was more pleasant,stopped closer,but took longer. MBTA's T-Pass permitted us unlimited travel on the subway and local bus,so we did not use the commuter rail.
We found a good selection of eating out places in nearby Jamaica Plain,"which was $11-$12 away via Uber.\"",,,,
4699828,32955734,2015-05-24,11798359,Ruth,"Bit late getting this review in but have been on the road. We stayed at the home of Barbara and Martin for 5 nights and it was just great! Starting with communication months ago to make the booking to our departure , everything went smoothly. They were not there to meet us but sent their friend to meet us on arrival and explain all about our stay. Barbara and Martin have a beautiful home and we felt quite at home. They gave us the run of the house and said we could use anything we wish. On arrival there was a lovely bottle of red, white and champagne to welcome us to the house. Also nibbles in the fridge, coffee (great coffee too) and enough items to get us going. As there was a BBQ on the veranda which we could also use, we enjoyed our first night in Boston with a great steak and a few wines!"
The house was presented very well,with all the amenities you could possibly require. Bedrooms were nice and comfortable and having two bathrooms was great for two couples! Everything was nice and clean.,,,,
Even though we had a car,we used the public transport once or twice and that was convenient to the house. They left all kinds of brochures to help us plan our stay in Boston which was very helpful.,,,,
"All in all a great stay and would recommend it to anyone who wants to really enjoy Boston as a local.\"",,,,,
4699828,33584666,2015-05-30,1925468,Shaela,"The house was nice and spacious and fully-equipped with everything we needed for the kitchen, including food they had left for  us, coffees, teas, spices, even wine and beer which was very kind for them to leave for us. There was plenty of bedding, towels, toiletries, hair dryers, iron, washing machine, dryer, etc. We didn't lack anything during our stay. Spacious parking area and nice back porch to sit on. The area is good, we drove to Forest Hills T-station (parking is $6-$8/day) and bought a week-long pass for unltd. travel for $16 each (it was inexpensive for 5 of us to do that). I didn't explore the area much as we had gone for my cousin's graduation from Harvard and had activities there all day for 4 days. However, it looked really nice when we drove past, there were some nice shops and restaurants within walking distance. There is also an overground train station that is walking distance from the house, however you have to pay for that outside of the T pass."
4699828,34541068,2015-06-09,31873426,Mindy,The home was wonderful and equipped with everything we could possibly imagine. The neighborhood was quiet and we enjoyed a number of walks to see the architecture of the different houses. We rented a car for our short visit and Hyde Park was a very convenient home base for us to explore Boston and the towns nearby. Absolutely can't say anything negative about our stay. Would definitely recommend this place!

4699828,43376391,2015-08-19,36582259,Brian,"They weren't there personally, but they had a greeter that lived down the street. She took us around the house and told us all we needed to know. The house was enormous! Everything was in tip-top shape save for an unwashed wok on top of the fridge. They also left us a bottle of wine, and an ukulele with a 'teach yourself to play the ukulele' book. Loads of books, games and fun stuff around the house. Kitchen was also stuffed with all the condiments a chef could want."
Neighborhood seemed fine. Its close to a commuter rail station but we ended up not using it because our CharlieCard weekly passes only cover commuter rails within zone 1A. Otherwise,"its $5.75 per person per trip. The weekly passes ($19) did cover all subways and local buses so we were able to take the 32 Bus to Forrest Hills and take subways from there.\"",,,,

"Incredibile apartment\"",,,,,
4699828,46936098,2015-09-14,10859363,Iris,"The house of Barbara and Martin was very cute and spacious. With two bedrooms, two bathrooms and one air mattress, enough to have 5 of us staying comfortably. Located just minutes away from two train stations, can follow the daily train schedule to go to downtown Boston. Friendly reminder: if you have an issue of connecting to the Wifi, just restart your device or the wifi router in the living room."
4699828,47420684,2015-09-18,19277163,Matthew J,"Lovely home that my wife, daughter and I enjoyed immensely.  Friendly greeter, smooth transaction, no complaints. Great location quiet neighborhood extremely close to rail and bus lines, easy access to downtown Boston. Would certainly do it again and I highly recommend!"
4699828,48059355,2015-09-23,28617045,Bernard,"Nous avons été ravis de séjourner dans votre charmante maison idéalement située et qui nous a permis de visiter Boston , Cape Cod , Newport et Harvard"
Nous nous sommes senti comme chez nous au sein de la vie Américaine,,,,,
"Cordialement \"",,,,,
4699828,49318736,2015-10-03,19459411,Sheila,"Thanks for letting us stay in your house. We really enjoyed our time in Boston. The house itself is a wonderful, eclectic mix of furnishings and was so very comfortable. Quiet street, very close to train and bus and with the weekly pass we travelled all over at a fraction of a cost. Great to have all the food extras and the bottle of wine (thank you), they got us off to a great start to a fantastic week. Would definitely stay again if we come back to Boston."
4699828,55096636,2015-11-28,6751391,Jacob,"If the taste might seem peculiar to some in its un-orthodox mix of nineteenth-century and Chinese-inspired decor, the feeling of an aesthetic intention creates an undeniably cosy atmosphere. I thus felt very much at home in my Hyde Park base and hugely enjoyed staying there for the two months I visited MIT. The apartment is spatious and lush and equipped with everything you could dream of, from advanced television gear to washing machine and dryer, to dish washer, coffee machine and all kinds of kitchen equipment (the missing garlic squeezer was the infinitesimal blemish that only heightened the rest, and Barbara even offered to pay for a new acquisition). There are even a few well-used gym machines in the basement."
I was  generously received with a bottle of white wine and amazing supplies of coffee,and Barbara and Martin reacted to all inquiries within minutes and would immediately fix any problem (the few I had were minor and mostly about technical instructions). Barbara can have a brash tongue and be a bit zealous,but that only keeps you awake. And suddenly she'll give you a bottle of red wine,so you won't be bored at Thanksgiving.,,
Linwood Street is placed in a nice and quiet neighborhood,with a big supermarket 7 minutes away,a gorgeous icecream place around the corner,and,especially attractive,a wonderful wood for walking tours just 5 minutes to the North. It's a bit distant from downtown Boston
In sum,I can strongly recommend this place if you appreciate comfort and want value for your money. I myself started out in Cambridge near Harvard with a much smaller and duller apartment for the same price. If you care about living and not only central location,"this is truly a gem.\"",,,
4699828,63152892,2016-02-20,16248160,Marie,The host canceled this reservation 158 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4699828,66355623,2016-03-22,15059226,Busola,"Stayed here for 2 months from January - March 2016. This is a nice house in the heart of hyde park. It is close to the high street shops, restaurants and grocery stores. It is also close to transportation. We rented a car during our stay and the driveway was very convenient for our use. The two bedrooms are comfortable and the bathrooms are nice. The kitchen is very well equipped."
We encountered some issues with the house and the host. Barbara was not the greatest host and she was hot and cold depending on the day. She has a very brash tongue and is extremely rude. We gave barbara notice to check out of the house earlier than reserved. We followed airbnb policy online and gave sufficient notice,She refused to follow airbnb policies and issue us a refund. She ignored the request sent online and so Airbnb had to take care of that issue themselves.,,,,
We had issues with rodents in the flat. An exterminator was sent out twice to address the issue. Barbara claimed she has never had rodent issues even though we met a rat trap in the house upon arrival. The rodent issue persisted even after the exterminator came to check the house out.,,,,,
We also has issues with the temperature of the house. It was winter and the house was unbearably cold. Barbara has instructions to leave the heat at 68 degrees which is absolutely unbearable even with the space heaters that were provided. It was constantly freezing in the house and we had to wear sweaters and socks and multiple layers all the time. The heat does not work. Especially in the master bedroom bathroom. Absolutely freezing!,,,,,
THE NEIGHBORS.... extremely loud neighbors. We pretty much had a concert going on every friday and saturday. The neighbors would run through the house all day long. We tried speaking to them twice and they basically slammed their door on us and told us to speak to the landlord. Barbara tried to speak with them on multiple occasions with no luck. This was a huge stress on us as we had a newborn and we needed to take naps during the day while he slept. The noise also sometimes startled him.,,,,,
Barbara tried to rip us off. She insisted we check out at 11am when she had no intention of refunding us for unused nights even when we gave her notice as per airbnb regulations. I had to file a complaint to airbnb resolution center. She was a terrible host. She was upset we didn't use her cleaner even though we cleaned the apartment regularly and kept it clean. Also upset that I rearranged the house. Who leaves their stuff in every single cupboard in the house. I simple put all her things in one place in the bathroom. Where was I supposed to put my own things? Ridiculous. Worst airbnb experience ever.,,,,,

The house is very clean and well-decorated; the bed sheets, quilt, and towels were all washed when we arrived. We had all of the necessary equipment we needed - laundry machine, vacuum machine, mop, to keep the house clean for a month. The only thing that was missing was an iron, and when we contacted Barbara about it, she had Martin buy us a new one immediately the next day. We could contact Barbara and Martin whenever we needed help and they got back to us as soon as possible. The neighborhood is very quiet and peaceful, and transportation is easily accessible. There is a commuter rail right across the street that will take you straight to downtown Boston, which takes about 10-15 minutes. There is also the 50 and 32 bus that will take you to the Forest Hills Train Station. A supermarket, along with a few restaurants are within a 10 min walk from this house."
Our stay at Boston was wonderful and once again,"many thanks to Barbara and Martin for being such great hosts. \"",,,,

Excellent well equipped kitchen, two comfortable bedrooms, two stylish new looking bathrooms, off street parking near the kitchen door.  Short walk to T station,  a nice park in walking distance.  Barbara replied quickly and helpfully when we had a question."

Jumbe was very accommodating and always willing to answer any questions/give suggestions. (One small downside: The water pressure in the shower isn't great.) Closest subway stop is a brief 15 minute walk away, and everything in the city is accessible from there. Overall an awesome place!"
11300899,88534412,2016-07-24,30318267,Jaclynn,Jumbe was an excellent host. His place had everything you could need for your stay in Boston. Would recommend to anyone.

The place was clean, and Jeff had stocked it with some travel-size toiletries. The only thing that gave me trouble was the front gate to the apartment, but I called Jeff, and he let me know that if you put some force into it, it'll open - and it did!"
13709092,97790445,2016-08-28,67078430,Jordyn,Great location in the center of everything and walking distance to most places. Mikes Pastry is right there so be aware of long lines right outside but also try Mikes because the gelato was amazing. Not a lot of natural light in the apartment but you won't be there much so it doesn't matter. Jeff had the essentials ready and was very accommodating for check in and out. Great location for a great price. Would definitely stay again.

The contact was very good with Tarek. We never met him,but he was very flexible and made sure that our arrival was easy,so it was not a problem. Moreover,he really made us feel at home.,,
The apartment is well located,in a safe neighborhood,very close to a subway station (2min) and relatively close to Quincy Market (20min) by walk.,,,
A little drawback : one of the two air beds had a leak,but Tarek told us about this detail before our arrival.,,,,

8696200,56336531,2015-12-12,27601134,Dongwoo,"Stayed one night during my quick visit to Boston. Trk was an awesome host, and even through his busy schedule at the hospital, he managed to communicate effectively and answer all questions in a short amount of time. The living room was spacious, and pretty clean from what I can say. It is an airbed, so don't expect a hotel experience (heavenly bed). Location of this apt can't be beat. Seriously! Most of my plans were at the financial district/quincy market/north end and they were walking distance from this apt (maybe 30min max and the neighborhood is safe enough to be walking late at night). Honestly, I'd say for the price I paid and for the location(compared to booking a hotel in downtown Boston), this was a bargain(maybe a steal). If youre looking for a place near downtown Boston for a day or so, I'd definitely recommend it."
8696200,57396815,2015-12-25,42994468,Maosen,"Tarek is a great host, friendly and easy to communicate. The apartment is spacious with perfect location, walking distance to city center, steps away from north station. Overall it was a great experience."

8696200,61138127,2016-01-31,56206872,Meagan,Tarek is an amazing host!! Such a nice friendly guy and super flexible. He helped me out through some weird cancellations and rebookings. And he was flexible on my checking out which really helped me out. Probably one of the best hosts I've ever had. Great with communication and will keep you updated on stuff. Would stay here again if I was ever in Boston!
8696200,77811872,2016-06-03,73479644,Adam,"Tarek was cool! My friend and I slept very well on air mattresses in the living room. Privacy was provided by a wall partition which was plenty as we were not spending much time in the space, except to sleep. There was a window near to help regulate temperature and the bathroom was appropriate and available. Had alot of fun watching game 1 of the NBA finals! He seems like a very hard working person. 5 stars!"

Great location! Five minute walk to a T station and apartment has everything you'd need. Close to parking in the Clarendon garage.,,,,,
Greta left us some water and pellegrino,which was a lovely touch. She had great communication and was accommodating to our late arrival. Highly recommend for a great apartment in the South End.

We arrived at the place in the morning, around 11 and left at 3 p.m. The studio is very nicely laid out, and the kitchen was separated from the bed and living area. There's also a small patio outside with table and chairs. Location wise, there's Back Bay T station, bus, commuter rail, all within 6-7 minute walk. Convenience stores, supermarket, pharmacy, it's as good as it gets. This place will definitely be my go to airbnb in Boston."

As for the space,it was lovely - exactly what we needed.  The location was stunning (with a great spot,Delux nearby serving a great frilled cheese),not to mention the proximity to a T-stop was soooo easy.,,
Greta's space was also wonderfully set up - the bed comfortable and with the option to,as we did,host a few guests for work in the fold-out sofa - it was perfect.,,,
Next time I'm in Boston,"I'll be reaching back out for this spot.  \"",,,,
9611852,73528899,2016-05-08,16468575,Jean,Greta's studio was perfect for a romantic getaway to Boston! The studio was clean and comfortable and had everything you need but the best part was the location. Just around the block were some great restaurants and bars (the Beehive for brunch was our favorite!) and we were also a short walk away from the Boston Common and Chinatown. This is the first AirBnb we have had in Boston where we didn't need to take an Uber the entire time!
9611852,73827370,2016-05-10,17176475,Jennifer,"Greta's studio is a treasure. I surprised my daughter with a girl's weekend for her 16th birthday and it was exactly what I was hoping for.  It's a fantastic location - maybe a five minute walk from both the Back Bay T Station and the 100 Clarendon Street Garage - but kind of quiet and residential.   It's just like the photos- plenty of light, comfortable bed, cute decor and very clean."
As a host,Greta was great - just the right amount of communication and very quick to respond to any questions.   We would definitely stay here again.,,,,
Also,Flour bakery & cafe is about a SIX minute walk from the studio and their raspberry seltzers (egg sandwiches,sticky buns,french toast,etc... :) )are perfection.,
At Greta's recommendation we parked at 100 Clarendon because I didn't want to wrestle luggage on the T.   Helpful hint: I used SpotHero and paid separately for the first day and then the next two days and somehow saved thirty dollars?  Well worth it.  It was super easy to drive right to the studio gate and pickup our luggage and shopping haul when we were leaving.,,,,,

9611852,74422899,2016-05-15,32597547,Simon,"Wonderful place, very quiet and really nice with the little patio! The location is a real advantage too. Greta has been very communicative with me, everything was planned for the arrival. She is an excellent host. I will come back without hesitation!"
9611852,76445192,2016-05-27,66110869,Rafael,"Our experience with Greta's lovely studio was smooth! As we arrived, she was even there to help us with a little confusion we did. She did also left a bottle of water and a pack of cookies, which was very nice of her!"
The studio itself is cozy,with everything we used worked as expected: bed,air-conditioning,bath/shower,fridge,the coffee maker and toaster
Moreover,the neighborhood is calm and quiet; the studio is located next to the Back Bay T station (a couple of blocks away from),which made our visit even better!,,,
"Highly reccommended for a Boston trip!\"",,,,,
9611852,77220659,2016-05-30,22065613,Clayton,"Greta's studio was wonderful! It was the perfect size for 2 people (it actually is bigger than it looks in the pictures, in my opinion). Greta made check-in and check-out super easy and was willing to accommodate our schedules perfectly.  Location here was wonderful and walkable to almost everything we wanted to do in Boston.  The outdoor patio was perhaps my favorite though, a perfect spot for morning coffee/breakfast or an evening nightcap."
9611852,77803219,2016-06-03,30238981,Todd,"Nice space in an established Boston neighborhood. Location was an enjoyable 10-15 walk to city center.  Also, good eats close by.  The only negative part was noise outside and you can hear footsteps above the space."
9611852,79300802,2016-06-12,21771951,Gracie,Greta's Boston apartment is perfect! It was clean and comfortable and the location is ideal for exploring the city. Greta was helpful and communicative throughout our stay. I would definitely stay there again next time I'm in Boston!

Globally,it is a place where you feel well.,,,,
The neighborhood is quiet and pleasant.,,,,,
I have not met Greta personally,but she was always very reactive by email. She was extremely helpful when I had a problem. She was a wonderful host.,,,,
"I warmly recommend the place! \"",,,,,
9611852,81757852,2016-06-24,17329581,Karen,"This studio really is perfect! It is very close to the T as well as walking distance to so many great places. It's quite spacious for a studio and very comfortable. The private patio is an extra bonus. So much nicer than being cooped up in a hotel room! I did not have the opportunity to meet Greta in person, and even so she was a very gracious host. Communication was very easy and she designated a spot to leave the keys for me and then checked in to make sure I made myself at home. Staying at Greta's with my dogs made this work trip feel like a mini vacation!"
9611852,82848154,2016-06-29,3459194,Quinn,"We had a wonderful stay at Greta's studio apartment in the South End. Greta was incredibly accommodating with our arrival and departure times and highly responsive with communication. I was attending a conference at the Hynes Convention Center, which was a lovely 20 minute walk. My husband came along and had a very comfortable place from which to explore Boston. We found the area very walkable and close to many nice cafes and restaurants and an easy walk to the downtown attractions. The studio is very spacious for two people and had everything we needed."
9611852,84344487,2016-07-06,60065489,Jackie,"We absolutely loved staying in Greta's adorable studo which was conveniently located right by a subway station and several restaurants and bars. Greta welcomed us with water, cookies and wine and communicated with us throughout the time prior to our arrival. This was our first experience with Airbnb and we couldn't have asked for a better experience! Thank you, Greta!"
9611852,85174261,2016-07-10,55115449,Madeleine,Greta made us feel very welcome. We were pleased to find multiple different kinds of coffee and coffee machines and a chilled bottle of wine! The neighborhood was wonderful and within walking distance of so many great places.
9611852,86321151,2016-07-16,62944871,Phyllis,"Greta's studio is in a great location. An easy walk from the Amtrak/T station, restaurants and sites. It's also walking distance to catch the Back Bay Logan Express. It's roomy and very clean. The A/C works great! Greta had wine and cookies on the counter for us. There's a regular coffee maker and a Nespresso, an iron and ironing board, hair dryer, TV and WiFi.  This is my first experience with AirBnB so I erred in communicating with Greta. I was replying to messages that were pushed through as text messages to my phone. Greta didn't receive them. Tip - communicate through AirBnB's site/app."

13547301,88512370,2016-07-24,76435391,Calie,"This is a great apartment. Georgia was so nice, and it fit our needs perfectly!"
13547301,89036092,2016-07-26,30456244,Attilio,"Georgia e sua sorella Galini sono davvero le ospiti che mi auguro sempre di incontrare. Al nostro arrivo, Galini ci ha accolto in casa dedicandoci una parte della sua domenica sera per parlarci di Boston, della casa e del quartiere con grande gentilezza e calore che abbiamo molto apprezzato e che non abbiamo più ritrovato in questa misura nel resto del viaggio. Altrettanto ha fatto Georgia il giorno successivo, in maniera estremamente piacevole e mai invadente, facendoci sentire molto a nostro agio grazie al suo spessore personale e alla sua ospitalità tipicamente ellenica. La casa è molto accogliente, pulita e funzionale, con facilità di parcheggio per noi che viaggiavamo in auto. E' un edificio costruito nel primo novecento che racconta anche un po' di storia della città e dell'evoluzione del quartiere. Forse bagni e cucina meriterebbero qualche aggiornamento, ma quello che c'è è assolutamente accettabile e funzionale e parla della storia della casa e di chi l'ha abitata. Nei pressi della casa ci sono negozi a sufficienza per la spesa e per tutto quanto serve al soggiorno. Inoltre a cinque minuti a piedi si trova il bellissimo Arboreto dell'Università di Boston, perfetto per ispiranti corse o passeggiate mattutine. Nel complesso è stata un'esperienza breve ma molto gratificante che ci ha fatto vivere una bella esperienza di luoghi e di incontri."
13547301,90183672,2016-07-31,78014422,Lauri,"Georgia was very accommodating, very nice and easy to work with. She even met us at the apartment upon a very late-night arrival. She provided us with lots of information & was easy to talk to. She was quick to respond to questions both before booking and after booking. She even had a few food items in the fridge waiting for us when we arrived, which was unexpected and very nice."
13547301,90954409,2016-08-03,22964941,Po Yan,"Georgia is nice and friendly! She is like a mother to us. The electricity supply went off one night and she came by and fixed the problem within 10 mins. She also helped us with the luggage even after our stay in this apartment. The apartment is cozy and warmly decorated. The neighbourhood is safe and convenient (takes half an hour to reach downtown, transfer needed)."

We were able to one day drive into the city and another day leave the car and take the train. The neighborhood is quiet and safe with a number of stores and bakery just blocks away.  Georgia was very helpful in providing useful information and breakfast items. We spent several days here and would look forward to staying here again next time we visit Boston."

Her place was close to public transportation and was very comfortable for 5 people. She made herself available for us at all times. Her communication and flexibility was excellent.  She is an A+ host. Her place was wonderful for our trip to the city. Her home was very lovely and the neighborhood was fantastic too. I can't say enough about our stay there, it made me want to move in Boston! Another bonus is that the place is close to the Harvard Arboretum."

10594800,67329505,2016-03-28,26447158,Sharmishtha,"Stuart's place was located very close to the green T lines, so it was fairly easy to get to and from the city. The neighborhood was also full of restaurants and convenience stores. He also had a very friendly cat (and another cat that we didn't meet) who was the highlight of our trip."
Unfortunately there were a number of negatives. The main one was that our bedroom door didn't close. Stuart tried to fashion something with string to help keep it closed,but this didn't work. He was pretty blasé about it,which was pretty annoying,since privacy is a pretty basic requirement of having a private room.,,
Stuart was also pretty slow with communication (we didn't hear back from him until the morning of our arrival for one) throughout our trip,and this caused a few inconveniences for us.,,,,
There was no wifi in the apartment,which was in the listing description. When we asked him about it,he said there was ethernet (we only had phones with us so we couldn't use it) and that he had a box but hadn't set it up yet. We managed fine since we had data,but I hope he acquires this for any future guests who will be relying on wifi in the house,or at least updates the listing to be accurate.,
He had also set up an air mattress in our room for his next guests,which essentially took up the entire spare space in the room. We told him we wouldn't need it,"but he told us to \"\"ignore it\"\". I don't understand why he couldn't have put this up after our departure.",,,
The apartment was otherwise well equipped,and the super friendly cat made up for some of the negative experiences,"but overall we regret staying in this airbnb and should have chosen somewhere that was already reviewed.\"",,,

Although his description makes full disclosure about the two cats,this place could be much cleaner.  A great deal more attention needed to smells,litter box neatness,and the dirty floor.  The kitchen and,especially,the bathroom
I don't like having to leave a negative review.  However,on the plus side -- great location,public transit,"and a fun neighborhood.\"",,
10594800,70552484,2016-04-18,27178751,Don,"I was in town for marathon weekend and Stuart was accommodating from beginning to end. I didn't experience anything negative that was mentioned in the previous reviews: wifi worked, nothing smelled bad, and the bedroom door was close-able, though I chose to let the two friendly cats move in & out as they pleased. Stuart was quiet and kept to himself and I did the same. The location, near the end of Mile 22 of the marathon, is excellent. I would definitely stay here again."

9494511,73051885,2016-05-06,54207974,Chi  Chi,The apartment was nice.  Everything was just what I needed.  I enjoyed my stay.
9494511,73602488,2016-05-08,20160518,Jenny,"Natalia was an ideal host. Very responsive, accommodating, and agreeable. While she was out of town during my and my partner's stay, she made herself more than available for questions and concerns. Our room was delightful and cozy and we loved the neighborhood. I would love to stay again and would recommend Natalia's lovely Dorchester abode!"

"Natalia très accueillante présente tous les jours pour répondre à vos questions\"",,,,,
9494511,76932345,2016-05-29,43856934,Rachel,"\"The room was as described in the listing. It had two locks on the bedroom door, which was a nice feature.  The bedding was clean and Natalia provided towels for us and a personalized greeting in our room upon arrival. The home was in a nice neighborhood that was pretty quiet and made up of mostly families. There were shops nearby and we enjoyed some local pizza within walking distance. We found the \"\"99 cent store\"\" within walking distance very useful (though most items were not 99 cents). We had some broken luggage and busted sunglasses and were able to replace both for $35."
The walk from the subway was very doable even with rolling luggage. The subway station was convenient and a wonderful way to get into the city.,,,,,
Natalia was very nice and made it a point to say hello to us every day and give helpful travel tips. She had a board posted with local suggestions for food and entertainment which we used for a breakfast recommendation that was quite good.,,,,,
While we expected a less convenient experience than having a private bath,we were a little surprised by how difficult it was to access the bathroom at certain times. If ease of access to a bathroom is important to you,you may want to factor this in.  While this was not a huge issue for my husband and I,we did have to wait up to 30 minutes for access several times.,,
Also,if you're going in warm weather,there is no air conditioning and no fan.  We did not ask Natalia about this so it's possible we missed an amenity (a portable fan) that may have been available. It was 90 degrees one day we were there and the home did not cool to below 80 until after midnight by our estimation.,,,
The shared areas were nice and the TV room was a nice perk. There was also a fridge for common use where we stored some drinks.,,,,,
"Overall clean and pleasant home for a reasonable price with a super host. Would recommend bearing in mind the above potentially concerning factors. \"",,,,,
9494511,77565377,2016-06-01,71471796,Woojin,"Natalia was great! Very responsive and accommodating! I've used Airbnb one other time and I can really say that Natalia is a great host. Room is clean, private, and very spacious. The nights I stayed were pretty hot but luckily Natalia installed an AC unit and it worked out well. Would recommend and definitely stay again if near the Boston area."
9494511,78745932,2016-06-08,18520562,Evaristus,Natalia was great. Very flexible with check in and check out times. Her recommendations enriched my Boston experience for the 7 days I spent at her house.
Sharing of the bathroom among four rooms is just one of the Boston reality,but actually enriched the Airbnb community/ sharing experience where guests from different parts of the world and country interact and share experiences with each other.,,,,
The squeaky stairs and floor,like sharing a bathroom,is typical of Boston homes,not a fault of the homeowners.,,
"I would definitely and gladly recommend and be hosted by Natalia when next in the city.\"",,,,,

Her house is dog-friendly including a fenced in backyard. The free street parking is a great perk in Boston. We were very happy guests! Thanks!"

Everything is very organized, e.g. the kitchen with a fridge or the timetable for using the bathroom, so I felt very comfortable. The flat is in a quiet neighbourhood, so you can relax well from any activities in Boston itself. Also many restaurants around. Thanks a lot for that nice weekend =)."

9494511,91025260,2016-08-03,38404984,Vicky,"The room clean, also contained a closet with extra bedding and hangers inside, and was exactly as shown! Natalia was very accommodating to our check-in issues and was always prompt with her communication with us. Many individuals, including families, stayed in the building at the same time as us, which made the single bathroom available very busy and slightly inconvenient (one bathroom for two floors). A shower sign-up schedule was available by the door in the mornings and evenings though on a first-come-first-serve basis, which made coordination between everyone much easier! The kitchen was also clean and available for use, and wifi information was immediately available inside our room. Beside the kitchen, a board with suggestions for nearby cafes and restaurants was displayed - a nice touch! The area itself was very close to the train, which was very convenient, although slightly intimidating to walk back from at night - something that was easily rectified with Uber. Overall, a wonderful experience!"
9494511,92368048,2016-08-08,33932516,Laurene,We had a great time here and Natalia was very accommodating to both us and our dog.  The room was very clean and comfortable and we were very close to a T stop so it was easy to get to other neighborhoods in Boston.  She is also quick to respond to any questions you might have.

The room that we found was swept clean, clean towels and even candles were waiting for us. Since we were not the only ones in the house we  loved how organized and thought trough everything was. We especially loved the large balcony and made sure to have breakfast there whenever we could."

The staff were very attentive and went above and beyond with the reservation for my student who was hurt in the Boston bombings. He and his mother had a comfortable stay. I would definitely recommend them to others who are in need of a transitional place to stay.
130552,8341517,2013-10-26,3432215,Jennifer,"This apartment was perfect! The location was great; I was working at the New England Baptist Hospital for a week. It was a 15 minute walk (uphill), or taxi was only $5, and there is also a shuttle that left from the supermarket (5 min walk away) for 50 cents. Also, 30 minute walk from Kenmore square/Fenway, or 15 minutes on the T. The place was spotless. A little bag of both kitchen and bath amenities was left for me (paper towels, new hand towels, tea/coffee, toilet paper, shampoo, etc). Getting the key was seamless and leaving was the same. I would HIGHLY recommend this place. I would definitely stay here again if I was back in Boston."

The T (metro system in Boston) at Harvard Ave. Stop takes you to downtown Boston in half an hour. It's a good place to stay!"

Onur is Phd student,and very interesting and comfortable to talk.,,,,

I look forward to working with her again on trips in the future. The Beacon Hill Penthouse fit our party of 5 comfortably. This is a newly renovated penthouse, so everything was updated and clean. Queen beds were very comfortable. Since it is a penthouse, you have to walk up a couple flights, but no issues for us.  This penthouse is in a great location for taking in many sites around Boston. We enjoyed our walks from Beacon Hill down past Faneuil Hall to the waterfront where we embarked on a whale watch. We also trekked through some tourist spots in the North End before easily making our way back to Beacon Hill."

It was very HOT when we were in Boston, it was great to have a cool apartment to go back to when we were done for the day.  Paige is a great communicator and quickly got back to me on any questions I had.  It is a top floor apartment which was not big deal for us but if you have trouble with stairs this is not the place for you."

7508865,55450825,2015-12-01,10249923,Hilary,"The welcome was thorough and included instructions about how to access the apartment, obtain the keys, etc.  The building is in a busy part of the Fenway area with lots of retail and dining options.   There was a welcome basket of toiletries and kitchen supplies.  The doormen and the employees in the building were very helpful.  The layout of the apartment was fine and there was plenty of space.  But the apartment furnishings are run down and the upkeep of the whole building left something to be desired.  The photo does not reflect the living area, as the furniture is much different.  Almost every piece of furniture had a broken handle or major scuff, and there were stains, burned parts of carpet, and caked on dirt on most surfaces.  There were dried up contact lenses on the bathroom counter.  We could smell the smoke from the residents next door.  The blinds didn't fully close and let a lot of light in.  The casement windows didn't close properly and there was a lot of street noise when they were opened.  We requested another 2 lamps because one was broken and there are no overhead lights in any of the living areas, so things were very dark.  When the company brought 2 new lamps, one was broken.  We never got the TV in the bedroom to work."

After I left 2 days, they sent me a requirement for asking fee for that( including late check out fee). They asked me the check out time, I only said around 10am. I left at 10:30, then they asked me for the late check out fee."

Richard did a great job with getting the studio ready for us despite our last minute reservations-  we were pleasantly surprised to find everything we could possibly need already waiting... including shampoo/soap, and even wine, bread, cereal, and coffee!!"
The neighborhood is quiet and residential,and though the house is a 10 minute walk to the Green line at Harvard Ave,we felt lucky to pass by so many great neighborhood restaurants on the way. There are also a few buses within a few blocks radius.,,,
The studio itself looks newly renovated,and comes well furnished with a fully supplied kitchen. Great for those who prefer a less touristy experience of Boston and don't want to stay at a hotel.,,,,
Sad to say we never crossed paths with Richard during our Sat-Tues stay,but I suppose that just speaks to the privacy and freedom we were able to enjoy.,,,,

Barely ran into the hosts but their communication was amazing. They were flexible with quirky arrival times, wonderfully open about their space, and super accommodating.

The Studio~3rd floor walkup, even more comfortable than the neighborhood, everything someone would need for either a short or long term stay.  Victoria and Richard are the epitome of hostess and host, like that perfect waiter who doesn't hover, yet is always there for the smallest of needs!

The location was incredible, very close to Harvard Ave and Cambridge Street, that had GREAT food options. Parking was easy as long as it wasn't a bad time (late on a weeknight, etc...), but we didn't even need to drive because buses and trains were walking distance. The studio was clean, comfortable, and everything we needed. Perfect location but still relaxing and secluded enough. Would definitely come back!"

7362715,48357995,2015-09-25,9464238,Janine,"The apartment was beautiful, clean and very well located. A perfect place to stay, if you don't mind sharing an apartment and sleeping in the livingroom. Jacob gave us lots of information about things to do in Boston and made us feel really welcome."
7362715,48463564,2015-09-26,8080730,Nathalie,We had a great stay at Jacob's place! Nice host and very neat and clean apartment. If your looking for a place to stay in a good location and are traveling on a budget I can recommend this one.
7362715,49278469,2015-10-02,2114093,Aparna,Jacob's place is in a great location in Boston. The apartment is clean and comfortable and I slept well on the sofa bed. Jacob is a friendly host.
2515870,11576385,2014-04-07,5392536,Isabel,"We stayed for only one night (so couldn't make the most out of it) but we had a great night's sleep. The place was spotless and exactly as shown in the pictures. It's in a quiet residential area which feels really safe, around 10 minutes walking from the nearest subway stop. Gabriel was very kind and picked us up on our way too. I would recommend this place!"
2515870,11782701,2014-04-14,272353,Mike,Gabriel was fantastic and the apartment was immaculate.
He had a cleaning service come through twice during our stay even and even let us use his laundry card.  The apartment was stocked like a hotel (candies,water,the works) and had everything that you could need (shampoo,conditioner,soap,iron
"It was perfect.\"",,,,,
2515870,12019334,2014-04-21,4116041,Tatiana,"Appartment absolutely corresponds to the description, with safe territory, with all you need, clean, very comfy bed. Gabriel showed us everything, easy-going person. 100% recommend that place for stay, liked it."
2515870,12107224,2014-04-22,13856597,Keith,"Very prompt and thorough host, with catering flexibility. I couldn't have been more please with the location, security, cleanliness, and apartment aesthetics. It was my first airbnb experience and I truly hope all my hosts are like Gabriel. Thanks again for an uncomplicated process!"
2515870,12257551,2014-04-27,1124342,Chris,Place was as described.  Gabriel. Was a fantastic host have me all the info that I needed for a great stay.
2515870,12479096,2014-05-03,13262918,Glenn,Gabriel was a great host and keeps a very clean and organized apartment.
2515870,12563118,2014-05-05,9270246,Lean,"It was a fantastic experience ( our first with airbnb). The apartement very nice, very clean, very confortable. Gabriel was a host very very friendly, all the time available to help us. We left us some candies and movies to make our stay more pleasent.  The apartment is more beautiful than what the pictures show. The location and the neighborhood are very fine. Obviously we would like come back to Gabriel's apartment."
2515870,12805887,2014-05-11,15222725,Ian,"Great Host. Very clean, very easy to get into the city and we really enjoyed our stay and Gabriel could not have been better!"
2515870,13142378,2014-05-20,12033179,Jill,We had a good stay. Neighbors in apartment complex were a bit noisy into late hours but we managed to sleep through it. Communicated great and we had everything we needed for stay. Short 10 minute walk to red line or there are frequent buses from right around corner (200ish feet) that will take you to red line station. We rented a car but didn't use it. Also very close (10 minute walk) to JFK library
2515870,13218492,2014-05-22,542455,Paul Joseph,"This place is exactly as advertised, and a pretty good price compared to other listings in the Boston area. Riding the T to the Boston Convention Center one morning was pretty easy, but did require a short bus trip at the beginning, so not as close to one of the T stations as you might at first guess. If you've not been to Boston, do yourself a favor and buy their metro card at first opportunity."
As for Gabriel,he was awesome. Very nice,friendly,professional,and thoughtful. The cleaning service prior to my stay was later in the day than expected,so he actually picked me up from the convention center after work and personally drove me to the lodging. I felt safe and had everything I needed. The water comes out hot immediately
2515870,13437921,2014-05-27,529023,Jeremy,"Had a very nice time in Boston. Our host, Gabriel was very friendly and attentive during our stay.  He was right on time to meet us when we arrived and had even stopped by to pay for our parking both days.  The apt was clean and very comfortable. Close to the UMASS/JFK T stop (only a 10 minute walk) his location was perfect for us as we were traveling into downtown Boston each day for the Boston Calling music fest.  The neighborhood seemed very safe and we had no problem with walking back to the apt each night after the festival. All in all it was a pleasant stay. Thanks again!"

2515870,13528333,2014-05-29,14225811,Denis,"Gabriel was such a nice and caring host. One of the few who we met in person and who showed us the entire condo. The condo was very nice, with a soft carpet and everything you need."
It is located in a very nice and safe are,directly at the sand beach.,,,,
Boston is pretty close by,though we recommend to travel by car or cab to downtown.,,,,
"We can highly recommend Gabriel and his Condo :-)\"",,,,,
2515870,13568996,2014-05-31,2014001,Anne-Laure,"Gabriel was a very good host, we highly recommend it. He always responded to our calls despite our late arrival. We had not realized that the car park was just for one night and he did the right thing so that we do not have a problem in our car. The situation in Boston is also very good, the subway is really close."
2515870,13977307,2014-06-09,15502629,Sara,"Gabriel es un anfitrión muy atento. El apartamento es muy luminoso y está bien situado, el barrio es muy tranquilo. Se puede pasear por la Old Harbor que tiene unas vistas muy bonitas del mar y de la ciudad."
"La estación de metro está a 10 minutos andando y en 4 paradas estás en el downtown.\"",,,,,
2515870,14108312,2014-06-11,16546933,Andrew,Gabriel was great.  I had a last minute booking.  His place was clean and close to the T.  Thanks Gabriel!
2515870,14227253,2014-06-15,14207598,Mark,Awesome place.
2515870,14714116,2014-06-24,2429368,Don,Everything exactly as described and perfectly quiet.
2515870,15007526,2014-06-30,545533,Russ,"Gabriel is one of the best hosts we have ever had.  No delays, place was very clean, he was very hospitable and polite and responsive.   Left my blue tooth and he is mailing to me no charge."
2515870,15355053,2014-07-07,5073160,Jean-Pierre,It was a pleasure to stay at Gabriel's apartment during the 4th of July weekend. The apartment is impeccably clean and tidy. Gabriel was very flexible and helpful. My flight was delayed twice (!); I was supposed to get to Boston by 6:40 pm or so and ended up arriving around 11:40 pm. Gabriel was helpful and patient with these delays due to the airline/weather and made sure I made it into the apartment upon my arrival.
2515870,15658142,2014-07-13,9851908,Guillaume,The apartment was really comfortable for 2 people and the view was great. It is located in a nice neighbourhood where you can get some rest after the frenetic vibe of the city of Boston. We had a great trip and everything was easy to access. Gabriel was really nice and took the time the receive us and make sure that everything was fine. We highly recommend !!!!
2515870,16693172,2014-07-31,17115182,Dmitry,"Gabriel was a great host. He met us at the house, showed the apartment and was easily accessible throughout the day via calls and text. The place itself looks even better than on the pictures - a large, 2-room appartment with a nice bedroom and a living room (with a fabulous media system). The neigborhood is quite close to the city center (we had a car - no issues with parking, $5 for overnight stay) but very quiet and safe. Overall, highly recommended"
2515870,16789344,2014-08-02,13035383,Ian,"The apartment was clean, quiet, organized and very close to UMass, where I was attending meetings. It was also just steps away from a bus that connects right to the center of Boston. Gabriel was accommodating of my schedule and it was the perfect place to stay for my trip. Thanks!"
2515870,16986650,2014-08-05,16626500,Zulema,"The apartment was amazing. Pity we didn't get to meet our host, Gabriel, but he was so helpful with all the arrangements before our arrival. The apartment is very good situated, only 10 minute walk to the public transport. The neighborhood was very lovely and quiet. The apartment was full equipped and very cosy. Highly recommendable!"
2515870,17463198,2014-08-12,16300647,Tommaso,"We didn't meet Gabriel, he sent a very nice and helpful friend. The apartment is exactly as shown in the pictures, clean and cozy. The neighborhood is quiet and nice. It's easy to go anywhere from JFK/Umass train station. The bus from the apartment to the station passes rarely and we had to walk most of the time (it's a 15 minutes walk). Highly recommended!"
2515870,19763949,2014-09-17,15342720,Margot Suzanne,I stayed at this apartment one night and it was just as described.  Very comfortable and clean.  Gabriel was very helpful with directions and ensuring I didn't get lost walking from the T station.  It was much appreciated.
2515870,19809374,2014-09-18,2508445,Chien,A quiet and peaceful apartment stay. Clean and neat. Used both lyft ride and 15 mins walk to T JFK/Umass station. Gabriel is very accommodating too and checked with us to make sure our stay goes well.
2515870,19858785,2014-09-19,21341264,Christin,"This was awesome for our first Airbnb experience. Beautiful apartment, really not too far from the T's red line, the walk was fine, even after dark, about 20 mins ish. Getting downtown was SO easy and quick! Gabriel was easy to get ahold of and very nice. Apartment had all amenities of a hotel and then some, located in a nice gated community. The bed was  nice, living space was superb. Great value, great stay, would do again in a heartbeat."
2515870,19987341,2014-09-21,18942973,Erin,"We didn't meet Gabriel but he was extremely communicative and kind over the phone. The unit was very clean, with everything we needed and more. We felt safe and slept well. The location was great, outside the busy city center but only a 10-15 minute walk to the red line."
2515870,20063860,2014-09-22,21341264,Christin,"Great place! I'm so glad we found him!  Gabriel is a really nice guy, easy to get ahold of, and he did everything he could to make us feel comfortable. It was great having the place to ourselves because we have a 3 month old baby. We felt totally safe, even walking to the T in the dark :) Thanks Gabriel!"
2515870,20258625,2014-09-26,6524576,Felix,Gabriel was very good at responding to my inquiries very quickly. He was actively making sure that I had everything I needed.
His place was ready and in a spotless condition when I arrived in the evening. It is nicely located,quiet,"but not too far from the subway. Essentially as advertised.\"",,,
2515870,20400831,2014-09-28,3485617,Guido,"Great apartment with a breeze of a check-in / check-out process.  Very clean and tidy apartment with comfortable accommodations. Didn't try public transportation around here but took cabs into downtown which was actually pretty cheap. Gabriel is also very responsive, which was great."
2515870,20535704,2014-09-30,1003954,Hanneli And Ricky,"Another pos review, nothing really to add to the others. Nice guy, helpful, clean apartment, etc. I would go there again (and may)."
2515870,20689879,2014-10-04,18611542,George,Coordination with Gabriel was excellent. Accomodations were as advertised and met our expectations for cleanliness and comfort. Apartment location was very convenient for using MBTA public transportation to visit downtown Boston. Enjoyed our 3 day stay and recommend using Gabriel's Airbnb rental.
2515870,21046256,2014-10-10,21538443,Todd,"Gabriel was very accommodating and flexible.  The apartment was great - clean, good-looking and quiet - pretty much all as advertised.  Had a great stay!"
2515870,21361446,2014-10-15,22116943,Francine,You can't beat the location of this apt. It's right near the water and T train. I loved how safe my husband and I felt walking to and from the T. There is not a lot with in walking distance that we found so we just took the T.  This apt is so cozy and comfy we felt just like we where at home. We only stayed one night but if we had time we would have stayed longer.  Gabriel called to check in on is a few times and made us feel welcomed. All in all is was a very nice place with a great location.
2515870,21484936,2014-10-18,22123695,Taras,"I have another great review, everything was just as described. I would love to stay here again."

"Would highly recommend it to anyone.\"",,,,,
2515870,22219671,2014-11-01,22586614,Jerry,Gabriel's apartment was perfect.  The location is great and had all the things needed for an comfortable stay.   Gabriel was very responsive and made sure I had all the needed information to gain access to the gated community and apartment. I would definitely rent again.  Thanks Gabriel for a great stay.
2515870,22542430,2014-11-09,6009738,Laura,I never met my host but our communication was very good. Gabriel helped us enjoyed our stay in Boston and he is wonderful host. The place we end up staying has beautiful view and food facility.
2515870,23586108,2014-12-05,24289938,Neil,"Very nice place at a very good price. Gabriel was very welcoming and flexible with check-in and check-out times. The place was clean and had everything I needed. By car, the apartment is 10-15 minutes from downtown Boston, and ~20 min during the early morning, so it is in a very convenient location."
2515870,24903345,2015-01-03,1863423,Patrick,"Très bonne communication avec Daniel. L'appartement est dans une zone sécurisé, proche de l'eau avec tout le nécessaire pour passer un bon séjour."
2515870,25490155,2015-01-17,5716158,Bernardo,"This place was great. Easy to get to, clean, comfortable, and in a nice area with a view of the ocean."
2515870,25761913,2015-01-25,25555741,Kevin,"The apartment was clean and just as advertised. There was bad weather coming so the apartment security would not allow me to park for the weekend, but Gabriel was not aware that they would do that. He called the garage across the street to ensure we could park over the weekend and even picked us up after dropping the car off and when leaving. GREAT HOST. I would stay again. It was perfect for a weekend tríp. We did not take the T train, but we were only about a 10 minute walk and about 15-20 minute drive to downtown Boston. We had as much contact with Gabriel as we needed. He resolved our minor issue, and then let us enjoy our trip. He was also very responsive. We enjoyed everything about our first trip to Boston minis the minor hiccup with parking during the snow storm."
2515870,26668132,2015-02-16,744329,Amilton,"I've been using AirBNB now for 4 years and I've got to say that Gabriel is one of the best hosts I've had the pleasure of meeting. The place looks just as it does in the pictures and is in a great location. There's a Shaw's Supermarket down the road, the JFK train station, quick access to highway I-93, it's about a 10 minute drive to downtown and/or the airport, and it's close to the water which makes for a great walk in warm weather."
I am a Boston local and made an inquiry about the place on Valentine's Day weekend and he responded within 15 minutes. Boston was hit with its 4th bad snow storm of the winter that weekend so the plan was to have a nice and cozy place to pass the storm and spend the weekend together. When we arrived,Gabriel brought us to the grocery store and made sure we knew how to use the projector. The thing I appreciated the most was when a false fire alarm went off in the building at 3am,Gabriel was accessible and called the building manager for us. Later that morning after the fire alarm situation was settled he came to check on us and gave us a ride to my house which is in the Boston area.,,,
If you need a place to stay in Boston,"I recommend that you inquire with Gabriel before anyone else. The price is more than reasonable and you can't beat the location. It was more than generous of him to give us the ride and goes to show that other than being a great host he's a man of high integrity. Gabriel is an extremely generous and considerate guy who will go above and beyond to make sure you have a great stay. Book your stay at his place and enjoy your time in the City of Champions.\"",,,,
2515870,27360755,2015-03-02,27930433,Daniel,"The apartment was absolutely wonderful--amenities were great, location was quiet, and relatively close to the red line. Gabriel was also a fantastic host; we had a chance to meet him in person and he was very enthusiastic in helping us settle in. He was also very responsive throughout the entire booking process--he always responds within an hour or less. There is also a maid who comes and cleans the place up so the service is definitely top-notch. I would recommend this to anyone trying to find a whole apartment relatively near Boston downtown."
2515870,27600291,2015-03-08,3596306,Adam,"\"We drove to Boston from NYC for a convention and chose Gabriel's apartment to stay at. It was only 10 minutes from the convention center, had security, lots of parking and a quiet location. It's terrific for one person or a couple, but if you have someone sleeping separately in the living room the love seat/futon is a bit uncomfortable. To be fair Gabriel doesn't \"\"advertise\"\" the futon as a separate bed or advise that the listing is suited for such a thing"
2515870,27887314,2015-03-14,28039069,Karolina,"Gabriel is a very friendly and helpful person. He assisted me in commuting in Boston and finding many useful places/sightseeings. His apartment was really very nice, clean and tidy. Additionally, it is situated in a very pieceful and safe district, near the underground station, which makes it even more attractive."
2515870,28037112,2015-03-16,28398373,Bryan,"Gabriel was extremely helpful and welcoming, and the apartment itself was fantastic.  Great area and extremely comfortable, about a mile down the street to the T. Highly recommended!"
2515870,28350994,2015-03-22,22804289,Maxx,His place was ready and in a spotless condition when I arrived in the afternoon. Apartment location was very convenient for using MBTA public transportation to visit downtown Boston. Had a great stay! I would stay here again.
2515870,29652411,2015-04-10,28868614,Assyria,We had a great stay at Gabriel's place. The apartment is equipped with anything you need for a more than comfortable stay.

2515870,30451062,2015-04-22,14685787,Neil,The apartment was great and Gabriel checked in a couple of times to see if I needed anything. I'd definitely stay there again and would recommend to others.
2515870,31536711,2015-05-06,16684526,Susan,"Gabriel was welcoming, informative, and checked in with us shortly after our arrival. The location is great for UMASS and the unit was generally quiet.  The negatives: Many of the typical and expected amenities were not provided such as kitchen sponge, kitchen towels, and a coffee pot.  There were coffee mugs but no drinking glasses.  All of the cushion was gone from the couch and you could feel the springs making it uncomfortable to sit for any length of time. The projector was askew so it couldn't be used (we did notify Gabrielle of this and he offered to come fix it but we opted to use the TV in the bedroom).  The apt was generally clean but there were areas that were missed such as the bathtub, month old milk left in the fridge, and what appeared to be bacon grease in the bottom of the toaster oven."
2515870,31923545,2015-05-11,17729427,Sophie,"Gabriel went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and welcome. When the AC hadn't been switched on in the building yet he brought us over two massive fans. He also brought us over a cable so we were able to watch movies on the projector in the living room. The place is exactly as you see it in the photos, and we had an excellent stay overall. We will definitely be staying again!"
2515870,32349486,2015-05-17,29990242,Eric,Gabriel and his apartment are great! Gabriel checked in on me via text and was quick to answer any question I had about the area. The apartment is just how it is in pictures. And it was very clean! The location is right on a harbor walk and its beautiful. I made a whole day of being by the harbor. I am looking forward to staying at Gabriel's place on my next visit to Boston.
2515870,32702790,2015-05-20,3778211,Mary,Gabriel was fantastic at keeping in touch with us both before we arrived and on our journey.
"The apartment was even better than our expectations.\"",,,,,
2515870,33515932,2015-05-29,19127415,Michael,Gabriel was great in getting everything set up.  The apartment was just as advertised.  Great experience.  Even let me borrow a bicycle for the week.
2515870,34201471,2015-06-06,30044584,Andrew,"Gabriel was a fantastic host. From the moment we were interested in booking until we got home from our trip, he was quick to respond and extremely helpful. His apartment is very nice - he takes very good care of it. We loved our trip to Boston and our stay at Gabriel's apartment was one of the many reasons why."

For my girlfriend and I's first airbnb experience, I could not have been more pleased. I look forward to staying there again!"
2515870,36375297,2015-06-28,29990242,Eric,This is the second time I have stayed at Gabriel's place and its probably the only place I'll ever stay when I go to Boston. It a beautiful apartment in a beautiful neighborhood by the harbor. It has easy quick access to the T. Gabriel even offered me his bike if I needed. Gabriel communicates clearly and is always quick to answer questions about the apartment or the city.
2515870,39359485,2015-07-22,7022392,Ray,Great place to stay. Affordable for last minute option. Very roomy. I regret not trying the large TV.

2515870,41302285,2015-08-05,40535217,Isaiah,Gabriel went out of his way to ensure my first airbnb.com experience went as smooth as possible.  Using this service was a last minute choice and he made sure I was able to get signed up after I had some troubles with the airbnb.com system.  I couldn't be happier with the experience.
2515870,41565182,2015-08-07,20880023,David,Great location and Gabriel made it easy to stay. Felt very much like a bachelor pad as depicted by the photos.
2515870,42485699,2015-08-13,28820074,Jasmine,Gabriel was great at communicating and our stay at his place was great! The apartment is in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood and he has a great sound system/projector set up in the living room. The apartment was very spacious (there were two of us) and clean.

2515870,47237313,2015-09-16,44276027,Yinmei,The location discribtion is very specific. And the room is perfect.
2515870,47389473,2015-09-18,29425870,Bex,"Gabriel's apartment is fantastic. The place has everything you need and is in a lovely quiet residential area very close to the sea, which makes for a lovely walk in the evening."
I was amazed how lovely and clean the place was when we arrived and how responsive Gabriel was to our messages prior to and during our arrival. His instructions for check in and out where clear and everything went smoothly.,,,,,
This would probably be a better location for someone with a car although a short walk to a bus/train station provides access to central Boston in less than half an hour overall. There is also a convenience store and Chinese restaurant within the area.,,,,,
"We had a wonderful stay at Gabriel's apartment and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to explore Boston!\"",,,,,
2515870,48235194,2015-09-24,18098317,Daniel,Apartment is clean and spacious with a nice kitchen and living room. Location is perfect for going into the city. Gabriel was a great host as well. Highly recommended!
2515870,48738722,2015-09-28,29935546,Bryony,"This apartment is very clean and exactly as described. It is walking distance to transit, making downtown easily accessible. Gabriel was always available to answer questions. One drawback locationwise, would be the lack of restaurants and/or grocery stores within walking distance. Without a car, we found this difficult.  Over all we had a great stay here."
2515870,49571073,2015-10-04,31665470,Fantasia,It was a nice space it was clean and spacious. Literally like right in front of a college campus lol but no problems at all very nice. Never met the host but he left the key for me and I had no problems getting inside.
2515870,50412059,2015-10-11,27705153,Sloane,Gabriel was an excellent host who was quick to respond with any questions we had. The apartment was a short 10 minute walk from the T and easily accessible to downtown Boston. Overall a great experience and we will be sure to stay with him again next time we are in Boston.
2515870,51181099,2015-10-18,15665769,Erwin,"We had a wonderful time in Boston, with Gabriel's apartment being surely one of the reasons. The apartment is located in a nice and quite neighbourhood with a good connection to public transport (Station JFK/UMASS, i.e. 5-10min to Park Street / Boston Common or Downtown Crossing). Despite the modern style and look, the apartment was clean, cosy and - for us a very important factor -  with lots of windows lightful as well."
Gabriel was out of town,so we did not meet personally,which was not a problem at all. Flexible check-in and check-out is an additional plus.,,,
"We would recommend Gabriel's apartment to everyone either for a short trip or a long stay!    \"",,,,,
2515870,51673825,2015-10-22,2955324,Rémy,Awesome apartment !
We didn't have the chance to meet Gabriel,but he was flexible and perfectly organised to welcome us in his place.,,,,
Situated 10 min walk from Umass red line stop,downtown crossing was only 2 stops away ! What a great location !,,,,
"Highly recommended !\"",,,,,
2515870,52318350,2015-10-28,37484815,Dianne,"We had a great time in Boston! Gabriel was attentive to ensure we had what we needed after we arrived.  The location was perfect for our needs; close to college where were visiting, close to the bus line and a short walk to the T.  The room is as advertised, a bachelor apartment, but it met our needs."
2515870,53870404,2015-11-13,14279916,Louis,Great place will definitely stay there again. Apartment was clean and host was very responsive. It was a great experience overall because he left no room for error. Highly recommend.
2515870,54070563,2015-11-15,45605387,Ben,"While we were not fortunate enough to meet Gabriel, he left a lasting impression on us nonetheless. Gabriel was incredibly helpful, attentive and responsive as soon as we had any questions. His apartment was absolutely beautiful, well kept and spacious. The location was very convenient for our needs, and I believe would be for anyone looking to use the Boston area. I highly recommend Gabe's apartment for anyone."
2515870,54640915,2015-11-22,27204298,Katie,Gabriel was a really great host and was quick in responding to any correspondence and checking if everything was okay. The listing was exactly as listed and a great location! Would stay again if ever in the area.
2515870,57824248,2015-12-29,41420144,Thaila,This was my first air bnb experience and it couldn't have gone better in my book. Gabriel is a great host. He is great at communicating and very accommodating. The apartment looked just as it did in the pictures. One thing I appreciated the most was how neat and clean everything was. The apartment not only looked great but is located very close to downtown where I needed to be that night. There is also plenty of parking if needed at the condominium. If I ever needed to stay in Boston again I would hope that Gabriel's apartment would be available.
2515870,61112437,2016-01-31,44973860,Diana,I really enjoyed my stay in Gabriel's home. It's a cozy clean apartment. He has amazing response time and is very helpful whenever you need him. The neighborhood seemed really quite and welcoming. I would gladly stay here again.
12857811,78788766,2016-06-09,57460255,Tyler,Kaitlin was very responsive to communication and very welcoming
12857811,79919008,2016-06-15,59581426,Clayton,"Couldn't ask for a better host. Very nice, very insightful and very helpful. She speaks well too...room was nice and the location was good also. Close to the airport and since i had a layover, that was totally fine for me. Definitely looking forward to staying there again if i were on that side of town again!"
12857811,80264532,2016-06-17,76960718,Philipp,Katie was very welcoming. She even arranged a driver picking us up at the Bus station and was always concerned with Our well-being. She seemed like a really trustworthy Person and made delicious pancakes for Breakfast.
It seems though,that she is just setting up the place as there were many shortcomings when it comes to the interior of the house itself.,,,,
Furthermore,the neighborhood might seem a little shady,but if you keep an open mind and dont get scared easily,you can have a great experience,just as we did.,
In conclusion,the bed n breakfast Provides an authentic and cheap accomodation for adventurous travelers who are willing to Cut some comfort Standards. What you can expect is a bed,a breakfast,and a lovely host.,,

12857811,80452604,2016-06-18,2159338,Pierre,"Kaitlin is a very kind host. She's launching her bnb and I can only support her in this effort. Not everything was perfect, but I assume these things will get fixed as she grows her business."
12857811,80925767,2016-06-20,29583128,Marco,"I was a little shocked about the location of the house and the cleanness of the rooms. The area surrounding the house didn't appear very safe to me. Hence, I decided to leave earlier as I planned."

12857811,81309625,2016-06-22,17695965,Henrik,"Kaitlin is a very welcoming and caring host. She made sure I was comfortable and ate well for breakfast. The room is nice and light. The apartment is a little worn, but functional. I liked that the neighborhood is authentic. It is a little out of the way from the downtown area, however the value is definately there. I would certainly stay with Kaitlin again."
12857811,81397845,2016-06-22,34863141,André,"I totaly agree with my predecessors. Kaitlin was very friendly and helpful. Her house is in a safe area and is easily reached from the south station by train/bus and a few minutes walk. For Boston conditions the price is extremely low. For this, however, one should not have high expectations."

I wish I could have spoken to her one on one but sometimes our best intentions can be misunderstood so I decided to remain quiet."
12857811,88230493,2016-07-23,61933198,Madeline,"Door left unlocked on arrival as host wasn't home. Someone else was home who didn't answer when I called out, leaving me to awkwardly let myself in and wait in the kitchen, not knowing which room was mine. Key was left in place too high to reach. Rodent nest in the room, dresser drawers were chewed through with droppings on the floor. One sheet and no blanket or anything on the bed. Bathroom wasn't properly cleaned. Host didn't respond to text message while there. Not a good area for public transport. No internet."

12857811,92412415,2016-08-08,62049817,Samer,"As a first time user for airbnb. My first experience was much more below my expectations in terms of the room cleanliness and neighborhood safety. However, The host Kaitlin is a very nice person and good in communication. Although she was on vacation when I booked the room she made sure someone else will open the door for me when I checked in. The cleanliness of the room and the bathroom is not what I expected and I didn't feel safe in the room so I left 4 hours after I checked in. It turned out to be that I was given the wrong room, but kaitlin made an effort to refund me and offered me another free night which was very nice of her"
12857811,93357858,2016-08-12,88928893,Florian,Very hot room without AC. Small bed with just one thin blanket. Nice host though and good breakfast.
585148,16753953,2014-08-01,1737185,Erica,"We were extremely happy with George's place and his hospitality!  He went above and beyond for us, ensuring we had everything we needed and made himself available for any questions from us at any time.  We loved his place.  He's a very neat, tidy and clean guy - clearly - and his apartment is nicely decorated, minimal in a good way and made us feel at home.  The washer and dryer was a nice perk in the apartment and the lofty space and building was pretty cool!  We were right in the heart of galleries and what seems to be a neighborhood that's drawing a trendy artsy and even a bit upscale crowd.  The people in the building were super friendly too!  Parking wasn't terrible, as it often is in cities.  We were able to find 4 hour parking and then move it to a meter right after that, and George even left us quarters to help us out with parking.  It felt like I was at a super luxury hotel with the perk of having a kitchen!"
585148,17248533,2014-08-09,19317736,Sara Firoozeh,I stayed at George's loft for a day and the place was exactly the same as the descriptions.The neighborhood (south end ) is very nice and safe..Even though he was not in town with his instructions it was easy to settle in.His communication was great and every time I had a question or needed direction to grocery store etc he was there to text me all the info that I needed.I recommend staying at this beautiful loft and will stay there again.
585148,18147263,2014-08-22,9739627,Helen,"George was a great host, very relaxed and responsive.  He was out of the country during our visit, but gave us his brother's telephone number as a contact.  We did have to call on his brother to let us into the apt., because the last guest did not leave the key in the proper location.  His brother came in 20 minutes and was very helpful and welcoming."
The apartment was beautiful,clean,quiet,and comfortable; the neighbors were friendly; and the neighborhood felt safe.  My only complaint was the parking.  It was very easy to park in front of the building,but the meters only allow for 2 hours of quarters,so one either has to keep running back to the car
"I would definitely stay at George's again if I were in Boston.\"",,,,,
585148,19375910,2014-09-11,11896696,Arturo,"George was a great host. He provided us all the information needed before moving in, and was always available for us in case we had any doubts."

585148,19683613,2014-09-16,19702568,Stephanie,"Amazing spot! George was very quick to respond to any questions or concerns we had. Gave us great recommendations for food and drink in the area. Close to a Foodies market, shops and GREAT restaurants. If you're there on a Sunday there is a pop-up farmer's market and food truck festival just around the corner. Easy to navigate and get around the city from this spot. The place itself was clean, tidy and organized - well set-up for the two of us. Thanks George!"
585148,20159372,2014-09-24,21084895,Kristen,"Great space in a trendy part of Boston.  Easy check in, handy to have washer/dryer, dishwasher while on vacation.  Parking not simple but not impossible.  George went out of his way to make our stay enjoyable.  Would stay here again."
585148,20963975,2014-10-08,8278653,Maria Cristina,"I traveled to Boston with a friend of mine and we both loved Georges' apartment. George was a great host. He was so helpful before we got to the apartment, and during our stay as well. He answered our questions in less then 30 minutes and seemed willing to help. We did not get to meet him, but his instructions on how to get into the apartment were clear and simple. No issues whatsoever."
The apartment was clean,organized and beautiful. It looked just like the pictures.,,,,
The location was perfect. It was a 15-20 minute walk to the downtown Boston attractions. There were also the Silver Line 4 and 5 buses taking you to and from downtown and the airport. The bus stop was a couple of blocks away from the apartment. The bus ride was really quick and frequent service.,,,,,
The area seemed safe and it had many great restaurants and cafe's.,,,,,

It's very comfortable and provides all that one needs for a great stay in Boston: comfy bed, cool furnishings, plenty of natural light. I could picture myself staying here much longer than a weekend. The check in and check out process were very smooth; despite a fairly significant travel delay on my end. Having lived in Boston before in a different area, the location of George's apartment also allowed me to explore a neighborhood that was still new to me!"

Nice,roomy apartment for two people. My wife suggests bringing earplugs as the street noise and freeway noise can be heard.,,,,

George communicated with us on our needs and he worked his schedule and kindly accommodated us.,,,,,
The apartment is as advertised. In fact it seemed larger than what I expected.,,,,,
We did not have a car (arrived by air). The apartment is well located for mass transit (a bus stop is directly across the street,runs every 20 min,then 5 or so minutes to Broadway Station and RED Line Subway connection). so was easy breezy to get around Boston.,,,
There is good security and good elevator system. We felt very safe there.,,,,,
There is a grocery store about 10 minute walk away.,,,,,
There are good family run cafes / restaurants just walking close by. We enjoyed the 'Hidden Kitchen' sandwich shop just across the street.,,,,,
I am very picky on noise levels,and even tho the apartment is near a major highway/busy street. The noise level did not bother me either during the day or night.,,,,
We liked the nice modern kitchen,good WIFI and a TV system with lots of choices.,,,,

2174476,19569208,2014-09-14,16683245,Caroline,Very nice apartment in a great neighborhood. Nice distance to Fenway Park and Boston.
2174476,20033417,2014-09-22,20419460,Stead,"First let me thank our host Alan for taking great care of us as promised!  The listing description was accurate, the place looks just like the pictures.  The studio was well appointed, clean and comfortable for two people.  The bed was firm and comfortable we slept well each night.  The neighborhood and building are pretty quiet.  No noisy neighbors and no real street noise.  We had everything we needed for our week long stay.  We did not spend much time hanging out in the studio as we were mostly on the go.  The studio was convenient to two subway stations about 0.5 mile walk to each one.  Which we used daily and is an inexpensive and  easy way to get all around town.  A taxi company operates from around the corner, so taxis were plentiful and easy to get from the neighborhood at all times. The neighborhood was awesome just blocks from Fenway park.  We went to a concert at Fenway one night so the proximity was super.  The Museum of Fine Arts was a 0.5 mile walk and is incredible not to be missed.   We enjoyed two restaurants around the corner from the studio on Peterborough St.  Thornton's has a yummy brunch 7 days a week 11-3 weekdays and 9-3 on weekends they serve dinner also but we didn't have chance to try it.  Also, El Pelon if you like Mexican was good and fresh and open till 11 PM.  The pizza joint across the street from the studio was just OK . I know you could do better somewhere else. There are many chain and other restaurants and bars near Fenway as well.  A laundry mat on the corner by the studio is convenient where you can do your own or they will do it for you."
This was my first time in Boston so we took a ton of tours.   My favorites were put on by Boston By Foot (Architecture Cruise and A city Engineered) and Haunted Boston (ghost tour ending in the Omni Parker Hotel  **not cheesy,just creepy).  Look them up if your interested both companies were professional,entertaining,and informative.  The view from the Tall Ship sunset cruise was breathtaking.  My favorite restaurants in the city were Atlantic Fish Co.,Sam LaGrassa's,"and Saus.  I really enjoyed this visit to Boston and plan to come back some day...  I would definitely stay in this cozy Fenway Studio again. \""
2174476,20106081,2014-09-23,11209731,Vicki,Alan was most helpful guiding us to his place. We took public transportation and walked the rest of the way with Alan's help. This was just the place we needed. We arrived fairly late but had a choice of a few restaurants right in the neighborhood to get a late dinner which we took back to the flat. We left early the next day for Vermont. I later realized I had left my IPad charger & called Alan to let him know. He offered to send it to me as soon as I emailed him my address. We would certainly stay there again.
2174476,20196284,2014-09-25,20620490,Gilbert,"The studio was cozy and comfortable. We were there for a Red Sox game, so it was very convenient for us. Fenway park is only minutes away by foot."
The Internet was hit and miss,"but other than that the experience was worth the stay. \"",,,,
2174476,20247416,2014-09-26,14771903,Diana,"I had a great stay at Alan's studio. It was clean and perfect with the kitchen. Towels, linens, and some bathroom toiletries were provided. It was also underground and remote so even though we were in an apartment building, it seemed really private. It was a two block walk from Fenway park. We ate at an amazing restaurant Church which was literally half a block away. It was super close to the Kenmore exit of the subway, which we took for free directly from the airport. Although Alan wasn't in town to greet us, his manager Eddie took great care of us to make sure we were settled in properly, not to mention the fact that he was super cool and accommodating when I miscommunicated an incorrect arrival time. I will 100% book this studio again when I come back to Boston."
2174476,20434960,2014-09-29,20571886,Jessica,"The apartment was in a great location, super close to Fenway! We had a great time catching a Red Sox game.  The neighborhood was nice and was in easy walking distance of some fun night life. Eddie got us settled in and even made sure we had extra towels. It was our first time using airbnb, and after this, I would definitely recommend  it to everyone!"
2174476,20583712,2014-10-01,17739798,Ariana,"Cute and clean apartment, perfect for what I needed."
2174476,20711467,2014-10-04,3166221,Haley,"We had a wonderful time!! Alan was out of town, so his property manager Eddie showed us the place. He was super nice and knowledgeable. The place was a clean and cozy basement unit. Would stay again!!!"
2174476,21135745,2014-10-12,1968944,Dani,Desafortunadamente no conocí personalmente a Alan pero fue muy amable y de mucha ayuda! Pero Eddie que fue la persona que nos recibió fue también muy amable y nos ayudo mucho. El vecindario es hermoso muy tranquilo y todo esta muy cerca. Lo recomiendo al 100% a todas las personas!
"Unfortunately I do not personally met but Alan was very friendly and very helpful! But Eddie was the person who greeted us was also very friendly and helped us a lot. The neighborhood is very quiet and beautiful everything is very close. 100% recommend it to everyone!\"",,,,,
2174476,21346516,2014-10-15,21214325,Sameer,My girlfriend and I had a great time at Alan's place. The studio has a great location with everything you could need around it. The place is stocked with any essentials you could need during your trip. Would gladly stay there again when in town.
2174476,21720192,2014-10-22,22217693,Jean,"This place is very convenient. No 55 bus takes us to subway lines. It is quiet, clean and safe.  Almost all the essentials are installed."
2174476,21879137,2014-10-26,20826949,Lisa,"Alan, and Eddie were both very friendly and helpful.  This was my first time using Airbnb, and it was a positive experience.   The property was located in a safe environment.  Parking is available nearby in a garage for 20 dollars a day with in and out privileged."
2174476,22102414,2014-10-30,5283379,Duncan,Eddie was prompt and helped us find our way quickly around the neighborhood.
This space is definitely for travelers without a car to park / this is the Back Bay -Fenway section of Boston - no on street parking at all.,,,,,
We had to have a car for our 10 day stay in the area and parking it for 3 nights cost us $135 total which is obviously crazy.,,,,,
"Those who have no car and use the T will love the location and the unit. If you have a car to park I advise you search for an alternate choice.\"",,,,,
2174476,22457903,2014-11-07,9795199,Jon,"Meeting up with Eddie (the property manager) was really easy and helpful.  He showed us the place and gave us a lay of the land as to what is nearby.  The place was in a great location - just a few blocks from Fenway ballpark.  There is a LOT of food nearby and even a grocery store to stock up on water and such.  We liked that the apartment was by the back entrance and used that almost exclusively.  The pictures are accurate to the place - TV was a nice size and worked fine, kitchen had the basics for some light cooking.  The biggest complaint we have is that there isn't a great/comfortable place to work.  The counter/bar stools are fine just not super comfortable on the back for long periods of work.  Also, wished there could have been just a few more towels but we made due."
2174476,22651713,2014-11-11,21702863,Diana,"Great experience overall. Alan was out of town so his colleague Eddie helped me get situated. Both replied to me in a timely manner when planning my arrival and both were very kind. The studio was in a great neighborhood and right next to a 7-11 whose coffee I needed due to the loss of some sleep. :)  There were some strange pipe noises early in the morning that woke me up so make sure this issue has been addressed before you stay...unless you want to get up every morning at 0530! I highly recommend staying here, it is a garden apartment, quiet and private for the most part.  As a female traveling by herself, I felt very safe here."
2174476,22750974,2014-11-13,20873752,Steven,"Great place, exactly as described"
2174476,22832401,2014-11-16,20334249,Jeanine,"It was really easy to work with Alan and his team. Alan was out of town so his business partner was who we worked with. Both Alan and Eddie were VERY responsive before we arrived to make arrangements on checking in. The check in process was very easy and Eddie was able to show us everything we would need for our stay. Everything was advertised accurately. The location could not be any better. we were 2 blocks from Fenway park, there was a ton of restaurants/bars to walk to and shopping was about a 10-15 min walk (very easy and safe!) I will keep this in mind if i find myself back in Boston. Thank you!!!!"

2174476,22997469,2014-11-19,23532660,Erin,"Great place to stay! Clean and comfortable, just as the listing describes. Plus it was in an incredibly convenient location (walking distance to green, red, and orange lines, plus the commuter rail). Alan and his property manager did a great job coordinating check in and describing the check-out process. Overall, it was a wonderful experience!"
2174476,23075537,2014-11-22,9973750,Maria,This studio is a cozy ground floor apartment on a nice residential street. The apartment is clean and has been recently renovated. It is on a quiet street near a main street with a Starbucks and Burger King within a block and other non-chain choices of eateries. We ate one night at The Church and another at the american Publican House(or some variation on that) both w/great food. I was attending a conference at the Hynces Convention center-only a 20 min walk. Both Alan and Eddie communicated with me promptly. Very enjoyable.
2174476,26386918,2015-02-11,22582697,Cecilia,"We had a very good time in Alan's apartment! Very convenient location and an efficient management, also with tons of snow!"
The apartment was equipped with everything we need and the host's response to our needs was very timely.,,,,,
"Highly recommended for your staying in Boston! \"",,,,,
2174476,26549368,2015-02-15,14911657,Jack,Alan attended to all of our needs promptly.
2174476,27521190,2015-03-06,28585635,Erin,"Alan's studio was great! It was very clean. There were bathroom supplies and a lot of TV options. The neighborhood was quiet and felt very safe. There were plenty of places to eat within walking distance. The apartment is very close to busy streets like Boylston and Newbury, which have lots of options for things to do (not to mention it's right by Fenway Park). We arrived in Boston super early and when we requested an earlier check-in time, it was easily accommodated."
2174476,28266163,2015-03-21,28208825,Vinay,Excellent communications throughout. Residence and service all well above expectation. Terribly obliging and nil concerns whatsoever. Thanks again. Would recommend without hesitation.

2174476,28954496,2015-04-01,15113335,Raul,Allan'a apartment was everything we expected and everything they advertised. The place was clean and comfortable and had everything you need if you're planning on visiting Boston for a weekend or a couple of days. The location is amazing as it is located in the Fenway neighbourghood and pretty close to a lot of interesting places. Very nice place!
2174476,30151956,2015-04-18,14645388,Hope Wesley,"We really enjoyed working with Alan. Both he and his property manager Eddie were incredibly responsive during the booking process and out visit. Eddie welcomed us when we arrived and helped us settle in, find parking, and dress the cot for our son. This compact little studio is comfortably appointed and very convenient for visiting Boston colleges."
2174476,30437777,2015-04-22,21545415,Cara,Alan's flat is amazing ... Home from home! Clean and comfortable.Everything is there from cutlery to towels and best of all internet access.
Alan was out of town when we arrived but he arranged for Eddie to meet us with the key and go through everything! Eddie was great and spent time explaining sights we should go see and places to eat.,,,,,
I would highly recommend as a place to stay,which is also central to the main town and just a few minutes walk to Prudential tower.,,,,
"Cara \"",,,,,
2174476,30872405,2015-04-28,28353507,Ronie,"A cute little studio in a nice area, literally a 5 min walk to Fenway. A lot of little places near by so you definitely don't need a car. More of a hassle to have one actually being that parking is mainly for residents. The place was clean, bedding was nice, towels soft.  Would def stay here again. Had all the amenities right down to even a washer and dryer down the hall. I didn't get to meet the actual host, he was out of town but the gentleman he did send to meet me was very nice and informative. Overall a great experience."
2174476,31181661,2015-05-03,28695080,Valerie,Great location to Fenway. Accommodated our late night arrival. Clean apartment. Highly recommended.

The studio was nice, beds were super comfortable, plenty of good restaurant choices right in walking distance.  Eddie checked us in and then smooth sailing for our entire visit.  Makes me want to live in Boston.  Thanks for the great service and accommodations."
2174476,32470717,2015-05-18,26423671,Leslie,"After a misstep in the beginning with a double booking, Alan made it right by putting us in his other place.  Perfect location as we were attending graduation at BU (would be unbeatable if you were in town for a Sox game!).  The bed set-up was great for a family of four -- I don't think two adults would be comfortable on the pull-out, but one would.  It is a basement apt. so no view, but quiet.  Quieter neighborhood which was nice, but also good restaurants to choose from -- recommend Sweet Cheeks bbq.  All good!"
2174476,34941783,2015-06-14,14379384,Natalie,"Great neighborhood! 5 minute walk to Fenway.  It was easy to use public transportation to get downtown and to other neighborhoods.  The studio was just as described and pictured.  Alan went above expectations, especially by being flexible with check-in time.  I would stay here again.  Thanks to Alan and his property manager, Eddie!"
2174476,39475196,2015-07-24,26191547,Fiona,Many thanks Eddie for a great welcome to Boston. The apartment was great; clean and tidy and had everything we needed. The location is excellent for public transport and has plenty of eating options nearby.

It was within walking distance to lots of interesting places to eat, public transport, and Fenway!  Eddie was super nice, giving us suggestions of nearby restaurants.  I would definitely stay here again.  It's VERY quiet, and even though it's a lower level apartment, there was plenty of light coming from the two large windows.

The location near Fenway, Boylston Street, and Northeastern made it perfect for us. It is a quaint walking neighborhood. Directly next door is a parking garage if you need overnight space, and it was very reasonably priced for Boston. The apartment is quiet, the AC was wonderful since it was over 90 degrees. I would definitely stay again. Thanks so much!!"
2174476,58105172,2015-12-31,10778805,Paul,"Really enjoyed the place.  It was clean, minimal (no clutter!) and in a great upscale neighborhood surrounded by restaurants, hotels and near Fenway Park (home to our Red Sox).  The street was residential however and quite peaceful.  Nearby attraction is The Rose Garden and the Fenway Victory gardens within 5 minutes walk away.  The owner Alan was great to work with and his property manager Eddie showed up after dark to welcome me to the place.  Thanks again and best wishes for future bookings.  Tra and Paul"

The apartment was exactly what we needed, just a comfortable place to sleep and take care of basic needs. The bed was great; there's a sofa thing that folds down, but that's strictly for younger, more resilient folks. Excellent water pressure, wifi was just fine, . Everything as expected.

The property manager,Eddie,was fantastic to deal with. He was very friendly and cheerful and recommended some good local places to us and was quick to respond when we experienced a problem with our accommodations.

The house was perfectly located for our needs in Boston. A few blocks from Simmons,a few blocks from Fenway,lots of choices in walking distance for food and drink. Great coffee shop (The Pavement) couple blocks up,pizza,pasta and a liquor store open late and directly across the street. Came in handy one night!!,

13464674,98798620,2016-09-01,59748840,Malte,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
11498523,64741601,2016-03-07,29868930,Petra,Ricardo was very nice and flexible with the check in time which was super appreciated due to hitting lot of traffic on the way to Boston. Place was clean and bed very comfy! Would recommend to anyone who's coming to explore Boston!
11498523,65999787,2016-03-18,61264824,Ryan,"While we didn't get to meet, Ricardo was excellent, making sure everything was ready to go upon arrival.  He was readily accessible by phone if anything was needed.  The room was great for my short term need.  Ricardo was also accommodating with late check in, which was great.  The area was convenient to the Blue Line, just a short walk away."
11498523,67625673,2016-03-30,30705310,Daisy,"Although I didn't get to meet Ricardo during my stay, he was quick to respond and instructions to check in were very clear. There are french doors and a curtain that separate the room next door, that being said the walls are thin and you can hear conversations from the other room. My boyfriend and I didn't mind it, but other people may want to know. There was no body wash or shampoo even thought the listing says essentials. I didn't really mind since I brought my own anyways. The listing says private/entire home but I believe we shared the bathroom with other guests as well. Bed was very comfy! Studio was clean! Near the blue line & neighborhood was quiet. Would recommend!"
11498523,68481477,2016-04-05,57302343,Miki,"Ricardo was a great host. He prepared everything before arrival, and always answer call/text quickly. The apt is clean and simple, and it seemed linens in guest room looked pretty new. Even though there were some problems at the house, he tried the best to solve. The area is nice and quiet, only a few minutes walk from T station."
11498523,69113136,2016-04-09,35949251,Laurent-Philippe,Ricardo seems to be a nice guy.
However,the description stated it was the whole studio and it was only a room. Kitchen and bathroom are shared.,,,,
I had several allergies and I am sorry to say the studio was not clean.,,,,,
Furthermore,the separation between rooms is only a simple door with windows (fortunately with a curtain) and you can hear everything that other co-locators say or do. I did not had any good night to sleep.,,,,
I am sorry,but although the location is ok and close to the metro,"I can not recommend this studio in any way.\"",,,
11498523,70013390,2016-04-15,45919117,Nina,"Ricardo is a really nice guy and a super host!  :) He answers quickly through (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) and is very often in the hostel, so he can help immediately."
He did his job very well.,,,,,
The kitchen was the best equipped ever,there's everything that sb needs to cook.,,,,
The location is awesome! Just 3 mim to subway and 10 to downtown.,,,,,
"Thank you Ricardo!  ;)\"",,,,,
11498523,70553591,2016-04-18,21571308,Peter,Host was great with communication. Location was great and accommodations were perfectly adequate. Awesome location if you're trying to access Boston metro or have quick access to/from the airport.
11498523,72869396,2016-05-05,40435015,Rosy,"The neighborhood was nice, the downtown area of Boston is all of 5 mins away. Ricardo was very welcoming and always responded quickly to any messages sent. The room was nice and clean, as was the shared bathroom and kitchen area. You could here all the fellow roommates but we didn't find it bothersome. All in all a great place!"
11498523,73817399,2016-05-10,10982982,Erick,"I rented this room for a cousin who was meeting up with us for a couple of days while we stayed there for almost 2 weeks. This room actually had a huge closet so if you need to hang your clothes, this would be the room I would pick."
11498523,74144614,2016-05-13,14527228,Jonas,"Very close to the airport, good public transport connection, supermarket (Shaw's) not too far and of course great view."
On the other hand it's not fancy and quite small,the walls are thin as mentioned everywhere and in that particular room the covered glass door to the next room has about an inch room to the ground,which makes thin walls obsolete. But since everyone was respectful during our stay,that's not a real issue.,,
Haven't met Ricardo,"but he was very helpful via messages!\"",,,,
11498523,74908585,2016-05-17,41319485,Channy,The listing is just as it is described! Clean and cozy and comfortably located. Riccardo is also very prompt with his responses.
11498523,76036531,2016-05-24,61147593,Troy,"Had a great experience with Richardo, was very friendly and quick to email back.  Would recommend this listing for anyone who is looking to travel to Boston."
11498523,76541519,2016-05-28,37318164,Stefan,Small but cosy room with excellent connection to downtown Boston. I would definitely recommend it. :-)
11498523,77463587,2016-06-01,56387424,Steven,Nice Stay. Nice neighborhood. Ricardo always kept the place clean. Very close to trains and beautiful ocean view.

11498523,78098124,2016-06-05,13219332,Shannon,Ricardo's place was just what we needed for three people for a few nights. He was very helpful with booking as we needed two rooms for two different lengths of stay. His place isn't fancy but it was clean and it was great that we had access to the fridge because we purchased a lot of beer that needed to be kept cold to bring back with us. We saw a few other people during our stay but most of the other guests kept to themselves. Self check-in was a breeze and when we ran into Ricardo cleaning he was friendly and asked how we were doing.
We didn't use the T at all,"we just used Uber and no trip was really expensive ($15 or less) into Boston/Seaport area where we had an event. \"",,,,

11498523,86288244,2016-07-15,26681461,Nathan,"Check in was super easy, Ricardo sends you all the information you need. The building is near a subway station, which makes it easy to reach from the airport and to get to the city."
The room / hostel has all you need to stay a few days in Boston. It was clean,although the building is quite old and could use a renovation in some areas,especially the bathroom on the second floor.,,,
"All in all you get a good and uncomplicated accomodation for the price.\"",,,,,
11498523,86917347,2016-07-18,38966911,Grant,It was great! Hostel is close to the Maverick station and it's definitely a livable place
11498523,88969159,2016-07-26,18430418,Ollie,Ricardo's flat was really great. Perfect location (I recommend Eddy C's for a late night drink...) and really good and simple communication. We had such a good time in Boston and would definitely recommend his place.
11498523,89430596,2016-07-28,48818431,Landon,Everything was exactly as advertised.

House is only a few minutes walking from Maverick underground stop.,,,,,
Neighborhood was quite calm,"even if some noise originated from a close house under construction.\"",,,,

11498523,92034544,2016-08-07,6121546,Jackie,The location is great for those how don't have a car. We had our car and was able to parking it in the provided space and leave it there while we explored on foot. Train is so close and is connected to everything. Very clean and if there was AC we wouldn't want to leave. Thankfully there was a fan provided or it would of been too hot to sleep. I recommend staying here.
11498523,93113221,2016-08-11,83182081,Ankita,"The place was nice and the location was great too. Few minutes walk from blue line. The room was clean and the kitchen was convenient too. Ricardo was really nice, he accepted my request on the same day I booked to stay, in such short time. He had everything setup well, the check in and everything. Definitely recommend, especially for travelers."

11498523,95573656,2016-08-20,84227840,Olga,"Nuestra estancia en el apartamento ha sido muy agradable. Hemos estado muy cómodas, estaba todo muy limpio y la gente que se ha alojado en el resto de las habitaciones eran muy respetuosas, parecía como si tuviésemos el baño y la cocina para nosotras solas cuando lo hemos necesitado. Lo recomiendo 100%. Los padres de Ricardo son muy amables. Esta situado en un barrio tranquilo con metro que te lleva al Centro en una o dos paradas muy cortas. A las traseras del apartamento hay unas vistas maravillosas de Boston, un lugar privilegiado para contemplarlo de día y de noche y hacer preciosas fotos. Gracias a la familia por su hospitalidad y limpieza."

The building and the room was welcoming, clean and cozy, and just a few minute walk to a nearby subway station to get around. The bathrooms were clean and never had much of a wait despite being shared among other residents. A much appreciated fan was provided in the bedroom to combat hot nights, as stated in the description there is no AC.   The free parking right next to the building was also a plus.  I would definitely stay here again if in Boston for the price and no fuss arrangements!"
11498523,97479646,2016-08-27,78124071,Maddie,"Ricardo's place is very convenient and offers everything needed for a stay in Boston. I loved that it was so close to the Metro Blue line, and offered a full kitchen. Everything was very clear and easy!"

11498523,99564110,2016-09-05,80519757,Clare,"Ricardo's place does what it says on the tin. If you're looking for a cheap and cheerful place to get your head down and sleep off the jet-lag, which is super close to the airport, then this the spot for you. It is a typical hostel and no frills, with the usual delights of a shared bathroom - but clean and comfy. Ricardo is always busy cleaning! Everything was great re check in and the Maverick area is fine - lots of shops and cafes and a nice bakery on Maverick Sq. There's a lovely view nearby over to Boston downtown which was fab for the Labor Day fireworks. The glass doors between rooms referred to in other reviews have now been covered over with a mock mdf wall, which I think shows a good host listening to feedback. The only downer re room3 was that it is next to the kitchen and communal area so a bit noisy at times, but guests were generally respectful and my jetlag meant I would have slept through a disco. Thanks Ricardo for being a great host."
9549850,60092200,2016-01-18,53159721,Ed,"This apartment is so charming, beautiful and private. The bedroom is large and the high ceilings add to an airy feeling complemented by some beautiful artwork. The kitchen is part of a large open plan lounge space with a table and chairs, sofa and cable television. The brickwork and artwork again make the space feel welcoming and comfortable."
The stand up shower had a good flow and was always warm.,,,,,
On -street parking was easy and we found a space no problem. Access to the apartment is through a communal front door,the owner's living room and down private stairs - however we felt as if this access was as private as if entering through our own front door.,,,,
The house is a short walk from the Jamaica Plains high street with a number of local amenities.,,,,,
Gail was a wonderful,welcoming host,"she even set out some welcome treats for us!  We will definitely be returning when we come back to Boston.\"",,,
9549850,60350632,2016-01-22,1840728,Deborah,"\"From the very start, Gail was responsive and great at communicating with me about my arrival and asking if I needed anything once there.  She made me feel at home not only with her pleasant demeanor but also with the table setting of fruit, cheese and crackers, assortment of drink choices and an invitation to share coffee the next morning.  The bathroom was well stocked with all kinds of amenities one might need.  Additionally, Gail  left me a newspaper with information about local events and suggested places to eat.  Once she knew more about me, she recommended some local art exhibits that might be of interest.  I loved the relaxed, cozy decor of the house which echos the hosts heartfelt love of art and her commitment to multicultural sharing and social justice.  The apartment is very close to a Whole Foods store for all kinds of delicious and healthy food, and JP is a fun neighborhood with great restaurants, coffee shops and a \"\"cool\"\" vibe.  I would recommend letting Gail know ahead of time if there is something particular you might want or need on the day of your arrival before you have a chance to shop.   There is parking available on the street and I was always able to find a spot"
I am hoping to stay at Gail's place again-- warm,interesting host,good location and comfy,colorful,"artsy apartment!\"",
9549850,61917695,2016-02-09,33641881,Constance,We had a lovely experience with Gail in her downstairs apartment!  The photos show it exactly as it is. There is art everywhere!  My favorites are the little wire sculptures whimsically place in unexpected places to delight your eye.
Gail stayed in contact with us by phone and came out to meet us as we drove up to her home--even though it had been snowing and there was about 5 inches in the street!  She is a very warm and attentive hostess,but we hadcomplete privacy.,,,,
The sitting room has a little efficiency kitchen with stove/ oven,refrigerator,cute cabinets with an eclectic,artistic collection of dishes including handmade ceramic mugs,as well as wine glasses.,
The bed was very comfortable with plenty of cozy covers--we were there on a very cold weekend,but never felt the cold inside.,,,,

9549850,62743689,2016-02-16,41326284,Matthew,"Gail’s home was charming and adorable. The downstairs section we stayed in was spacious yet cozy. It included everything we needed - kitchen, dining area, daybed nook, bathroom with shower, and bedroom. Her home is just up the street from several quaint cafes and a Whole Foods, so dining was easily accessible. Gail was so sweet and made sure we were comfortable and happy - Thank you so much for letting us stay in your beautiful home!"
9549850,63632663,2016-02-25,21928460,Cuthbert,"I had a wonderful stay in Boston!  Gail is kind, friendly and helpful - picked and dropped me to the station, offered many tips on Boston and checked in without being intrusive at all.  The house is gorgeous and the basement apartment which I stayed in is spacious, peaceful and warm.  It's perfect for a single person or a couple.  The queen-size bed and duvet are extremely comfortable and perfect after a long day exploring Boston. It comes equipped with Wifi, TV, and a complete kitchen (oven, coffee maker, kettle, cutlery, crockery etc.), towels and bathroom necessities in case you don't bring your own. She went out of her way to have snacks and drinks available for me upon my arrival which was a nice touch."
The location is also very safe,quiet and nice - very close to the nice Cuban restaurant,El Oriental,Wholefoods etc. and a few minutes' walk to the Stony Brook station which is just about 10-15 minutes downtown. I had a great stay thanks to Gail and would definitely recommend her warm home when you are here. Thank you,"Gail!\"",
9549850,63812268,2016-02-27,28599995,Katy,"Gail was very warm and welcoming, she gave me plenty of recommendations for activities. The apartment was exactly as pictured and comfortable. The building itself was older than I had envisioned, so it's a little quirky, but not in a bad way. That's not a fault of the listing; for some reason I just had pictured the building being a bit newer. The bed was very comfortable, which is great because I only really used the apartment to sleep. The T station (Stony Brook) is a solid 10-15 minute walk away, which was fine. An Uber to/from the T station is only about $5; I used it when returning to the apartment at night because I was too cold/lazy to walk back after long days in Boston. From what I read on blogs and articles, I thought there would be more to do in Jamaica Plain, but there isn't much to do other than eat, and the section where most of the restaurants are about a 30 minute walk away. This isn't a big deal though since there's so much to do in Boston. Most of the things I wanted to do in Boston and Cambridge were about 30-45 minutes away via the T, which is super easy to use (I've never really used public transportation before). If you want a place that provides super quick and convenient to access Boston attractions and is in the middle of the action, this is not for you. However, if you want a comfortable place that allows you pretty easy access to Boston but is nice and quiet to return to, this is it. Over all Gail was great and the apartment was exactly as listed."
9549850,64095788,2016-02-29,26222644,Nicky,"Gail is a terrific host and a super cool person! The apartment is funky and cute featuring original artwork by Gail herself!  The bed is comfy and the neighborhood is lively. The apartment is right down the street from the brendan beehan pub, one of my favorite spots in JP.  It is an easy walk to the trained but we explored the area on foot mostly. We had a lovely stay and would definitely book again. Next time we will be sure to stay longer so we can take Gail out to lunch and continue our conversation about art, politics, and life."
9549850,64784744,2016-03-08,9453836,Anne Marie,"Gail was an amazing host who made us feel very at home in her house and the apartment. She was so kind and accommodating with us, even though we had to change the dates of our arrival and then arrived later than we had planned to. The apartment itself is wonderful, creative and very cozy and a place where one just feels at home right away and wishes for a longer stay.  The kitchen is well equipped, as is the bathroom. The bookshelves are full of interesting books. The apartment is just 5 min walk to the orange line (subway), and is very close to many restaurants and grocery stores. We had no trouble parking on the street, close to the house. I highly recommend this listing with no hesitation! One of the best experiences I have had to date with airbnb."
9549850,65094250,2016-03-10,17141621,Luba,"Gail is an amazing host! The downstairs apartment is exactly as described with huge variety of music CDs and interesting books! We loved every single detail of that place - from cozy living room on the first floor to the  bedroom with her own paintings and art on the walls! Gail was very helpful with information about Boston, she even printed out the directions to the train station for us. She also recommended lots of great restaurants in JP - we had great breakfast sandwiches at Sorella's, great cocktails at Frogmore, she also mentioned Tres Gatos, but unfortunately we didn't have chance to go! The place is 15 minutes drive away from downtown of Boston, with parking on the street right in front of the house. It is very quiet neighborhood - all you need after a long day in Boston. We had great experience and definitely will consider this lovely house for the next visit in Boston."

9549850,67574054,2016-03-30,15730045,Brittany,"Our short visit to Boston was wonderful for many reasons--and choosing to stay at Gail's was one of them. Gail was very warm and welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed. She gave us pointers on things to see and how to get around, and most importantly on where to eat in Jamaica Plain! The apartment itself was adorable, eclectic, private, and cozy. The neighborhood has a lot to offer--we didn't even travel elsewhere in Boston the day we arrived. We just explored JP. Gail's place is also in a very convenient location (and there's a great view of the skyline at night from her street!). I would most definitely stay here again, and recommend Gail's place to friends looking at a Boston trip."
9549850,68876477,2016-04-07,9142376,Tracy,"Loved our stay.  Neighbourhood was very nice.  Parking was easy and free for the entire 3 days.  Once parked, we did not need to move our vehicle.  Easy walk to the 'T' orange line for transportation into the big city.  Thanks Gail!"

Our only disappointment is that we didn't get much of an opportunity to chat with Gail, as she is a very interesting person.  Would definitely consider staying there again."
9549850,69538192,2016-04-11,18155774,Ashley,"Pros: Gail is very nice, and interesting. She left a pile of pamphlets pertaining to transportation and art events around the Boston area, along with drinks for our arrival. Lovely touch. The neighborhood seemed very safe, and walkable, with plenty of restaurants/bars within just a 5-10 minute walk. The Stonybrook T station is just a 10-minute walk in the other direction, so you can take the orange line downtown in less than 15-20 minutes. There's plenty of on-street parking close to the house. Good price for Boston."
Cons: The house is older,and this is a basement apartment. As such,it's a little rough around the edges with less than perfect finishes,and some quirks (chipping paint,exposed pipes,some odors
Overall,if you are looking for more of a hotel-quality experience in a unit with regards to cleanliness and aesthetic,this is not it. If you're looking for an inexpensive place with good access to public transit,and some quirky charm,"this is it. \"",
9549850,69794554,2016-04-13,62434810,Sasha,"Gail was a wonderful host and her apartment has to be the best hidden gem in all of Boston!  It is a very spacious downstairs apartment, beautifully furnished and full of character.  I was on my own and really enjoyed the space and layout but it would also be perfect for a couple or small family.  In addition there was ample street parking which is not something you find anywhere in Boston.  Gail was incredibly welcoming, warm and interesting.  I couldn't imagine a better place to stay for a visit in Boston!"

"Location is ve\"",,,,,
9549850,70698491,2016-04-19,54561788,Todd,Gail was a perfect host--from welcome to good-bye--and the apartment was an absolute gem!  It exceeded my expectations based on the pictures she provided.  The decor is eclectic but memorable.  Solid Wi-Fi connection.  The most comfortable bed I've ever slept in (really).  Gail provided helpful tips on getting around and made a point of inviting me to join her when she had guests.  The neighborhood is heavily gentrified and full of beautifully rehabbed Victorians.  Gail's house is only a 6 minute walk from the Orange Line train and less than 5 minutes from both a Whole Foods and a 7-Eleven...comfortable and convenient.
9549850,70843917,2016-04-21,62936977,Dawn,Great space! Exactly as described!
9549850,71267598,2016-04-24,10276235,Madeline,Gail was a wonderful host - she offered us a metro card that had some money on it and gave us great advice as to what places were best to eat in her neighborhood. I'm sure if we asked her more questions she would have had the answers! The apartment is just as cozy and clean as it looks and the location of Jamaica Plains is great and intriguing. If we ever travel to Boston again I would not hesitate to book this location again.
9549850,71531307,2016-04-26,56335397,McKenna,"Gail is an amazing hostess, and this apartment was perfect for our needs! The space is cozy and charming with beautiful artwork and plants throughout. The pictures accurately portray the space and there were no surprises. Although the entrance to the apartment is through Gail's first floor living room, it then leads down to a private set of stairs and apartment entrance. Don't let this shared entrance deter you, it feels very private and we felt comfortable that we were not a disturbance, even when returning late at night. The location is about a 15-20 minute ride from many of the tourist attractions in Boston and is easily accessed by bus or the T. Gail even provided us with cards to swipe in order to ride the public transit and this was a HUGE help! While not located directly in the center of Boston, there are many fun and interesting places in Jamaica Plain and lots of great places to eat. The apartment is on a very quiet street, which is a great relief after spending the day in the hustle and bustle of Boston. Overall, Gail is a perfect hostess who respects her guests' privacy, but is also extremely accessible to answer any questions, or make recommendations about local places to eat, etc. Communication with Gail was quick and easy before, during, and after our stay. Gail really seems to want to provide her guests with the best experience possible, and she definitely did that and so much more! I would definitely stay here again."
9549850,72827829,2016-05-04,49825619,Inés,"We felt extremely welcome at Gail's apartment during our visit in Boston, it really made a difference for us! It's a lovely place with everything you may need to feel comfortable and cozy, and we felt so at home with all of Gail's warmth as she saw that we had a wonderful time there. She helped us a lot, and we are really thankful to the excellent attention she provided."
We loved the quiet elegant neighborhood,and how by walking a few minutes you we had access to restaurants,trains,supermarkets,even amazon lockers!,
Highly recommended,"we would go back without a thought if we are around in Boston sometime again.\"",,,,
9549850,73234851,2016-05-07,31997170,Katie,"Gail's place was perfect for my parents' trip to Boston. She was a wonderful host and checking in was a breeze. The location is great, really close to public transportation and plenty of street parking. The apartment is pretty spacious and has everything you would need for a stay in Boston. My parents would definitely stay here again and I would recommend it to anyone looking for somewhere to stay!"

Location is beautiful , nice neighborhood with great vibe , very artsy. Her place was a walking distance to the T, and even other shops. Room was great too. This place will be first choice if I come back."
9549850,75457672,2016-05-21,6452808,Elizabeth,"As planned, Gail met us at her house and showed us to our apartment. It is as represented on her airbnb site, cozy and comfortable with everything we needed. Gail is a thoughtful, kind person and good communicator. She responded quickly to questions and was warm and friendly to us. We hope that we can stay at her house again."
9549850,76305599,2016-05-26,70053361,Yanilis,"Gail was an awesome host. She was very helpful and provided us with great reccomendations on how to spend our time in Boston. We loved her artisy home and hearing all about the very interesting pieces she had around her home. Our living area was perfect. We had all the privacy in the world in a cozy downstairs apartment with a kitchen, living room, bathroom, and bed room. Also she greeted us with a thoughtful gift. Definitely recommend this location for anyone who would like to visit Boston and stay in an area with amazing Latin American eats and friendly community. Gail was very accommodating."
9549850,76825479,2016-05-29,34968170,Haena,Gail is so kind! I loved staying at her house! The neighborhood is also beautiful! Great location!
9549850,77636379,2016-06-02,6213829,New,Very warm welcome including a cold beer on arrival and cozy apartment. Highly recommended.
9549850,78177710,2016-06-05,41507600,Theresa,"Gail was amazingly welcoming and helpful. I came into town to take in some sights and music and she recommended things that aligned with my interests.  Her home was cozy, clean and everything I look for when it comes to an Air BnB. If I'm ever back in town, I'll be sure to reserve with Gail again."
9549850,78692131,2016-06-08,1345952,Tina,"\"We arrived hours later than expected,due to airline delay .Gail was waiting for us  in the pouring rain,and she moved her car so we could park more easily.We received a smiling welcome and lovely wine,which we greatly appreciated.Gail's home is very cozy and decorated with exotic artifacts from her African (URL HIDDEN) is a very charming,interesting lady and we enjoyed our stay.She certainly deserves her title \"\"Superhost\"\" \""
9549850,79417079,2016-06-12,2908401,Jonathan,"We stayed with Gail during our short stay in Boston. As described, the apartment is in the basement of Gail's home. You enter through Gail's living area but this did not pose any problems. We had a good time but there were a few areas which made it less comfortable than other places that we have stayed in through Airbnb."
Good: A very warm welcome from Gail - conversation and a beer. Good location - easily connected to town centre with 10 minute walk to stony brook subway stop. We would recommend walking to stony brook over Jackson square as it was a nicer walk. Plenty of bars and cafes at the end of the street. Good wifi connection. Comfy bed. Gail provided a travel card which we could top up to use for public transport.,,,,,
Bad: Being a basement apartment,"there is not a lot of natural light in the rooms. This also led to us having several encounters with fairly large basement dwelling bugs - house centipedes - in the bathroom and bedroom. Not being fond of insects this led to us feeling a bit uncomfortable. The place was quirky and interestingly decorated but wasn't quite as clean as it could have been. \"",,,,
9549850,80375396,2016-06-17,5667373,Kathryn,"We only met Gail once, on our first night, but she was very sweet and helpful with narrowing down what to see for our short time in Boston. The location is near two metro stops so my friend and I were able to fit in a lot of sightseeing during our stay. We would definitely stay here again!"
9549850,80692332,2016-06-19,53468758,Martin,Incredibly interesting apartment and lovely host who provided excellent hospitality to two weary travellers!   Location is really  quiet but convenient for the T and is also close to really vibrant urban activities. Great
9549850,81391455,2016-06-22,4231114,Tina,Gail was an incredible host! We loved all her art and her hospitality. We would definately recommend a stay here.
9549850,82624074,2016-06-28,56569768,Jana,"When you enter  the apartment, you are astonished to see all the different objects of art in  the rooms and on the walls. Very eclectic and eccentric. Bur after a couple of days you get used to it and realise that you are in a harmonious surrounding that you will probably never find again elsewhere."
The sleeping room is spacious and has enough natural light,the living room/kitchen is a little dark (as announced). But Gail opened  for us the lower deck facing the garden! And it is also possible to sit upstairs on the upper deck when the weather is fine. We had our breakfast there every morning,in the sun and the shade of the trees with birds and squirrels around us.,,,
Kitchen and bathroom equipment are basic but OK; just bring your own shampoo and you won't miss anything.,,,,,
Gail is a great host. Everything was prepared when we arrived,local beer to greet us and lots of information about Boston,a Charlie card for the T. In the morning Gail left us her paper (Boston Globe) and one evening she prepared us a picnic (on the steps of ECA) with a beautiful view of the Boston harbour.,,,
There's a Whole Foods supermarket 2 minutes' walk  away from Gail's apartement and a Stop and shop a 5 minutes' walk away. The neighbourhood is full of restaurants.,,,,,
Bus 39 to downtown stops around the corner from Whole Foods and the Green metroo line has two stops max 10 minutes'walk from Gails House.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
9549850,82966899,2016-06-30,55937593,Kimberly,Wonderful place to stay in a wonderful neighborhood. Gail cared for us by bothering to arrange her schedule around ours to welcome us. She lent is a transit card and made sure we felt comfortable. The bed is comfortable and we spent hours relaxing in the sitting area. So many restaurants and stores nearby. We walked down Centre St to the lovely arboretum and ate Thai/Khmer food on the way. We hope to stay here again!
9549850,83394324,2016-07-02,45925509,Nicole,"The rooms were clean and very nice. Though Gail was not able to be there, she made sure someone would be able to greet us at our very late arrival. We had a wonderful time. The bed was very comfortable and it was very private. It's an easy walk to some good restaurants in town and a Whole Foods."
9549850,84180865,2016-07-05,61545384,Carolin,Gail was a very warmhearted host who did all she could to make us feel comfortable and at home. The place is very unique! We loved the artistic atmosphere.
"It was especially nice of her to let us store our suitcases for the rest of the day until we actually left Boston.\"",,,,,
9549850,84714882,2016-07-08,3792180,Richard,"Excellent communications before our stay with detailed, accurate descriptions of how to take public transit from the airport to the apartment. It's in a newish building, very nice design (exposed brick, etc.). The apartment is large and well laid out. It lacks a dining table, which means eating while sitting on the sofa (not a problem for my grandson and me). And, Gail left the A/C on so it was very comfortable when we arrived in the late afternoon! Much appreciated."
9549850,86243276,2016-07-15,1438415,Yvette,"\"This is a charming apartment with international art displayed throughout the flat that added a lot of charm.  We appreciated the info Gail left for us: on the \"\"T\"\" - the schedules"

9549850,86754707,2016-07-17,13423783,Samara,"Even though our stay was brief as was our contact with Gail, we felt like the apartment suited our needs for a weekend in Boston.    The apartment is very private even though you do have to walk through Gail's living room.  We were out pretty late and this was not a problem at all.  We used LYFT to ride back and forth downtown near Fenway park (about 10-15min) which is about $7 each way.  There is a T line a short walk from the apartment if needed.   Just down the road from the house is the main street with a variety of restaurants, grocery stores and a liquor store.  I recommend eating breakfast at Sorella's or Ula cafe.  Gail's apartment is perfect for a couple or single traveler."
9549850,89462118,2016-07-28,45714409,Stefan,It was nice to stay @ Gail's house. Seh is very friendly and kind. We had great conversation  with her. We would stay again.

9549850,92153196,2016-08-07,5109452,Patricia,Good location. We did not meet Gail as she was on vacation.
9549850,93713544,2016-08-13,60433773,Sam,"The apartment was perfect for our stay, minus the lack of air conditioning. That, however, was our fault because we should have read the description better. It was a few blocks away from the train which was nice, because we traveled downtown almost every day. We did not interact with Gail at all because she was gone, instead with her housemate. The only thing that we really disliked was having to ask for new towels every day because there were times we weren't able to catch her if it was too early or too late because we were too busy. Having wifi was nice, nothing else was needed because we weren't in the apartment but only to sleep. Gail kept dishes and pans in the apartment, which was great because we ate breakfast every day there before left. Overall the stay was nice, it was just unbearably hot at night."
9549850,94972855,2016-08-17,13632504,Abianco,"Gail è un'artista, la sua casa è piena di oggetti e manufatti. Come host è molto rispettosa della privacy. L'appartamento condivide l'entrata con la casa padronale, ma per il resto è completamente autonomo, separato da una porta con chiusura. La scala è la tipica scala dei film, un po' ripida e stretta. Due birre in fresco di un birrificio artigianale ci hanno accolto al nostro arrivo. L'appartamento ha tutto il necessario, non c'è aria condizionata ma ci sono due ventilatori che fanno il loro lavoro. Il letto (camera da letto in una vera stanza) è comodissimo e grande, non un semplice queen size. Il quartiere Jamaica Plain è singolare ma sicuro. Downtown Crossing dista circa 10 minuti di metropolitana. Una corsa in taxi da south station costa circa 17 dollari. C'è un grosso supermercato nei pressi di Jackson Square. L'appartamento di Gail ha un ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo."
4593974,59882829,2016-01-16,26973444,Jose Ignacio,"The house was in the middle of a quiet residential area in Roxbury, a classical American New England architecture neighborhood. My room was spacious with high ceiling and the apartment was clean and well-organized. Everything was just as described in the listing and Youtube videos. Two supermarkets and a small shopping area were just across the main street. It took less than 30 minutes to reach downtown on public transit. I used to walk to Jackson Square and it took me 15 minutes. A bus stop was within two minute walk and the buses came quite frequently, going to Dudley Station and Ruggles Station etc. Easy street parking was a huge plus for me. Other housemates were friendly and courteous. Many of them were in academia, particularly in the medical field, so there is a comfortable environment. I didn't get to meet all of them for a while until the host invited everyone for a dinner. They were mostly long-term. I totally recommend this house for its clean and safe environment and its easy commute to downtown. Huggy, the host, was really nice, responsible and helpful. He has enough experience as a host and can help you to get orientated in the city. Thank you Huggy and I wish you the best! Hope to see you again when I come back to Boston."
4593974,68311801,2016-04-04,53725686,Emily,I was a visiting medical student from Chicago and Huggy was a great landlord. He was there to help me move in and orient myself. The place was nice and parking was convenient. Roommates were easy going and were always quiet.

10945407,77826484,2016-06-03,4587669,Zane,"Andy was a great host. The check in process was very easy, as the key was available in a lockbox that was readily accessible. The house was very clean and surprisingly very spacious. We had no problems fitting nine people in the house. Though we did not cook, there seems to be an ample amount of cookware and dishes. Moreover, the house itself was gorgeous, and the couch and beds were all very comfortable. There were also extra linen and towels to accommodate our large amounts of guests. The only critiques that I have are that there was no hand soap in the bathrooms and there could have been an extra trash bin in the kitchen. The Wi-Fi also was not great, but this was not too much importance to us because we were out and about for most of our time in Boston. Otherwise, I fully recommend this house and Andy as a host."
10945407,78505454,2016-06-07,34017837,Rebekah,"Andy's apartment was overall clean and consistent with the description.  Andy was a great host, as the check-in & check-out procedures were very easy, and he also responded very quickly to an inquires I had.  The location was great for taking the T into Boston to explore the Freedom Trail and other sights.  The only critiques I have are: no hand soap or trashcans in the bathrooms and finding parking during weekdays.  Overall, our stay in Boston was good; this place was a great deal for our party of seven."

The apartment was well kept, clean and up to date. Great amount of space if you're staying in for the evening. The apartment was on the basement level and had street access with stairs, the perfect kind of place to visit Boston as it makes you feel like a local. Valerie was great! She laid out house rules, public transit map and suggestions on where to explore. We didn't have any issues, but she let us know she was available if we needed anything. The apt was on the way up a small hill, so a lot of walking of you're taking the train. However it was only about a 10-15 min walk and very enjoyable as there is much to see along the way. As her pictures show, the apt is in front of Fort Roxbury and has a small trail perfect for walking and running. It's a very unique park. I enjoyed my stay and the city! Thanks so much Valerie!"

She had food and beverages for us - which was lovely and unexpected: eggs, juice, bagels and cream cheese in the fridge; coffee, tea, & hot cocoa fixings, and a bowl of fresh tangerines! The neighborhood was great -beautiful, easy to find and so close to public transport. Rooms all as pictured in the photos. Maps, tourist pamphlets and information sheet on the apartment available to us. When a snowstorm was predicted during our stay she texted us to make sure we knew about it.

Everything is well thought out and prepared for comfortable staying, including snacks, maps, and useful information for guests. Valerie is a great host for people visiting Boston. Location is fine, only 10 minutes from T station \"\"Roxbury Crossing\"\" which is easily connected with the city center"
9694218,68869507,2016-04-07,8241749,Daniele,Valerie was there when we arrived and she led us to the apartment which is the basement of her house.
The apartment is spacious,clean and well organized. The fridge can be a bit noisy,but one has everything to cook and make coffee.,,,
and  tea.,,,,,
When it comes to sleeping,the bed is good,and when there are more than 2 people,Valerie has an air mattress(for 2 people),however it can be coldish and it deflates fast,it may be better to sleep on the sofas.
The house is in a residential area in a quiet street. This may explain why there does not seem to be groceries near by,so the best solution is to buy one's food downtown (and water can be drunk from the tap). The house is on top of a hill,which may be interesting to know for people with disabilities or walking problems,since it is a 15 mn walk to the subway,but is otherwise very easy.  From the subway it takes  20 mn to go downtown,so it is quite fast.
Now the only problem with the house is the noise coming from within. Sound proofing,as acknowledged by Valerie,is very bad,and so we can hear whatever Valerie's family is doing or saying (we can even hear the dogs walk); this can be quite problematic as our last day showed since they switched on a machine (?) at 10pm,then stopped it towards 1 am,to switch it on again at 6 am and it sounded as if an airplane engine was in the bedroom and even with earplugs and headphones on we could still hear it.
Thus being said,"Boston is a really beautiful town and Bostonians are really friendly and helpful people.\"",,,,

Although we were only there for a short time and never got to personally meet Val, she was always prompt in communicating directions with us, and answering our questions. The breakfast items in the fridge (bagels, eggs, cream cheese, butter, OJ, milk) saved us time searching for food in the morning and was very much appreciated! One of the nicest airbnb's we have stayed in, would definitely visit again!"
9694218,70627354,2016-04-19,46875410,Carlos,Valerie was an incredible host and her place was very neat and comfortable. She was really nice leaving us breakfast for the first day and lots of info to get to know the city and everything around. The neighborhood is nice with close access to the subway and parking space. We went there during the Boston marathon and value for money was really good.

We found the place was very pleasant,very well equipped with everything one may need for a short or long stay,and more.,,,
We felt very welcome and comfortable walking into a clean,very well organized and nicely decorated place,with great attention and care to all the little details that make a difference.,,,
It was one of the better experiences we had in ABNB places,if not the best.,,,,

9694218,73812253,2016-05-10,55983996,Lindsay,"Valerie and her husband were incredible hosts!  This was our first stay using AirBNB, and the bar could not have been set higher after staying here.  The apartment was very inviting, clean, beautiful, and perfect.  Valerie was awesome with communication - she quickly answered any questions we had.  She went above and beyond in the following ways: leaving breakfast food items for us, having fresh flowers on the snack bar, getting the sleeping areas ready for our late arrival, having lots of information and brochures about Boston handy (including a metro map), and giving us detailed instructions about using Wi-Fi, using the washer/dryer, etc."
"This is as good as it gets - we were very impressed!  We highly recommend staying here if you're in Boston!  Thank you so much for making our first AirBNB experience unforgettable!!  \"",,,,,
9694218,73928472,2016-05-11,13584908,Peggy,"Valerie met me at the door when I arrived, she was very flexible about scheduling.  Her place is clean and spacious and very well appointed.  She provided a lovely breakfast and coffee and thoughtful amenities.  Her family lives upstairs, which was helpful and not at all obtrusive.  And her neighborhood is fabulous, with a great historic park and homes, within minutes from the bus and subway."
9694218,74104408,2016-05-13,5439607,Jill,"My sisters and I had a really great time at Valerie's. She was very accommodating when we sprung an extra person on her at the last moment, she set up a large air bed in the living room. The rooms were comfortable and very clean. The locale was also great, within walking distance to the bus and the T. The Airbnb is in a very cool neighborhood too, quite a historic place. I would love to stay with Valerie when I visit Boston in the future."
9694218,74433737,2016-05-15,54404110,Katharine,Staying at Valerie's was perfect in every way.  Such a welcoming home.  I would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone.  I feel lucky to have found such an incredible place my first time using Airbnb.  Thank you for making my stay so memorable.
9694218,75558722,2016-05-22,17260989,Ashlye,"This was probably one of the most spacious Airbnb places we have stayed in. No wide angle lens have been used to enhance the size. What you see is what you get. However, what you don't see makes the place even more special. The food in the fridge, the bathroom toiletries, the range of books (including Make way for Ducklings!) and the great wifi. The apartment is in a good, quiet residential area and knowing our host was living above make the place feel more secure. We did get to meet Valerie and her lovely family, she very kindly looked after our luggage. If you are thinking of using this apartment, don't hesitate about it, just do it."
9694218,76616152,2016-05-28,1632151,Prahlad,The description of the apartment was very accurate.  Overall the apartment is very comfortable with all necessary amenities.   We were there last weekend for a graduation in Harvard.  It  was easy to commute to the university and get back for a good nights rest.
9694218,77367738,2016-05-31,52486045,Giulio,"Il soggiorno è stato ottimo! Valerie è stata accogliente e precisa in ogni comunicazione. La casa è accogliente e completa di tutto, esattamente come nelle foto; è un po' fuori dal centro della città ma il centro si raggiunge con poche fermate di metro. La stazione è a pochi minuti a piedi ma se si è carichi di bagagli all'arrivo/partenza è meglio scegliere un taxi/uber."
9694218,77684689,2016-06-02,61771656,Byungsoo,"Boston hostel is really good. As if this was about the illusion came to my house. Quiet, clean room is very good. Free use of washing machine was not even a great gift idea. May it always be your host family full of health and happiness."
9694218,77914528,2016-06-04,54872181,Sue,"What a wonderful experience.  Our flights were delayed so we arrived very late.  Val gave us all the information we needed to find our very comfortable beds and fall in.  Val had a bed all made up for our daughter who joined us.   She had bagels, eggs and juice in the frig, which was wonderful the next morning after a long day of travel.  The apartment was clean and very comfortable with beautiful flowers outside.  Parking was easy with a short walk to the subway.  We will be staying there everytime we visit our son in Boston.  It was perfect!"

The place is easy to find and easy to access with both car and public transport (10mins walk to the station). There's a pizza place in that station open til 2AM, btw."
Val&Ben&fam live upstairs,so it is technically really easy to contact them if you need to,but we found all necessary information was provided beforehand. Sometimes you will be able to hear them roam around up there,but this did not bother us in any way.,,
Val was kind enough to provide basic tools for a quick breakfast,which was perrrrfect for us arriving from a 11h flight straight to bed with jetlag in the morning. There was 4 of us,with need for 3 beds so Val's place suited us well. The weather during our stay was was really rainy,"so it did get a bit humid down there. \"",,

11201204,68135551,2016-04-02,60833746,Barry,Rented the apartment for my parents who were visitng me for a week. Gretchen was easily contactable by phone and collecting the package with keys etc was a breeze.
"Apartment was exactly as expected and in fantastic condition. Gretchen checked in numeeous times to ensure everything was ok. My parents loved their stay!\"",,,,,
11201204,71080130,2016-04-23,27597819,David,"\"The studio was all great.  Perfect location for getting around town for all the events surrounding marathon weekend.  Gretchen met us with a nice information packet. She called in the middle of our stay to check on us. My wife said to me, \"\"Let's see if we can stay here again next year\"\"  What bigger compliment can you get.  We loved our stay here. We kept commenting to each other on how comfortable the bed was. How often do you travel with a pinch of worry about the bed being just right.  We both slept great all 10 days.  We pinched ourselves several times on how lucky we were to stay here.  Thanks Gretchen.\""
11201204,76118119,2016-05-24,5216311,Jeffrey,"My family had come into town for about a week and Gretchen's place was a true life saver. Space is tight and Boston and this suite was an absolute gem. It was spacious, clean, modern, stylist, and very comfortable. The best part was that it was centrally located to all the major shopping, tourist attractions, and dining that my family was looking for! Check in and check out were very smooth, and while I didn't meet Gretchen in person, she and her staff were highly accommodating and reached out to see if we needed anything further! Will definitely recommend this to others in the future!"

Rental is small but PERFECT. It was bright,light and had EVERYTHING i could need (including a new Keurig coffeemaker ) and access to washer and dryer inside the building.,,,,
Further,rental  couldn't possibly be in a more convenient location ( walking distance to Fenway,Boylston,Newbury St.  and Cambridge). It is located in  Boston's most prestigious and walking friendly location (Back Bay),and there are small stores and restaurants on all sides of the rental.,
I couldnt think of even one thing that could be improved with this rental. Over-exceeded all of my expectations by an order of magnitude and for the graduation weekend i was there,it couldnt have been a better deal for the rental price!! Smaller hotel rooms in that area were running twice the price and lacked all the conveniences (rerigerator,microwave,kitchenette,private entrance),"that made the trip wonderful and cost-effective. \""

The hallway carpet leading into the studio was stained and dingy, but the studio apartment was nice and clean. The Back Bay Area has many places to eat and it is easy to walk anywhere to catch the sites or use the T."
11201204,90752007,2016-08-02,76737385,Dana,Great location in the Back Bay. This clean and comfortable studio suite was exactly like the pictures posted on Air BnB.

11201204,98081775,2016-08-29,1236129,Desiree,The pics are like the one in advertising! The apartment is small but cozy and with a lot of amenities. The area is very nice and central. Unfortunately the closest T station (Hynes) does not have elevators so you should go to Kenmore (but less than 10 minutes walking distance).
The only concern is about the doorphone,"it is not connected with the apartment and it is not easy to order delivery food.\"",,,,
14255219,91592030,2016-08-06,6785314,Kaitlyn,Hector's girlfriend was able to accommodate my arrival and let me into the place as soon as I got of of the plane in the morning. Hector was also very friendly. The doors have individual locks so I felt secure.

14255219,96424665,2016-08-22,86771240,Sara,I thoroughly enjoyed my (EMAIL HIDDEN)munication was a breeze and the room was very comfortable. I also loved how close it was to the subway.
14255219,97596636,2016-08-28,90791287,Amanda,"Hector was incredibly responsive via the AirBNB messenger. They provided water and popcorn for guests which I thought was a nice touch. It was soooo close to a T stop, which was perfect. The neighborhood itself doesn't have a lot going on, but it's really well connected, only about 10 minutes from downtown. The room has a window air conditioning unit so you can control your own room temp. Overall I was very pleased with my stay"
14255219,98122703,2016-08-29,35026327,Carla,"I didn't get the chance to meet Hector but his girlfriend, Sarah, was great!  I had pre-arranged to drop off my luggage very early Sunday morning after a red-eye flight but still felt bad ringing the door bell at 7:00am.  Sarah answered the door with a huge smile, led me upstairs, offered to let me take a shower before I headed out to have breakfast and explore and gave me a nice chilled bottle of water with keys to the main door."
She communicated with me on when the room was ready and was there to greet me again and give me the room key.  She had already turned on the room A/C as it was very warm that day and the rest of the apartment didn't seem to be air conditioned.    Every time I saw her she was cheerful,warm and welcoming but really wasn't around much.,,,,
The  location is just a couple blocks from the T in Eastie,one stop from the airport and 2 stops to State St.  There is road construction going on along the block that starts very early but certainly isn't Hector or Sarah's fault.  I didn't walk the area at night,choosing instead to use uber back from Fenway Park but it is a very quiet emerging neighborhood.  This is the perfect spot for a quick trip if you want to be close to the airport.  I was even able to leave my bag at the apartment until it was time to leave for my flight home thanks to Sarah's generosity.,,,
"Communication from the beginning was super fast and answered all my questions.  I would definitely stay here again.\"",,,,,
14255219,98352053,2016-08-30,14278737,Claudia,"Hector was very fast and accurat in responding to my questions about the room. I received clear information how to reach his place. It was also no problem to leave my luggage in the afternoon, as my flight suppose to be in the evening. Unfortunately, I was not able to enjoy this convienietly located room as my flights were cancelled and I was not able to arrive in Boston. I have book his place becouse it is situated close to the airport."

6596242,35020864,2015-06-14,34982997,Ellen,"\"My husband and I recently used airbnb for the first time.  We did not know quite what to expect.  We were delighted with the quick response of our contact. and the ease of booking.  Subsequently , we were delighted with the ease in which everything worked out:  picking up keys at the door from our smiling host, directions on how everything worked, etc.  The apartment location is perfect for exploring Boston on foot. It is 10 minutes to most of the central historical destinations via Chinatown. We loved the juxtaposition of the cultures!  And the size and décor of the apartment are very nice in an \"\"IKEA first apartment\"\" way....modern and comfortable but not over-exaggerated.  The apartment is high up and you get a nice sky view of Boston. The bed is very comfortable with a memory foam topper. The host was sweet in leaving a vase of fresh flowers in the living room.

6596242,69347700,2016-04-10,47650822,Kathrin,With two of my friends I spent a weekend in Boston. We stayed one night in Jings apartment. The apartment is very close to the center and we had everything we need. Also Jing gave us recommendations around the area.

Jing's apartment was a wonderful find! It's so close to so many wonderful Boston attractions. I was happy that so many restaurants, theaters and shops were within a good walking distance. It is located in downtown Boston, a very historical area. It's a great location for a history buff such as myself."
Jing's apartment was perfect! Not only was it immaculate,it was spacious and bright. It was a perfect place to retire after not only running the Marathon but also after doing some sightseeing! Taking the MBTA was very easy from his location as well. As I stated the proximity to other locations was wonderfully close!,,,,
Jing was a great host as well. He met me upon my arrival and gave me not only a great tour of the apartment but also recommended some great restaurants as well. He made me feel very welcome!,,,,,

6596242,78038470,2016-06-05,73262241,Nicole,Jing was an amazing host! Lots of communication prior to arrival and was even able to accommodate what became a very late check in.  He even had a candy bar for my son as a special treat.  He went above and beyond to make sure I had parking for the weekend and saved me a lot of money. Much appreciated by a mom on a budget.
The building is under construction so street access was difficult but the apartment itself was very quiet,"both night and day! It was everything we needed after a long evening of travel and a long day of sightseeing! We will definitely return and would recommended Jing and his apartment to friends and family! \"",,,,
6596242,80915486,2016-06-20,71214138,Gregory,Jing was a fantastic host and very responsive to communication. He was able to accommodate some unusual arrival and departure times with no difficulties. The apartment is centrally located - we were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to go - and it's just down the street from public transit as well. The apartment is very clean and well maintained. It's also very quiet; the building is currently under construction but we never heard a thing. This was our first Airbnb experience and it could not have been smoother. We'll definitely recommend Jing to any friends traveling to Boston.

Lee was a responsive host and replied quickly to any inquiries we had.  Check-in and check-out was also fully automated which made things much more convenient in terms of scheduling our day.,,,,,

We really appreciated his efforts!  The house description accurate and it was a great place to stay in Boston.  The location was great and we appreciated being in Chinatown next to great restaurants and within walking distance to Boston Commons, Newbury Street, etc.  The heating to the unit ended up not working, but he came by personally to check on it and give us extra blankets to keep warm.  Thankfully it wasn't too cold in the apartment and we were just fine."
7434871,50134448,2015-10-09,11565453,Laurent,"Lee is a really great host. The communication with him was perfect from our first contact on airbnb until our departure. We were 4 people and he prepared everything for us. We had 4 comfortable beds with all the furniture we needed. I had the chance to meet him when we left and he is very nice. The apartment is perfect and very well located in Boston, close to everything and only few minutes away from a Tube station. I will definitely stay there again for my next trip in Boston."

7434871,62703801,2016-02-16,28183441,Chelsea,We had a lovely stay Lee's!
We were in Boston for two weeks for work,and couldn't have asked for a better place to live. You are within walking distance to just about everything,and if there's something you can't get to it's a short uber ride away.  You are equipped with everything you'd need for a short or long stay. While we were there we had two requests and Lee was quick to respond and accommodate. Any time we had a question he was always quick to answer. No complaints here! We would definitely stay again and recommend to family and friends.,,,

7434871,65532463,2016-03-15,9296456,Sunny,"The place was as advertised: clean, simple, and in a central/safe location.  Being in Chinatown, there were lots of little restaurants in the immediate area (most of which only took cash).  It was about a 15 minute walk to Boston Commons, and about an ~$8 Uber ride to the North End. Lee was a super responsive to my messages, and the instructions for entering and exiting the building were clear."
One of my friends brought his car.  Street parking is limited,as mentioned in the property description.  Because of this,"we opted to work with the 3rd party mentioned in the listing description (a man named Ed) to find Off Street parking.  Cost was $30/day for a spot next to the building with a gate and lock. \"",,,

However we weren't aware that the apartment was in Chinatown,but it was merely me not having looked on the map:) But it was actually great (close to a nice Chinese bakery. Also a plus: Wholefoods a quick stroll away and the Train around the corner!),,,,

The host (Lee) was very friendly and immediately responded to all questions that I had.  We did not have any issues during our stay"

7434871,75305678,2016-05-20,6553964,Vickie,Lee was fairly responsive and clear with check-in/out times which was good. He also let us leave our bags at the place before check-in time which was super helpful as it meant we didn't need to carry our bags everywhere with us. The location of this place is really great & it seemed very safe too. It's walking distance from chinatown and so it was easy to get home late at night. The downsides would be the slow wifi and the stairs which we had to carry our luggages up and down.

7434871,78635891,2016-06-08,352244,James,Lee was a great host--kept us informed and was very responsive to questions I sent over. Place was pretty much exactly as described and as we expected. Only recommendation is to add an AC unit to the second upstairs bedroom--it was quite warm the night we were there. Would definitely stay here again!
7434871,79707913,2016-06-13,49020255,Chris,"The listing is accurate.  My family enjoyed staying in the neighborhood and I would recommend this place to others.  If you're afraid of stairs, don't bother."
7434871,80242287,2016-06-17,5471961,Andy,"Great location in walking distance to various landmarks, Chinatown restaurants, the Tufts orange line station, cab stands for those that don't use Uber and so on. The property is in decent condition for its age, with convenient electronic access advised by Lee shortly before arrival. It is located at the top of a narrow staircase and has its own internal staircase leading up to the two attic bedrooms. There is a third bedroom on the lower level, and a single bathroom for the apartment. The bedding was comfortable and everything generally worked fine including the air conditioning, although the wifi was unreliable at times."
7434871,80490522,2016-06-18,44532354,Victor,Lee's is the place if you enjoy access to Chinatown and (a bit further away) the Faneuil Hall area or the Common. The unit's also really close to South Station which is great for out of town visitors.
The unit itself is clean and comfortable. Not super high-end but everything is in working order,"the beds are good and we had a great time overall\"",,,,
7434871,81212975,2016-06-21,20493211,Tricia,"The apartment was in a good location and is just off the beaten path enough to guarantee a bit of quiet when you want it. The building is older and there is a walk-up, so it may not be for someone who can't climb stairs.  It is close to transit, which is a plus. It was fun being in Chinatown because the vibe is fun and the food around there is pretty great. Most of the rooms had air conditioning, which was good for us because it was pretty hot in Boston when we were there.  The check in process was easy and the apartment had everything we needed for a short stay."

Looking back I would probably only recommend 6 people, as 8 people sharing 4 beds and 1 bathroom was tough! The apartment was wonderfully located though, in a safe neighborhood and in close proximity to all the charms of Boston."
7434871,86972804,2016-07-18,83596737,Ignacio,Lee's place is very well located in Chinatown and is only about a 10 minute walk to the Boston Commons. The apartment is a little older but very clean and cozy. The beds are very comfortable. I would recommend this place for groups of 3 or more people.
7434871,87499887,2016-07-20,76824495,Luke,Exactly what we needed to attend a conference at the Courtyard Marriott on Tremont street. The place was easy to access and the beds were clean and comfortable. Great location.

The neighborhood is nice and quiet. The subway is very near and the theatres are within walking distance.,,,,,

It's uncomfortable, there is no decent air conditioning upstairs: it was so hot that our children did not get any sleep at all during our stay. We had to make them sleep on the couch in the living room... There are wires laying everywhere. The place was not clean: the handrail in the stairway is sticky , there were crumbs next to the beds, etc."

The apartment is a little bit different from the photo but it's not a big deal. The only suggestion to the host is to pay more attention to cleaning, the apartment is clean only superficially."
7434871,97774933,2016-08-28,39356996,Michael,"I think it was a bit expensive for what we received, but overall had a great experience with Lee's place. While the place was exactly what my group needed, I did think it was going to be a tad bit nicer.  The beds were EXTREMELY nice. I may have missed it, but some basic amenities like soap and shampoo for the shower would have been great.  The WiFi also dropped a lot, but we were not there to surf the web."

7434871,98548033,2016-08-31,6393097,Shannan,"We only stayed for one night. Decent location, was east enough for us to get around and get to Fenway. The house itself is very run down, there were holes everywhere and bits of the roof were coming apart.  But the house was relatively clean and served it's purpose for us. Was very hot in the room that didn't have air-con. Lee was very helpful though and was really accommodating to us so thanks so much for that!"

Host was very good about responding to email and made arrival a smooth experience.  That's where the positives end.  Overall, the place is very old and tired looking.  The Ikea furniture helps to make it look modern the place itself is a bit dilapidated.  Not as clean as it should be.  The kitchen sink was not clean and there was a dirty sponge lying on the bedroom night stand.  The toilet does not flush well.  No AC in one of the bedrooms upstairs so it got very hot.  Not worth the money paid.  I should have stayed at a hotel."

Rebecca's place is in such a great location that we messaged her to see if she might fit us in. She responded immediately, and we enjoyed an additional couple of days in the North End. Communication was friendly and immediate. I highly Recommend Rebecca's place for anyone needing a cozy and walkable location to all Boston has to offer, especially the awesome North End."

It was clean and she left little items that helped (shampoo, blow dryer, etc). Did I mention the location? :-) We already said we would be back....many times. Ps. There is parking right across the street if you have a rental car, that was super convenient. (I would add Ernestos and Bovas)"
13478348,95909240,2016-08-21,5423357,Tim,"Rebecca's place was super cute and just right for what we needed to really enjoy our first trip to Boston. It is right in the heart of the North End with plenty of great places to eat only steps away. Rebecca was out of town when we arrived, but her instructions for checking in were seamless and she was super helpful the several times we messaged her with questions. She was also great with recommendations on nearby places to eat or visit (on a particularly hot summer day, she helped us get into the aquarium and cool off!)  This place was a perfect fit since my 22 month old son could sleep in the nursery instead of in bed with my wife and me. We'd definitely recommend this place for anyone (but especially small families) traveling to the area."

The top most attic space is huge, finished, and can easily house 2 people.  The master bath shower is unbelievable.  The house is heated by radiant heat which is really nice compared to forced air."
The location worked great for us,as we were in town for the Boston marathon.  My husband took the subway to Boston common (just 10 mins to central downtown).  There are cool little shops just a few blocks away,but the location is tucked away enough that it's quiet.,,,

It was large, comfortable and warm.   The kitchen and dinning area was our favorite area, as we cooked in mostly.  It was large, with a good layout, with all the amenities of home.   We did not rent a car and found the T a short walk, maybe a half mile, to be safe, even at night.  We would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone wanting a comfortable home for an extended stay."
Thanks Carol  and Joe for sharing your wonderful  home.  We had a great time.,,,,,

The space was perfect for sleeping 8 and we had plenty of room to accommodate 12 for meals.  We were able to walk to Jamaica Pond due to the unseasonably warm weather and we were able to enjoy the screened in porch throughout our stay.  Pluses:  Fully-equipped kitchen, 2 full bathrooms, large gathering space, ample food storage areas, all of which made it so easy and comfortable for everyone.  We would definitely consider booking this again for next Christmas!"

The proximity to public transport was really beneficial for our party, as well as the access to a wonderful park just behind.  All members of our group loved the experience.  Might very well repeat next year."

The only real problem I had is that the air conditioner didn't work and it took a day to have a window unit installed. I also wish the unit had a normal chair with back support. The only place to sit down comfortably was the bed.

I most of all really loved the attention to detail in the home. Every amenity in the kitchen and bathroom you could think of, plus more! The home was just finishing up its renovation when I arrived. However it does not change my opinion, I'm sure once all the final details are put in, it will be even greater! Thanks for awesome experience!"
8388481,51582491,2015-10-21,41115214,Ashley,"The photos and description of the property are accurate - this place is a great find!  The room was incredibly clean and well appointed, with a bed, nightstand, deck, comfy desk chair, and clean linens.  The kitchen is well equipped with coffee pot, microwave, plates and silverware, and all the small kitchen tools you need to get you through a few meals.  The bathroom is spotless, and the heat throughout the house works well (a necessity for colder Boston weather) - plus, everything is new.  Each room has its own key and in-closet safe so you know it's secure."
The property is a bit further from downtown,but a quick Uber ride to Harvard Square and walking distance to a bus that connects to public transit,as well as a few restaurants and a grocery.,,,
Unlike other AirBNB rooms,you don't have to deal with permanent tenants here - it's much closer to a true hotel experience,with a cleaning staff that is on-call and right up the road if anything is out of order.  Overall,"a great experience for the price - I've already booked another stay! \"",,

Todd even put a travel size tube of toothpaste and mouthwash on the bedside table.

I loved it,that the bus and train station were not far away (only 20 min. to Downtown) the Wifi connection was continual good,I could washed my clothes in the basement and that we had our own fridge and microwave.,,,

1602491,8316772,2013-10-25,1960611,Hanneke,"AREA- Couldn't find a room in the neighborhoods that were recommended to me and then booked this room in Roxbury. Got a few surprised and worried looks from people that live in Boston, since the area has had such a bad reputation; a decade ago you just didn't go there unless you got lost. But it's upcoming for sure and right next to the neigborhoods that were recommended to me. So dare to cross the line from hip& fancy Backbay and be open to this nice neighborhood with rough edges."
ROOM- Loved this spacious room in a house with character. I worked at my computer in the evenings (wifi available and fast) and really enjoyed the atmosphere.,,,,,
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION- was great. No need to plan ahead: busses to and fro the  South Station and the airport are running frequently. And within 15-20 minutes you'll walk to fancy restaurants in Backbay or to the fine arts museum in another erea closeby. Also the public transportation in general is easy in Boston.,,,,,
"OVERALL: I would recommend this room and wouldn't hesitate to book it again next time around. \"",,,,,

The neighborhood demands a bit of street sense and common sense,but it's fine. The Silver Line provides direct access to downtown and a free ride from the airport. It's a bus pretending to be a subway,but it's clean,comfortable and runs frequently.,,

First,the place was easy to find and the self check-in was easy. Mekkin's home is really welcoming,beautiful and big !,,,
The neighborhood is fine,and we felt secure,"even if it's not directly downtown Boston. The bus stop is 2 steps away and a big bus station is located at a 5 minutes walk (where you can easily buy the \"\"CharlieCard\"\" for bus and metro). Since the weather was beautiful",we could also walk to the Roxbury Crossing metro station and were downtown in 15 minutes.,,
We saw our hosts only a handful of times,and they were really nice. We had access to a small fridge right next to our room and the commodities (ustensils and plates) so we could eat at the house. The room is big and convenient.,,,,
Since the weather was really hot and humid in Boston,it was a bit hot in our room but we could sleep with 3 windows opened.,,,,
Overall,we would go back anytime at Mekkin's place for a nice stay in Boston ! :),,,,

1602491,20782631,2014-10-05,21645647,Cate,"The listing was accurate. Just for reference, its a black neighborhood which worked fine for me because I'm black. I was chilly but I think that's because I'm from a place where its humid 10 months out of the year. If you have bad knees, which I do when it rains, the steps are going to be a problem because its the only way you'll get to the bathroom. The bed was comfortable but really loud. I didn't see Mekkin except for about 10 minutes the first night there. She's very friendly and the dog is super sweet! I kept to myself most of the time, so this wasn't a problem but I would've liked to see her in person before I left. If you're not staying more than 1 or 2 nights, the area is fine. There's a Bank of America and bus depot about a quarter of a mile away, a hair salon at the top of the street and Marshall's in the opposite direction."

1602491,33525413,2015-05-29,9431470,Geoff,I felt very welcome and the bed and all amenities are comfortable - they have really done a super job with the remodeling work. The third floor functions like a shotgun floor layout north to south with a  deck off the back. When a nice breeze blows in the evening it does good job cooling down the bedroom after dark. There were other guests staying there at the time but the house was quiet and didn't feel crowded at all.
The Silver Line 4 and 5 stops are at Dudley Square,which is a 10 minute walk away,"and then a short 15 minute ride to the more touristy areas of the city. This Roxbury neighborhood is in gentrification mode; if I were out late I probably would have taken a taxi to the house rather than walk from the Dudley stop. \"",,,

1602491,48616941,2015-09-27,31526845,Roya,"On the positive, Mekkin was very responsive which was helpful for the booking and checking in process. The room was accurate to the pictures and description. The bed was very comfortable. On the negative, it was not clear to me during the booking process that other rooms in this house are rented out, and therefore that other guests are present during the stay. Mekkin informed me of this once booked though. Having to share a bathroom with three women who were also staying in the house was a problem - we waited an hour on Saturday night to use it and finally had to ask them if we could as we were made running late by this point. Whilst the neighbourhood is not far from the action, I did not feel safe there and did not like the area it was in. When we entered the house the patio door opposite our room was wide open despite the fact no one was home. I didn't feel comfortable leaving my belongings in a house where doors are left wide open and there are other guests there who I have no idea about and no locks on doors. Overall I felt this was expensive for what it was."

The email ended up in my Junk file with a squllion others.) So we didn't know how to get in. Tried ringing several times,only to get an answering machine,left several messages with no reply. Finally posed message on AirbandB,and got a quick reply from RahSheik. All sorted then,shit happens. But we where getting concerned,it was getting late dark and cold
1340290,9081156,2013-12-05,9722296,Alex,"I would NOT RECOMMEND staying at this accommodation. This apartment is a one bedroom apartment that the owner has made into accommodating two persons by putting up a bamboo screen in the lounge room to create a false second room which she stays in. Naturally there is no sound privacy and it is ridiculously cosy. The second bedroom which I stayed in has an open window to a study which has an open walkway into the (URL HIDDEN) there is no sound privacy in the bedroom either. This means you hear phone calls, and well...pretty much everything. The worst part of my experience staying here was that I was duped for $658. I needed to leave earlier than I had booked for. The owner agreed that I could leave early and verbally said they would cancel the airbnb reservation. Two days after I left, I was charged a further payment for the remainder of my original reservation as the owner had not cancelled my booking. When I asked what was going on she evidently had changed her mind and decided that she would keep the money ... going back on our agreement. This really screwed my travel plans. I was shocked that she would do this and in speaking to AirBnB numerous times, there was nothing that could be done other to request the money back, which she refused. I thought I would be blatantly honest about my whole experience so that no-one need go through the same ordeal. There are plenty of nice, honest and trustworthy people out there, but this owner is not one of them. Take my advice and look elsewhere for accommodation in Boston."

8780440,53939470,2015-11-14,48017720,Holly,"This apartment in Boston (Cambridge) is pretty small.  We were a family of four and for that number, I wouldn't choose it again.  The internet connection and tv get a very weak connection.  I never spoke with Paul.  I spoke with his partner Cama.  She was nice enough.  If you plan on cooking for meals, this is a really hard place to do it since the oven did not work and there's no hood for the range, so it gets quite smoky.  We had to open all the windows and doors.  We also never could figure out the thermostat snd had to leave the windows open at night to sleep because it was really hot in there.... In November.  The shower was good.  I think it was a fairly safe area and building.  I do think it's priced a little high for what it is.  I think it's more realistic for a single person or couple."

The beds were small but mostly comfortable. Our son slept on the pull-out couch and didn't have any complaints. The heat is radiator,and we turned them completely off to cool the place. We even opened the kitchen door frequently. Maybe the heat rose up from the 1st floor.  The did have fans though,which helped.,,,
The unit is a little cramped and takes time to adjust,but we were comfortable. I would recommend it to a couple or a family with small kids.,,,,
Great location! Near food and the T to downtown. Completely safe neighborhood. Moogy's is a cool restaurant. We stayed for the Boston Marathon,and this was very close to mile 21/22 on the route,which was convenient.  If we are in town again,"we would definitely stay here again.\"",,

8780440,94505549,2016-08-16,38372663,Ellen,Kama ensured we knew how to access the apartment and accommodated our late check in. Apartment was fully stocked with extra towels and sheets which was lovely. Snacks and refreshments were provided too. Overall we had a great stay and would highly recommend this property.
8780440,97243309,2016-08-26,52344669,Ljubitza,My parents had a wonderful stay in this house! Kama was always available for any immediate request and that made me feel relieved. I liked that the house had a Bostonian style and it was all neat and nice with the new painting and everything. I would recommend this house for 2 people so to feel comfortable and enjoy the different spaces the house has.
4484747,22627113,2014-11-10,4996275,Atsumi,"The owner really welcomed me, and nice of her that she introduced me to other Airbnb users at the building. I could make a very good friend there. Bathroom is the only concern to stay there."
4484747,31964780,2015-05-12,27296298,X,"Overall an ok place for a short stay. Host is very responsive, room is clean, full kitchen, quick access to T station. Would be nicer if provide towel/washer/dryer."
4484747,33544988,2015-05-29,3751402,Henry,"Orchid was helpful in communicating to make sure I got to the place and could be let in. The apartment is very convenient -- a very short walk to the Red Line. The room was simple and basic. There is no AC or fan, but fortunately the weather wasn't too bad. The apartment could have been cleaner (the room had a lot of dust and such on the floor) but I think the location and price made it worth it."
4484747,43838367,2015-08-22,40742691,Frank,"\"Orchid present when I arrived, and very helpful in orienting me to AirBnB and to Boston.  Great location right by JFK/UMass stop on Red Line.  Apartment had all the necessary amenities, but stuck me as a college off-campus apartment in appearance.  Bathroom is shared by up to 4 tenants (can be issue in the morning hours).  The bed size is Full, and so not the most comfortable for large people (at 6'2\"\" I had my feet right at the end).  Hangers"
4484747,44724969,2015-08-28,42051067,Tyler,"\"All I can say is that it was ok.  I received rude texts from the host who gave me an hour-long window in which I could check-in (not their stated policy) and which I couldn't make because I was working.  Then they were late and \"\"on their way\"\" for about 20 minutes."
"The apartment was in poor shape in a low-rent neighborhood.  And don't forget to bring your own towel.  This guy is basically operating an overpriced hostel out of a crappy building.  \"",,,,,
8227206,46670812,2015-09-12,831572,Rupert,"Alexa was great. I arrived a little late, but she wasn't fazed. She met me at the apartment, and showed me round."
But,there was a little hitch,after she'd gone it turned out there was a problem with the lock and I was locked out. Alexa was GREAT. She came back immediately. Called a locksmith,and sent me to the pub (with beer money). It all worked out fine. Top crisis skills.,,
Amazing location.,,,,,
Lovely,"lovely space. \"",,,,
8227206,47307471,2015-09-17,42978571,Bill,Reserved the North End sunny one bedroom studio for a short three night trip to Boston.  My friend had never been; I had been there once before.  Alexa made us feel very welcome by having some breakfast (B&B style) ready for us in the morning; as we came in on a late flight.
The apartment was as described; small (we were a couple; more than three adults might be crowded up there).  If you are a bigger person over six feet,you are going to have to negotiate the bathroom,but the shower/hot water/facilities work great.  I have no idea how Alexa got that comfortable King bed in there but it works!,,,
The apartment is small but is in a building oozing of character in what many consider the best part of Boston; YOU'RE RIGHT THERE.,,,,,
Less than five minutes walk to the Subway (take you to the Freedom Trail and the rest of Boston); and bout a 7-10 minute walk to Hanover Street (incredible food/drinks/pastries).   The location was absolutely perfect.  Should we visit  Boston again,we hope Alexa will accept us again.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
8227206,47836790,2015-09-21,43720553,David (Wooyong),Our stay at Alexa's apartment was perfect. I was visiting my wife who studies in Boston and looking for a comfortable place to stay. Alexa's apartment is located in a terrific area. Most tourist attractions and popular restaurants are within walking distance. The interior decor was modern and clean. Alexa was responsive when we text-messaged to confirm check-in and check-out. Thank you Alexa.
8227206,48221965,2015-09-24,9233634,Andrea,"Great appartment, great location, great host"
8227206,48584556,2015-09-27,40886066,Alexander,"This was my first experience with Airbnb. I was generally optimistic, though somewhat skeptical when I first sent the reservation request. As soon as I heard back from Alexa, which didn't take long at all, all skepticism was pushed aside. Each detail and every question I had was promptly attended to before I ever left home. When my train pulled into Boston, I felt like I was arriving in a place I was familiar with thanks to the notes she typed up about the North End. No issues arrose, but if they had I have no doubt Alexa would have tended to them swiftly. The home itself is beautiful, bright, and charming. I'm fairly certain her bed is in fact a cloud. It is the most comfortable thing I have ever slept in. The kitchen had every tool we would need. I will without a doubt book my next trip to Boston around the availability of this home."
8227206,49165457,2015-10-01,44525437,Patrick,"Alexa was a wonderful, communicative host with a vested interest in making my and my girlfriend's stay comfortable and personal. The North End is a beautiful area in Boston and a true, throwback neighborhood. We enjoyed the local bars and restaurants, the quaint side streets, and Alex's cozy apartment."
8227206,50098843,2015-10-09,21466068,Paul,Alexa's apartment in North End was in a really great location.  We spent mid week there and was able to walk about all the city fairly easily.  Check in and check out was easy while the apartment was as described in her description.  Will definitely be looking her back up when we go back!!  Thanks Alexa
8227206,50489064,2015-10-12,43135863,Noah,"We had a terrific time in Boston and were incredibly happy with out first experience with Airbnb. Alexa's apartment is in an awesome neighborhood and an awesome building. The architecture was really cool and when we walked in the door and found a beautiful home to stay at we knew we were in for a good trip. It felt like staying at your cousin's house, not a stranger's."
8227206,51200336,2015-10-18,43126435,Jillian,"Alexa was a wonderful host! This was our first AirBnB experience and we could not have had a better introduction! The apartment was adorable and had everything we needed...a big comfy bed, living room with tv, bathroom, kitchen, and closet. Alexa even left us delicious local coffee and beer, a few toiletries, and a long list of recommendations! The apartment was super clean and smelled fantastic when we arrived. Alexa spent a few minutes with us to give us a tour and make sure we had everything we needed before she left. The apartment was in a great location! There were tons of restaurants, coffee shops and bakeries in the area. I wish there was more time in the day so we could have enjoyed more of the fantastic Boston food! Can't wait to go back! :)"
8227206,51784697,2015-10-24,1779543,Rick,"This is a great place in one of the most interesting neighborhoods in Boston. The apartment was very clean, nicely decorated and right in the heart of many things to do. The booking process was seamless as was the checkin and communication prior to and during my stay. I would love to stay here again."
8227206,51913608,2015-10-25,42859545,Christian,"\"This was our first time using Airbnb so we were not setting any unrealistic expectations. However we also were not expecting to be completely mistreated by the host. The apartment was perfect nothing to complain about there and the location was central and perfect close to day and night life, but the owner was very rude to us after we left the apartment. First she was late to let us in. We waited for about 10 minutes in the front door. She seemed very welcoming once we were inside giving us the run down of the neighborhood. On our last day we had to leave to go to the airport. Check out was at 11 so it was perfect. However at 11 the host said she would be there in 30 minutes. Since we needed to catch a flight she told us to put the key somewhere. As we were ready to leave is when she started giving us things to do. Strip the bed and put all the sheets in the hamper, in addition to the towels. In a hurry we did all that she asked and left. One hour later at the airport is when we started being bombarded with text messages. She was complaining that we did not leave the Charlie pass, that we did not properly strip the bed, that the garbage was left, and that food was left in the kitchen sink. She had the audacity to charge us $75 for all these \"\"extra things she would have to do\"\". I am beyond disappointed with how she treated us. The Charlie card only had $2.60 on it"
8227206,52588150,2015-10-31,8442820,Katherine,The apartment was as described and a great find. We had a wonderful time and Alexa provided us with so many extras!
8227206,67143421,2016-03-27,24354821,Veronica,The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8227206,77344549,2016-05-31,52922849,John,Alexa was very accomodating and everything was just as described. She really went above and beyond. It's a very nice apartment in a great location.
8227206,80612226,2016-06-19,20785070,Geoffrey,"Alexa was spot on.  Our flight was delayed but she waited patiently till quite late and welcomed us.  All communication, follow up and assistance was excellent.  The apartment has great style, the location is great, the North End feels very genuine still and people were friendly and welcoming.  Monica's deli and Cafe Victoria were fabulous.  Even got to know the lady at the coin laundry.  You are close to the city and key sights and facilities.  This place is everything Airbnb should be.  You don't just go there, you live there for a little window of time.  We will recommend Alexa's to our friends and family."
8227206,85429618,2016-07-11,2795112,Jose,Alexa was a terrific host.
She welcomed us and provided great information about the neighborhood including sights,restaurants,and history.,,,
The place was really fun,furnished artfully,and practical.,,,
We also loved being in the North End.,,,,,
"We'll be back.\"",,,,,
8227206,87690943,2016-07-21,44764425,Patrick,"Alexa was an awesome host and provided a great spot for me to stay while in Boston. The apartment is spotless and lives up to her description exactly. The delicious cold brew coffee provided was helpful getting started on a hot day. Also, the apartment is in a great neighborhood with a ton going on. Very walkable to cafes, restaurants, and bars. Will certainly try to book again the next time I'm visiting Boston."

11695285,81566128,2016-06-23,32200827,Michael,"Kate’s 2 bedroom apartment is nice.   As the name suggests, it appears all the rooms have been recently renovated.    Beds were comfortable.    It was clean and conveniently located to the T (train/subway) and the airport.    The apartment is separated from the Airport T station on the blue line by a narrow park and 4 city blocks.  There is an exterior door to the building containing 3 apartments, one on each floor, with Kate’s apartment on the 3rd floor."
Never heard or saw the neighbors below.   Minimal street noise.    The neighborhood isn’t upscale,but we felt safe.,,,,
The available TV channels were limited if that’s important to you.,,,,,
Kate was very accommodating and responsive to my many questions.,,,,,
Would stay there again.,,,,,

11695285,84014313,2016-07-05,17498237,Sally,"Great apartment - clean, comfortable and about an $7-11 Uber ride into the heart of Boston.  Kate left detailed instructions prior to and upon arrival and proactively reached out about preferences.  We were two couples travelling so the 2 bedroom was perfect.  There was ample street parking for our car, but we opted for Uber more often so we didn't have to worry about parking in Boston which can be a challenge.  Kate's apt served as a great stay for a weekend stint in Boston!"
11695285,88433233,2016-07-24,8762263,Barbara,Convenient location from downtown Boston. Very comfortable and homey feel. Kate was great and accommodating. Would stay again

189965,463662,2011-08-21,945118,Arnab,"Atef is an exceptional human being and I am very happy that I met him. The room is very spacious, clean, tidy and gets a lot of light. The bed and the bathroom beat 5-star hotels. Trust me! The house is in a very friendly neighborhood, close to everything a tourist or newcomer to the city can ask for. Lastly, I cannot express in words how approachable and insightful Atef is. I made a great choice!"
189965,485212,2011-08-29,118754,Felix,HIghly recommendable!
Atef is a really nice guy,offering a nice,clean and large room above the roofs of Charlestown. Everything is very clean and comfortable.,,,
The house is situated in a beautiful street below Bunker Hill Monument. It's a twenty minute walk away from downtown and a five minute walk away from the next T-Stop.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
189965,569464,2011-09-26,719179,Erik,"Mr. Aziz is an impeccable host, and was waiting for me when I arrived.  Everything in his place is spotless, comfortable, and done in good taste.  What you don't see on the listing is the neighborhood he is in:  all lamp-it very old row houses of the most historic part of Boston, like stepping back a century or two in time.  Although there are big freeways only blocks away, the neighborhood itself and Mr. Aziz' house are completely quiet, and a wonderful sanctuary from the noise of the city.  I was able to get around entirely by public transportation from here, using the MTA Community College station, which is about a 10 minute walk away.  The bed in the apartment is very comfortable, and the stone-tiled bathroom is a lavish extra for an apartment this size - I loved the multi-headed shower.  There is a good view out the bedroom window, a powerful ceiling fan, a good functional fridge, all adding up to a very pleasant stay.  I felt quite pampered being there."
189965,581493,2011-09-29,1118532,Liza,"Amazing! More than we expected! Everything is so nice: host, the house, the city! We had a wonderful time and Attef was very helpful and supportive.  We would go back again without doubts!!!!"

His house is in an ideal quite spot within walking distance of downtown Boston and a number of good restaurants which he recommended.,,,,,

189965,633098,2011-10-16,1217773,John,"Pleasant, cultured, unobtrusive host. Large spotless elegantly furnished room. Convenient quiet location. Helpful information on travel and eating establishments. Highly recommended."

It also close to convenience stores and everything. Atef is very helpful host. He gave me very good information about the city and some interesting places to visit outside of Boston. I would stay here again."
189965,653368,2011-10-22,1284813,Michelle,Seldom have I received so much value in a hotel stay!
After a draining day of attending a conference,"I felt like I was \"\"coming home\"\". The room is huge",spotless and impeccably well maintained,with an infusion of Old World European elegance in the decor. I looked forward to my morning shower in the oversized tiled shower. Tons of natural light poured in from the overhead skylight and window (both right inside the shower!),and I felt refreshed from breathing in fresh autumn air and by water coming down like rain from the overhead rain shower and 2 other shower heads. The linens and pillows were hotel quality – the kind where you feel like you are sliding into pure luxury.,
But what really made the trip memorable was the host of this wonderful place. Prior to arriving,Atef provided detailed information to make it easy for even the most novice of travellers to get around. His attention to detail is all focused around making his guests as welcomed and comfortable as he possibly can. He provides an element of worldly polish and professionalism through his demeanor and heartfelt understanding of what it means to “be of service” to his guests. He was unobtrusive,not unavailable.  I really got the feeling he understands people have many options of where to stay. He genuinely cares about his guests’ comfort and values them for the choice they made to stay at his establishment.,,,
"\"",,,,,
189965,689592,2011-11-03,409423,Gwen,"Atef is very thoughtful and considerate and can recommend places and restaurants to visit. The third floor room is wonderful, very serene and peaceful with a fireplace and excellent window views. The neighborhood is historical and beautiful. You are one of the best airbnb hosts Atef."
189965,700949,2011-11-07,1162731,Martin,"We had a wonderful stay in Boston and lovely Charlestown. The room is spacious and beautifully decorated, with a very large and newly renovated bathroom. Our host was tremendously kind and helpful and we are pleased to recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston and looking for comfortable and stylish accommodation in this picturesque, historical neighbourhood, close to the city centre."
189965,718653,2011-11-14,1366622,Julie,"Atef was a great host!  I was in a bind as had someone over-book me originally for staying in Boston and he helped me so much last minute.  I stayed in the 3rd floor room with bathroom and it was such an amazing deal!  Luxurious accomodations with beautiful art, fireplace, great windows and cute view and the AMAZING bathroom!  The multiple shower heads and heated floors were amazing."
Atef even met me very early for a check-in at 9 a.m. as I had taken a red-eye flight.  Perfect directions and assistance for getting to and from airport (much more than you'd ever get from a hotel) and the neighborhood is safe,fun and beautiful.  My visiting friend even found reasonably close and free parking over the weekend.,,,,
There is all you could want in walking distance too - restaurants,pubs,coffee shops,shopping,massage,spas
"Would definitely come back!\"",,,,,
189965,791460,2011-12-18,1442878,Selena,"Lovely, luxurious space and delightful, informative, considerate host. The location was ideal, the neighborhood safe, charming and close to everything. Highest possible recomendation."
189965,4199133,2013-04-17,5797968,Jamie,"Atef was a fantastic, considerate, passionate, informative host. The beautiful room was immaculately clean, spacious and the bed provided for some of the best sleeps in three months traveling. Charlestown is a lovely neighborhood, and provides a great location to other areas of the city and close enough to walk almost anywhere. Not 'if,' but when i return to Boston, I'll certainly be in touch with Atef."
189965,7018184,2013-09-03,7786840,Kate,"What a treat it was staying at Atef's place! Gorgeous historic home literally 50 metres from the Bunker Hill monument and a nice 15 min walk to town with a handy shopping centre 5 minutes walk away. The photos of Atef's airbnb room don't really do it justice- the room is better than the photos and the bathroom is luxurious better than most hotels. Atef has great taste and has created a very comfortable haven for a traveller. In a months stay in the States- this was my favourite airbnb stay. My only regret was I was so busy seeing wonderful Boston sights and Atef was busy too, I would have loved to have had more time to just have a cup of coffee and a chat with Atef- he seemed like a really interesting person. Highly recommend airbnb stay."
189965,8026933,2013-10-13,3267454,Guy,I had a really comfortable stay here. Atef keeps the room immaculate and the house quiet. An ideal retreat from the hustle of the city. Thankyou!
189965,8225590,2013-10-21,47335,Chanita,"This was may first time traveling to Boston and I must say my experience here living in Atef's home was pleasant. My room was quiet and equipped with everything you need and more. The fridge and microwave allowed me to buy snack foods to eat while I was there for three days, an add on I wouldn't have received if I were at a hotel. The location in Charlestown made it very easy to commute throughout the city either walking, bus or train. Atef's home is a minute walk to Bunker Hill monument which is totally cool. A very comfortable stay and would recommend staying here over anywhere else in Boston. As a woman traveling alone I felt very safe coming and going in this neighborhood. Atef thanks again for extending your home to me great place!"
"Chanita W.\"",,,,,
189965,11782185,2014-04-14,376908,Reighan,"Atef’s place was wonderful. It is exactly as pictured and pristine. Additionally, Atef was very accommodating. He is extremely kind and responded immediately to all my questions. I really enjoyed the quiet of his house as well – a very nice reprieve from my time in the busy streets of Boston. The house helped me discover the neighborhood of Charlestown, where I had never previously visited. It’s probably an 8 minute walk to the T (orange line) and there is a Whole Foods on the way. I would stop at the Whole Foods on the way to the T every morning. There are also an array of delightful bars and restaurants in the neighborhood of Charlestown just minutes from Atef’s house. I felt completely safe coming back and forth during the day and night. Finally, staying at Atef’s house really enhanced my stay in Boston, and helped me enjoy one of my favorite cities!"
189965,12512663,2014-05-04,14679842,Liyong,Two complaints.
I waited for one hour for the housekeeper to open the door. The phone is not answered and regularly go to voice box.,,,,,
The house owner said it is not a hotel,and extra towel and expense will be charged.,,,,
Overall,"it is clean and quiet. But I would stay at hotel on that price if I can book the hotel.\"",,,,
189965,20626560,2014-10-02,21648669,Wendi,"Atef was a friendly, genuine host. We loved the location...right down the street from the Bunker Hill Monument and within walking distances of almost everywhere we wanted to go. First experience with a vrbo was a good one."

The neighborhood is beautiful and made traveling around Boston easily accessible. My husband and I very much enjoyed our stay. Atef was very attentive and kind. Thanks again, Atef!"
189965,32645557,2015-05-19,31668730,Javier,"First off, Atef was gracious enough to accept my request to stay at his place after a previous reservation I had made was canceled two days before my trip."
"I had originally booked a complete unit with the previous reservation and was a bit nervous about staying in a \"\"private room\"\".",,,,,
"Let me say that Atef's \"\"room\"\" was nothing like I had expected. The room felt more like a small studio with it's own bath and with a beautiful view looking west",allowing one to take in the sunset.,,,,
The room is very spacious,well kept and comfortable and the bathroom is very modern with heated floors!,,,,
I wasn't able to meet Atef personally,but I did get to meet and talk to Charles,the house keeper,who was an all around great guy and very nice.,,
Atef's place is located in the historic Charlestown just a few hundred feet from the famous and historical,Bunker Hill.,,,,
My stay at Atef's was far and beyond what I had expected and it was a pleasure to have been able to stay there.,,,,,
The only recommendation I would make would be that it would be nice to have a small desk for to be able to work on my laptop. There was a desk there,but a bit small for my computer. But then again,I'm on vacation,so why would I want to work? I had to send out a few emails and look over a few things. Other than that minor insignificant item,I would highly recommend staying there. It is an A1,A+ location and space! I would stay there again and the next time I'm in Boston

189965,34481347,2015-06-08,34137906,Alexa,"This is a beautiful room in a great location, on a quite street! Only a 5 minute walk to the Community College subway stop and 15 minute walk to downtown. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom is beautifully remodeled with Kohler fixtures. Don't hesitate to stay here!"
189965,38113562,2015-07-13,29412590,Maureen,Atef was a perfect host. The area was terrific and near the T. It was also in a charming area and close to many historic sites. The room was super clean and have any amenity that I required. I would recommend Atef's place to anyone- no doubt about it!
189965,41691910,2015-08-08,40035420,Christopher,I had a great experience. Atef is a gracious host to a beautiful home. The location is perfect in the heart of Charlestown. The room was immaculate and clean with an absolutely gorgeous bathroom.
"I would certainly stay there again.\"",,,,,
189965,50491301,2015-10-12,4058474,Mena,"Atef was a great host.  The communication with him from the beginning was clear.  When I arrived he greeted me at the door and gave me a thorough briefing of his home.  The bedroom and bath was exactly as pictured, clean and charming.  The neighborhood is fantastic as it is steps from the bunker hill monument and Charlestown is a quaint part of Boston.  I would recommend this host/location to anyone.  He also checked in with me through the week via text and asked how he could make my stay more comfortable.  Great host."

189965,88139291,2016-07-23,84570030,Clare,"This was my first airbnb experience and honestly I preferred it to staying at the usual large hotel in the city. The nieghborhood was genteel, peaceful and historic. I had a fantastic gourmet meal at a moderate price just a few blocks away. The room was extremely private, the bathroom was the equivalent of a European hotel. I can't recommend it highly enough."
189965,93156819,2016-08-11,83304592,Darlene,Atef was there to greet me and was fine with allowing me to settle in an hour earlier than expected. Atef Checked in on me twice during the week and helped me with locating food and yoga!
11398953,71040216,2016-04-23,9586456,Kyle,"\"We had just worked a 16 hour day. During that day I got a text from the host saying \"\"Sorry"
My point is this - Last minute appraisers while you have tenants,especially those happening at 8:30 am are unacceptable.,,,,
This was an actual experience we had here - its not a horror story,however gives you an understanding of the professionalism that you might receive.,,,,
This along with the fact that we booked the room for 5 people yet had only 3 blankets and 1 hand towel. Made us feel like they didn't go above and beyond like the average airbnb.,,,,,
The best parts about this place are the extremely fast internet and the nice subway system 5 minute walk away.,,,,,
The interior is nice as well,nice beds,decent TV,couch was okay,rooms are 1 med - 2 small,big kitchen
However,"In my opinion I would have rather booked a residence inn or a staybridge suites. \"",,,,
11398953,71378295,2016-04-25,24164275,Chris,Had a great stay everything went great with Shawn and I would recommend him to anyone looking at one of his places. The place was as pictured which I was pleased with.
11398953,75680465,2016-05-22,65212943,Kaniet,"It was a first experience with a Airbnb,and i can say,that is very comfortable way. Apartment was really good,me and my guests are enjoyed it! Thx to Shawn!!! 5 star definitely"
11398953,79600987,2016-06-13,72880769,Fred A.,"The apartment definitely met our expectations.  It was comfortable, clean, and more spacious than the photographs made it appear.  In addition, it was located within easy walking distance of the subway.  We would certainly use it again when we are in Boston.  Shawn was very accommodating, informative and helpful."
11398953,80244350,2016-06-17,1653778,Ashley,"Shawn was very helpful in helping us navigate the neighborhood and welcoming us to Boston.  My two colleagues and I were in town for a work trip and the 3 bedroom apartment was perfect for us all to share.  We felt safe in the neighborhood and the place was clean, spacious, and I just loved the exposed brick in the bedroom."
11398953,81010208,2016-06-20,45272548,Pam,"Shawn is a nice and responsive host. His place is charming and about a block from a gorgeous park overlooking the harbor. It's close to the t which made getting around easy. Shawn recommended the restaurant, Rino's, which was fantastic and pretty close to his place."
11398953,86011466,2016-07-14,82403702,John,"I would rent this listing again in a heartbeat. I went with my family of 5 and we loved it. It was really clean first of all. This was important to my wife and I and we were NOT disappointed. Secondly, it's right by a subway and so my family and I walked to the subway to go into Boston and Harvard. That was really a plus. Thirdly, Sean was very responsive to my concerns. When we got there we could not get the wifi to work, but he helped us via text and it was up and running in no time. He also was helpful in getting us ideas on sights to see and so on. Fourthly, it has a big kitchen and comfortable beds and in a safe neighborhood. It was very family friendly."
The only negative was finding on street parking close to the condo. Sean cannot control that,but we had to park on another street at first to find on street parking. But when our neighbors left for work the next day we were able to move a lot closer. You have to be aware of street cleaners on Wednesday and Thursday depending on which side of the street you park. Your car could be towed if you happen to be on the wrong side of the street on the day the street cleaner comes through.,,,,
I just want to say that this listing is everything Sean said it would be,"and he was a great host. \"",,,,
11398953,87697602,2016-07-21,28826743,Lilly,Great stay! Comfortable place that was a quick walk to the T station. Stop is Maverick on blue line and you can take subway from and to airport via free shuttle bus. Thanks Shawn!
11398953,90946391,2016-08-03,74235033,Kyuho,"The place was very good from the pictures, but not good for staying few days. Not much of consideration for guests, shower towels only, dark lighting, noisy constructions around, no parking space."
11398953,91712145,2016-08-06,82575525,Bridget,"This was the perfect place for our Boston vacation. This home is within walking distance to the T, a beautiful city park (perfect for our 17 month old), and the Boston Harbor. It was also very close to the airport so you wouldn't need a rental car!!  Shawn was very speedy in all our communications and we appreciated his timeliness with regards to questions we had."
11398953,95384660,2016-08-19,7155749,Connor,"Shawns place is absolutely lovely, clean and spacious. It's in the perfect location near the subway to travel further in town. Communication and check in/out was so easy."

The apartment is walking distance from the convention center and an easy cab/uber ride to the city and airport. Lovely and comfy furnishings and a well equipped kitchen. It met all of our needs. We will be back next time we visit Boston."
10475848,68765191,2016-04-06,25970775,Austin,Good location in a quiet spot near lots of great food.  We were given tons of great recommendations and a wonderful overview of the building.  Be sure to read it all because it's super helpful!
10475848,71349825,2016-04-24,12321994,Kevin,"A wonderful and spacious apartment in a great location.  The number of beds was a huge plus and Mo was a fantastic, flexible and communicative host.  The place smelled great as well."
10475848,73588115,2016-05-08,13791915,Jennifer,Mo was great and her place was just what we needed for a night in btown. The rooftop common area was perfect for a little bday gathering.
10475848,75504323,2016-05-21,29548909,Colleen,The neighbourhood was great lots of good Cafes nice restaurant near by. Near city and nice to relax.
10475848,79146692,2016-06-11,64902843,Jason,The apartment was very nice and comfortable. Perfect location and Mo was great to deal with.
10475848,80373342,2016-06-17,35671507,Tim,Mo was amazing.  Met us to provide keys and good rundown of the city.  We felt incredibly welcome in her home.  The condo was perfect and the rooftop patio had incredible views.
I definitely recommend taking a water taxi from the airport upon arrival.  It is about a 10 minute walk from where it lets out.  Would recommend this AirBnb to anyone that asks.,,,,,
"Thank you so much Mo!\"",,,,,
10475848,89178755,2016-07-27,64952381,Christine,Mo was very responsive from booking to arrival and answered any question we had promptly.  The location is great and is within walking distance to downtown and many attractions.  Uber rides were there within minutes if you needed it.  Many restaurants and coffee shops are within walking distance.  The convention center is a very short easy walk.
10475848,92525840,2016-08-09,15182055,Jeremy,"This is a fabulous apartment in an excellent location. It is well appointed, neat and very comfortable. Mo did everything to make sure the check in and out was smooth and easy. Highly recommended"
10475848,97776217,2016-08-28,7195530,Anne,"Our host was accurate about the assets of the space and ammenities, but we were happily surprised by the prevalence of new upscale dining and coffee places very close by. Overlooking the seaport is a treat, and the deck on the 20th floor was excellent, especially for the night view."

12071820,70648224,2016-04-19,66060022,Flor,"Sin duda la mejor opción, el apartamento contaba con todo lo necesario y ademas con un concepto muy artístico al igual que sus anfitriones. La estación de tres esta muy cerca, al igual que la zona de comercios y restaurantes a la que puedes tener acceso en cuestión de minutos, todo a través de lindos paisajes acompañados de parques y mucha naturaleza. Dani y Erica son unas personas muy amables, que me dieron ayuda en todo momento y gracias a ellos pude realizar todos los planes que tenia en mi estancia a Boston sin ninguna dificultad y de la forma mas eficiente. Ademas son unas personas muy calidas y con mucha calidad humana, que te hacen sentir en casa y muy detallistas, incluso me dieron un tour e hicimos una ruta fantástica en el museo siempre llenos de risas, que son tan características de ellos y de muy buen humor, por cierto Erica es una estupenda chef y de verdad se portaron demasiado buenos conmigo, no tengo palabras de agradecimiento por hacer una feliz estancia en Boston y de ir para hacer la maratón de Boston me quedo con grandes recuerdos gracias a ellos, incluso fue muy reconfortante sus palabras y motivación antes, durante y después de la competencia. El estar con ellos y haberlos conocido fue un super plus para mi viaje, recomiendo ampliamente este apartamento ademas de ubicación, costo, servicios, instalación, confort por sus inigualables anfitriones, de verdad son personas sensacionales y únicas,  los llevo en el corazón junto con el dibujo que me hicieron de animo previo a mi evento y el cual ya decora mi cuarto. La mejor opción, en el mejor lugar y con las mejores personas sin duda!"

12071820,75096847,2016-05-18,67651118,Melissa,"This was my first time using AirBNB. Hosts where very attentive and pleasant. They answered all my questions and always responded promptly. I had some initial trouble making the reservation, and Daniel patiently waited for me to get my profile verified, even though it took longer than normal. Hosts kindly left a bottle of wine and made great sight-seeing and restaurant recommendations. The apartment spare room and pull-out sofa was as described + a pile of fluffy pillows.  Both hosts are working artists and their home is filled with warm artistic energy, music and paintings. Residence is set back a few blocks from the main road, so city noise at night wasn't a problem. Located is a safe, fresh neighborhood. Creative restaurants and coffee shops with fresh ingredients, vegan, and gluten-free options within short walking distance. Easy access to public transportation stops. Recommended to anyone looking for a quiet, friendly place to stay."
12071820,77339839,2016-05-31,69551804,Katharina,"Daniel and Erica were wonderful hosts and enriched our stay in Boston with great evening conversations after dinner! They were not there on our arrival day but made sure we had everything we needed and gave us tips about the area! Jamaica Plain was fun to explore, as it is a nice part of greater Boston with a good connection to the city center. The flat is as seen in the pictures, your bed(sofa) will be next to Erica's paintings and an old piano and both, Erica and Daniel, are very helpful!"

The rental is exactly as described in the pictures and is very well kept and stocked. Everything is new and in working order. I would definitely have loved to utilize the kitchen and BBQ had there been time. There is ample room for 7-9 depending on how people sleep. There is not too much to do in the direct vicinity so walking is a must, but it isn't bad at all. There is a bus that runs right on the corner as well. Overall love the space."

Amazing location with convenient access to some of Boston's best restaurants, Whole Foods, public transportation.

Não tem metrô muito perto, apenas ônibus, mas para quem gosta de andar como eu, em 30 minutos se chega a Back Bay. A única observação  é que o prédio não tem porteiro, então não é aconselhável fazer encomendas ou compras pela internet e após o check-out às 11:00h, não existe um locker para deixarmos bagagens. Mesmo assim Recomendo!"

The apt was exactly as posted, and the tips / hints / emails were very helpful.  We contacted the property manager (Corey) just once, and he was very helpful and prompt in providing some extra towels, as the count seemed to be a bit mis-matched (likely a result from previous stays).  We pre-cleared a group BBQ for our daughter's graduation (10 people total), and the unit worked perfectly for our group.  The cleanliness, location, amenities and comfort of the unit made our stay memorable."

We easily were able to get Uber's or walk to a number of activities. The size of the home was good for our needs and the washer and drier were convenient."
However,"we thought that the neighborhood was noisy and the security lights in the back of the unit were very bright and the rooms were too bright for us at night. \"",,,,

The space is in the lower level/daylight basement/garden apartment portion of the building, had enough room for everyone to sleep and hang out.  We wanted to stay in a neighborhood while we were in Boston as opposed to a hotel closer to downtown. The area around the apartment itself is right on the verge of being a little sketchy, we didn't mind at all, and actually enjoyed it, but if you are looking for a pristine area this may not be the place. The host was responsive to an email regarding bedding/towels."

2549840,57486640,2015-12-26,34075203,Shaker,"The first thing that everyone should know about this listing is that you are not renting from someone that lives in that apartment, you are renting from a realtor company that has multiple apartments and multiple employees managing them; which makes it confusing when you are trying to contact the person you thought you rented from only to get someone else answering the phone. Because this was more like renting a hotel room you can only check in at 4pm and you had to leave by 11am which has never happened to me when renting from an individual, I am usually told that I can come and leave whenever I wanted. The fact that it was a rental company was not clear to us when we rented and I think for the sake of transparency it should be known."
The apartment is fairly spacious for a Mass Ave apartment. The location is really good as well,you will have to do some walking or hop on the T to get around though. Parking is not included and is an extra $25 per night but compared to other parking options in the city it is well worth it,not to mention that its really close to the apartment.,,,
"You get 2 nice big beds and and one of those IKEA bed couches which is also comfortable. The apartment can easily fit a large group because of the number of bathrooms and the number of places you can sleep.\"",,,,,
2549840,58531729,2016-01-03,46286459,George,"The apartment was as advertised and we enjoyed the rapidly improving neighborhood. However, I think that the smell from a gas leak which pervades the hallway and occasionally the apartment needs to be fixed! We were told the leak was too small to:"
a: find  and,,,,,
b: be a health or safety concern. I'm not so sure about that.,,,,,
The third bedroom has only a quite short single bed it really needs a double to make the place suitable for 3 couples. As it is,the 6th person must sleep on one of the living room couches.,,,,

9750460,94161824,2016-08-15,509195,Chris,Everything at Tim's place fit the description and it is extremely well located.  There were 4 of us staying here for a few nights and we had a great time.  I fully recommend Tim's place.
9750460,96205407,2016-08-22,32932471,Joseph,"Tim's place was fantastic! The apartment was beautiful and in a great neighborhood. You feel at home at the apartment, with the roof top being a great place to relax and have a few drinks after exploring the city.  It was a short walk to the central part of the city and the closest T station that can get you anywhere else in Boston. Tim was an awesome host, great communication throughout the process and easy check in/out.  Would definitely recommend staying here!"
9750460,97757328,2016-08-28,87156670,Matt,Very nice apartment and affordable!  Tim was very accommodating on all aspects of our trip.  We will definitely try to book again.

4948724,33277238,2015-05-26,13096273,Victor,We absolutely loved the apartment. Very clean and spacious.  The location was very nice as well. We would highly recommend this apt for anyone traveling to Boston in the future.
4948724,36965806,2015-07-03,33698248,Edward,Great apartment in a great location! Clean and convenient.
4948724,47067368,2015-09-15,11743266,Tad,Really nice and clean apartment in a beautiful neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again. Communication with Richard was simple and everything was professionally provided.
4948724,51548407,2015-10-21,44265741,Benoit,"We very much enjoyed our time in the apartment. We particularly liked the comfortable leather couch and plush king size bed. We never lacked anything, the place was furnished with everything we could need and more. It is close to great shops and restaurants which we took advantage of."
"We would consider staying again.\"",,,,,
4948724,54345465,2015-11-18,5592830,Bob,"WOW! This apartment is fantastic.  Great location: beautiful neighborhood, 2 block walk to the subway.  Getting into the building and the apartment worked well.  Everything about this apartment was great—cleanliness, appearance, décor, amenities, appliances (but no dish washer), king bed, robes and slippers.  The information in the apartment was very clear about its use (except I couldn’t find how to get to the back of the apartment building to discard the trash). A small elevator is available for getting to the 5th floor.  Signing an agreement was new to us, but reflected how this unit is professionally run.  We didn’t take advantage of the wood burning fire place or the roof, but those are nice extras to an excellent apartment.  Excellent value for Boston, when compared to silly hotel prices."
4948724,62563030,2016-02-15,41227300,方正,I have experienced a nice journey in Boston. Richard had made everything clean and comfortable. The kitchen is new and equipped. Thanks to Richard so much for supplying such a warm apartment.
4948724,66672362,2016-03-24,5592830,Bob,"Great apartment. Great location.  This is the second time that we have stayed in this apartment and we love it.  Easy access to the train, restaurants, Back Bay area, Fine Arts museum, and conference centers at Copley or Hynes. Interior is in great shape and very comfortable.  Easy access and exit. We had the minor inconvenience of no hot water, but that was attended to quickly."
4948724,73149158,2016-05-07,36966769,Kara,"I stayed at this apartment with my two daughters while one was moving out of the dorms and one was looking for an apartment.  The location was perfect.  Very walkable to BU campus, dinning, grocery, and public transportation.  The apartment was impeccable and had everything we needed including bathrobes.   The apartment is located in a updated building in a beautiful old neighborhood on Commonwealth Avenue.  Would love to stay here again.  It was the perfect get-away.  I give 5 stars to our host, Richard!"
4948724,85226505,2016-07-10,63189483,Simon,"Schönes und gut gelegenes Apartment, insgesamt hat es uns dort sehr gut gefallen. Der Gatgeber Richard ist sehr hilfsbereit und organisiert das Ganze sehr professionell. Die Dachterasse ist super, von dort aus lässt sich übrigens wunderbar das Feuerwerk am Unabhängigkeitstag beobachten. Zu dritt kann es wegen des Ausziehsofas zwar ab und zu etwas eng werden aber wer bereit ist, es tagsüber immer wieder zusammen zu schieben, sollte mehr als genug Platz haben. Ein kleines Manko ist die angrenzende größere Straße, aufgrund derer es vorallem morgens etwas laut werden kann. Es gibt außerdem leider keine Möglichkeit, am Abreisetag die Koffer zu verstauen, falls man erst später am Tag abfliegt. Auch wenn Richard gerne gute Tips gibt, wie man dieses Problem lösen kann, wäre es doch super, wenn hier eine einfachere Lösung angeboten würde."
4948724,88538337,2016-07-24,8517130,Rachel,"A great place to stay. We love back bay and this was perfect. Close to the universities (came to visit our student son) great shops, restaurants etc"
14231732,91439875,2016-08-05,25206417,Andy,I stayed here for 3 nights during my East Coast trip. When I checked in Gogo greeted me in a friendly manner and gave me the tour.
The space was clean and tidy. Don't expect a finely furnished apartment (there's no couch if that matters to you) but the bed was comfortable,and if you're spending most of your time out it really shouldn't be any sort of problem.,,,,
The apartment is located right next to the tram which you can use to take you into the city. There are plenty of good restaurants nearby but don't expect the same busyness that you would find in Boston proper. I always felt safe there.,,,,,
Overall it was a clean,comfortable space at a great value in a safe neighborhood with a helpful and kind host,"there's not much more you can ask for.\"",,,
14231732,91798276,2016-08-06,3056466,Chelsea,"The unit was clean and accurate to the pictures. I'd stay there again if I went to Boston. It's close to the T, it also has a meter lot less than a block away for parking, we didn't stay long enough to use the kitchen or anything but there was everything there to use if we did have time."
14231732,92631690,2016-08-09,7708576,Maxime,"My stay at Gogo's apartment went great. The place is spacious and was very clean, the building quiet, the AC very efficient, and check-in and check-out went smoothly. There's a metro and a bus station about 2 minutes away for easy access into Boston, as well as a pharmacy, convenience store, grocery store and several restaurants within walking distance, though the neighborhood isn't very interesting. Overall I was very satisfied with my stay, especially for the value, and I'd stay here again."
14231732,94053596,2016-08-14,24767792,Shanina,"GoGo was very accommodating with our arrival, as it look a little longer to get through customs than expected. The apartment itself is in a great location in Allston just off a main street full of cafes, bars, and restaurants, and a short walk to the green tram line which takes you right to downtown Boston. The only challenge was finding a place to park the car during our stay - there are mostly residential parking spots in the area, or those with a two hour limit."
14231732,95561663,2016-08-20,86932807,Madie,"The host was very sweet. The apartment was good for just the night, the room was air-conditioned! Definitely take advantage of Uber in boston because parking was rough. The closest parking garage to the air bnb is boston university, about 10 min walk. The location is in college town part of Boston so there is lots of bars, restaurants and transportation."
2933661,16876226,2014-08-03,19180142,Celicia,"I stayed only for one night. There is a bus stop very close to the apartment, a laundromat across the road, and several restaurants within walking distance. Is more towards the quiet side of Jamaica Plain."
2933661,17317455,2014-08-10,18870905,Jocelyn,"I enjoyed my week stay at this location! It is well located in a nice neighborhood and its near the T (Green rd station, 15min to downtown)"
The host is very very nice,I would go back just for them.  Their dog is quite nice so you will need a minimum appreciation for dogs to like this place because the door for the porch is in the room.(but this mean you will have direct access to the porch!)  I woulds stay there again.,,,,

2933661,17906820,2014-08-18,14904304,Aman,"This was my first time visiting Boston and what a great first start!. This house is awesome, Rooms look exactly as they do in the pictures, very well furnished and clean. The neighborhood is fantastic because you are in a quiet area but also two blocks away from a bus stop and about 10 mins away from Centre st. -the heart of JP. Lots of nice cafés and places to eat in walking distance. I felt very much at home the entire time. Josefa is extremely nice and easy to talk with and her dog Kira is so adorable. I will definitely stay here when I come back to visit Boston. I truly recommend this place!!  Thank you for providing me a wonderful stay!"
2933661,18100901,2014-08-21,4109410,Christian,Terrible experience.
I woke up at 2am and what I found was pretty scary:,,,,,
- A syringe in the kitchen sink,,,,,
- Lots of pubic hair in the bathroom sink,,,,,
- A kitchen which was completely messy (pasta plates,stuff on the floor),,,,
- 4 guys & girls sleeping on the other bedroom,with the door wide opened and the light switched on (guess why),,,,
Earlier,in the evening,my girlfriend and I thought the experience was not good:,,,
- Many spots on our bed sheets that we had to put ourselves,,,,,
- Towels were new but not washed,,,,,
- Friend's of Josefa's brother smoking weed at 9pm,and had a small party in the other bedroom (at least it was not that noisy: somehow,"they realized they had AirBnB hosts)\"",,,
2933661,18956785,2014-09-03,2310026,Ekua Andrea,"My son and I were very fortunate to have found this excellent space in Jamaica Plain. We were made to feel welcome and after long conversations with the hostess, we found out we had similar tastes in home furnishings. I am looking forward to returning and can't wait for the next holiday. The house is also located very close two stations ( Green Street/ Forest Hills) which takes you directly into the heart of Boston. In addition, we were able to walk to  Centre Street where all the trendy shops/ cafes and restaurants are located."
Overall,a wonderful hostess,great space and fantastic neighbourhood- We could not have asked for more!,,,

Totally fell in love with the dog in the house - a cute charming sibirian hosky. Its a bit distance from Boston center, but very easy and cheap to go there by the tube, and on the way to tube there was a really nice coffeshop with the nicest bread and latte. :-) :-) :-)"

2933661,35053298,2015-06-14,35565224,Luis,I had a wonderful time. Very friendly host and dog was super friendly. Room was clean and organized. Had privacy loved having my own door to leave house and come through. All as aspected.
2933661,39583810,2015-07-24,3936705,Nelson,"The apartment was great and Josefa really helped us out in a pinch since we had a last-minute change of plans. It is located on a quiet street with plenty of parking and the T, though a bit of a walk, is easily accesible and worked for us: no need to worry about driving and paying for parking downtown! Their place also has a sweet and friendly dog which we loved. Overall, a great stay."
2933661,40044838,2015-07-27,6243772,Scott,"The nicest people - very relaxed and helpful. The place was clean, with a back porch, and comfy. Even though we arrived in Boston late, Jorge stayed up and made it easy to get in. Would definitely stay again!"

Additionally, she made us feel really welcomed and she was especially very nice and friendly with my girlfriend and with our little dog. Thanks Josefa!"
2933661,46545395,2015-09-11,27292244,J P,Perfect! My time here was too short! It was a pleasure to meet everyone there. I only wish was that I had not been so busy with work to have gotten a chance to know more about the city in general. The proximity to the T made getting in and out of town very simple. Thank you for being such a great host!
2933661,51933392,2015-10-25,42332504,Karson,I stayed here for a month while on work assignment in Boston. It was good location to get both downtown and to areas I had to access by interestate. About a 10 minute walk to the T and downtown Jamaica Plain.
Ori was very helpful with anything I needed upon arrival. She was in and out,sometimes for a couple days at a time,while I was there. I kept to my room 90% of the time I was at the apartment because her dog did go after my dog twice within the first couple of days of me being there due to her dog being in heat. I wish I would have known this prior because my dog was petrified the rest of our stay.,,,
The temperature varies greatly in the apartment depending on the temperature outside. I ended up buying a fan that I used up until the last week of my stay because the inside temperature of the apartment reached the 80s.,,,,,
The room was nice. I would not recommend that specific room for a long stay like mine,as the futon is not the most comfortable bed in the world but would make do for a couple of nights no problem.,,,,
I was asked to clean up and do the laundry for one of the rooms in Ori's absence out of pocket. No big deal,as she paid me back,but I did find it strange.,,,
The listing includes laundry as an amenity but in actuality the laundromat is right across the street. Costs about $10-20 to do a load.,,,,,
The shower and fridge (both kitchen and mini in my room) were not very clean. Also,there is an abundance of fruit flies in the apartment at all times.,,,,
All in all,"this was a fine place to stay. \"",,,,

I immediately felt at home in their space and appreciated the privacy of the room, its spaciousness and newly painted walls.  The room has everything one could want and because all of the other bedrooms are upstairs, the 1st floor bathroom feels private.  Their wonderful dog, Bounce greeted me at the door."

5874408,34465860,2015-06-08,33504929,Fang,The all family members are hospitable and enthusiastic. The home is big and clean. There is a book containing some maps and introduction to Boston. Its very convenient from the house to the downtown of Boston by the orange line. Its late night we get the green street stop and Julie has been waited there to pick us up. We really appreciate that. Thanks Julie & Donna.  Its a nice experience to us.

In the morning Julie baked us delicious fresh muffins and made a lot of suggestions for sightseeing.  The place was cozy and peaceful as described.

Folks who are not used to dogs just need to understand that the dog is playful and affectionate.  When I entered I asked the hosts to have the dog come down so I could meet her with them present so the dog would feel comfortable.  We got along fine.,,,,,

The house was always very quiet and we felt comfortable engaging Julie & Seven, as well as taking time to ourselves to rest after busy tourist-filled days.

Julie and Seven and their dog Bounce are super friendly and very welcoming. I would definitely stay here again if I return to Boston and am very happy to recommend."
5874408,72304413,2016-05-01,61846089,Heidi,"We had a really nice stay with Julie and Seven. The room is very comfortable and warm, the bed was great, breakfast was good too. Julie and Seven were very welcoming, and helpful with suggestions for things to do in Boston and how to get around the city. We also loved the dog - she was friendly from the moment we walked in, and very affectionate! Many thanks, staying with you definitely added a lot to our stay in Boston :)"
5874408,72820639,2016-05-04,4602553,Becca,"I thoroughly enjoyed my short stay with Julie & Seven. Their room is very cosy, comfy and super clean, with an excellent bed. Julie & Seven are wonderful, considerate hosts who went out of their way to be helpful, welcoming and accommodating. I definitely plan on staying with them  again next time I'm in Boston."
5874408,73643923,2016-05-09,27508648,George,"This was our second time staying with Julie & Seven.  A comfy room and a great place to stay in JP. In short, really welcoming hosts and a dog named Bounce that you will fall in love with."
5874408,73918448,2016-05-11,1230678,Yelena,Rarely can one meet people as welcoming and caring as Julie and Seven. Their energy provides safe heaven for their guests. The location cannot be more perfect. The instructions are clear. I so much hope to come back!
5874408,77762046,2016-06-03,603792,Tara,"From the moment we arrived, Julie and seven were top notch hosts.  They helped us with local knowledge and were kind enough to invite us to their Memorial Day bbq. The location was ideal for visiting everything in Boston, the bus and train are so close to the house,it was super easy to get around. The room we had was lovely and plenty big enough for myself and my teenage daughter! Even with her bags and bags of shopping!!  The breakfast was always fully stocked and the home made muffins were delicious. We never had to wait for the bathroom as they have one upstairs also so the downstairs was virtually our own"
5874408,79035751,2016-06-10,23689602,Carly,Lovely home with a welcoming family and dog! The bed is super comfy and the room feels private since its on the lower level to the hosts bedrooms. Sharing one bathroom caused no problems whatsoever. The homemade muffins were fab too! Bounce the dog was a particular favourite of my boyfriends! Transport wise the home is a 3-5 minute walk to the bus stop and a further 20-30 mins to central Boston or the subway (the T) is a 5 minute walk away and about 20 mins into the centre. Neighbourhood felt really safe. Thanks Julie and Seven for a great air bnb experience!!
5874408,79829176,2016-06-14,27182664,Euge,Staying in Julie and Seven's house is definitely my best air bnb experience.
From the very first moment that I booked the room,Julie was really caring about our stay,she gave us detailed instructions to arrive safe to the house. It was clear that this was going to be a great experience. Julie and Seven are very welcoming,caring and they made us feel like we were at home. We enjoyed getting to know them and having great conversations in the morning while Bounce was playing with us. She is so lovely that it was hard saying good bye.,,
The room was perfect,very clean and with small details that show us how caring and cozy they are. The house is wonderful,warm and well located. Just a few blocks from the JP center where we enjoyed walking around and having delicious dinners. Also,"the bus stop that took us Downtown was a block away and it only takes a few minutes.  We highly recommend staying in Julie and Seven house and if we come back to Boston we'll stay with them.\"",,
5874408,82157540,2016-06-26,46848,Rachel,"Julie & Seven are conscientious and caring without being fussy. Staying with them for 4 nights was like visiting my hip aunties. I was busy with a workshop and wish I had more time to linger w/them just to chat. Their comfortable home reflects their personalities. The spacious bedroom has a nice mattress, and the house is clean and inviting. There was plenty of room to share w/my friend who drove down from Vermont for 1 night. Easy access to the Orange T line, lots of street parking, and just a short walk to excellent restaurants and groceries on Centre Street. Pretty much ideal."
5874408,84852697,2016-07-09,19504291,Christina,"My husband and I stayed for one night with Julie and Seven. They were both welcoming hosts and provided us with what we needed to come and go as we pleased. They also were hospitable in accommodating my dietary needs for breakfast. The room was spacious, with a comfy bed and lots of natural light. We would definitely consider staying again next time we visit Boston."
5874408,85839359,2016-07-13,56134558,Antony,"Julie and Seven hosted our first Airbnb experience, and we couldn't have asked for more. Our bedroom was very comfortable and well presented. Our hosts also gave us plenty of great suggestions on where to go in Jamaica Plain (which a really awesome area) and how to get around Boston. They also catered to our vegan requests for breakfast, and always made sure there was a pot of coffee ready to go first thing in the morning. Bounce the dog and Pokey the cat were excellent co-hosts, too!"
"Thank you for an awesome stay!\"",,,,,
5874408,92092797,2016-08-07,112807,Sophia,"Julie and Seven provided me with a soft place to land while I took an intense five day course nearby.  Their home is walking distance from the T, in a quiet residential neighborhood."
The AirBnB room is on the main floor right by the front door,and everyone else lives upstairs,so it felt private but not isolated. Perfect spot for creative and introverted souls.,,,
"I especially enjoyed playing and cuddling with Bounce the affectionate dog.\"",,,,,

2769450,74787652,2016-05-16,46891109,Martha,"This was our first AirBnB experience and it worked well for us. Varouj met us downstairs and showed us around. The apartment was clean, comfortable and functional. The view is amazing. Whole Foods and CVS are in walking distance as is the Science Museum. T-station close by as is a taxi stand at the nearby Wyndham Hotel. Uber drivers needed a bit of instruction sometimes in finding the front door as it is in a cul-de-sac off of Blossom, but it all worked out. Varouj identified a problem with the thermostat and had it fixed right away with no inconvenience to us."
2769450,74940366,2016-05-17,19586242,Kristin,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2769450,84331514,2016-07-06,59183212,Jason,"My wife and I, along with our 5yr old son, stayed at Varouj's apartment on the Charles River for a week which included the 4th of July. This was our first time using Airbnb and Varouj really helped us along as we had a lot of questions. The apartment was amazing - it had great views of the Charles, which came in handy on the 4th as the Boston fireworks are done there and we were able to avoid crowds and watch them from the balcony. There are many great things to do within walking distance, such as the science museum, Faneuil Hall, the esplanade, restaurants, kayaking, tours, shopping, and much more. It was also very close to the 93 which was useful to us. Our flight arrived a bit late on our first day and Varouj was out of town, but he left the keys with one of the security folks and everything went smoothly. The inside of the apartment was clean and there were some supplies to get us through the first night luckily because it was late. Overall, our experience both with Varouj and the apartment were excellent."
5709298,29242176,2015-04-05,1355483,Eliane,"Jay was so nice and helpful! Even though we were running super late, Jay went out of the way to get us keys. The neighborhood is absolutely adorable and super close to Whole Foods and Charles Street. The apartment was very quiet and clean, seemed like it was brand spanking new. I would highly recommend the area for someone who is coming in for a quick trip. We would definitely stay here again if we come back to Boston."
5709298,29538739,2015-04-08,30732267,Derek,"Jay's apartment was beautiful and just as advertised. This was my first time in Boston and I'm glad we chose to stay at this place.  The Beacon Hill neighborhood is not only gorgeous and historic, but in a great location. It is within walking distance to pretty much all of the great downtown areas."
Jay was prompt in meeting us and very flexible. He allowed us the check out late which was awesome and very much appreciated.,,,,,

5709298,29992611,2015-04-15,29710970,Jim,Jay was responsive and accommodating.  The apt was perfect for our family and the location is great as it's walking distance to most of the city.

Jay was extremely responsive and friendly. He was also very flexible, allowing us to drop off our luggage before the designated check-in time so that we could begin enjoying Boston. We also met his cleaning person, Jess, who made the place look great and was very friendly. She gave us some very helpful information for using the T, which is a short walk from Jay's place. The building was secure, and the location fantastic. We walked nearly everywhere. I would definitely stay again!"

Definitely recommend. Thanks again for everything, Jay!"

He was very accommodating and responsive. I highly recommend Jay's apartment and this is one of the best Airbnb experience I have had. Thank you, Jay!"
5709298,33097136,2015-05-25,29627836,Mariyana,"The location of the apartment is amazing. The place is very new. The beds and pillows are comfortable, the bathroom was clean, the kitchen has everything you need. The apartment is small but the amenities, location, and the level of cleanliness makes up for that. The only bad thing about our stay was that we were able to check in pretty late at around 5pm since the apartment was not cleaned and ready for us at the time we aggressive on, 3pm."
5709298,33345431,2015-05-26,32014946,Katerina,"Although we didn't get to meet in person and had to book the house in the last minute, Jay was extremely responsive and easy to communicate with, and made it very easy for us.

5709298,33909636,2015-06-02,11467905,Maurice,Jay's place is well place in between all the great sights and night spots the city has to offer.
The place is immaculate and comfortable. I would def recommend staying here.,,,,,
As for Jay,he was attentive and was there to answer any questions.,,,,
"It was a great stay.\"",,,,,
5709298,34078000,2015-06-04,6486531,David,"Jay was welcoming and very helpful. The place was clean and well maintained, but small.  With 4 of us there, it wasn't a great place to just hang out. Probably fine for 2 people. For the most part though, we were out and about since the central location allowed us to walk most everywhere we wanted to go. The only real downside was that with no parking, and the street outside packed with cars on both sides, unloading 4 people and moving in was stressful, even with Jay's help, since we were blocking cars from moving when loading or unloading. That seems to be common in Beacon Hill, and would stop me from locating in that area again."
5709298,34526688,2015-06-09,29558718,Mark,"Lovely appartement - clean, nice beds, everything you need is there. Probably the best neighbourhood of Boston to stay in. Jay is very friendly and thoughtfull. Absolute recommendation!"

5709298,35559968,2015-06-20,28893330,Kearney,"My husband and I used to live in Boston and we were planning to return to visit family and friends for a few days. With two young children, we decided an apartment rental would be better for us than a hotel...giving us more space, kitchen facilities, and bedrooms. Jay's listing fit exactly what we were looking for, and although we had never done an airbnb rental before, decided to give it a shot."
Jay's apartment is in an amazing location-safe,convenient to the river,commons/public garden,west end/gov't center,Charles street shops,and the T.  There's plenty of dining near by (from quick and cheap to fancy sit down places) as well as grocery options if you want to eat in.
Limited parking exists,although that is par for the course in Boston and really,no car is needed in the city. If you must have a vehicle,park it in a ramp and leave it.,,
The apartment was easy to access and Jay was very flexible with check in times. He communicated quickly and answered all questions in a timely manner,even apologizing for a few problems he was trying to address with some lights in the bathroom...none of which affected our stay.,,,,
The apartment itself is newly renovated and a functional size for Boston. The galley kitchen was stocked with utensils and dishes,and even has a dishwasher. Despite being across the street from Mass General,we found the apartment to be very quiet. The bathroom shower took a bit to heat up,but the water pressure and temperature were excellent once it did. Beds were comfortable,closets provided extra storage space for luggage and other travel items.,
My kids enjoyed the apartment so much,they didn't want to leave and head to the cape on our last day here!,,,,
Thanks,Jay,for a fantastic place to stay,at a great price,"in a perfect location!\"",
5709298,35707522,2015-06-21,18517378,Nikhil,Great place to stay in downtown Boston. Jay was very welcoming and available and accommodated our early arrival. Apartment was clean and size was great for 4 people with two nice sized bedrooms. Location is right in Beacon Hill with close proximity to mass transit and a lot of tourist attractions. Price was excellent for the fact that it was two bedrooms right in the downtown area. Would definitely stay here again.
5709298,35984250,2015-06-23,4163817,Marianna,Jay was an excellent host. Finding the apartment and getting in were easy with clear instructions. This is a great apartment for a single person or couple. Fantastic location. Very clean and comfortable.

Very pleased with the stay in general and if I'm in Boston again in the future and the place is available I will definitely be in touch."

5709298,45382070,2015-09-02,35480097,Pam,We had a great Boston experience and a lot of that was due to the quality and convenience of Jays apartment. The location is central to all that Boston can offer. We walked almost everywhere and the train station is down the street. The apartment is clean and well equipped. The neighborhood has restaurants and shops. I will be back..

5709298,46592642,2015-09-12,38237576,Pam,"Jay's place in Boston's Beacon Hill was our first AirB&B, so I was very pleased to find the compact 2 bedroom apartment accurately described. We were comfortably ensconced here for a 3 night stay. I had been concerned about the key handover which had at first glance seemed complex, but all went well and we had no problems with it at all. We didn't meet Jay but it was nice knowing he was only a text or phone call away and managed to help us sort out our only real problem when our teenaged son locked us all out of the bathroom! The necessary tool was available in the apartment although Jay did say that was the first time anyone had ever managed this feat! My son who has used Air B& B before said that the provision of bathroom essentials was particularly good. I'd certainly recommend the Historic Beacon Hill location which we found both convenient to walk into the harbour area and very quiet and attractive."

We had a slight delay in getting into the apartment, which was a bit annoying, but was quickly forgiven as we spent the time having a beer and great calamari at a cute spot right around the corner from the apartment. Besides the initial delay, Jay was very responsive and helpful for the rest of our trip."
His apartment was clean,modern,and in an awesome part of Boston. We easily walked to the North End,Boston Common,the Freedom Trail,and the Financial District. (Full disclosure: we consider anything under 1.5 miles
We would absolutely stay here again.,,,,,

Sometime at late night there were cars passing in front the window so it could be a bit loud for light sleepers. But a pair of earplugs could solve that.  I recommend this place to other travelers."

There were some great places to eat nearby, plus the Wholefood Store for groceries. It was also on the edge of the beautiful Beacon Hill area and a short walk from both the Common and Freedom Trail. Charles Street with its antique and arty shops was also close by. In fact we could walk to most places we wanted to see"
5709298,51319875,2015-10-19,8310876,Meghan,The apartment was great.  Jay let us drop our bags off early which was nice.  The apartment is close to a lot of great places to eat and shop.  I would definitely stay here again!

5709298,53686654,2015-11-11,10379713,Leah,We (2 adults & 1 toddler) had three nights at Jay's apartment and we have nothing but praise for such a great apartment and host. I would go as far to say it's the BEST Airbnb accommodation I've stayed at to date.
Jay was a very attentive host. He sent through all the location details,access information for the building,and replied to all our queries promptly.,,,
Despite the previous guests still being at the apartment when we arrived,Jay kept me updated,Jess the cleaner came in right away once they'd left and got the place looking spick and span.  The apartment had all the amenities and then some you could possibly need. It's in the best location near supermarkets,restaurants,bars and liquor stores. It's only a stones throw from the train line,and walking distance to all the tourist sights. Beacon Hill itself is a very pretty place with lots of boutique shops
Thanks for making our trip to Boston a good one Jay.,,,,,
FYI - Do yourself a favour and stay at Jay's if you are ever in Boston. It's a lovely apartment in a great city.  My only advice would be; don't bother with a car. You won't need it and parking is very expensive as we learned the hard way.,,,,,

5709298,75739056,2016-05-22,32456846,Juan Manuel,"We went to Boston for our Son's graduation, and found Jay's apartment as the perfect spot for the visit. Cozy, indeed very well located. Thanks Jay !!"
5709298,76946179,2016-05-29,853479,Brian,"Jay's apartment is very clean, spacious and comfortable. The location is EXCELLENT, close to the red line and at a walking distance of most of the major sights. We didn't get to meet Jay in person, but he always replied to our questions and needs promptly. Overall, a great experience!"
5709298,77413889,2016-05-31,63361411,Karla,"Jay was an excellent host. He sent us detailed directions on how to enter the apartment, and was available by cell phone if we had questions or needed anything. He was helpful in providing tips to touring Boston. The apartment was clean and matched the description provided. We loved staying on Beacon Hill, as we were immersed in the culture of living in Boston. This was also a great location....close to the tourist sights. We found Uber to be the way to get around, as we decided not to rent a car until leaving the city."
5709298,77720811,2016-06-03,23494370,Ryan,Awesome place in a great location in Boston! Jay was very helpful in getting the logistics sorted out and would highly recommend his apartment for anyone looking to stay in the city.
5709298,78124674,2016-06-05,30687288,Gabriele,"Jay's place is extremely nice and clean, I highly recommend it!"
5709298,78620605,2016-06-07,69436218,Greg,Jay was very responsive and the place was great!  Awesome part of Boston.
5709298,79122097,2016-06-11,26617556,Tim,"Jay was an awesome host, communicated really well and made check in very easy.  The apartment was perfect for us - plenty of space for 3 travellers, comfy beds and couch and in am awesome area of town - great boutiques and bakeries around the corner - the bike share system hub is just down the street too, making getting around a breeze!  Would definitely stay at Jay's again when travelling through Boston! Tim, Tanya and Kym"
5709298,81186435,2016-06-21,66502362,Erica,"This place was so great! Jay was super-informative and kind, and his place was perfect for what we needed. It's right in the middle of Boston. We walked and took trains everywhere we wanted to go. This central location was perfect for what we needed: an affordable home base for a long weekend seeing a new city. It was very clean and felt very safe as well. We will definitely use it again if given the chance!"
5709298,81566857,2016-06-23,43185835,Grace,"Jay was an excellent host and his apartment is exactly as described. Walking distance to Whole Foods, Charles River Esplanade, The Freedom Trail & Feneuil Hall; yet still cosy & quiet enough for a good night's rest. My first airbnb booking, and my first time in Boston. Thank you Jay, for making the experience a wonderful one!"
5709298,82487928,2016-06-27,12373869,Traci,Great location! We had a wonderful time in Boston and this was the perfect home base for us.
5709298,82956899,2016-06-30,42463959,Caitlin,Jay's home was great and felt very safe and secure in a lovely neighbourhood.
We were very close to transport and major attractions.,,,,,
The house was clean and presentable.,,,,,
Suggestions would be to perhaps leave an instruction page in the apartment detailing TV/wifi/oven usage instructions.,,,,,
"It would also be helpful to have more cooking and baking utensils.\"",,,,,
5709298,84200389,2016-07-06,424043,Amber,"Jay's Beacon Hill apartment was awesome for our stay. It was exactly as pictured and described, and super-clean! The location was perfect for a variety of Boston activities. It's right near a Whole Foods, CVS, and Starbucks -- just perfect. I'd definitely stay here again."
5709298,84466840,2016-07-07,54911944,Cody,Great location in the heart of Beacon Hill with easy access to the rest of the city. Having a full size kitchen and two bedrooms makes you really feel like living as a local.
5709298,84927389,2016-07-09,22256444,Niki,"This is a great little apartment in Beacon Hill! It was super clean, in a very secure building and really quiet. The space was just right for our family of 4 (with two small kids). T was just outside the door, Boston Common was walkable and While Foods was across the street."
"Jay was really quick to respond and easy to communicate with. We would love to stay here again and totally recommend it!\"",,,,,
5709298,85506604,2016-07-11,31827445,Erica,"Jay did a wonderful job of communicating with me the whole time. We had no trouble getting in and settled. We even met the house keeper,Robert, who was a really nice guy! The location was great. Being so close to the hospital we were worried about noise, but it's down a nice quiet street. There is a whole foods and plenty of liquor stores in the area. I would absolutely stay here again. Jay made us feel very welcome."
5709298,85926531,2016-07-14,39483638,Janine,"When I had a little difficulty getting the outside door to unlock, Jay was available and responded immediately."
5709298,86986830,2016-07-18,3393739,Annie,"Jay's apartment in Bracon Hill is so well located - walking distance to almost everything you would like to see. The neighbourhood is gorgeous, the apartment is really quaint and clean, and Jay is really friendly and helpful. A great stay."
5709298,87571619,2016-07-20,436384,Greg,The experience started off well as Jay sent a thorough/organized informational email prior to check-in. He was already there when I arrived for check-in and provided me with the necessary key/fob and was ready to answer any questions we had. The location was centrally located for everything we wanted to do while in Boston. This place really felt like Boston was home for the couple days we were there.
5709298,88024653,2016-07-22,702645,Scott,"Great place! Really excellent communication from the host, awesome location in a fun building, short walk to the hip Charles Street and Boston Common, and great value for a group needing more than one bedroom. Highly recommended!"
5709298,88424443,2016-07-24,77387083,David,Jay was an excellent host! Very professional and a beautiful apartment.
5709298,89317185,2016-07-27,69286925,Chris,"Great location, great modern and clean space. Wifi, TV, all great. And all we had to do was leave the keys behind so no big cleanup at the end. Definitely will consider this next time we go back to Boston."
5709298,90038897,2016-07-31,71266502,Bobby,Great neighbor hood. Very accurate description.
5709298,91078828,2016-08-03,43232724,Agathe,"We enjoyed our stay very much !! The flat was clean, cosy and quiet. Located in the center and very easy to reach."
5709298,92252689,2016-08-08,40870934,Louise,"You can't beat Beacon Hill for location.. just a few blocks from the T and from Charles street.  Jay's apartment was perfection itself..clean, bright and well appointed.  I found Jay himself to be professional and very accommodating! It was the perfect stay with the perfect host."
5709298,92714616,2016-08-09,6182875,Mona & Seif,"Jay made an excellent job indicating to us where and how to get in his unit. The apartment was ideally located in downtown Boston and had all the amenities needed for an enjoyable stay. Also, everything was very clean and the bed sheets smelled nice. We highly recommend and would ourselves come back next time we are in Boston."
5709298,93113754,2016-08-11,21635990,Justine,"Jay was very responsive. We had trouble with the lock system which was out of his control but he took care of it. He was flexible with us dropping our bags which allowed us to explore the city longer. Overall a great location, walking distance to almost everything, clean and comfortable."
5709298,93360978,2016-08-12,58078701,Becca,"Absolutely awesome, clean, and accurately described apartment in Beacon Hill! Loved staying at Jay's - who was extremely easy to communicate with and attentive to our needs. The apartment is great and would definitely stay again next time I'm in Boston!"
5709298,94537353,2016-08-16,73666423,Sylvia,"Great experience both with the stay itself and communicating with Jay.  The apartment was exactly as described -- easy to find, conveniently located, and perfect for a weekend of sight seeing."
5709298,95373428,2016-08-19,59372551,Bettina,Jay war bereits im Vorraus sehr engagiert und teilte schriftlich alle nötigen Informationen mit und beantwortete alle Fragen schnell und ausführlich.
So ist es gar kein Problem,dass man ihn während des Aufenthalts nicht persönlich sieht,da er trotzdem jederzeit als Ansprechpartner zur Verfügung steht. Er war stets sehr freundlich und zuverlässig!,,,
Die Wohnung war neu renoviert,sehr schön,hervorragend ausgestattet und in einem wirklich ansprechenden Viertel von Boston.,,,
"Wir würden diese Wohnung jedem weiterempfehlen.\"",,,,,
5709298,97218670,2016-08-26,14191477,Paula,"El apartamento está situado en una zona tranquila y cercana al centro de la ciudad. Tiene todas las comodidades, está limpio y es muy sencillo contactar con el propietario."
5709298,98055637,2016-08-29,14929500,Liz,"This was my first positive experience with Airbnb and it was largely in part to Jay's hospitality. My first time with Airbnb was a fail because of my host's unresponsive nature. Jay could not have been further from that. He made himself available to all the questions I had about visiting Boston and about getting in and out of the apartment (one of my major concerns at first). Another big concern I had was working around flying in and out of Boston - could we check in early and store luggage, could we store luggage until we left late afternoon for the airport, what did we need to do prior to leaving the airport? Jay was very helpful in helping me work this out."
I would stay here again and recommend Jay's place to anyone looking for an Airbnb in Boston. Thanks,"Jay! \"",,,,
5709298,99647128,2016-09-05,27504839,Aeimit,Great location in Beacon Hill.  Really nice apartment that was in great shape and everything was as we expected.
2555771,13085262,2014-05-19,13975249,Darach,"John was a most gracious and considerate host who was available anytime to provide insightful advice and guidance on scenic walks, local pubs and eateries, and the many things I shouldn't miss during my brief stay.  The apartment was bright and airy, making it a welcome place to return to at the end of a busy day out."
2555771,30380170,2015-04-21,4051536,Ian,John made our stay most enjoyable and made sure we knew how to get to all locations.Since I was there to run the marathon this was very important.Great home with plenty of character with easy access to public transport.If I get another chance to run the Boston Marathon we would hope to stay with John again.
2555771,48427927,2015-09-26,43005819,Susan,John made us feel very welcome.  Just enough privacy.
A lovely place to stay,,,,,
"Very convenient\"",,,,,
2555771,49616064,2015-10-05,40972092,Michael,"John couldn't have been more gracious as a host: he offered to share his dinner the first night we were in (couldn't take him up on it) and did make us dinner the last night; had food in the refrigerator in the space;   adjusted the heat (which effects his living space as well) for us; lent us a phone charger to use instead of the one forgotten; etc. The space is very nice, a converted attic with kitchen, bath, living room, sizable bedroom, and nicely furnished (the posted picture is in John's space, not the rental space). The neighborhood is pleasant, fairly quiet, with public transportation only by bus."
2555771,76463237,2016-05-27,17213200,Thomas,"John was very friendly and welcoming.  He helped us with our luggage and even asked if we would like to have dinner and another day invited us to join him for a martini.  He also had coffee, cereal, milk and berries for us in the kitchen.  He is a very nice and personable guy."
2555771,81315567,2016-06-22,19072963,Jennifer,"John is such a kind and thoughtful host. My boyfriend and I are moving to Boston and used his lovely upstairs space as a home base while exploring the city. Not only was the space fantastic -- large, comfortable bed, great bathroom, kitchenette with cereal and fruit, and a lovely sitting area -- John sat with us each day to talk about what we had experienced and to give us suggestions. I feel so lucky that John and his lovely home were our introduction to Boston."
2555771,88001079,2016-07-22,53448725,Elisa,"A descrição do anúncio era adequada. O John, foi um excelente anfitrião, desde o início muito atencioso e sempre respondeu os e-mails muito rápido. Na chegada explicou tudo. Foi muito atencioso, prestativo e receptivo. Alugamos a parte superior para um casal de amigos que vieram nos visitar em Boston, eles não falavam inglês, mas John fez de tudo para recebe-los bem, sempre com um sorriso no rosto. Agradecemos muito a atenção ."
2555771,89130675,2016-07-27,53448725,Elisa,"Estadia maravilhosa, local muito aconchegante e o John é um excelente anfitrião."
9180965,68577780,2016-04-05,64410585,Mike,Tao was very accommodating and friendly. His room is what I would describe as a 'bedsit' with its own bathroom and kitchen. It was perfectly adequate for my needs and only ten minutes walk from my conference centre.
The room was exactly what I needed with a clean bed and bathroom. Tao was always available at the end of the phone and very helpful when I needed assistance.,,,,,
"I am very happy to recommend his room.\"",,,,,
2372987,10459719,2014-02-19,12200259,Maged,"Beautiful place, super clean and modern,"
The host was available at all times to help us with any questions we had even the silly ones.,,,,,
Although we never met him,"but I am certain he is a very very nice person.\"",,,,
2372987,10578950,2014-02-25,10103349,Courtney,"First, let me begin by saying that the apartment is gorgeous and looks exactly as it appears in the photos provided; everything is brand new and very clean."
- The only thing missing was the DVD player that was mentioned in the description,we couldn't find it anywhere.,,,,
- Also,note that the bedroom faces the street which provides for a very noisy sleeping environment (we could hear everything from noisy cars and music,to conversations of people walking down the street) However this didn't really bother us.,,,
The apartment is located in a nice area which allows for walking as opposed to driving (if it isn't so cold). This is ideal since parking is a bit hard to find,especially since we arrived on a Saturday night. We did text Brent and he responded very quickly with tips on parking locations.,,,,
- The day before we were scheduled to check out we contacted Brent to see if a late check-out would be possible as my significant others' flight was not leaving until much later in the day,he responded very quickly with a later time. However,"the next morning he contacted us again stating that the cleaners would be coming sometime between the original check-out time and the time he had told us and could not guarantee a late check-out. We had to rush to get ready so we wouldn't be there when the cleaners showed up... was not my ideal departing day. \"",,,
2372987,11053824,2014-03-18,12273336,Jesus,"I had a wonderful stay.  Has everything you will need.  From a full stocked kitchen, to your own washer/dryer.  I would definitely stay again!"
2372987,11615739,2014-04-09,12458357,Catherine,"This apartment was very easy to get to on the Silver Line and a great base from which to explore Boston.  Whilst compact, it was well laid out with plenty of storage space.  There are several excellent breakfast places close by to set you up for the day - Mike's City Diner and Flour Bakery, and there's a grocery store just across the road.  The only downside was the noise level from the road outside the bedroom window."
2372987,11757705,2014-04-14,6511606,Sydney,"Overall I enjoyed my stay in Brent's apartment. The bed was comfortable, the location was within a block of the Silver Line, and it was also close to convenience stores and some good restaurants (Mike's City Diner). It was very convenient to have a code to get in rather than have to carry a key, and we had no trouble getting in to the apartment."
2372987,12243726,2014-04-27,13156619,Jessica,"Brent was a very good host.  He gave me the code to get into the building in a timely manner and was flexible with the checkin time according to my flight times. The apartment was in a great location and very walkable to restaurants and the subway.  There was also a bus stop just a block from the apartment.  The apartment was very clean and cozy; the perfect size for my fiancé and I.  Brent also included a notebook and great places to see and do, as well as recommended restaurants. I would definitely stay here again!"
2372987,12503604,2014-05-04,1630367,Marian,"This is a beautiful, new apartment in the South End, just around the corner from Toro and Flour. The apartment has a very comfortable bed, keyless (passcode) locks, and everything you could possibly need for a short stay."
The only negative is the street noise,which is probably inevitable in any apartment right on Mass Ave. The host provides a white noise machine and I wear earplugs every night anyway,so I was fine,but it's worth noting that this is definitely not a quiet apartment.,,
There is a parking spot that you can rent one street away,which was very convenient.,,,,
"Great experience--highly recommended. \"",,,,,
2372987,12983910,2014-05-16,6073562,Guillaume,Perfect communication. brand new and very clean apt in a cute village like neighbourhood of Boston
2372987,13601543,2014-06-01,6282240,Andrea,Brents apartment is perfectly for staying a few days in Boston. You have to be slim (queen size bed) and tall (to reach the upper shelves in the kitchen). the description is perfect.
It is conveniently located near bus stops going downtown,the underground station or direction of Cambridge.,,,,
The only negative point is the noise from the street - a hospital is located at the end of the street with ambulances driving back and forth a lot. Nevertheless,"with closed windows you get accustomed real fast.\"",,,,
2372987,13894268,2014-06-07,6403645,Paul,"Very nice, clean and easy to access in South End.  Professionally managed making trip easy."
2372987,14212725,2014-06-14,10701974,David,"The apartment was great, brand new and very clean. Check could not have been simpler the way Brent has set it up which I found very helpful. The area has everything you could want within easy walking distance, restaurants, whole foods and flour bakery nearby. The only downside is the noise from the street at night if you're sensitive, as mentioned in previous reviews, there is a white noise machine thats really helps. Overall I would definitely recommend this apartment and would stay again. Thanks Brent."
2372987,14226587,2014-06-15,9710732,Eugenio,The reservation was canceled 48 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2372987,15749959,2014-07-15,2899604,Florence,"Un adorable studio ! Tout était impeccable. Le confort est au rendez-vous. C'est joli et très propre. Nous avons pu nous reposer entre deux grandes marchés découverte de Boston, préparer nos petits déjeuners et même des dîners. Les fenêtres isolent bien du bruit inévitable de Mass Avenue. Parfait pour un séjour en ville. À proximité de South end et ses petits restaus. Je recommande !"
2372987,16660809,2014-07-31,16227165,Wolfgang,Brent´s apartment is very well furnished and equipped. Everything was like described in the advertisement. The bedroom is directed towards Massachusetts Avenue. This street is quite busy. But the windows are well sound deadening. So sleeping with closed windows was no problem at all. The location is well located if one wants to use public transportation.
2372987,19678410,2014-09-16,16718550,Mirjam,"We had a wonderful stay at Brent's place, it is clean and roomy and very well situated."
2372987,20080580,2014-09-23,5053119,Kelly,The apartment is gorgeous and finished to a very high standard throughout. It's super clean and fresh and more than ample for two people. The only issues were the noise from the road outside - it was relentless but earplugs help. It's also quite a way out of the main attractions but easily reached by bus. I was a little worried being there later at night but Brent reassured me it's a nice neighbourhood.
2372987,20500045,2014-09-30,2526788,Eleanor,"This apartment is essentially a hotel, and I do not mean that in a good way. It is a buy-to-let property. For me, the joy of Airbnb is the home-away-from-home feel and the opportunity to connect with local hosts (even if you don't meet them). This apartment is managed by a short term rental agency. I never had any contact with Brent. Immediately after the booking was accepted, I was sent a separate contract by the agency. The listing does make clear that the property is managed by a property management company, but I hadn't appreciated how impersonal that would make the experience. This is exactly the kind of listing that has been getting Airbnb into trouble in New York (URL HIDDEN) Whilst I can't argue with the accuracy of the listing, I strongly belief that these kind of properties are against the spirit and ethos of Airbnb, and I would not recommend staying here."
2372987,20851266,2014-10-06,9455528,Jesse,Great location and loved that it was recently renovated! Was so easy to get around the city. Brent's listing was welcoming and provided great amenities for our trip.
2372987,21217101,2014-10-13,19272074,Agah,"House was very clean, new and functional. Not very central but very close to the bus station where you can catch bus to downtown. 15 minutes away by walk to the train station. But the core issue for us was the street passing by the house; source of a noise which is hard to stand when you are sleeping. We are easy and deep sleepers but  even we were not able to sleep. After the second night we needed to carry the whole matress infront of the kitchen and closed the door between kitchen and the bedroom. It was the only way to sleep. A medical center is close to the house and ambulances makes everthing worse."
2372987,21604419,2014-10-20,7110251,Daniel,"The apt was just perfect for our needs.  It is small but met all our needs.  The cypher locks are helpful as you don't need to get keys, possibly lose them, or return same.  A little street noise but this is a city."
2372987,22300078,2014-11-03,21207825,Richard,"\"The listing is described perfectly, the small apartment is cute & cozy, and just a few blocks up from Boston Medical Center.  It does sit right on Massachusetts Avenue, so you do hear traffic and ambulances, which is not terrible if the windows remain closed.  The apartment does seem to have a nice heating and cooling unit built in which you could control.  Some of the reviews stated there is a noise machine to help with sleeping!?  I found no such thing, and if you want to sleep in late, you will need some ear plugs or head-phones.  Also in the review you get the impression that Brent owns this small apartment and a few others, which appear to be all rentals.  However I discovered that the units are managed by his company, Boston Short Term Rentals which operates several buildings and multiple units. Brent lives in the top unit of this newly renovated building on Mass Ave., but his management team handles everything.  You most likely will not meet or contact Brent directly.  Everyone from the company seemed very nice and helpful when I called for questions or needed something.  There are all new appliances in the apartment, including a great washer & dryer.  My only negative experience besides street noise was that someone from the rental office came by at on a Saturday, unannounced, apparently to show the apartment to a new client looking for rentals.  Now this is the Saturday after Halloween, \"\"dropping by\"\" with no email"
2372987,22670100,2014-11-11,7960055,Mike,The apartment was just as advertised. Great location!! Flour and Toro just around the corner and easy access to the running paths along the Charles river.
2372987,30795409,2015-04-27,19014474,Zhijiao,Very clean and cozy studio. Great location!
2372987,32696150,2015-05-20,1883453,Sue,The apartment was exactly as pictured.  Some of the furnishing were a bit uncomfortable but it met our needs.
2372987,33107104,2015-05-25,30868573,Kacy,Yes Brent did a great job making us feel welcome. He was very prompt answering any questions I had which I really appreciated.
2372987,33672933,2015-05-31,30695873,Dolph,Checking in was breeze.  Great location with modern finishes. Allowed for a great return trip back to Boston!  Thanks!
2372987,34129419,2015-06-05,14249139,Andy,"The apartment was exactly as pictured and although small, was brand new, very clean, had beautiful finishings and everything we needed. Totally fine for a couple to stay in but a third person would be pushing it. There was a little binder with suggestions of things to do in the area, as well as tons of closet space to store our things. The South End is a cool area with great restaurants and cafes nearby, and it's fairly convenient to get to Cambridge or downtown via public transit."
One caveat about this place - although I was aware beforehand that Brent did not live in the apartment and it is operated by a larger rental company,"it still felt odd to have more of a \"\"hotel\"\" experience than an airbnb experience. In the end",I would agree with a previous reviewer that I'm not sure it's in the spirit of airbnb to have this rental property on the site. For instance,when I asked Brent about parking (is it okay to park on the street on Sundays,etc.),rather than outlining what the street parking rules are and giving suggestions about where to park for cheap in the area
I guess it depends what type of experience you're looking for. If you're looking for more of a hotel experience,then this place is a good bet. And all in all,"we had a good trip to Boston and enjoyed staying here.\"",,,
2372987,35556195,2015-06-20,15619330,Steph,"Everything about the flat was very nice! Exactly as pictured online, and very clean and neat. We had a car and were able to rent a space in a lot nearby which was really convenient. Brent was responsive to questions before the stay, and their handyman helped me with the washing machine while there. Overall I'd love to stay here again and I'd recommend it to anyone!"
2372987,39346548,2015-07-22,37705991,Araceli,"We loved our privacy & the keyless way to get in! As others have mentioned, we too arrived early and were allowed to leave our bags in the apartment to start exploring the ciry."
2372987,39635684,2015-07-25,3578013,Chris,Like some of the other reviews we found the apartment acceptably clean but too noisy for us as right next to the main road on the  ground floor my main gripe was that unlike many other apartments this is purely a commercial venture and is devoid of any home comforts unlike all of the other homes we have shared
2372987,40595324,2015-08-01,34440210,Carol,"Nicely appointed unit. Easy keyless access was very convenient particularly since our plane was delayed and we arrived late. The apartment is close to public transportation and the South End proved to be quite charming. If you are a light sleeper, bring earplugs, otherwise the bed is very comfortable. The apartment is located right around the corner from Toro, a great tapas bar, and down the street from Flour Bakery, a local haunt."
The rental company that manages the apartment for Brent outlines everything explicitly prior to your arrival. Brent was very responsive when booking his unit. Further communication was not needed since we didn't encounter any problems.,,,,,

Emma was very responsive to messages,and did her best to accommodate our needs for an early check in and late checkout.,,,,
The suite is very clean and spacious given the location -- it has been newly furnished Ikea-style,which was quite clean and functional,and does not have a very lived-in feel to it.,,,

8340072,71449846,2016-04-25,52958219,Thomas,"We stayed in Emma's apartment in 131 Tremont St. It is a fantastic location, slap bang in the middle of everything, you can get to all the major sites within 10 mins walking. The apartment is also exactly what we needed with a decent size bedroom and a good lounge/kitchen. We would highly recommend staying in Emma's apartment, the checking in process was so easy and she had a professional cleaner clean the place before we moved in."

But all was good as the flat was cleaned ASAP. She also graciously allowed us a late checkout as our flight was late. Location of her flat was very good.
8340072,75678112,2016-05-22,54194585,Maire,"My group is just back from 5 nights at Emma's place. It was great experience, checking in and out were both really simple. The apartment itself was clean, spacious and everything we needed. It was really quiet at night time despite being in such an excellent location.

Right in the middle of Boston's historical sites, you can walk across the street to Boston Common, one block to a great grocery store. Easy check-in and an incredibly accommodating host.

Calm and everything needed and the confort for a much longer stay than ours. A problem of aircond could have made our very warm July stay much less nice but Emma took care about the problem remotely.

La proximité avec les lignes orange et verte est très appréciable et permet de rejoindre le centre ville rapidement. Le quartier est relativement calme et les commerces à proximité sont pratiques. Alexandra est une hôte très discrète qui ne cherche pas à engager la conversation. Elle a su toutefois répondre à toutes nos demandes."
1426711,13130807,2014-05-20,11312162,Jing,"The two rooms are perfect, just like a home. My parents flew from China to attend my graduation ceremony, and we really had a happy time in Alex's home."

Issues as stated by other guests include: Subway smell, cleanliness of the bathroom and rooms, air conditionning always on (made a very loud noise in the room with the two  air beds) and locked with password.  We completely agree with Chases's review."

10391455,62283589,2016-02-13,3203440,James,"Dave was a great host!  He was around the place or just a text away if I needed anything, but in general, he gave me my privacy.  It was walking distance to the Boston Sheraton (where my conference took place), so I saved loads of money.  The space looked exactly the same as the photo listed.  The pull-out sofa bed was very firm, but it didn't bother me much."
I liked that there was no elevator,since it forced me to get some exercise up 3 flights of stairs.  The only thing that was somewhat annoying was a first floor smoker,which made the stairwell smell.,,,

Superb location, surrounded by excellent cafes, within minutes' walking of two train lines which will take you to any part of downtown, and a bus runs past the front door which takes you to Harvard University. Walking distance of Newbury St and Skywalk Observatory. Lovely area, beautiful buildings and safe to walk around at night. Thanks for a five-star experience!"

That cheesy phrase \"\"mi casa es su casa\"\" falls short in describing Dave's hospitality. He was friendly"
As other reviews have pointed out,the bed provided is firm,however Dave provides a pad as well as lots of blankets,so I was able to layer things to achieve my balance of firm and soft while still having more than enough blanket coverage.,,
The apartment is definitely in the heart of Boston,and the walk to the nearest T orange line is a short one. If you haven't lived in a city before,staying here is a highly immersive experience of city life.,,,

Due to flight cancelations my friend arrived before I did, and there was no problem with her checking in and getting the keys. Dave was super personable and helpful, checking up with our plans and making suggestions about activities. The apartment is located in an awesome area, super accessible to the T and busses that take you all over the city. In the area itself you have restaurants and coffee shops for that early morning caffeine.

It's a small but cozy bedroom, like advertised, but the whole apartment feels bright, roomy and clean. There was little closet space, but we were able to make do with what was available. It was very convenient for us to be able to safely park our car near the apartment the whole time we were there, so we could use transit and visit Boston properly. The walk to the transit station was a bit hilly, but it was a safe and lovely walk nevertheless. And what a sweet, adorable dog Booker (sp?) is!

There were a pair of clean towels, two bars of soap, and a sheet of paper with all the details of the stay, including the wireless password, his cell phone number, restaurants in the area, and instructions for leaving the house, waiting for me when I got there. He checked up on me multiple times to ensure that I was comfortable and had everything I needed, and also provided me detailed directions to the local bus station, which is literally a 3 minute walk from his house, where I was able to catch a free shuttle to the Boston Airport."
I highly recommend his place to anyone looking for a convenient,"clean and safe location in East Boston. You won't be disappointed. \"",,,,
9145242,59674238,2016-01-13,53632164,Sy,I had a very good experience staying at Ivan's place.  So close to the airport and so easy to get to.  Ivan really showed that the quality of my experience in staying at his place was important to him.

9145242,64465290,2016-03-04,56681258,Natasha,"\"This being my first Airbnb experience and the first time in the US I was a bit apprehensive to start off with, however Ivan and his family made me feel right at home. Even before I landed in the country I received text messages from Ivan to enquire if there was anything I needed and to make sure I have a safe flight. When I got to his home Ivan helped carry all my luggage down the stairs to the room (3 heavy bags!). The room had everything you need after a long flight and there was even a lovely \"\"Welcome home\"\" note"
9145242,64981461,2016-03-09,61323682,Chris,Delightful host and great accommodations.
9145242,65660257,2016-03-16,8724592,Saul,"Me alojé en casa de Iván durante 4 noches y la experiencia fue más que excelente. Iván es una persona muy atenta, al igual que toda su familia. El lugar está ubicado en una zona súper conveniente porque desde el aeropuerto es muy fácil llegar y se localiza solament(URL HIDDEN)estaciones del centro de Boston, por todo eso creo que es una de las mejores opciones para quedarse en la ciudad. El cuarto es amplio y muy cómodo, con todo lo necesario para una estancia perfecta."
---------------------------------------,,,,,
I stayed at Ivan's place for 4 nights and it was a great experience. Ivan and his family are very kind and thoughtful,they are very friendly. The place's location is excelent,only 2 minutes walk to the blue line,which takes you to the downtown (only 2 or 3 stops,"depends on your destination). I'm pretty sure this is one of the best options to stay in Boston. The room is extremely comfortable (the bed and the pillows are the best) and it has everything you need to make it the perfect stay!\"",
9145242,66100505,2016-03-19,51865073,Rafael,"Very nice place, the bed is crazy comfortable and Ivan and his wife are some of the friendliest people I've met."

9145242,67232951,2016-03-27,2516211,Cathy,"\"Ivan was awesome!  I can't imagine how he could have been more helpful.. I think if he could have improved the weather he would have! Shared shower was not a problem.  Good shower, sheets and towels. Used kitchen to make breakfast and pack lunch.  Half bath downstairs where room was located. Everyone in the home was very nice.  House is conveniently located 2 blocks from the Airport stop on the \"\"T\"\" (subway).  It took about 20 min to get anywhere I wanted to go.  30min to Cambridge.  Get a Charlie card for $19 to ride subway/bus for a week.  There's a free shuttle bus from the station directly to/from terminals at Logan. I came in at night a couple of times and felt perfectly safe alone.  I was provided with a key.  Appreciated being able to do a small load of laundry after a spill.  One of the things I love about traveling with airbnb.  I highly recommend Ivan's place.\""
9145242,68156210,2016-04-02,51580174,Lauren,Ivan's place is perfect for a quick stay! He's very friendly and considerate.
9145242,69334305,2016-04-10,20782997,Allan,I spent two nights at Ivan's place.
I found Ivan being welcoming,keen to help and prompt in responding to correspondence,his family is friendly.,,,
When I asked Ivan to help me find transport to the airport for my oversized luggage,he readily offered to drive me to the airport at a time of my choosing.,,,,
My flight out of Boston was scheduled to leave the evening of the checkout day,Ivan was very accommodating he let me leave my luggage at his place after checking out and I was able to spend an afternoon in the city before returning to collect the luggage in the evening and head to the airport.,,,,
Ivan drove me to the airport along with my large suitcase and oversized luggage hereby saving me transport costs.,,,,,
The room was warm and has a comfortable bed and is 5 minutes walk to the airport (blue line) train station,the station is also served with free bus transport to all terminals of the airport.,,,,
In most cases one may not need to catch a taxi to or from the airport to this location,which translates to savings of about USD35 per taxi trip.,,,,
I had a large suitcase and an oversized luggage which I had to travel with to the airport therefore could not catch the free shuttle from the station.,,,,,
I look forward to staying at Ivan's place if I return to Boston for a visit.,,,,,

9145242,71766968,2016-04-28,46573696,Rachel,"Ivan was very accomodating for our stay conditions. We asked to check in fairly late and leave early the next morning for our flight. On top of that, we had to leave the room at night to run some errands and Ivan was very understanding."
The room is a 5 minute walk from Airport Train Station (which has free shuttles to Logan Airport). However,if you have an early flight,you might need to grab a cab to get to the airport (still cheap) because the park/crossing from Ivan's room to the station might be closed off.,,,

It's spacious and very comfortable either for a night or for a long stay. The bed is large and comfortable, there's a bed-side table, a cozy armchair and a study table where you can work with your laptop. There's also a cabinet with shelves and hangers where you can place all your clothes. The house is place is a beatiful neighborhood with lots of shops. It's only 3 minutes walking to Airport Station subway stop (blue line) and from this stop it only takes you 15 minutes to get to the most important places in Boston or Cambridge. So the house couldn't be better placed. Staying with Ivan is like staying at your own home: you have all the facilities in the house. And he is very friendly, nice, helpful, very responsible. If I were to come back to Boston, I wouldn't search for any other host. I will always choose Ivan's home."

His entire home is very clean, and the bedroom is spacious with a very comfortable bed. The location is great; about a 5 minute walk to the Blue Line's Airport Station, which will take you to downtown Boston in about 15 minutes. It also has free shuttles to Logan Airport, making it the perfect place to stay if you have an early flight."
I would definitely recommend Ivan's place to anyone looking for an affordable,"convenient stay in Boston with an attentive host!\"",,,,

It is really convenient to walk to the Blue line T-station and take the shuttle back to the airport. You will save on taxi/Uber services if you stay farther. Just so you know, the bathroom is on one floor up. But everything was clean and quiet. The bedroom is well curtained that it doesn't let too much sun in the morning. So, I could sleep well and got rid of my jet lag. The wifi is quite fast and convenient as well."

9145242,77900090,2016-06-04,47680262,Emi,Perfectly located for taking the shuttle bus to the airport relatively early. You must go through the park and two elevators at the train station to get to the shuttle; the park opens at 5am. Shared bathroom a floor up was a bit inconvenient during the night.

Would recommend for the style of the place, the relaxed atmosphere, and the bonus of having a genuinely friendly host. Also nice to have access to the kitchen and some tasty (healthy) treats. The only issue I had was with the lock for the outside door being a bit finicky - hopefully that will get fixed so there's no problem with coming and going. Thanks Ben !"

5295491,40046991,2015-07-27,10072688,Christine,The listing and reviews were accurate.  It's a very safe location with interesting cafes and other resources within a very short walk.  It's an upstairs apartment in an old house.  The entry is tight and the steps narrow and steep.  But the bathroom was clean and the room perfection serviceable.  A good value!
5295491,41302050,2015-08-05,17639643,Aaron,"Ben was a great and very welcoming host!  From the second I arrived, Ben made every effort to ensure that I was comfortable and had everything I needed.  Prior to my arrival, Ben had sent an email outlining in detail every aspect of my stay, and had left a detailed one pager in the bedroom as well with pointers on what was nearby, places to go and things to do!  The place was very clean, bed was comfortable and quiet.  The perfect place to stay in Boston!"
5295491,44192733,2015-08-24,40180021,Hui,"This is a really nice place to stay, cozy, homey.... Ben is super nice, easy to talk and really helpful. I will recommend this place to my friends definitely."
5295491,46460326,2015-09-10,18986129,Franck,The big + of this listing is Ben!!
He is very kind and friendly,doing his best to be helpful,very generous (he offered to tap into his food).,,,
He accepted my last minute request although he was just back from a long trip which wasn't simple to manage for him.,,,,,
Great if you like a natural cool and quiet place a bit away from busy streets.,,,,,
Don't expect a spotless,sterile,modern,floor-leaking kind off place. It's more of a cool man's cave,"or rather a \"\"man's treehouse\"\"\"",
5295491,48442936,2015-09-26,7159976,Kyle,"Ben was a fantastically flexible host. Despite my strange schedule, Ben was very accommodating and I felt totally at home in his place. I will definitely stay here again when I'm in the area for work."
5295491,50157115,2015-10-09,46098127,Kenneth,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5295491,51250065,2015-10-18,20633213,Minshu,"Ben is very nice. He replied me quickly every time when I message to him, and he also allow us a late night check-in. The treehouse is old but warm and clean. I like his Mung beans smell soap, it has refreshed me in the early morning. The location is a little bit complicated but Ben would provide a clear direction before you check in. Only a small problem, the nearest T location is in a 15m distance, or I just fail to find a more close one, but to me is okay, because we only stay one night and we didn't plan to take the subway. Anyway, Ben is considerate to others, and the treehouse is worthy to try."
5295491,53572926,2015-11-09,43027185,Ari,"Ben was friendly, service-oriented and provided an overall amazing experience (even though he wasn't even home for my stay).  It felt like his home was my home and the chips in the cabinet up for grabs were incredible.  The place is well and interestingly decorated and great amenities were provided.  Would stay again and recommend!!"
5295491,60398479,2016-01-23,20937339,Fred,"Ben is an awesome guy and his place is good for a short stay. I'm from Brookline (town nearby) and I love the location. Street parking is pretty decent. One thing I would say is don't expect a clean place. It definitely wasn't clean when I got there. I don't like to say anything because then it's an issue and I can clean a little bit anyway. However, if Ben gets better at cleaning then it's a killer value for anyone. I found value based on my need. The floor in the bedroom is a little slanted but I just put a couple books under one corner and it was fine. Neighbors downstairs had loud music on until 1:30 am sometimes but I usually go to bed late anyway. If you're visiting the Allston area for nightlife then this is an awesome place for you. I had a great stay regardless."
5295491,66277582,2016-03-20,43766085,Mary,"I had such a wonderful experience, thanks to Ben and The Treehouse! The apartment has a personality all its own - it's inviting, comfortable, and beautifully decorated - tons of records, food, artwork, and coziness."
The kitchen is spacious and bountiful - food,coffee,amenities galore. The living room was cozy - comfy couches,tons of records. Lovely books and artwork everywhere. The bathroom is simple and accommodating - not cramped at all,and the shower pressure (if one cares about that like I do) is just right!,
Ben was generous with the space,with delicious food,and tons of awesome stories! I had a great time hanging with him while we were both around - He was also great about holding space for both of us whenever one wanted/needed. I truly felt at home while I was there.,,,
Ben was well informed of the area,and I enjoyed all of the recommendations that he gave for spots/areas of interest. The area is nice and quiet,cute,with tons of nice little shops just steps away. I had to be in several different areas in/around Boston during my stay and everything was a short easy drive away.,,
I loved the experience of Boston,made exponentially more awesome by my experience with Ben and The Treehouse. I definitely recommend! In short,"rave review : )\"",,,
5295491,68540995,2016-04-05,62326786,Wayne,This was my first Air BnB experience.  This room and this host have set the bar high for future stays.  Ben was a great communicator before and during my stay.  Ben goes above and beyond by providing some food and coffee and a very clean and neat living space.  Ben also provided maps and advice on using transit and where to dine.
The Treehouse is about 15 minute walk from the train and only about 4-5 minute walk from the frequently running and clean bus line.,,,,,
Safe and nice neighborhood.,,,,,
"Ben is an interesting guy with good taste in home decor... A bit crunchy granola and natural.  Highly recommend!\"",,,,,
5295491,75284028,2016-05-20,9360205,Nurman,"I had the pleasure of staying at Ben's Treehouse while I was in Boston. This place is very charming all the way from the decor (imagine if a human sized style magpie curates different items into a small space) to the host (Ben was communicative and attentive throughout my stay, which I am appreciative of). Sure, the location is further away from the city centre, but access to public transport is within walking distance. All in all, glad that I got the opportunity to stay at a place as unique as the Treehouse. Cheers Ben!"

He was very easy to work with, he welcomed us before our arrival, and communicated well before and throughout our stay. The apartment was as described with luxury amenities. In fact, it actually looks better than the pictures."
The only thing I would clarify is the location. The listing is close to a lot of different parts of Boston - most things are a short cab ride away. However (because the place is basically in Chinatown) if you want to just run down and get a quick deli sandwich (as we did one morning for a late breakfast),options are limited.,,,,
Overall,"I would definitely stay again.\"",,,,
4255538,90030425,2016-07-30,15659334,Francois,"The appartment is great, full of sun light and well equipped. The view is awesome on the east and south of Boston. One can observe the highway traffic over the day. The building is new and clean. The building location allows one to walk easily to Boston harbor or to downtown ( Boston common, beacon hill, etc...). Daniel is very reactive and was helpful to answer our questions. The only drawback is that if you are traffic noise sensitive you better bring ear plugs in order to sleep."
4255538,91465578,2016-08-05,20439080,Allison,"We had an enjoyable work trip to Boston in part due to a great place to stay - easy walk to the office, lots of coffee shops & places to eat within walking distance -space is nicer in person than photos- great view of the city, easy space to relax in, easy in/out.   Internet was blazing fast- and WF is a short walk down the street- almost made me miss living in the city!"

6337106,38471241,2015-07-15,5463198,Mikhail,Tom was extremely accomodating.  He went above and beyond what any host would be expected to do and helped us out in a unique situation.  I would recommend him and his place to anybody thinking they need a place to stay close by the airport.
6337106,38740291,2015-07-18,7329753,Florien,"Tom's room was very conveniently located near the airport. I had some trouble getting in touch with him before about my time of arrival, but he was there when I arrived so in the end there was no need to worry. The bed was comfortable (memory foam) and there was a fan/ airco which was nice given the hot weather."
6337106,39362083,2015-07-22,12290087,Nina,"Tom's room really helped us out in a pinch with an unexpected overnight layover at Logan.  We looked around and hotels were $(PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN) that night.  It was great that he had instant booking, and he was responsive to my inquiry.  It is walkable from the airport (20-30 minutes) and we walked to find it, but you can take the Embassy Suites shuttle and be right around the corner from the apartment if you'd like.  The neighborhood was quiet and nice, and there are some cute restaurants a few blocks away Tom recommended.  The room we had was smaller but adequate as we just needed a place to sleep and has a full bath down the hall, and it did have window-unit air conditioning, which may be a recent addition based on other reviews I read.  We were more than comfortable.  Tom was welcoming and friendly, and we would recommend staying with him."
6337106,39580961,2015-07-24,39117470,Mark,"Overall, I had a very positive experience. The place was very quiet, had a reasonable amount of space, and was walking distance to the airport, waterfront, and a few restaurants."
The previous occupants forgot to leave behind the keys,which initially prevented access to the room. However,Tom immediately drove out and delivered a new set of keys.,,,

Just a short walk from the T and one one stop from the airport as well as one stop to downtown. The host Tom was so friendly and accommodating to us. The room was clean and the bed was really comfy. The bedroom itself was a little small because we had two large bags since we were traveling for 2 weeks but the room is great otherwise.

6337106,48093448,2015-09-23,4068912,Jorge,"We spent two nights at Tom's place in Boston. The location of the apartment is really convenient, a few minutes walking from airport (yes walking!), and 5 minutes away from the metro station that takes you to the downtown (just one station to the wharfs). The house is quite big and newish. Our room (by the kitchen) big enough and practical. Tom himself is really nice, polite and always ready to chat about things to do, work or any interesting thing, so we felt really comfy. But even when I'm pretty happy with the experience I must mention some details that should be improved. In the kitchen I was not able to find any glass or dish. The bathroom:  as there is only one bathroom for (I guess) 4 rooms, the second day we had literally a queue, so we had to wait almost one hour to step into the bathroom, and that's why to keep it clean was sort of impossible for Tom."
For the price,location and listing I must say that is a great value. As a host that I am as well,"I would improve the details I mention before.\"",,,

However, our room was double booked -- we got into Boston and to the apartment around 2am, just looking for a place to crash for a few hours. We were informed that we would have a back room near the kitchen. When we got to the room, someone was occupying it. Tom seemed to have no idea what was going on. He didn't have a grasp on how this incident had come about, and we were then put in a room of his \"\"partners.\"\" It was a place to stay; not much else. Easily stated a rip off for the amount it cost to sleep in a room for a few hours."

Das Badezimmer war in einem äußerst unsauberen Zustand (Haare,Zahnpastareste). Wir haben Tom gebeten,diesen Zustand zu beheben.

Tom made some good suggestions   for nearby restaurants, including an excellent and reasonable Halal Pakistani one, only 3 blocks away.  Internet connection was reliable.  I didn't stay long, bu would definitely recommend it for its airport location."
6337106,53036802,2015-11-03,9035762,Laura,Tom is a great host and very nice. He helped me with my bags up the 2 flights of stairs to his place. The room is very basic yet he has all the amenities you may need.  My only observation is that the bathroom could be clearer.  There are 3 rooms he rents out so you are sharing the bathroom with other travels.

Tom answer all my questions and also my phone calls even when i had to call him late in the night."
6337106,53910591,2015-11-14,9148792,Arthi,Tom was a very gracious host. He guided us with the best way to get to his place. He ensured everything was ready ahead of arrival. He was very helpful about guiding us around the neighborhood. A pleasure and would certainly consider for future stays.
6337106,53994057,2015-11-15,22454788,Richard,Very clean and comfortable room that is walking distance to the airport and subway station.  Tom is very friendly and accommodating.  We enjoyed our stay here.

6337106,55226779,2015-11-29,37671399,Gregoire,"There was no bad surprise regarding Tom's house. Besides the bedroom, you're sharing the rest of the apartment - bathroom and kitchen mainly - with the other guests. There is a living room but when we were there, Tom had rented it, so we didn't really have access to it,  except for the last day. Tom answered very quickly to our questions ahead of the trip. Maybe he could have explained a little bit better how to get access to the keys before we arrived."
6337106,55394156,2015-12-01,12528117,Cris,I felt right at home the minute I arrived. Tom was friendly and open. I'm sure I'll be back.

6337106,55708218,2015-12-04,4423542,Matt,"Location, location, location: Tom's place couldn't be closer to the airport if it were an air mattress on the runway, and after a long, late flight into Boston, that was all I wanted. I got more than that, though, with a very comfy bed and a very cool host who was great conversation. (He was like the lost third Car Talk brother -- the one who went to California and got into pottery and astrology -- which was a treat.) The Logan rental car center is also literally behind Tom's house, as is the T, so if you need to grab a car or trek to the city the next morning it couldn't be easier. Thanks, Tom!"
One warning: the shuttle trick Tom mentions is a great way to get you to the apartment for free,but the beauty is lost on the shuttle driver himself; as I left the bus and he realized that I'd conned him,"he started screaming obscenities and honking the horn. (I'm guessing this has happened to him several dozen times before.) \"",,,
6337106,55829621,2015-12-06,48500969,Ashwin,I stayed here for a weekend and the stay was great. Tom was very accommodating to my timings and the room was kept nice and clean. I would take this place in a heartbeat if I were visiting Boston again.

6337106,56175403,2015-12-09,42916600,Fj,"the room has a washer/dryer in basement which is nice. Room # 2 is near the street which means you get street noise. But, Tom also has 2 other rooms that are farther from the street which might be available."

6337106,56980523,2015-12-20,51173969,Daniel,"Tom was friendly and accommodating to my friend and I during out overnight stay. His place was fairly clean, thought a little bare, and is a great location for getting to and from the airport by taking the free bus from the Hertz car rental building."

Great for airport,airline workers such as myself as a crash pad,and its a 5 min to walk there from the Blue line airport station T stop.,,,
For those seeking a hotelesque experience this is not the place for you as its in a working class neighborhood,without a view,and inside a private apt on the 3rd floor,"but as i said above its great for those who just need a basic clean and comfortable room to spend the night in.\"",,

Tom was  accommodating and really friendly. The room was warm and comfortable. The bathroom, although small was quite adequate. There was a slight smoke smell in the communal areas, but it did not affect the bedroom where we slept. Also if you are wondering the pet mentioned in the listing is a cat. I would recommend staying at Tom's place."

6337106,68162528,2016-04-02,62613243,Keith,"This an ideal overnight place for anyone needing to do business in Boston and who wants/needs to be close to the airport. I had luggage, so took the Car Rental shuttle, and that made it a five minute walk to Tom's apartment. This is not fancy, but the price reflects that. Tom is a warm, friendly host who takes the time to chat and give you as much info as you need about Boston. The return to the airport by taxi cost $8.00 (in Apr 2016). I would stay here again - close to public transit and a variety of restaurants."

The neighborhood seemed kind of sketchy and we didn't feel 100% safe. Once we entered the apartment we went up the 3 flights of narrow stairs and opened the door to a thick cloud of stench. Smoke or something. If you are sensitive like we were, you will be coughing. The bedroom was decent and had no smell once we were in there, but there was a dirty towel hanging on the chair and it made us question what else might not be clean. Only a single body pillow on the bed to use as a pillow. We ended up leaving and getting a hotel room."

6337106,76669342,2016-05-28,14088259,Elise,We had a wonderful and handy stay at Tom's. We got lost between the airport and the flat but the location was great (5 min walk from subway - 10 min from city center with center) and the room very comfy. Tom was a perfect host and we'll be happy to have another stay there for our next visit to Boston.

6337106,77706381,2016-06-03,8133554,Paul,We arrived in the early evening at Logan airport and wanted to have something close by because we had a bus very early the next morning. Since we only had carry on luggage we decided to walk the twenty min to toms place. It was easy to find and the key was safely deposited for us. The stay was easy going and we had all we needed for the one night transit. Thank you Tom!
6337106,77829950,2016-06-03,71825256,Kristina,My sister and I needed a place to rest ourselves after a long day of traveling.  The room was great for our (too short) rest.  Tom always responded to my questions and in the morning before we left we had a chance to meet him in person and chat with him.  Tom was really friendly and just a cool guy!
6337106,78051282,2016-06-05,24735956,Chueh Lung,Close to the airport. Small room but clean and suitable for people who need to catch early flight. Tom is nice and warm. Would love to stay again.

Need to know there is a cat in the house so someone who's allergic for it ....BTW totally worth it, great place great person with huge experience"

6337106,78690940,2016-06-08,74853264,Augustė,"Ideal place to spend the night after the flight. Airport is just 10 minutes away from Tom's apartment. Thank you, Tom :)"
6337106,79274855,2016-06-12,66942699,Vanessa,"Tom is nice and friendly, very helpful. Everything was as in the description. very nice experience! I did not appreciate so much the neighborhood, but the place was perfect if you need to stay near the airport! the room and the shared bathroom were clean.  to find shops and place to eat you have to reach Maverick sq. that is near (5-10 minutes of walk), from there you can reach the  waterfront and see the skyline of North End!"
6337106,79322036,2016-06-12,76227733,Sunil,This is my first experience with Airbnb and I must say that I am disappointed.  I booked Tom's place reading his positive reviews but the experience that I had at his place was not pleasant.
We arrived at 9 PM at his place. He was not there instead he gave us directions to access keys to his apartment by phone. The key was hidden in a lock box. Following his instructions,we made several attempts to open the box but failed to open . He then got pissed off and told us to cancel our reservation and find some other place since he could not personally come to handover the keys.  We were there at 9 PM with two big suitcases and two carry-on items and we were totally unfamiliar with the Boston area and unprepared for this kind of response. Where would we go at that time of the day? After trying for several times,we somehow managed to open the box and got the keys. When we entered into his apartment a cat jumped on us. We didn't expect this and informed him over the phone that there is a cat in his place. He told us that it is not his cat and he doesn't know how the cat got inside. At that point,we were scared if something was wrong in the apartment and we asked him if the place was safe to enter. As soon as I asked this question he just freaked out and hung up on us and didn't answer his phone afterwards. Scaringly we entered inside and luckily nothing was wrong. We expected him at least to assure that nothing was wrong but got a very rude response.,,
Moreover,the room that we got was not good.  We paid $93 per night but the pillow was so saggy that I used the towels in the room as my pillow. The mattress was also saggy. The table lamp was not working.  Overall,"we had a bad experience at Tom's place though he seemed to be apologetic when we met him the next day and helped us to bring down our stuff downstairs.\"",,,
6337106,79751693,2016-06-14,73404138,Harout,"Very Friendly, Very close to airport and subway line to downtown, Great for short stay, Tom is an excellent Host, Thank you"
6337106,80047376,2016-06-15,67155602,Tika,"We arrive at logan airport at 11.30 pm, order an uber but there is not uberX so we order limo, it costs $29 to get to Tom's house. Tom 's house is nice, clean, the bed is not too big for 2 persons but its okay since we are 2 slim girls"
6337106,80447036,2016-06-18,47194759,Amanda,Tom was a great and very kind host. It was my first time using airbnb and I absolutely loved it! Very humble and non invasive. Me and my boyfriend took an uber to the apartment and it was about $10.00 it's about 7 min to the airport wich was perfect for us. We would walk to the Maverick train station that is about a 6 min walk from the apartment and it goes right into the downtown area. Our stay was absolutely lovely.
6337106,80865068,2016-06-20,74839105,Sven,Tom was really friendly and it was a good place to stay for the two days in Boston!

6337106,85109545,2016-07-10,75344373,Joshua,"The listing description was accurate, and feedback and info from Tom was instant. The neighborhood isn't fantastic when you arrive by yourself late at night, but could be worse. The biggest asset is that it's a 20 dollar taxi ride from the airport and you can arrive anytime."
Also,"the cat is pretty cute.\"",,,,

It was a nice clean room with a comfy bed and great ac and so convenient to get to the airport in the early morning! Would definitely recommend for anyone needing something close to the airport.
6337106,87311155,2016-07-19,54419961,Fairy,Tom is a nice host and we talk for a while. He is a movie director and potter. I'm also a musician so we have a lot of topics. He is a conversationalist and we had good conversation. We enjoy staying in Tom's home.

6337106,90046314,2016-07-31,38231611,Liam,"This was the second place I stayed in, in East Boston and by far the Best. The room is great and comfortable and Tom is extremely friendly and welcoming."
"For people not familiar with Boston- the East is a great place to base. You're surrounded by great Mexican and other food and are just one train stop to the city centre. Really can't ask for more.\"",,,,,

Room itself is ok. Actually for this price I've expected a more neat and tidy room but as long as it's not far from the airport,"it's definitely a choice if you wanna take flight early. \"",,,,

L'appartamento non è in centro ma con la metro si arriva ovunque. È in una zona tranquilla, vicinissimo all'aeroporto e si può ammirare una splendida vista di Boston.  La stanza non è grande ma per due persone è più che sufficiente. Unico fattore critico può essere il bagno che è unico e quindi da dividere con gli altri ospiti oltre che con Tom (le stanze sono 3)."

Very clean and comfortable. Her apartment was close to the orange line which I used to get to downtown (BCEC convention center). The neighborhood was scenic and quiet. Janel was very informative and helped with all of the questions I had. I would definitely stay here again! Thanks Janel!

5076880,77969968,2016-06-04,17480798,Sue,"I, along with my husband, son and a small dog stayed at the apartment for 6 nights. We loved the location on the Freedom Trail near the transit systems  ( a 10 minute walk into downtown Boston and the bus stop was in front of the apartment). The apartment  is very quiet and roomy for 3 adults (and a small dog). The location is not accessible  to anyone with limited mobility due to the 3rd floor location with steep stairs and no elevator. The kitchen was fully equipped with pots and pans, coffee maker, tea pot, toaster, full sized gas range and oven. We saved lots of money by eating breakfast and snacks at the apartment, and splurged on dinner at Boston's abundant  fine resturants! The queen and twin beds were very comfortable and thick bath towels were provided. There were 2 flat screen TVs (one in the master bedroom) and wifi. There is a coin laundry in the complex. We were there during weather in the upper 80s-low 90s and the apartment was very hot without any air conditioning, though there were ceiling fans in the common area. Janel was very quick to respond to questions and provided a welcome packet with maps and information about the area."

It was a great hub for all our sight seeing. The neighborhood has a Whole Foods, coffee places, great food, park, etc. Janel was a wonderful host. She was totally available for any questions and very organized. Her home was so warm, very clean, and every detail was thought of. I can't wait to stay there again and refer my friends! It was very hard to leave."
5076880,89681166,2016-07-29,44680015,Claire,"We loved staying at Janel's home in Charlestown while visiting family in the area. We are a family of 3 and we found the space very comfortable and relaxing. We needed the air conditioners in the bedrooms because of the recent heat wave, and the open windows and ceiling fans in the living room were perfectly adequate. Janel's place is easy walking distance to everything we needed during our stay - groceries, post office, pharmacy, water taxi, etc. Thank you for making our Boston trip easy and enjoyable!"
5076880,93040594,2016-08-11,5868066,MaryLee,Janel was wonderful. We had a very nice chat when I picked up the keys. Her condo is really convenient to get around Boston.

In fact, I slept better there than I do in my own bed at home. The bathroom had modern updates and cushy towels, and the essential toiletries were provided. We felt right at home. We didn't meet Beth in person, but she was responsive, prompt, and friendly in making all of the advance arrangements. Jenn was there to greet us and made us feel very welcome. She even made coffee for us in the morning. It felt more like a bed and breakfast than just a bed and place to sleep. The location on a lovely old street near the Arboretum and the center of Roslindale was perfect for us. We look forward to returning again and again."
879929,5031546,2013-06-08,687467,Colleen,"Beth is a delightful and gracious hostess, and her home is clean, comfortable and full fanciful creations--as promised.

The room was great,and the AC was wonderful and cooled the room down very quickly even in this summer heat,which is unusually hot for the area. The bed is very supportive,yet soft. I usually sleep though the night till daybreak. Don't be overzealous in the AC's temperature setting though - the unit can easily make it feel like winter.,,
The bathroom is clean and spacious,"and the shower had great pressure. I believe it is unfinished marble - very nice.\"",,,,
879929,6992658,2013-09-02,7871277,Sema,"Beth is an amazing host. It was our first trip with airbnb. We stayed at her place for two weeks while we were relocating to Boston. Her house is really nice with art at every corner. Jen and Beth made us feel really at home. They both are very nice people. We had our privacy, but also got to chat with them. They gave suggestions about places to visit and helped with our apartment search. We are really glad we chose Beth's house."
879929,7114614,2013-09-07,2888492,Ana,"My stay was only for 6 days but enough time to feel at home. Beth is an amazing hostess, really kind, polite, respectful, honest and always willing to indicate me the right way :) . She even lend me a bike and went for a ride with me along beautiful Arboretum to Downtown Boston. Beth and Jenn were both very sweet and helpfull at every moment, with a lot of interesting things to talk about. They make you feel at home from the very first moment, and that kind of things really make the difference when travelling alone."

"We were very comfortable and felt very welcome. Her space Is so inspiring and creative. \"",,,,,
879929,9020367,2013-12-02,7398804,Nancy,My husband and I wanted a place where we could stay near our son and his family.  Beth Ireland's home was perfect.  It was less than a mile from Beth's to our son's home.
Beth was so gracious and helpful.  In fact,the bed gave me some of the best night's sleep I've had in years.  And then,Beth,helped us purchase the same foam mattress topper that produced such a comfortable night.,,
Her art work is compelling; we found many pieces to enjoy.  She answered all our questions cheerfully,while giving us details on how she made things.,,,,
All in all it was a great experience.  We couldn't have asked for any place better.,,,,,

879929,11775550,2014-04-14,13409845,Jennifer,"We got in later than we had planned and Beth was great, she met us at the door even in the late hour."
She was awesome about any questions we had,she gave great local info.,,,,

Initially, we only intended to stay the night and leave early in the morning, but we were happily coerced into having a fine morning conversation over breakfast filled with (URL HIDDEN) from Beth's travels."
If you're lucky during your stay,you might also get a visit from Beth's very sweet,but very shy,"old lady-cat. She's a darling. \"",,
879929,12591988,2014-05-05,14865494,Mm,Beth was a FANTASTIC host.  She was helpful but not intrusive.  She had banana bread fresh out ot the oven when I arrived!  The room was very clean and exactly as described.  All aspects of the house were clean and welcoming.  Her art work is amazing.  This was my first Airbnb experience.   I had a great stay at Beth's and would recommend it to anyone looking for a welcoming quiet place in Roslindale.
879929,12633559,2014-05-06,7398804,Nancy,Our experience with Beth could only be described as wonderful.  She welcomed us as long lost friends and made sure we were comfortable.  We already knew the neighborhood as our son and his family live a short distance away.  We plan to stay with this airbnb as often as possible.
879929,13099991,2014-05-19,6012126,María,"Mi experiencia en casa de Beth ha sido inmejorable. Me he sentido como en casa. Beth es muy generosa y atenta.  La habitación es muy confortable y cómoda y la casa muy acogedora. He disfrutado mi estancia en Boston mucho gracias a Beth, su conversación interesante y su generosidad al invitarme a comer y llevarme al aeropuerto. Su amabilidad va mucho más allá de un contrato de hospedaje. Gracias, Beth!"
My experience at Beth's  home was excellent. I felt at home. Beth is very generous and attentive. The room is very comfortable. I enjoyed my time in Boston a lot because of Beth,her interesting conversation and her great generosity (for example,when she dropped me off the airport). Thank you,"Beth!\"",,
879929,13170520,2014-05-20,4478505,Sharon,"My parents and I stayed with by Beth and were blown away by how beautiful Beth's home is. She has incredible taste and is INCREDIBLY talented at wood working, art, and decorating. Beth was also happy to share breakfast with us and tell us the history of the area. Couldn't recommend more!"
879929,13377993,2014-05-26,583416,David,"This was a great experience that fully lived up to what I hope for in an AirBnB stay. Beth is a warm and thoughtful host. The house is full of great woodwork, as described. The house is on a quiet, well-kept residential street. UberX was there within a few minutes when I needed to head into town. I'd recommend the place."
879929,13555940,2014-05-30,1361496,Stevi,"Staying with Beth has been one of the best experiences I have had with airbnb.  The place was beautifully kept and filled with her amazing artwork.  The room she offers is quite large and has a very comfortable bed! She was very clear with how to use everything within the space, and I felt very comfortable and at ease. Beth allowed me to ask many questions about her work, and she graciously shared about her art and experiences.   I left her place feeling rested and inspired.  Honestly, I plan to contact her in the future if I need a place to stay near Boston."
879929,13697662,2014-06-02,8133789,Julie,"Staying with Beth was our first Airbnb experience.  She was very welcoming and our stay with her was very comfortable.  She was friendly but not intrusive.  The bed in the guest bedroom is very comfortable (memory foam), so we slept very well.  We didn't spend much time at her home as we were busy most days at a convention but it was still a great stay.  Roslindale is a fantastic town with a lot of great restaurants within walking distance from Beth's house, which was a great perk.  The only small negative is on day 2 of our trip, we noticed the smell of cat food that wasn't there when we got there, but lingered for the rest of the trip.  It was noticeable because I have a particularly sensitive nose, but, it definitely wasn't a big deal.  All-in-all, Beth has a beautiful home, and I would definitely recommend her home to any Airbnb-ers!"
879929,14057824,2014-06-10,7026448,Sandy,Beth was a wonderful host. She is warm and friendly and made us feel at home right away! The place is gorgeous and looks exactly like in the photos. The room and bed is very comfortable. The place is a 5 min walk from the commuter rail (which doesn't run on weekends) and a 15 min walk to the Forest Hills subway stop.
Beth made banana bread for my friend and I when we arrived and treated us to handmade breakfast on the last day at our stay. She also has some wonderful and inspiring stories to share. Thank you so much for everything,"Beth! It was a lovely time in Boston!\"",,,,

We were two graduate students looking for a place to stay until our lease began and Aviva helped out with everything from the laundry to getting our books shipped to the house. The room was really nice and having free wifi, tv, and an a/c were all really appreciated. The house is just off the Bus 51 route and is a quick ten min ride to Forest Hills Station. We would recommend this place."

Aviva made us feel at home, showed us our room and common space.   Beth's home is lovely and clean.  Her artwork and style make the space unique.   Our bedroom and comfortable bed were just right for our needs.  The bathroom was newly refurbished and well-appointed.  The kitchen was available to make tea /coffee and a quick breakfast.  And Beth's cat made us feel welcome as well!!  We would definitely consider a return stay."
879929,21489587,2014-10-18,9145782,Tara,House and host were great.  Neighborhood is lovely- very close to commuter rail as promised and access to the arboretum during fall colors was amazing.

Beth was there to greet us as she emailed she would be. She showed us around, offered us some banana bread she'd just made and snacks cheese from the frig, showed us how to use her coffee maker. She was busy but took the time to explain her creative endeavors to my husband and me, as we were both interested. We marveled at her complex wood sculptures and her descriptions of ongoing workshops and jobs."
The bathroom was designed with ingenuity - clean,bright and efficient. We were so pleased to find Beth,"within walking distance to our daughter's house.\"",,,

We felt extremely welcome and comfortable in her beautiful, artsy home. Beth had a lot of great suggestions as for things to do in Roslindale and in Boston. Beth was quick to reply to all of my messages and questions prior to our stay as well."
The house was as pictured. The bed was so comfortable and the shower was amazing. Beth's home is in a safe and beautiful location,with great public transportation. We used both the commuter rail and bus line,both of which are located right down the street.,,,

The bathroom is located just adjacent to bedroom. Although it was shared , but we never faced difficulty in accessing it. Beth is a great hostess , she even cooked breakfast for us and we all had breakfast together. We visited  Boston for site seeing and after the whole day of walking her home was such a cosy retreat for us. This was my first time using airbnb but certainly Beth has raised the bar for any upcoming trips. I would like to stay in her home anytime I am back in the city"

Beth war sehr  hilfsbereit und wir haben eine schöne Zeit gehabt."

One of the charming aspects of this experience is the large number of art objects that Beth has fashioned from wood.  She is a master craft person and teaches word working to various age groups, from children through adults.  I enjoyed my stay very much.

She was quite respectful of our needs and answered all questions at the earliest. Best part about our stay was how we discussed about our passion/hobbies. Art -which is quite visible across her well crafted house, speaks a lot about her creativeness imbibed with tremendous  passion. I'd recommend everyone if you stay with her , try to talk to her as she has had few great experiences to share :) thanks Beth for the accommodation and I hope to see you in near future."

Inside was just a nice as her photos had shown and it felt really cozy. The beds were both really comfortable and the neighborhood was quiet at night which made getting up the next morning really hard! :) Megan's place had everything you could ask for and she left a really handy binder which answered any questions I had. The neighborhood was excellent and we easily walked to the village for food and transportation.  Thank you to Megan for making our stay incredibly comfortable!
6390634,32649906,2015-05-19,9525301,Sunil,I had a wonderful stay at Danielle's place. Some of the major pluses were: 1. it is literally right next to the T. Get down and walk 3 minutes to the house right in front. This made it extremely convenient to go downtown and back. 2. The house is very new and spanking clean--it was the closest to a nice 4 star hotel-style look and feel  I've been in. And finally 3. Danielle was a very friendly hostess.

6390634,35484961,2015-06-19,34118870,Sara,"Before we decided to stay at Danielle's I read a review that said her place was better than a 4 star hotel and boy was that reviewer correct! Her home is beautiful and feels so homey, but yet still so clean and new. We really did not want to leave. We did a ton of sightseeing and always felt relieved to be heading back to our temporary home! Communication was a breeze and they could not have been nicer. If we ever travel back to the Boston area we will stay here again if at all possible! It was a far better experience than we could have ever imagined."
6390634,36238354,2015-06-26,6030312,Lozza And Willy,Good location - an easy metro ride 20 mins out of Downtown Boston. Get yourself a CharlieTicket for easy rides to and from! House is on a safe street and is up a small hill 5 min walk from the metro station.
Super clean apartment,comfortable bedding,clean towels and good hot water. Coffee,tea and morning snacks were super appreciated.,,
Key exchange is not an issue as the house has a special code lock,which makes arrival that tad easier!,,,,

I would highly recommend staying with Danielle if you plan visit to Boston."
6390634,43959095,2015-08-23,38177063,Saviz,"Danielle's house is very clean, cosy and comfortable. Even though she was abroad during our stay, lots of small handwritten tips scattered across the house gave a nice feeling of attention. Snacks and fruits available to us made us feel at home. The location is great, with the house situated in a quiet residential neighborhood while being less than 5 minutes walk from the T stop, where you'll find a nice array of restaurants. In short, we had an awesome stay at Danielle's house and will not hesitate to recommend the place to our friends in the future!"
6390634,44505693,2015-08-26,12370690,Jay,Staying at Danielle's place was an absolute pleasure. Luckily I had the whole place to myself and was able to relax and unwind and recover mug of the sleep lost travelling from Australia. Everything was as described. Although Danielle was not there she arranged one of her friends to meet me who was lovely. Will definitely stay there again next time I am in Boston.

It was very clean and comfortable and the snacks left out for guests were a bonus! Danielle was away when we stayed but her friend Leah (who lives a couple blocks away) was there to welcome us on arrival and assured us we could call if we needed help with anything. The other guests were in and out of the house at various times and sharing the bathroom/kitchen/lounge didn't really cause any hassle. Really impressed with the house and the cleanliness. Definitely recommend.

You may share the condo with other visitors so be aware.  We had wonderful housemates from Taiwan - a voice translator on our phones made it a memorable experience."
There is a place about a .75 mi away where you can leave your car for free (if you drove). We left ours there all week.  The condo and car are in safe neighborhoods.,,,,,
The T station is at the bottom of the hill.  You can buy a Charlie Card for $19 and have unlimited bus/train access for a week.  Definitely worth it!  You can get to down town in ~20 minutes.,,,,,
"Absolutely take a stroll through the Forest Hills Cemetery at the top of the hill.  It's gorgeous and a great place to walk. \"",,,,,
6390634,47669006,2015-09-21,12396938,Andrea,"Danielle's house was cozy and very comfortable. I appreciated the notes she left around the house with helpful tips. The house was clean and bright. My husband and I stayed there, the room was nice and simple, however I didn't read thoroughly that it was a full-size bed, which was quite too small for us (so keep that in mind if you are traveling with a companion)."
The location was right next to the T so it was easy to get to the city. We rented a car,which I would not recommend doing as parking was not easy within that neighborhood (and a parking ticket is $40!)  It's all permit parking or two-hour parking so it was a hassle having a car. Definitely in the future I would recommend use Uber to get around the city as driving in Boston was a bit scary with so much traffic and all the impatient drivers.,,,,
The coffee shop down the block was amazing (homemade donuts!!) and there is a really cool cemetery right at the top of the street that was amazing to wander thru.,,,,,
Thank you for hosting us,we had a lovely time!,,,,

Everything thought out, written explanations and recommendations, sticky notes for every possible question and all sorts of tasty goodies  for the quests. The location is great, we managed to park our car right next to the house. The metro station is a few minutes away and only 15-20 minutes ride to the main attractions in the city center. When back in Boston - we hope to stay with Danielle again. Highly recommended !"
6390634,49661805,2015-10-05,43116142,Aaron,Staying at Danielle’s place was an absolutely topnotch experience!
The first thing we noticed was how clean well kept the house is. It looks exactly like what is pictured online,and is even more inviting in person. We found all kinds of helpful sticky notes and a welcome information book to help us settle in comfortably. Our bedroom was also very clean,and had ample space in the closet for both our bags.,,,
We had the pleasure of meeting Danielle,and she is super cool. She was always willing to answer any questions we had and was very helpful pointing us to the best coffee shops and food in the area. She truly made us feel right at home.,,,,
Hopefully we can visit the city again soon,and when we do we hope to stay with Danielle again! She made our first experience with Airbnb absolutely fantastic!,,,,

6390634,51016695,2015-10-17,21170397,Jamie,Had a great stay at Danielle's place. Had the entire place to myself most of the time and there were helpful little notes throughout the apartment. Exactly as described and very close to the train.

El departamento es precioso y el barrio muy bonito, además de que la pieza era exactamente como se mostraba. Estuvimos solos en el departamento casi todos los días, y Leah nos contactó para saber si todo estaba bien. ¡Se agradece tremendamente la preocupación!"
Pudimos estacionar todos los días en el estacionamiento pagado que está muy cerca,además de encontrar negocios,restaurantes y metro a una distancia muy conveniente,lo cual hizo que pasáramos mucho tiempo en la zona del departamento,"además de poder cocinar allí.\"",

Modern, clean, perfect for the T line, really comfortable and overall really really good. It was a perfect place to base ourselves for our 5 day stay in Boston. Personally I loved that there was a cup of tea and some porridge available every morning which I appreciate and also the cemetery nearby allowed me to go for a run early every morning which was brilliant. We had some nice chats with Danielle on the weekend mornings and she gave us a bit of background on Boston and overall I would highly recommend this place..."

Danielle has a nice home and its in a great location for Boston. it's easy to get downtown from her place. Her home is cozy and the full bed was sufficient for two people. I loved the fig bars, oatmeal, and little snacks that she left out for us. Everything in the kitchen is labeled so you know where to find things. Danielle is very easy going and she took time to get to know us. We had to park on another street because we stayed for a decent amount of time. Once you find the location, which Leah will give you, you'll be all set. We'd stay here again if we were in Boston!!"

6390634,73883388,2016-05-11,61394846,Joseph,"Danielle was a terrific host. I was out early and back later so our interaction was mostly chatting over some coffee in the AM, and eating the excellent breakfast samplings. Her place is very nice, spacious and clean.  The location is excellent for picking up the train to downtown,  the parking on the street is limited, but the parking lot down the street is only $8 per day.  This was my first experience with Airbnb and if the hosts are all like Danielle it would be perfect."

It made a very enjoyable place to lay our head at night and including breakfast coffee and snacks along with personal items that may have been forgotten was very appreciated. My only suggestion would be to add a mirror in the bedroom. THANK YOU SO MUCH! Recommended with no reservations!"

The house and room were absolutely spotless, and the little snacks (fresh fruit and snack bars and yogurt) and lovely teas were welcome. The neighborhood is very convenient to the T, and had a really good coffee shop and and a commodious pub nearby. Also, the famed arboretum and beautiful cemetery are easy walking distance.

11498583,66268252,2016-03-20,32048655,Anna,The very small room was incorrectly advertised as a studio. The as advertised futon was old and worn and the sheets appeared unclean.The room security was a flimsy hollow inside door in view of the other 'hostel' rooms opening onto a cramped common area.
"The stairs to the second floor space were extremely dark without a light. The back door entry way to the street was open at all times.\"",,,,,
11498583,66914912,2016-03-25,60286634,Josh,Ricardo's place worked out great and he was readily available to answer any questions. The location and off street parking was perfect. I would definitely recommend this listing to anyone that is familiar with hostel travel.
11498583,68234761,2016-04-03,10942382,Subba,Ricardo was quite responsive whenever he was reached out to. The common toilet (there is one functional) and another soon to be functional for 4 apartments. This is very inconvenient. There is also some renovations going on and the place smells of paint. It is a soft bed and hence very troublesome for people who have back problem
11498583,69102415,2016-04-09,30232000,Julie,"The place is well located, very close to the Maverick subway station. It includes a private room (which is quite small and the bed is a bit leaning but that's ok), two shared kitchens and two shared bathrooms. Thus, unlike what is written in the description, it is not a private studio. The kitchens and bathrooms are however cleaned every day. Overall we felt comfortable during our stay and recommend Ricardo's place."
11498583,69724426,2016-04-12,56545943,Nicola,"Although this is definitely a private room (with shared bathrooms/kitchen/common areas) and not a studio as advertised, the hostel situation was clearly explained by Ricardo prior to our arrival."
The house is located very close to Maverick station making it a great base for exploring the city,the rooms are clean and there is secure keyless entry. Room #4 is very small,and as others have noted the floor does tilt making the bed a little uneven,"but it's fine for a few nights stay :)\"",,
11498583,70664204,2016-04-19,22021367,Rebekah,"Worst experience. Stay away. It's a dump. The floor is tilted so steep you roll out of the cheap futon if you don't hang on. The shared bathroom only had one half of a shower slide pane so the entire bathroom was soaked when anyone showered. Because each room of this dilapidated building was used to rent out, the tiny bath rarely had any hot water for longer than a minute. Rooms were not cleaned each day. Hostel International would never endorse this place. Code violations were everywhere you looked. Charged over $100/night - hotel level pricing for that neighborhood. Total rip off. Never again."
11498583,71336700,2016-04-24,62605190,Tony,"No complaints about my stay. Quiet place, not much going on pretty clean. Room was a little small, but two fit with no issue."

Do not expect a luxurious appartment to be alone in a spacious and comfortable bed. It is a simple futon in a small private room with shared spaces. But you are about 3 minutes by foot from the metro station and if you take a walk to the end of the street, you'll have the best view of the city. Enjoy!"
11498583,74457051,2016-05-15,53220263,Kirby,"Would definitely recommend if you're someone who is fine with shared bathrooms (as I know not everyone is). We mostly just used this as a place to crash during our weekend and did not need anything super fancy, so it was perfect. Location is great, and only a few minutes walk to Maverick and some amazing restaurants nearby. Onsite parking was also great to have and Ricardo was there to answer a question I had upon arrival."

We had 3 people staying in the apartment and the sofa bed that 2 people used was awful, very small and old thin mattress provided no support and you could feel the springs sticking into your back. For the amount we paid for a boutique apartment, this bed was a big disappointment. We would recommend staying here but only after the mattress and bed are replaced. The price was very expensive however it was July 4th week."

Great location - we could walk to a lot of places and it was also really close to the T (walking distance to Boylston T station as well as Chinatown T station) if we wanted to go somewhere further away. The only negative was that the crib supplied was not as good as the one Seamless supplied on our previous stay.  Rather than a proper wooden crib with bars, it was more like a playpen / travel cot and the mattress did not seem very comfortable."

We really appreciated her hospitality and that she was so helpful whenever we had questions. The location of the apartment is handy for getting out and about around Boston and Cambridge. It acted as a lovely spot to retire to at the end of a day out exploring and was very peaceful during sleeping hours. We felt just as comfortable staying out and doing our own thing as we were hanging out there for a relaxed evening watching telly and chatting. Thank you Deana and Michael for making us feel so welcome – although we’re probably having some kind of cinnamon withdrawal... Come say hi any time you happen to be in NW England.
7836038,51597019,2015-10-21,30609577,Joel,Deana and Michael are a really nice couple who were very accommodating hosts. The area is a little out of the way but very close to the T station if you are going to use it and not too far of a walk to some nice places to eat and drink.
"The place was what we needed for a short stay which was great and the only negative I would say is the room is reasonably small so a little difficult if you have a lot of stuff.

7836038,68425453,2016-04-04,60880355,Quan You,"We stayed at Deana apartment from 01 Apr to 04 Apr16. The apt was conveniently located, about 100m walk from the nearest Andrew station. Deana and micheal were nice and hospitable.  She made arrangement to work from home to welcome us as we arrived at her apt on a weekday 11am. The room was clean neat and tidy. Fresh clean towels were provided. Bathroom was clean and water pressure was good. We would recommend her place for people traveling to Boston."
7836038,70469816,2016-04-18,16381039,Malcolm,Deana was a wonderful host and provided us with everything we could need. She was very kind and considerate. The location was great and easy to get to everything. I would definitely stay here again if I were in Boston and would recommend it to anyone.
7836038,72595716,2016-05-03,67674495,Danilo,"Awesome place, really nice and super close to public transportation."
7836038,74756200,2016-05-16,67127959,Bérénice,"Accueil très chaleureux de Deana, qui nous a accommodés alors que nous sommes arrivés plus tard que prévu. L'appartement est très bien aménagé, avec une cuisine et un salon spacieux. La chambre est assez petite mais correcte pour les besoins de voyageurs. Pendant notre séjour, c'était très calme, pas de bruit de voisinage. Le quartier est par endroit pas très chic, mais une station de métro nous reliant rapidement au centre-ville et autres attractions est très proche. Bref, je recommande sans hésiter! :)"
7836038,78016348,2016-06-05,32800832,Hachihin,Great stay! The bed was really comfortable and the hosts are really nice.
7836038,78981502,2016-06-10,1159134,Stephanie,"Deana and Michael were wonderful hosts.  I stayed with them for 5 nights.  The location is convenient because it is so close to the T.  If you like to explore on foot, you can walk to South End and downtown.  I recommend you explore South Boston too because it's nice to experience a neighborhood where locals live.  I appreciated having a kitchen to make my own meals, the porch to enjoy the outdoors, and access to a washer and dryer."
7836038,80042223,2016-06-15,22216603,Ling,"They were great hosts, flexible in check-in and check-out, and provided everything you need, including wifi. Their home is a few minutes' walk to the red line T stop, Andrew, which is convenient to reach most of Boston. Quiet neighborhood."
7836038,81053978,2016-06-20,64490622,Paul,"Dean and Michael were nice hosts.  I had a lot of activities early in the morning up to late in the evening, which means that I have not seen them much.  The room is NOT what is in the picture (this is their sitting room) but a small room with just a bed.  This was not a problem for me as all I really needed was a bed (and it was comfortable) and I had access to a good working table in the kitchen."
7836038,86155742,2016-07-15,51417637,Nicholas,"Deana and Michael were great hosts, they made me feel right at home and are super easy going. It was almost more like staying with friends than anything else. The room was clean and comfortable, as was the rest of the apartment. The location was convenient to the waterfront area, which was just what I needed. It is also just around the corner from a metro stop, which made commuting to/from the airport a breeze. I would definitely recommend staying with Deana and Michael to anyone visiting Boston."
7836038,87380472,2016-07-19,83513551,Debbie,"Deana made us feel confortable right from the start.  Easy going, she provided nice tips on how to get there and there in boston and made available to us a lonely planets guide to Boston.  Very appreciated."
The location is stellar,"in 10 minute you can hop on the red line and be en route to downtown.  Or you can walk 10 minutes and be on the beach.\"",,,,
7836038,88393644,2016-07-24,39199751,Nicholas,"Deana and Michael were fantastic hosts. Due to our schedule and the timing of our trip, we didn't get to interact much, but even still, they were very friendly and very accommodating."
The room was clean,comfortable and the A/C was appreciated during a hot and humid Boston weekend.,,,,
The place was easy to find and it was incredibly convenient to get in and out of the city and to the airport.,,,,,

Deana went out of her way and got me some things to eat for breakfast before our arrival. We felt like we were staying with friends, one night we were really tired and went to bed early, but another night we stayed up and hung out, which was really fun! The room was cozy, but comfortable and was exactly what we were hoping for. They really helped us get acclimated with the city. They gave us a tour book and told us how to use the trains to get around. We highly recommend this place for another adventurous couple!"
7836038,91759224,2016-08-06,45644846,Amélie,Deana nous a bien accueilli. La chambre était propre et le lit confortable. Le logement est prêt d'un arrêt de métro. Nous avons passé un agréable séjour.
11514237,68473661,2016-04-05,7836546,Summer,"This was a great place to stay! Great decor and loved all the color and spirit of the place. The host, Zoe, was super friendly and very welcoming. She was very helpful as far as giving directions and recommending local places to check out. Located in a wonderful neighborhood. JP is the coolest. Lots of great shops and restaurants to check out. It was very close and convenient to the Green street stop on the Orange line. Super easy to get downtown, and very quick. There was some parking in the neighborhood at night and some 2 hour parking available close by. Its a beautiful place to stay while you are visiting Boston. Super comfy and sweet attic apartment, very private and very fun place to stay!"
11514237,71258126,2016-04-24,5514817,Alexandra,"We loved Zoe's place! It was clean, thoughtfully decorated, and in the perfect location. Zoe gave us awesome suggestions for food and drink, and her apartment was neat, comfortable and welcoming. She was completely available and an excellent host. I highly recommend it for an easy and relaxing stay!!!!"
11514237,74428588,2016-05-15,70640498,Alec,"Zoe's place was fantastic! It was exactly what we were looking for as far as location and price range. Zoe's place is cute and fun, and in a wonderful location - just a short ride to downtown Boston. Our stay was definitely a huge highlight of our trip!"
11514237,76572946,2016-05-28,736391,Aja,We loved Zoe's place. The location was so convenient  (right by a train stop and near so many places to eat). Check in was super easy and Zoe was very accommodating (brought us fans since we were there on an oddly warm day). We loved it!
11514237,81313586,2016-06-22,1777080,G.J.,"Zoe was a great host - super flexible with check-in and check-out time.  The apartment looks just like the photos.  Bed is a little tight for two people, but comfortable.  Good bathroom and shower.  Location is great, very close to the T and walking distance to many cafes, shops, post office, cleaners, etc."
11514237,82214703,2016-06-26,17069469,Shay,This place was amazing.
"Zoe's family is super helpful and nice. The apartment is actually better than shown in the pictures. For an airbnb place it felt more like a home than a rental. There's a supermarket 10 minutes away and a ton of parks near by. It's also super convenient if you need to use public transportation the subway is right on there and you can get anywhere in Boston from there.  They even gave is great recommendations on where to eat. The only complaint i have is that we didn't get to stay longer!\"",,,,,
11514237,86760592,2016-07-17,64800941,Jorge,"Lo que más me agradó de Zoe fue su permanente disposición por cuidar que todo estuviera en orden. Fue increíble cómo cuidó de cada detalle. Incluso, como ella no podía estar el día de mi llegada, dejó todo previsto para que alguien de su familia me recibiera. En todo momento sentí que Zoe estaba pendiente de todo. El departamento es muy agradable; un poco viejo, pero muy bien mantenido y con todas las cosas necesarias para que no te falte nada. No dudaría en volver allí."
11514237,87773618,2016-07-21,16023298,Robert,Zoe was awesome! Can't ask for more from a host. Had great suggestions on where to go near by that did not disappoint. I wish all host could be like her. And i don't think i have gotten a better nights sleep through airbnb.
11514237,89345988,2016-07-28,15160352,Daniel,"It's a cosy, neat and surprisingly large apartment in a safe and quiet neighborhood, with a train station and a bike rental station (Hubway) right around the corner. I'd definitely stay here again, immediately felt like home. Zoe was very helpful and responded quickly whenever we needed anything, she even offered us to park our car in the driveway after we got towed (as we've learned, Jamaica Plains is hell for non-residential drivers). We really had a great stay!"
11514237,91442991,2016-08-05,1345130,Bridget,Zoe's place was awesome! Both her and her mum made us feel very welcome.

The home was spacious, clean, centrally located and thoroughly enjoyable. I recommend it highly, especially for larger groups."

6160803,35353758,2015-06-17,2877170,Jc,"My friends and I love our stay and love the space.  It was a nice change after so many days at a hotel.  It was a nice quiet neighborhood but it doesn't seem like the best part of town.  Jenny is very prompt at responding to every question.  Very lovely front yard.  Though, 10 am check out was a little too early for us... Overall, I'd still recommend this place."
6160803,35475913,2015-06-19,4607064,Gauthier,We really enjoyed our stay at Thomas & Jenny's place. Evrything was as described on the listing.
We didn't stayed much in the neighborhood during the day but it doesn't seem to be the most touristic place :) So,make sure you have a car or take public transportation to go to downtown Boston.,,,,
"Thanks again for hosting us :)\"",,,,,
6160803,35837440,2015-06-22,34584185,Steven,"The host is super polite, and all instructions and house rules are very clearly laid out.  More importantly, is is the best house we ever booked for our 10-people church retreat / gathering!  The house is in a super great location, 5 gorgeous bed rooms with 3 queen-size beds and 4 single beds.  The neighborhood is very quite and calm, and we used the fantastic kitchen for our lunch and dinner cooking.  There are many other choices in Boston area, but I will say this is the best one I'm ever seen.  If my church is doing another retreat, we will definitely come back to book this house again!  Both bathrooms are super clean and tidy.  Couch area is wonderfully comfortable for group chatting and playing board games.  The nice huge patio on the first floor is another perfect place for group discussion / activity / prayer!  We even leveraged the dim sum (3-min walk) nearby for one of our lunches!  Cannot think of a better place than this lovely house to host a 10-people event!"
6160803,36018318,2015-06-24,32534106,John,We had the most amazing time while our stay in Boston.  The house was more then the pictures and other reviews wrote about.  Thomas and Jenny are great hosts who answered all our questions.  The house is very clean and a great place to stay that is a quick drive to the city.
"Would surely stay here again if we ever go back to Boston and would recommend the house to our friends.\"",,,,,
6160803,36405364,2015-06-28,27146046,Mona,"We were two families – 9 persons - staying here for a few days, and we had a great time. The house was very well equipped. We loved the big and airy rooms with very good beds. Everything was new, nice and tidy. We had a great stay in Boston, and we will recommend this house to any families og groups of friends going to Boston."
6160803,37071500,2015-07-04,23749481,James,"We had a great time in Boston and Thomas and Jenny's lovely home contributed to that, There place is very clean,very spacious and everything is in working order. The parking is ideal and it's location is  easy to get to downtown Boston and the various interstates. Their place is quiet and the yard is very nice, and the kitchen is nice and having a easy to use washer and dryer made things nice (We travel with three kiddos) The beds were almost to comfy.  I suggest bringing an alarm.  As we were rushing to catch our flight, I couldn't find the email with the lock box code . In a rush i texted Jenny asking for the code, literally within the minute she replied back and away we went. Talk about great communication when I needed it most. Thank you~"
6160803,37351530,2015-07-06,35330735,Ryan,"A group of us stayed here for the July 4th weekend and had an amazing experience. We had never used Airbnb before and were overly pleased with the accommodations provided. The house was very clean and had everything we needed, all of our inquiries were quickly responded too and the entire experience was very simple and easy and we were all happy that we had stayed here rather than a hotel."
The only issue we did have (and is in no way a reflection to the property) was getting a taxi. We were told that taxi's don't come to the area often and even when we called multiple times,we waited hours and the drivers didn't even know where Fenway Park was and wanted us (tourists) to direct them.,,,,
I highly recommend staying here and using Uber if you do want to take your own vehicle into the city,it worked wonders.,,,,
Again,"amazing experience. If we travel back to Boston  we would 100% stay here again.\"",,,,
6160803,38277278,2015-07-14,33108511,Shannon,"This was a very nice apartment and super convenient for my family since it was only minutes away from my family in Dorchester. It was fully equipped with just about everything we needed, very clean, spacious, and the neighbors were really nice. We would definitely stay here again."
6160803,38858477,2015-07-19,34790023,Michael,"This ended up being a perfect rental for our business trip. Each one of our team members had their own bedroom, and the space was clean and comfortable for everyone. The home is within walking distance of the T, which we made good use of. Most of our trip was spent around the harbor/financial district, so we didn't spend much time in the neighborhood around the home, but it seemed like there were enough businesses within walking distance of the home that it would have been convenient to pick up takeout or groceries had we needed. My colleagues and I may come back to Boston for other business, and if we do I would not hesitate at all to stay here again."
6160803,39378957,2015-07-23,31693701,Kelli,"A group of 8 (4 adults, 4 children) stayed here for 3 days in July.  The house was very clean and well equipped.  We had plenty of room.  The upstairs room of the apartment is a great place for kids to play without having to worry about bothering anyone downstairs. Thomas and Jenny were great hosts and very responsive.  A minor issue was addressed extremely quickly.  Would stay here again!"
6160803,39622247,2015-07-25,33915369,Jenny,We really enjoyed our time at this house in Dorchester.  Everything was exactly as the pictures showed it to be.  The house was immaculate and had everything that you could need.  The T stop was about a 15-20 minute walk.  The owners were very responsive to our questions.  I would not hesitate to stay here again.
6160803,39786802,2015-07-26,36060066,William,"The apartment was as described, very nice, good communications, would recommend highly to anyone going to Boston, or to Fenway Park for a game like we did."

6160803,44552138,2015-08-27,2245051,Dave,Thomas and Jenny were quick to respond to inquires about the space and worked with me to settle our group in our accommodations. The pictures represented the listing well and we were incredibly pleased with the amenities provided to us. The neighborhood was a little difficult to navigate due to the small streets (FYI if you are driving in using a big vehicle)
6160803,45497141,2015-09-03,40970256,Yiqing,"This house provided us everything we needed during our stay. We had total of 7 people stayed there for a week. The apartment looked exactly the same as shown on the website. Spacious living area along with a fully equipped modern kitchen, everything was just beyond our expectations. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. And Jenny the landlord, she is very responsive. She answered all of our questions quickly and patiently. Overall, me and my family were more than satisfied to stay in Jenny's apartment. I would strongly recommend it to anyone who  is looking for a comfy  home to stay in Boston."

It was nice to stay in a local neighborhood to get the real feel of living in the Boston area.  It was close to the T and also just an Uber drive away from everything."
6160803,49772278,2015-10-06,7802535,Ryan,Thomas and Jenny provided a carefree stay in their beautiful home. Arrival and leaving were seamless and our family loved all being together in one place. All was very clean and we needed nothing. I would certainly stay here again.
6160803,49971147,2015-10-08,33687355,Pat,"Loved our two days / two nights at Thomas and Jenny's place.  Perfect for four, retired couples traveling together.  Close to Boston area venues. Nice kitchen and dining / living room.  Comfortable and clean.  Great place for an extended family reunion or larger party of 8-10.  We'd stay here again!!"
6160803,50456249,2015-10-12,22011449,Cindy,"The listing was nicer then pictures show. The house is a lovely older updated centerhall style home. (Beautifully restored wood floors!) The unit we stayed in was the second and third floor. It was perfect for my family which was in from all over for my daughter's wedding. And it was quite, too. The parking was easy (two places in the driveway) and plenty free on the street. The location offers easy access to Boston and the neighborhood is safe.  I highly recommend this for business groups or extended families."

リビングダイニングとキッチンはとても広くて快適でした。キッチンは今回使いませんでしたが、食器やカトラリー、鍋等そろっています。チェックインの時間が夜の10時くらいになってしまい、頂いていたキーナンバーで入れなかったのですが、電話をしたらすぐに対応して頂けました。なお、ダウンタウンからは電車で20分くらいです。家から駅までは12分ほど歩きますが、特に問題は感じませんでした。おすすめしたいお家です。,,,,,

The house was fully stocked with kitchen utensils, a washer & dryer, and plenty of extra pillows to satisfy your comfort needs.

6160803,61791363,2016-02-08,9642297,Murat,Hosts were great and the house was very nice and clean. Everything was as expected based on the descriptions. Not too far from subway so relatively easy to get into down town. Quite neighbourhood with a great cafe nearby (Dot2Dot).
6160803,64737068,2016-03-06,16640784,Justine,The house and location were perfect for our last minute trip to Boston! I highly recommend this wonderful home!
6160803,66401011,2016-03-22,55022027,Jillian,"The house was easy to find and close to a CVS, package store and restaurants. The space was very clean, nicely decorated, spacious and inviting. There was plenty of room for the seven of us to hang out in the main area. The yellow roses on the kitchen table was a lovely welcome. The bedrooms only have mini blinds (no curtains) so it is very sunny and bright in the morning- consider bringing an eye mask if you want to sleep in- I did and it was fine! We had such a fun trip and all wished we could have spent even more time at the house. Thomas and Jenny checked in with us on our second day to make sure we were all settled in which was considerate. I would definitely come back!"
6160803,68315455,2016-04-04,13959817,Jill,"The house was perfect for our group of 7 and would have been comfortable for up to 10.  It is very clean and just like shown in the pictures.  Being able to park 2 cars was great, and it was an easy 10 minute walk to the T.  I highly recommend this home and would definitely stay here if we travel to the Boston area again."
6160803,70866326,2016-04-21,38846538,Stacey And Nate,"Our stay in the Dorchester House worked out very well for our week long stay as we were in town for the Boston Marathon. The sleeping options fit our group of friends and family perfectly. The walk to the train at Fields Corners wasn't too bad. The keyless entry was perfect for our large group coming and going at different times. We made a decent amount of meals at the house to save money and all I really missed having was a cookie sheet and luckily I brought my own seasoning because this house doesn't have any. There is a nice pasta strainer not pictured in case anyone was wondering. If you do come with a larger group, take care to space out showering and possibly have some shower the night before. The hot water only goes so far."
But despite that it was a great stay and a good experience. I would recommend it to other groups like ours.,,,,,
Thank you Thomas and Jenny,,,,,

6160803,71655612,2016-04-27,68326236,Kevin,"Quiet neighborhood, accurate description.  There are two beds on the attic but they are pretty much only good for one person.  Condo was well equipped for cooking."
6160803,74485201,2016-05-15,22551957,Jose Alberto,"We stayed at this property in Dorchester, Boston for 7 days and it fulfilled our expectations.  We were a family of 8 members attending graduation ceremonies in Boston.  The apartment is located on the 2nd floor of a large home and it accomodated 8 persons in 3 bedrooms and 2 in the attic.  The apt. was clean and it looked exactly the same as what the photos portrayed. The kitchen has all the necessary utensils, washer, dryer, towels,  and everything you need.  We enjoyed the cleanliness, comfort and felt like at home.  The only inconvenience was the steep stairs both entering the apt. and going into the attic. especially since we had 3 senior citizens with health problems, still we managed to assist them while going up the stairs.  The apt. is well-aired and lighted, and the beds are comfortable.  The use of WC got a little busy in the morning since there are only two of them but we managed as well.  The area in Dorchester is safe and with easy access to and from downtown Boston and other areas.  I highly recommend this apt. for its cleanliness, size, and the frequent communication with the owner who is willing to assist any needs one has.  The parking space is shared with other tenants but the property has enough space to park several cars.  Quiet neighborhood. This property definitely honors the Airbnb policy of renting a home and feeling like part of that home, surroundings and environment.  Two thumbs up!"
6160803,75058752,2016-05-18,21543630,Beth,"A great value. This home accommodated seven women who traveled together to Boston for a board meeting and it cost our nonprofit a fraction of what we would have had to spend on hotel rooms. Easily accessible to downtown via Uber for roughly $15 each way. Clean, roomy and comfortable for our two-night stay. If we would stay here again, I'd want to remember to pack an extra hotel-sized soap (toiletries aren't provided) and a roll of toilet paper, as the owners request that you replace what is used. Note that this home is on the second floor; we didn't have a problem lugging our carry-on luggage up the steep flight of stairs, but with larger bags or frailer guests you may have difficulty."
6160803,75608898,2016-05-22,46744282,Diane,"This was a great vacation rental.  It was probably the cleanest vacation rental we have ever stayed in and in a very quiet neighborhood.  The setup as far as bedrooms and bathrooms was perfect for my family of seven adults.  When we initially had trouble locking up and called our hosts, they answered immediately and were very helpful.  Jenny also checked in with us on our second day to make sure we were doing okay.  The rental was exactly as described.  I wish I had re-read the previous reviews the week before we arrived so that I wouldn't have been surprised by the bright sunshine in the bedrooms each morning.  The kitchen is adequately supplied with cooking utensils but not what I would call a fully stocked kitchen, especially for a large group.  As another reviewer pointed out, if you have as many people staying as we did, you will want to space out the showers but we would have to do that at our home too.  It was also a little disconcerting after arriving to find that we had to immediately go to the store because there were only 2 partial rolls of toilet paper for the 2 bathrooms.  I knew we had to provide everything but I didn't think that was going to have to be our very first stop.  Parking was exactly as described but we didn't need the parking area since we utilized the subway."
6160803,76864883,2016-05-29,26025511,Hailey,Not only were the pictures and descriptions accurate - but Jenny was an absolute pleasure to work with. Door keypad entry is genius and worked perfectly with our large group of 9 other girls going different places at different times. We had so much fun and would absolutely recommend both this place and it's hosts to anyone interested.

I had a large group of friends and family members, about 13 of us, coming for my son's graduation and I rented  both units. One on the first floor and the other one on the second,  Thomas and Jenny own both places.  The house is beautiful, spacious, well decorated, fully equipped, and very close to Boston and the subway station. It looks exactly like the pictures. Jenny was absolutely fabulous!

The location is very nice. A quiet neighborhood next to que old Harbour,which is now a park where walk,run or just stay. Great views of Boston and the sea. There is a nice walk till the JFK Library and Museum. Nevertheless,the place is far away from the city center. There is a subway stop which is 15' walking. You could take a bus to arrive to the subway in 4',but the bus is not very frequent and is not worth to wait. The nearest supermarket is 15' too,"although there is a little grocery within the urbanization. There are no restaurants or similar near but a little one (more a take away) next to the groceries.\""

5690424,30105738,2015-04-17,29741597,Manny,"A gem on Beacon Hill is what we found in many ways. Our family converged in Boston for a medical emergency. We needed a place that would be centrally located in a good area with space to accommodate a large family. We found that and much  much more with Gloria and her apartment.  First, because of the nature of the medical emergency we did not know when we would be able to take possession of the apartment. When we explained our situation to Gloria, Gloria and her staff offered to be available at whatever time things became stable at the hospital. True to their word, they met us at the apartment at a late hour and were very accommodating. The apartment itself is a lovely, bright apartment with grand areas. Although the apartment is large enough to receive guests it still has a cozy feel to it. Our family came together as a group there during the emergency. The apartment also became the place where our daughter came to after the  surgery. Being there in that environment was very positive for her and all of us. The apartment is situated in a perfect place. Within steps you have all of the conveniences that you could want being in the heart of Beacon Hill. The apartment is central to virtually everything in Boston yet provides a quiet haven free from the hustle and bustle a City can bring. Our family plans to return soon to celebrate our blessings.  Manny and Family"
5690424,30626391,2015-04-25,6849491,Martin,This place is stunning and Gloria showed us great hospitality! I can only recommend staying at her apartment.

Perfect location a few blocks from the commons. Coffee shops, restaurants and pleasantries all steps from the front door. Would stay there again every time I am in Boston!"
5690424,32687847,2015-05-20,30077198,Peter,"Gloria was very friendly and helpful and personally let us into the property.  The accomodations are very spacious and it is in a prime location.  Walking distance to many attractions, plentiful cabs and close to the T.  We had a group of 7 and could have used some extra seating, glassware and bed linens/blankets.  This may not be an issue for smaller groups. Gloria was quick to respond to the few questions we did have after settling in."
5690424,33786341,2015-06-01,26393538,Pim,"Gloria was a terrific host. She called to check that we arrived and were able to get in as she was unfortunately unavailable to meet us. She then stayed on the phone with us and walked us through the entire house (which is spacious, has wonderful lighting and looks exactly like listed photographs). We had some issues with the internet that Gloria, as soon as she was notified, took care of immediately. Highly recommend. Gorgeous neighbourhood, great location. A really wonderful host and a beautiful home."
5690424,34857429,2015-06-13,15124045,Minsu,"Gloria's apartment is amazing. That's very spacious, well-equipped, and beautiful. We were literally surprised when we arrived at the place with nice vintage interiors. Furthermore, it's located in a very fancy district in Boston. I am sure any other will love this apartment and its neighborhood. The only problem was that cleaning was not perfect. But, Gloria kindly explained there was some mistakes, and handled it. Overall, I highly recommend this place, especially if you like a spacious and vintage designs."
5690424,35942305,2015-06-23,33863862,Nancy,We felt the apt. was too minimally furnished and supplied given the daily fee paid.  The kitchen needs more equipment to cook comfortably. The apt. in general needs to be cleaner when guests arrive. There should be smoke detectors in every bedroom and a fire extinguisher should be supplied. These issues can be easily corrected.
5690424,36870123,2015-07-02,32577465,Yuya,"Gloria was very responsive and gave us great guidance to our questions, and the flat was amazing with really cozy atmosphere. The place was very quiet although in the center of the city, and the rooftop terrace was very relaxing with nice view. It is a rare opportunity to stay in such a great neighborhood of old Boston. We would definitely love to come back to stay at Gloria's place again. Thanks so much Gloria!"
5690424,38602717,2015-07-17,3248908,Lindsay,"We really enjoyed our stay here! It was just as we expected. The location is phenomenal and really can't be beat. It was honestly even better than I expected. EVERYTHING is close-by! The place itself is very spacious. We had 7 people (some were children) staying there, but we had lots of family in town so we had guests over constantly and it was plenty of room. And the rooftop deck alone was worth getting this place! Oh, and Gloria was very easy to work with."
One note for anyone looking at this place who is planning to bring kids: It's not really ideal for small children. We have a 3 year old and a 1 year old. There are 3 flights of very steep,old stairs. We rented baby gates and it was mostly fine,but still a little stressful and tricky with our wobbly 14-month-old. Plus carrying the strollers up and down every day wasn't fun.,,,
Overall,it was a great experience and we would stay here again (but maybe when the kids are a bit older)! Thanks,"Gloria!\"",,,
5690424,38940880,2015-07-19,2522781,Max,"Gloria is an amazing host. She is genuinely concerned about helping her guests on enjoying their stay as much as possible. She gave us all the details and tips on the flat, the neighbourhood, and Boston's do's."
The flat is really impressive. All bedrooms very-well furnished. The living room is really cozy,with a lot of space. Fully-equipped kitchen. In our experience,the best of all is the deck. Beautiful views of Boston,ideally for enjoying the summer breeze at sunset. Really nice.,,
Located in the heart of Beacon Hill,"you could not ask for more.\"",,,,
5690424,43759718,2015-08-22,33603822,Jeff,Host was attentive and accommodating.
Arrival and acess to appartment was very easy. Gloria made our last day more enjoyable by allowing us to store our baggage at the appartment after checkout time and retrieve it before our flight - enabled us to see the museum of science. This is our first time using airbnb so bare with me on my feedback.,,,,,
The location of this rental is probably the best location in Boston. The Beacon Hill neighborhood is exactly what we were looking for (my wife and I as well as our two college students). We were able to walk to almost any part of Boston (Boston Harbor,North End,Back Bay,Boston Common or Sourh Boston) in less than 20 minutes.,,
The appartment is in a vintage brick building (fits the age and character of Beacon Hill). The building has 4 stories and a rooftop. The first two floors are occupied by permanant tenants - nice people. Everyone has access to the rooftop via a common stairway connected at each floor. The third and fourth floors are the rental. All but two of the rooms are air conditioned and all have comfortable beds. There was a full kitchen and two bathrooms. We didn't really use the kitchen,but everything seemed in working order.,,,,
"All in all a great rental that I recommend.\"",,,,,
5690424,44763964,2015-08-29,34485577,Albert,Gloria was very helpful. Location is awesome and the main attraction of this property. Stairs are not for older persons with bad knees. We had hot weather and the AC was not adequate in two of the bedrooms. The dwelling matched the advertisement quite well. It has a charming old character.

Sadly we didn't meet Gloria, but she was very attentive via email and text messages and we felt very well looked after.

The apartment was charming, but it wasn’t as tidy as we expected and was missing some basic items (only one set of keys, few basic toiletries) which we easily remediated.  We provided our host with that feedback for future improvements.  Gloria expressed frustration with me related to our check out, and I recommended she provide check out instructions.  I was disappointed in the overall experience, but our family truly enjoyed the use of the property and left with warm memories of our trip."
5690424,47384663,2015-09-18,42018049,Kevin,Host worked well with me to accommodate any scheduling changes that was necessary.  She was polite and quick to respond to any needs.

It has lots of different areas to spread out - the cosy kitchen, the quiet study, the grand upstairs, and the amazing roof terrace. It's also in a beautiful neighbourhood, which is safe, central, and wonderfully served for coffee houses, restaurants, bars and shops. We were all very pleased we found Gloria's place."

5690424,57644234,2015-12-28,21814551,Jennifer,Unfortunately I am unable to give a positive review of our stay over Christmas at Gloria's place.  When my family of five arrived from CA there was no heat on the upper floor of the apartment at all (and wasn't fixed for two days). Gloria doesn't live close by so my husband had to do all the coordination with letting the heat guy in and out of the building.
The house was minimally furnished,almost like someone had moved out and just left the beds and a couple of couches. Acres of empty bookshelves,only one bedside table in all of the four bedrooms,arms of chairs and couches in the living room were loose.  There were no blankets on any of the beds (only light summer comforters). Gloria did go out and buy blankets after we asked. There was no light in the narrow,steep stairs between the floors and it never did get fixed while we were there. The apartment was pretty dirty,despite contacting Gloria ahead of time after reading other reviews. The kitchen is very basically outfitted
Overall,"I cannot agree with the listing description that describes the place as a \"\"luxury apartment\"\". My husband likened it to a grand old lady who had seen better days...",,,,
Gloria seemed a bit defensive and it felt like every question we had,or thing we requested,she took personally.,,,
The single plus (and it is a big one) is that the location is very good,near Boston Common and Charles St. restaurants and shops.,,,,
Hopefully Gloria will spend some time cleaning,furnishing and outfitting this lovely old place more completely,it really could be fabulous.,,,

I had the best night sleep - crisp clean white cotton sheets, awesome Posturepedic pillows (4 per bed), great mattress. 4 bedrooms for 3 people meant we got to spread out like divas! Huge shower with great water pressure. Wifi, fluffy towels, and fireplaces throughout the rooms. The rooms had all the charm of Beacon Hill without being cluttered. The kitchen had everything we needed. Spacious, comfortable and clean - a terrific value! With the rooftop deck and location, there is nothing better in Boston!

Neighborhood was safe and quiet."
The house had plenty of room for five of us. Lots of stairs,which made us glad our elderly parents ended up canceling out of the trip,because I don't think they would have enjoyed the climbing/descending. But for the rest of us,we considered it a bonus workout!,,

5690424,73925919,2016-05-11,191280,Brenda,"This was a great townhouse in the perfect location in Beacon Hill.  Gloria was an excellent host and we had very good, clear communication.  She made special arrangements for us to pick up a key a little early which was great since we had very limited time in the city.  She also made herself and family easily accessable  if we needed anything during our stay.  Very spacious, clean, comfy place we especially loved the roof top deck.  We hope to visit again soon."
5690424,76108789,2016-05-24,1332674,Alex,Gloria was an excellent host for our stay in her apartment in Boston. Her communication was prompt and accurate and met us at the apartment to explain various things and give us some local recommendations.
The location is very convenient and we walked to everything that we wanted to experience - Boston Common,North Boston,Freedom Trail,etc..,,
The apartment is very large and was ample for our group of 5. It even looks bigger than its photos. It had everything that you would need for a great stay. We didn't cook but the kitchen was well set out and had basic cooking ingredients,etc.. We loved the roof decks the weather was beautiful while we were there.,,,,
"we would highly recommend it to a family or group of friends wanting to enjoy the sites and live like a local in Boston.\"",,,,,
5690424,76645476,2016-05-28,43313209,Kirti,"Gloria was there to receive us, Her son kindly carried up our bags as there are a lot of stairs in the house."
The unit is quaint and comfortable and very very central. Walk to the T and Boston Commons in less than 5 mins. We used the terrace every evening it was lovely to see the Boston skyline.,,,,,
Coffee,"restaurants and stores are a few mins away. Peets coffee was just down stairs across the road\"",,,,
5690424,78064547,2016-06-05,70128781,William,Gloria was a great host. The unit was as described and the location can't be beat! The weather was beautiful and that roof deck was a great way to spend an afternoon in Beacon Hill.
5690424,79166186,2016-06-11,14086641,Sarah,We rented this place for colleagues coming to town for meetings by North Station and it was perfect. Gloria's place is in the heart of Boston with tons of food and sights nearby. It is a true Boston experience staying there. Thanks again for a great stay!
5690424,82464445,2016-06-27,9624561,Bridget,"Gloria made the check in process extremely easy - she was kind enough to meet one of my roommates early at the coffee house across the street from the house so that she could give keys and a tour of the space, which was extremely appreciated. The description was accurate, and the neighborhood was beyond wonderful - one block from Charles Street, and less than 0.6 miles from the theatre where we were working for  2 weeks. Some of the furniture in the house's common areas could be updated, but it was totally adequate for our needs, along with a very comfy couch  in front of the HDTV, which we enjoyed for Netflix nights."
5690424,84948022,2016-07-09,67269763,Richard,Gloria is a gracious host.  Her house is set in a quaint neighborhood of Beacon Hill.  Excellent location for exploring Boston.  The charming and spacious house was built in 1812 giving added history our adventure.
5690424,87717145,2016-07-21,5034536,Jean,"The host was amazing, she was kind and very attentive to us and our needs. The neighborhood was ideal. So easy access all parts of Beacon Hill and such a quick and easy walk to the North End."

The apartment is pretty dirty and basically furnished. Furniture seem to come from a second hand shop, and is of bad quality. Beds are not comfortable and the rooms are sad and not equipped at all (in our room for example a small bed for 2, an awful table, a dirty lamp and a magazine picture stuck on the wall to hide a hole."
However,the apartment could really be great and is very well located.,,,,
The terrasse roof (access not easy) is to be shared with other guests which is not a problem but good to know.,,,,,
The neighborhood is lovely and we've enjoyed it.,,,,,

It's fun old place with a unique character.  Despite its age, there is central air conditioning, which was much needed and appreciated in early August.  It is sparsely furnished without a lot of creature comforts and fancy decor, but they were not promised or pictured anyway.  If I ever need a place that large again in Boston, I will certainly go back."
5690424,97994009,2016-08-29,57101736,David,"Le quartier est magnifique et le logement est grand. Néanmoins, on ne sent pas accueilli, avec peu de chaises, des couverts manquants, une literie peu confortable et une télévision ne proposant même pas les chaînes d'information nationales. Le lave linge et le sèche linge sont dans un sous-sol commun à l'immeuble, peu accessible, encombré et fonctionne à pièces et sont très sales."

The apartment was easy to find and it was great not to have to drive into downtown Boston. The stay in Jamaica Plain was part of our whole adventure.  It is a unique apartment in a beautiful neighborhood.  Our family of 6 was more than comfortable and loved having a 'home' to return to each night after exploring downtown Boston.  Everything we needed was right there for us.

Jean communicated with us promptly with instructions for checking in, and everything was ready for us when we arrived, clean and tidy."

She was wonderful about communication and giving us pertinent details as well as in her home many things are labeled for easy use and making ourselves comfortable.  The beds were very comfortable and we had everything we needed.  The space was crowded for 6 adults, but we all agreed we would enjoy staying there again because it was clean, comfortable, safe, and not far from Boston!  This place was a winner for us."

It is in a very beautiful Boston suburb close to the beautiful Jamaica Plain park which is perfect for a morning run or stroll. All the kitchen utensils were provided, AC worked really well and we had complete privacy. I really recommend it if you are travelling down to Boston with friends and would like to get a feel of Boston instead of staying a stuffy tiny hotel room."

Communication with Jean-Ellen by email was very easy and timely. The apartment was a bit too small for 6 people especially dining area (table size would be ideal for 3-4). We experienced issues with hot water: not enough hot water to take a shower for more than 2 people in the evening. This was quite inconvenient for a party of 6."
4975581,71149520,2016-04-24,4989504,Jake,"The first thing we noticed as we arrived was how nice the neighborhood was! Torpey house is on a quiet street, lined with trees and beautiful, old, giant homes. Our key was waiting for us right where it was supposed to be, and we walked up the stairs to our floor. Boy were we surprised! We knew there would be enough for all of us (we were a large group) but WOW there was more than enough space for all of us! Honestly, the pictures don't do it credit. While we didn't use the fully-equipped kitchen (we went out to eat at the many nearby restaurants during our stay) we did take advantage of the large living room, hanging out there to decompress after our busy days, before heading off to bed.  We will definitely be returning to Torpey house should it be available for our next visit to Boston!"

4975581,72313627,2016-05-01,60800735,Sabrina,The listing was accurate and in a great neighborhood. She had great amenities in terms of the kitchen and the toiletries. The bathroom is smaller than I anticipated (and there aren't many if any questions on the Airbnb website). I also wish there was more space to sit and eat together? But all things considered (that we typically had 4 people staying in the apartment at a time and how close it was to centre st.) this was great!
4975581,73658741,2016-05-09,4941283,Hae Ji,"Jean-Ellen was attentive, generous, and accommodating. Her space has everything a large family like mine needed and we all stayed there comfortably for over half a week for a very reasonable price. It was a great experience all around."
4975581,74737772,2016-05-16,28013268,Isabella,"The description of Jean-Ellen's place is spot on and the pictures are an exact representation. The location is ideal as it is very close to the T. Plenty of space for a large party. The only negative aspect of our trip was that both beds had hair in the sheets leaving us with doubts about how clean the apartment was. When you're away from home there's nothing worse with having doubts about the cleanliness of the bed you're sleeping in. If it weren't for this, our stay would have been perfect. My advice book this apartment, but bring your own sheets."

Jean-Ellen was extremely responsive and accommodating. There were plenty of extra storage space and there were laundry machines in the basement as she mentioned. Street parking was readily available and the neighborhood was very safe and quiet. Wholefoods was only 10min walk so it was convenient for us to pick up some grocery during our stay. The Stony Brook subway station (or T as they call it in Boston) was 15min walk away. There was also a nice huge park 5min walk from the apartment, great for morning or evening joggers! We will definitely stay at Jean-Ellen's place again the next time we visit Boston!"
4975581,78397062,2016-06-06,39605156,Julia,"The apartment was simply perfect for our stay.  It was very comfortable, spacious, decorated beautifully, many extras were provided such as complimentary toiletries, extra linens, extra pillows, fully stocked kitchen, everything in the apartment was labeled, a binder with information about the area, recommended places to visit, eat and how to find just about anything you would need.  I cannot say enough how comfortable and convenient it made our stay.  The neighborhood was quiet, family oriented and within walking distance to many places, there was also onsite parking plus plenty on the street.  Jean-Ellen is an excellent hostess; she was in touch to ensure we arrived, was available to answer questions and then when we checked out.  We would definitely stay here again when we visit Boston."

The location is great, the neighborhood is safe and welcoming, the parking is available, the wifi is solid, but the hostess did not provide a clean room, bathroom, or kitchen. These issues are easily fixable though."
2698996,11608821,2014-04-08,4414279,Eric,"Ray is a fabulous host and epitomizes the best of Airbnb--friendly, accomodating, very helpful with tips about the area, fun to hang out with, but careful to give you as much personal space as you want and need.  His place is very clean and tidy, the room spaceous and the queen bed comfortable.  The location is fabulous (although new to me, the Jamaica Plain neighborhood has become my favorite in Boston) and just up the street from Jamaica pond and a great, contiguous park network.  I would definitely stay with Ray again, and, even if not staying there, would look him up to hang out together.  We had the good fortune of being his first guests and he took great care to be sure the place was ready for visitors and he was ready to be a local resource."

The apartment was super clean and COMPLETELY uncluttered with a comfy bed and great coffee!  The location is awesome.  We had a beautiful walk one morning around Jamaica Pond, a great bike ride through the Arnold Arboretum and enjoyed the great restaurants and cafes on Centre Street."

Quiet,beautiful neighborhood close to yummy restaurants,hip coffee shops,beautiful parks and ponds. Travelling downtown was made easy with the metro station nearby. It was great to spend the day out and then come back to a friendly neighborhood that felt like home.,,
Ray was such a welcoming host,making sure we had everything to enjoy our stay: clean towels,comfortable bed,kitchen we could use,and advice for finding cool spots around the city. He was there to greet us and let us plenty of space so that we really felt like home. The occasional chit-chat was always nice and friendly :) Ray really respects his guests' privacy.,
We have nothing but good things to say about our stay at Ray's place and will definitely visit again,,,,,
Thanks again,,,,,

2698996,12854388,2014-05-12,12934207,Averil,"Ray was friendly and easy to talk with, and a prompt and responsible host. Communications worked very well - he even let us know that there was an unusual power failure which fortunately resolved quickly. His place is clean and everything we needed was available. The central location in Jamaica Plain is handy to stores and restaurants and the lovely Jamaica Pond, a nice place to go for a walk. The one drawback was some neighbors behind Ray's house who talked loud and long into the evening (outside) and made it somewhat difficult to sleep."
2698996,13261784,2014-05-23,14315845,Aroonrawee,I and my mom stayed at Ray's place for two nights when we visited Boston. We had a brief interaction with him and he was very nice and welcoming. The area is quite and has several cool restaurants. Ray simply left the whole place for us and we really enjoyed our stay!
2698996,13315409,2014-05-25,14549306,Ramoun,Great place in a great location. Quiet considering how busy Jamaica Plain seems to be during the day. Walking distance to pretty much everything including the T and some unique shops. Jamaica Pond is literally a block away and great for morning runs or paddling on the water. This is the room you are looking for.
2698996,13436368,2014-05-27,570068,Katie,"Ray's apartment was perfect for our stay in Boston. We didn't get to meet Ray since he went out of town that weekend but his communication was 100% and we had no problems getting into the apartment and getting settled. The neighborhood is super fun and you have everything in close distance. Wholefoods, restaurants, coffee shop, wine store, the T, etc. We loved it and would absolutely stay here again!"
2698996,13574440,2014-05-31,9142124,(EMAIL HIDDEN),"Ray was a wonderful host with a great laugh. His apartment was spiffy clean, comfy bed and pillows, and a half block to Jamaica Pond. Ray greeted us the first day, was gone the second, and we were comfortable enough to bake a batch of brownies for my daughter's graduation day. A very comfortable experience."
2698996,13615730,2014-06-01,13139893,Fernando,Me and my girlfriend stayed at Ray's house just for one night and it was an amazing experience.

2698996,13864374,2014-06-06,11374,Kirsten,Ray rocks!  His apartment is in a great location. The bed is super comfy and the apartment is immaculate. The only thing missing during my stay was Ray!
2698996,14031311,2014-06-10,5523805,Aemie,"Simply put... Ray is a stellar host. Straight up first-rate! His apartment is immaculate, orderly and spacious. My best friend and I stayed with Ray for 3 nights (Ray was there for 2) and it was an all around positive experience. Our room was large and uncluttered with a big closet and dresser for us to use. The bed, pillows and blankets were super comfy and there's air conditioning in the room for added comfort. Soft clean towels and wash cloths were laid out for us, and hot coffee was prepared for us each morning courtesy of Ray. Ray is a good-natured, genuine person with whom we enjoyed spending some time with. We felt exceptionally comfortable staying with him and he was very respectful of our privacy and space. The location is excellent too. Jamaica Plain is a very cool neighbourhood filled with fun shops, restaurants and friendly people. Jamaica Pond is beautiful! Ray's place is just minutes away from the bus stop and subway which makes getting around Boston a piece of cake! I have nothing but the best things to say about Ray, his apartment and Jamaica Plain. Ray is a model AirBnb host!"
2698996,14126565,2014-06-12,13951397,Melodie,Big nice room with a nice bed + aircon. The rest of the house is furnished beautifully in the minimalist style. Located in a cool neighbourhood within a short distance of central Boston.
Ray is a genial host and he was happy to receive us.,,,,,
"Highly recommended\"",,,,,
2698996,14613548,2014-06-23,14820878,Trevor,"Staying with Ray in Jamacia Plain was a excellent experience in all regards.  When I first inquired about availability, Ray was quick to respond, courtesious, and fielded all of my questions about his place.  Upon arriving, Ray offered recommendations on things to do in the area, had a printed document with information orienting me to the area (including things liek wifi password), and continuely checked in to make sure that I was finding everything okay."
As a side note,Ray was a great guy to share the apartment with.  He is kind,very professional,and knowledgable on the area.  One evening when I was at home working and he was out for dinner,he brought me back something from the restaurant.,
The apartment was exactly as described and I left with no complaints what-so-ever.  Ray was also very accomodating with my scheduling requests and offered me a weekly rate.  The area around the apartment is very nice with lots of little shops and restaurant.  Just down the block is Jamacia pond which is a beautiful place to go for a walk,run,have a picnic,or even sail.,,
All in all,"I would give Ray's place a 10/10 in all regards!  It worked perfectly for me as I was moving to Boston and needed a place to stay while I started work nearby.\"",,,,
2698996,14846482,2014-06-27,16632693,Sierra,"My stay in Jamaica Plains with Ray was fabulous. It was great chatting about Boston, Baltimore and design.  His place is beyond clean, which is key, and the decor is very simple and yet has a definite and pleasant personality. I felt very welcome and comfortable using the kitchen and bathroom as needed.  The bedroom is really spacious with a large closet where I could hang my work clothes to de-wrinkle.  Sheets and towels were clean and cottony.  The location is very convenient to a lot of great neighborhood food options, and an easy walk to the T station.  Parking was also surprisingly easy. I plan to stay again if there is availability on my next trip to Boston!"
2698996,14892930,2014-06-28,7364926,Ryoka,"Ray was a fantastic host and I felt like I was staying at my good friend's house. His place was so clean, spacious, and sophisticated. The location was convenient and close to everything from a drug store, restaurants, and chic coffee shops - he even created a list of recommendations for his guests, which I found very helpful. Just wonderful!"
2698996,14943304,2014-06-29,9982657,Usman,"Ray is a great host! My flight was delayed and I got to Ray's house quite late but he was very patient. Also, he even helped me move my luggage from the taxi to his house. I had quite a lot of luggage since I was moving to Boston.  Finally he gave me an uber voucher that I used to get a free taxi ride next day. Ray went way beyond my expectations of what an ideal host would do."
"I recommend Ray very highly to anyone visiting Boston!\"",,,,,
2698996,15074468,2014-07-01,3765076,Oliver,"Absolutely recommend Ray and his place! Well located,  nice quarter and a nice traditional Boston house. And people like Ray are the reason why I prefer Airbnb over hotels."
2698996,15149678,2014-07-03,11374,Kirsten,"Ray's place is perfection.  Located in a terrific neighborhood, in walking distance to anything you need.  The apartment is clean, light and comfortable.  The bedroom is big, the bed is comfortable, and (for summer) there is A/C."

2698996,15400012,2014-07-08,13479915,Terry,"We had a wonderful time at Rays. Jamaica Plain is an area full of character, which matches Ray exactly. The room was clean, spacious and comfortable, and Ray proved to be the consumate host. If he hadn't recommended The Galway Bar, it was the sort of place you would have walked right past.....quickly! But inside it was good beer, good food and good company both sides of the bar. All that was missing from our visit was a chance to watch Ray and his class practising their Yoga. The area is full of good cafes,shops and interesting places to see. If your are visiting Boston, then Rays place is the place to be."
2698996,15552047,2014-07-11,12684076,Yi,My husband and son spent really great time in Ray's house. That made their journey in Boston more wonderful. It's a big house and they really appreciated to live there.
2698996,16059389,2014-07-21,14022211,David,"Ray is a super nice host who leave us an extraordinary house to stay. I stayed in Ray's house for 9 days and felt like I am home at these days. The location is very good, walking distance to T and Jamaica pond, free street parking and great pizza nearby. The house is old but Ray keep it very clean and comfortable. I would definitely choose Ray's house when I visit Boston next time."
2698996,16608420,2014-07-30,15398742,Isabelle,"Le séjour chez Ray a été tout à fait agréable! C'est un hôte très sympathique, attentionné et discret à la fois (notre café était même prêt lorsque nous nous levions). Le métro est à 5 minutes de marche et ça prend environ 20 minutes se rendre au centre-ville. Nous avons beaucoup aimé le quartier, en particulier le fameux City feed and supply pour son café et ses sandwichs-déjeuners et le restaurant Vee Vee pour une bonne table le soir. Merci pour l'accueil, Ray!"

2698996,17284219,2014-08-10,17235877,Stephen,"My wife and I stayed three nights in what I'd call a traditional Jamaica Plain house and home. Ray's a great host, had the room clean and in perfect order (or course!), was helpful like a good friend, and provided as much conversation as our schedule and his allowed.  Everything was easy.  The shared bath was easily shared. The location is great - just 3 or 4 houses from JP's main drag, Centre Street.  Without question I'd stay there again."
2698996,17566880,2014-08-14,16024986,Tobias,I stayed with my girlfriend for four nights at Ray's place.

He was helpful assisting us with information and suggestions for things to see in Boston, how to get there, and fun places to eat.  He is a great host, thoughtful, knowledgeable and fun to talk with.   He treated us like we had known each other for years and showed us his favorite local hangout.  It was great!   His home was clean, easily accessible to the subway, buses and close to downtown and the harbor.  Jamaica Plain was fun.  We would love to stay there again."

The room is clean and exactly as in the picture. The place is close to many restaurants. I took the bus 39 to longwood medical area several times and it was very convenient.

Jamaica Pond with hiking trails is a block away in one direction and Centre street with great eateries, drinkeries and street musicians some nights is right around the corner in the other. The T train station is only a 7 minute walk away to connect with the rest of Boston. I highly recommend Ray's place!"

Some yummy food places nearby, a nice respite from touristy downtown. I recommend this in lieu of a downtown hotel anyday. Healthy food options around too-  including gluten free/vegan ice cream, farm fresh grocery, great coffee."
The pond park (can run or walk around it,so pretty!) is just a stone's throw from the apt. Ray was super communicative and helpful,and despite our not meeting in person,"everything went smoothly and I never felt out of the loop-he's truly a pro AirBnb'er.

We were there during the week so we didn't see him that much but still each time it was nice talking with him. We felt like at home, it's also really easy to get in touch with him.

We wanted to stay in JP (Jamaica Plain), and Ray's place is in the heart of it (we're looking at you FoMu and City Feed & Supply). We wanted to be near bicycle paths, and Ray's place is close to Hubway bike rentals and both the Jamaica Pond path (go for sunset) and the Southwest Corridor path (picking it up at Green St. Station). We also wanted public transport options, and Ray's place is near both the Orange line (Green St) or the 39 bus (very close). We wanted a comfortable and cozy stay, and we slept really well in the comfortable bed with options of ceiling fan or AC. We wanted an easy going and like-minded host, and Ray not only made it easy for us to be self-sufficient but he also was happy to engage with us on a range of topics from yoga and the barter economy to sugar addiction and bands of all sorts. After such great conversations, we found ourselves playing 6 Degrees of Ray -- we hit 2 degrees. Thanks, Ray!"
2698996,43675969,2015-08-21,25209164,Manfred,"Ray was a lovely host. He greeted us in his apartment in Jamaica Plaid to show us around. The listing includes a private room in his apartment, everything else is shared with the host. We hardly see each other afterwards because of our busy schedule, nonetheless he works nearby is available via phone all the times if necessary."
Jamaica Plaid is a nice neighborhood with lots of restaurants and cafes. It is great for outdoor activities (nearby Jamaica Pond) and not to far from the city center (25-35min using the bus or subway).,,,,,

Ray is a wonderful host, he cares for his guests in every little way. We would definitely choose him if we visited Boston again.

The room is fairly spacious and features a comfy full size bed.  There's also plenty of dresser and closet space.  We also had full access to the kitchen, which helped us save lots of money on meals.  I loved being close to the Orange Line of the T, the nearest station being only around seven blocks away.  Ray is a kind man and hardly at home so it's almost like you have the place to yourself.  All in all, the room at Ray's place is a really good deal for $96."

I always went out for an evening walk to the near Pond, which is a wonderful piece of nature close by."

2698996,53140795,2015-11-05,1824570,Virginia,Ray was a fantastic host. He did not only accept our last minute booking request but was also really flexible and organised regarding our delayed arrival. Thanks again for that - it's a shame we only met briefly on your way to the coffee refill !
Staying in Ray's apartment was a blast. The flat is bright,super clean,airy and beautifully furnished. The room itself is big enough for two people with huge suitcases and the bed is super comfy and gives you a good night's rest.  Although we didn't use it - the kitchen was fully equipped with everything you need. The water pressure in the shower was great.,,,
The area around the apartment is calm,safe and full of nice restaurants and cafes for breakfast and super delicious burritos. Subway is within 15 minutes walk anda cab from the airportis only 40$ and totally worth it.,,,,

Ray himself was a fantastic host too - very enthusiastic, accommodating and always ready to help. I had a great time chatting and going out to dinner with him. I would definitely look him up next time I visit Boston and when you find Ray's listing, do yourself a favor and stop your search and book with him. You will not be disappointed!"

I arrived at the tail end of a snow storm but found parking pretty easily around the corner on Centre St.  I come to JP often to visit my son and Ray's place on Pond Street is in a perfect location.
The room I stayed in was large and the bed was very comfortable.  The bathroom was clean as was the whole apartment.  I really loved the way Ray chose design elements throughout the apartment that complimented the period that the building was built...a fun stylish result.

The room is huge with everything you could need. The whole house is warm, clean and very well furnished. I can't recommend this place highly enough. Jamaica Plain is a lovely area to with a huge variety of stores and restaurants. The pond at the end of the road is delightful and I took several afternoon walks there. Public transport is super accessible."

9373802,60089422,2016-01-18,52635375,Maximilian,Everything top!
9373802,61311710,2016-02-02,24224426,Marcos,"Large apartment very well located. Very convenient for visiting central areas in Boston. The apartment is confortable with a large bed and sofa, four chairs and little else. No decoration. 4 glasses and some dishes in the kitchen. No way to open a wine bottle. The microwave oven didn't work. We asked for a replacement in the first day of our visit, but it was no replaced so we could not have warm food during the 5 days of our visit. In summary, it is large and well located, but impossible to feel like home. Not a good choice for that price unless you are 5-6 people.."
9373802,65109149,2016-03-10,25355308,Jeff,"Paige kept in great contact, and was super flexible with the later-than-usual check-in time. This space is right next door to Deuxave, an incredible restaurant with a nice upscale bar. It was a perfect location for my meetings at the Hynes Convention Center, with only about a 10 minute walk, door to door. Plus, plenty of good coffee/restaurant spots in between."
9373802,66035556,2016-03-19,51430279,Daragh,Check in was easy. Location was great for all the sites and shops. Paige was always contactable.
9373802,66399516,2016-03-22,45929860,Lindsay,"This location was great! HUGE bedroom and fit us all without feeling cramped. The kitchen was stocked with dishes, flatware, etc. There was blowup mattresses and a comfy couch. Paige was great in responding to all of my questions in a timely manner. Would definitely stay at again."
9373802,68393012,2016-04-04,46879814,Kimberly,"Clear, consistent communication. Check-in was easy and hassle free. Location was the main reason we booked and enjoyed our stay! There is a parking garage in walking distance (3-5 minute walk) that was $25 per day, since parking spots were not available for our stay. All in all, this place was advertised honestly and met our expectations. The only challenge was getting ready with 5+ girls with only two small mirrors - we managed! And don't forget your aerobeds if you are more than 4+ people (couch is comfy though)."
9373802,69145334,2016-04-09,44073968,Katie,"The place was not what we expected. One of the air mattress was damaged. Page sent a replacement the next day, but it was still one REALY uncomfortable  and spoiled night. There was a  bad smell in the kitchen which we had to avoid going into at all time. Need to keep the door closed to avoid spreading the smell all around the apartment."
"\"",,,,,
9373802,70049127,2016-04-15,2041606,Micah,"This place is fine as a budget option. It's a bit crusty, some of the sheets were stained, one of the walls had a mildew smell, and the air mattress wouldn't stay inflated.  But it had that Boston charm, the wood floors, and the location is great. It was sort of like an old college dorm. Just don't expect the Ritz Carlton."
Also,we never asked for more,"but were were only given one set of keys for three people.\"",,,
9373802,71458645,2016-04-25,50784065,Geoff,"Great neighborhood, we were a short walk from wherever we really wanted to go or from a public transport stop. Our group was on the larger side and we had no problems fitting everyone. There are a couple of car parks near by which can be a bit pricey but you won't really need to drive anywhere else. I think I can speak for my group when I say we'd all stay there again"
9373802,71784051,2016-04-28,3916376,Eric,Your condo is great. In an excellent location in the Back Bay. Close to everything. It's huge - much bigger than I expected. I would love to stay there my next time in Boston. Thanks!
9373802,72278506,2016-05-01,23183511,Andrew,This place is great for people looking to stay in an amazing location on a budget.  It is a very basic apartment but you probably wont stay in it for other then sleeping anyway.  We had eight people and they all fit comfortably although one of the air mattresses would not stay inflated.  We went to a Red Sox game and it was only a 10 min walk to Fenway.  The hot water stopped working one morning but Paige was very quick to get it fixed. We would all stay here again.
9373802,75017483,2016-05-18,59786269,Sylvia,"Paige was a great contact for the listing. She quickly responded to each question (of which I had many as I had never used Airbnb before). We did not have many problems with the exception of the TV which only pulled in one channel. That was disappointing. It was not fixed during our stay, but perhaps you can ask about the situation before you rent this listing. Even though the picture shows the room with the exact bed we had etc., the feel of the room is different than you see in the picture. The room feels older and darker, and has plaster pealing off in the bathroom. There are no curtains, even though there are curtain rods in this room. One window over the blow up mattress does not have any window dressing at all. Plan on dressing in the bathroom or putting on a show for those on the main street.The furniture is minimal and the blow up mattress for the last two people, has to be blown up and made up by the renters. FYI the listing did not say there are a tremendous number of steps you need to climb to get to the unit from the street level. Not appropriate for older or handicapped people."
9373802,75630870,2016-05-22,54428034,A Arun,"The place was tidy and neat. The page promised 1 full bed and 1 air bed, but to our surprise, and general elation, we found 2 more tucked away in the closet. That was so good. We got everything that was promised and more!"
"This place is perfect for those AirBnber's who are looking for an old-school rustic living space that is spacious and located in a good spot near public transportation.\"",,,,,
9373802,76337814,2016-05-26,7576473,Anthony,"Dear Paige: The location was perfect, .....however the maintenance does not exist: blinds that do not close, or they do not exist, no curtains, poor kitchen implements, etc. etc. etc. I wish this apt. were mine, I would make a PALACE  out of it!"

Paige was a responsive and prompt host,"she was able to answer all my questions in a prompt manner and I would definitely recommend her. \"",,,,
9373802,87574095,2016-07-20,27617180,Zach,"Great location.  No frills apartment, clean and a solid place to stay. Paige was very responsive."
9373802,88356990,2016-07-24,6322947,Jessica,"We ran into a few issues at Paige's apartment that unfortunately soured our visit to Boston. We ran into communication difficulties, and at the end of the day the host was difficult to work with, and instead of working with us, requested we contact Airbnb directly. Certain amenities on the listings were not available,  and when requested were not brought to the apartment for the duration of our stay. Overall, the location of the apartment is great, and we had a pleasant experience working with Airbnb resolution. We would like to assume our experience was just a one-off, but unfortunetley would caution others before booking this apartment."
9373802,89407389,2016-07-28,85017381,Joe,Great location and value.  Recommended.
9373802,93347204,2016-08-12,83274687,Hannah,"Paige's place was in a prime location for our stay in Boston. I had never been to Boston before, but by looking at a map it seemed close to everything we wanted to do and it turned out to be extremely convenient. Only a few blocks away from the metro, and within walking distance to several restaurants, pubs, grocery stores, and a park. Paige was VERY good at communicating promptly with us via text and took care of any issues quickly. Her place was very clean and had all the appliances we needed for the 4-night stay. We are not from the city, so it was a bit of an adjustment to sleep with so much road noise as the apartment was on a main road, but to us the convenience was worth it. Overall, a great place to stay if you want to see Bay Back, downtown Boston, and the surrounding areas. We would stay there again!"
9373802,94169957,2016-08-15,87486553,Ed,"I was very disappointed with our stay in Boston.  Minus the great location, this place really isn't all it's kicked up to be.  The stairway up and hallways are beautiful, but the unit itself smelt and was rather dusty.  The air conditioner unit in the bedroom barely works enough in the room alone yet the entire condo.  The door in the front looked chewed and the kitchen was mediocre at best."
9373802,96545550,2016-08-23,90839626,Axel,"We needed an early check in and also leaving our luggage for some hours on the check out day, and she did her best to help us. Amazing place."
8523157,68522747,2016-04-05,62831498,Blake,"Absolutely loved my stay with Matthew and Nathan in Dorchester. The house is located in Upham's corner, which is definitely a revitalized area south of Boston. The house was beautifully decorated and clean. I was very comfortable the entire time. There are several ways to get to and from the house, and I found it a great location to access the city. I will definitely try and stay here when I visit Boston in the future."
8523157,68933310,2016-04-07,65224749,Matthew,Matthew's house is beautiful. The room was very comfortable and clean. They were accommodating and friendly. The dogs and cat were all so sweet. Thank you for a lovely stay.
8523157,70763452,2016-04-20,56644623,Kris,"We LOVED our stay at Matthew's place. We arrived very late (midnight) Matthew made sure he was available to greet us, show us around, explain everything and answer questions. We felt spoiled with this beautiful room, bathrobes, slippers and very cozy, quiet bedroom. Matthew also answered any questions we had the entire 6 days we were in Boston. Because of this we enjoyed easy transportation and great restaurants. We will be back next year if available.  If you are lucky enough to find this listing available. take it!"
8523157,73446565,2016-05-08,18111086,Geannie,"We were so fortunate to be able to spend 4 nights at Matthew's beautiful home.  Matthew and Nathan were super gracious hosts and made us feel very welcomed, like staying with friends.  They really have thought of everything, from robes and slippers to snacks and guide books.  Our one regret was not having enough time to take Matthew up on his offer to cook breakfast!  Very much enjoyed our conversations revolving our shared love of food and travel.  Thank you Matt and Nathan for your hospitality!  And love to Bruce, Charlie and Kali!  3"
8523157,76306945,2016-05-26,12462730,Steven,"We absolutely loved our stay with Matthew and Nathan. The house is beautiful and spotless, the room and bathroom have everything you need and we loved staying in the neighbourhood. On top of this, you get to stay with a super friendly cat and 2 lovely dogs! Matthew and Nathan were excellent hosts, we felt really welcome and very well taken care of. Would recommend to anyone and thank you to Matthew and Nathan for a thoroughly enjoyable stay."
8523157,78201062,2016-06-05,26382018,Lindsey,"Only stayed with Matthew one night, he was a great host and made us feel at home. I would definitely stay with Matthew again if I am ever in the area."

Nathan and his charming pets ( two sweet French bulldogs: Charlie and Bruce, and the dainty cat) greeted us and showed us around the house, unfortunately we didn't have a chance to meet Mathew. The house has a beautiful interior, the guest room is spacious and very nice, has a big screen, a very comfortable bed. The location itself is convenient, it's a 15 minute walk to the subway station and 10 minutes to the downtown by  the subway train. We would definitely recommend this place!"

Amy, the host initiated contact as soon as my reservation was accepted. Due to how we planned everything, I was not able to meet Amy but was in correspondence with her all day until we arrived. The apartment is in Allston, an adorable neighborhood not far from Harvard University. To be a college area it was extremely quiet! Many great places to eat and a park not too far away. Also, the train is directly across the street if you're using public transportation. When we got in the apartment, it looked exactly as pictured. There was wifi with code provided and a television with cable. The space was quaint and my husband, daughter, and I were able to move around without without feeling cramped and was lightly decorated to give a homey feel. The only \"\"bad\"\" was the password for wifi didn't work but I easily emailed Amy and she sent me the correct one. This and the host were amazing! When we come back bext month"

His room is pretty clean but the kitchen is just okay or so so. But there was no problem at all about all the functioning of stove and washing muchine:D and he had all detergent for it. And also the basement where the kitchen is located leaks some water but it didn't bother me cooking or washing dishes!

Joseph was flexible and allowed me to stay only two nights (midweek) despite the posted three night minimum, which was really great, as I made the reservation very last minute.  He was very prompt in all of his communications and gave clear, thorough directions explaining how to access the house, etc.  The shower in this suite is AMAZING.  The bed is exceptionally comfortable and the suite is unbelievably spacious."

7472068,41681465,2015-08-08,39721539,Stuart,"We were the first clients for this spacious appartment, it was good for our family of five including three teenage children. Melissa was very helpful and welcoming. Secure off-street parking is available if you have a car. Its well located, only 20 to 25 mins walking distance to NorthEnd of Downtown, but nicer to cut across to Main via the Bunker Hill monument rather than straight down Bunker Hill Street if you do walk it. Otherwise bus stop for #92 and #93 just outside. 15 to 20 mins drive to Logan airport. Convenience store and off-licence 2 mins away. Good size appartment, we'll located, I am sure it will be a popular rental."
7472068,42354824,2015-08-12,31241105,Scott,What are GREAT find just a short distance from Boston’s famed North End and Downtown. This was my wife’s first time in the area and she had a wonderful experience largely due to the location of Melissa’s listing and her hospitality. Her apartment is now my families “go to” place when staying in Boston and you’d be wise to book this property if you're planning a trip to New England.
7472068,43845050,2015-08-22,40971281,Stephen,"Melissa was a great host and was always available to answer any questions and concerns. As for the  location, it was perfect for me and my family. It was only a 5 minute walk or less to the supermarket, to the bunker hill monument, and to a bunch of restaurants! Also close enough to walk to the North End too! The apartment was perfect for my family of 4. Kitchen had what we needed, towels were aplenty, and the furniture was comfortable. The parking space is great for anyone driving, as parking can be costly around the area. Highly recommended!"
7472068,45113720,2015-08-31,38832565,Andreina,Melissa was very accessible we had problems with the air condition but she took care of it quickly. The apartment was clean and spacious. In front of the building is a convenient store which you can find almost anything. It is aprox. 30 minutes walk to fenueil hall.

The apartment itself was clean and tidy with a great selection of snacks and coffee at hand. It was also in a lovely part of Boston from where we could walk or catch the bus to anywhere we needed to go. I recommend Melissa's apartment and will even stay again the next time we are in Boston!"
7472068,51706572,2015-10-24,403113,Alethea,"We just spent 7 weeks in Melissa's apartment while my husband was in town for work. Melissa greeted us on arrival to give us a tour of the apartment and building. The apartment is light, fresh and spacious. We were two adults + a one year and old and had more space than we needed."
Melissa was quick to respond to any questions and to provide everything we needed (often the next day.) She even gave us crib sheets/towels to use for our child which was very thoughtful. The apartment is well-stocked - we were there for a long time and had all we needed. The location is incredibly convenient - half hour walk to most major sights. Bus stop right outside on a line that goes right into the city center. 10 minutes walk to the Orange Line subway station and even closer is a Whole Foods,CVS,Dunkin Donuts plus numerous pizza places,sub shops,and a really great brewpub called the Brewer's Fork.,
Having a parking space in that area is a necessity,and the spot that goes with the apartment is in a gated lot right behind the building.,,,,
It's not the quietest neighborhood but that's to be expected living in the city. Evenings were fairly peaceful,mornings and early afternoons it gets busier in the area as there is a large high school down the street.,,,,
The apartment has a brand new central AC/heating unit which works really well.,,,,,
I can only high recommend this apartment whether you are in town sightseeing or for a longer stay like we were.  If you have a car it's very easy to hop onto the major highways that go through/around Boston to do day trips (there is also a brand new outlet mall a five-minute's drive away - also accessible via that bus line that goes by the apartment!),,,,,

Melissa wasn't there to greet us personally, but there was a lockbox outside (not how secure this is...) and we were able to get in to the apartment pretty easily. At first, there was a problem with the internet router but Melissa worked hard to get it fixed, quite a feat considering it was about 10pm. Overall, though, we found that the place was quite dirty and very basic for the price, which was about $300 a night. We realize it was a busy week in Boston but this seemed like price gouging to us. There was only one old towel per person and the bedsheets were very thin. We wondered when the duvets had last been washed.... The kitchen was pretty clean (nice fridge) but was short on some basics, including a kettle. There is no coffee machine, only a Keurig that takes capsules and doesn't make particularly good coffee. Also, it wouldn't hurt to put up a few pictures or posters on the walls! Not a very cozy atmosphere, unfortunately!"
7472068,71227294,2016-04-24,35594024,Paweł,Melissa was very nice. Its a great place to stay if you plan to do some sightseeing. The Freedom Trail is couple blocks away. The parking spot is also great if you plan to Uber around Boston.
The only thing that bothered all four of us who stayed was cleanliness. For a quite high cleaning price,you could call it rather dirty (bathroom floor,toilet seat,stuff under living room cushions.,,
"Overall it's a nice place I would recommend. \"",,,,,
7472068,72100957,2016-05-01,43884040,Alan,"Melissa's place was great! I flew 4 buddies to Boston to come see the city for the weekend, and this was our crash pad. Great communication, clean place, and comfy, simple place."
7472068,72788537,2016-05-04,67678083,Wei,"It is a really good place to stay and it is near to the free trail.you don't even need to drive in this area cuz  Melissa's private parking lot helps us a lot. Moreover, apartment is clean and comfortable. My mom and aunts love it! First time Airbnb experience is fantastic !"
7472068,73227781,2016-05-07,69102017,Phillip,"The apartment is really bright and welcoming and we had a lot of space (3 people). Melissa is very friendly and always answered my questions within a short time. She also allowed us to stay the whole last day till we left in the evening since she had no reservation for the following day. We really appreciated that. All in all, we had super four days in Boston!"
7472068,74500118,2016-05-15,61942015,James,We were a small group of friends in town for a wedding and this place was perfect for us.  It is a no-frills apartment that was a short uber ride from everything in town.  Melissa was very attentive to making sure everything went very smoothly and check-in and check-out were easy.
"Next time we are in Boston we will probably stay at this place again.\"",,,,,
7472068,76213401,2016-05-25,72262106,Randy,"Melissa was great at keeping in contact with us and providing suggestions. This was my first time in Boston so I learned that Charlestown is in a quieter, more local section of the city which was great for us. Access to the end of the Freedom Trail is only about 3 blocks away, it's about a mile walk to North End, and there is a bus stop right outside of the building.  The availability of a free secure parking spot was a huge plus since we drove in and then walked or took public transportation after that. Simple, clean and comfortable!"
7472068,76740187,2016-05-29,5387612,Jacob,Melissa's place was great for our purposes! Good location and a lot of space in the apartment. Melissa was a very responsive and attentive host.
7472068,78200355,2016-06-05,61295867,Jami,Melissa was great to work with.  She was in constant communication to ensure we were taken care of.  She even offered us to stay a little later on check-out day which was much appreciated.
My only complaint is that the floor was quite dirty.  I have 2 little kids who were crawling / walking around and their feet and pants got dirty quickly.  You could clearly see the dust / dirt pileup under the couches.  And while I'm sure if we called Melissa,she would have had it cleaned (as per her other review comments),however we were only there for 2 days and having to schedule a cleaner would have been another scheduling logistic we didn't want to have to worry about while on vacation.  And a clean rental upon arrival is an expectation that I don't think is asking too much especially with the cost of the cleaning fee.,,,
Overall,I would consider staying here again.,,,,

7472068,87635148,2016-07-21,19446205,John,Melissa made everything very easy. Place was exactly as  advertised. Would definitely recommend.
7472068,96463968,2016-08-22,41506834,Kit,"We really enjoyed our stay at Melissa's apartment. Everything was exactly as advertised in the photos, the beds were comfortable, and Melissa was very responsive to our texts. The parking space out back was crucial, and we appreciated that it was secured behind a fence. While the location a few blocks from Bunker Hill was great, you should be aware that the apartment faces a busy street and there's a bus stop directly out front, so the front rooms can be a little noisy. Nothing a pair of earplugs can't handle."
4863101,26275883,2015-02-08,15819061,Suzanne,We had a wonderful time. John was an attentive wonderful host. Dan was out of town so did not get to meet him. The room was lovely and very comfortable and cozy. Thank you so much and we will come back to stay!
4863101,27279077,2015-03-01,58326,Olutope,"John was extremely responsive and timely. Upon notification of my arrival, he called me  which I thought was a very polite gesture. He was immediately available whenever I had the slightest of comments/questions or kindly endured my own errors when I was communicating with him."
The closet space in the private room is just wondrous,my goodness. The hot water was perfection and I really liked the coconut body wash (and I am a picky gal,I tell you).,,,
The amenities in the kitchen and laundry area make it a complete stay for that home away from home for a short-term or long-term stay.,,,,,
He was kind enough to lend me his slippers,too.,,,,
For a future visit to Boston,I will hope that John is able to accommodate me. I hope I can meet Dan at that point,"too.\"",,,

4863101,28623613,2015-03-27,29196382,Shaiza,"The host was incredibly kind by extending his offer to help throughout our stay. We found the room to be just as described in the listing. The location was easily accessible by public transportation, which was important since we didn't have a car while in Boston. The main roads were full of nice places to grab a bite to eat or a drink. I would definitely consider staying here again if visiting Boston."

With this room you get the whole top floor to yourself -  a massive room, tons of storage space and an ensuite with a great shower. I used the kitchen a lot and it had everything I needed. The neighbourhood is quiet and I felt safe walking around. John and Dan were really quick to respond to everything, checked that I had everything I needed and were friendly guys. I'd come back here if I was back in Boston."
4863101,29975816,2015-04-15,21036432,Corby,John and Dan were great!  They were quick to respond to emails and check-in and check out were easy.  I even was able to leave my bags after check-out time.

The house and the room are lovely (the place looks exactly like the pictures),spacious,clean; the kitchen is fully equipped. The place actually feels like a home away from home!,,,
Nice,quiet but safe neighbourhood,close to some nice restaurants/bars,food shop,CVS pharmacy. Two bus stops and the subway station (Broadway) are only a few minutes away,so it's easy to get around and explore Boston from here; the conference center is fairly close as well (15-20 mins walk max.).
John and Dan are super friendly. I only met them briefly for check-in and check-out (they are very flexible time-wise!),but John was available throughout my stay via email/(SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) and was super helpful and quick to respond whenever I contacted him.,,,,

We were a little surprised to find that the apartment also hosting two other airbnb guests in the downstairs bedroom during our stay; this was not a problem as they were also attending the conference and great folks, but just something future guests might want to be aware of.  We liked the neighborhood, too: restaurants and a small grocery nearby, as well as a playground and the \"\"Lawn on D\"\".  We would stay here again and recommend the space to others!\""

John and Dan were not around when we arrived but left clear instructions on how to find the key, and were very good at keeping in touch to make sure we got in ok and check whether we needed anything. The apartment is in a very convenient location for the T station and there are nice bars and restaurants within a 10 min walk. We would definitely stay there again if we come back to Boston! Thanks John and Dan for a great stay!"

We ended up paying $28 for a spot hero and uber to get a garage spot about 5 mins away after unloading the car.  The place was excellent, clean, and very comfortable. Would definitely recommend as long as you don't mind stairs!"

In this case, privacy was the top amenity, and the presence of our hosts was entirely absent, even during breakfast and when we left.  The house was new and the room comfortable but we were surprised to find street parking almost entirely unavailable.  A long search brought us to an area several blocks away where street cleaning restrictions did not apply the next day and one spot was luckily still available."

Even not for Check in and check out. For check in I would have personally preferred someone who would have been there for some instructions. Yet, there are instructions on a sheet given and the texting via email or smatphone went very well. He is a very nice host indeed! In total everything was really fine and the neighbourhood was also very nice and close to the city center. So I would come to Dan's place at any again!"
4863101,44755589,2015-08-29,5081546,Dennis,We had a comfortable stay. One needs to be fit for this Bnb as there are stairs and quite a bit of walking for shops subway etc but it was no problem for us. Although quite hot the air conditioning was effective and quiet. The share kitchen was modern and well appointed.
4863101,45069654,2015-08-31,9293352,Mai,"Dan made it easy for my first experience with airbnb. He left us the detail instruction on how to get around, where to eat, where's  grocery store. The neighborhood  is pretty new, safe and quiet."

4863101,48384903,2015-09-26,35559836,Betty,"This was a great place, although it is South Boston, so you gotta take the T to get to the main action! We found the neighborhood really cute and felt safe walking around even at night. There's a few bars/restaurants right off the Broadway stop so the walks back were well lit and populated. The room was on the top floor and very spacious; huge closet! We had access to the kitchen, which we used to make coffee every am and store/heat up leftovers. There was someone else staying in the bottom floor, but our paths never crossed. We never met our host either, but he promptly answered any questions I had."
My only complaint was the cleanliness of the bathroom,unfortunately. I emailed Dan about it and he offered to have his cleaning person come back out but we had all of our stuff out and left the door locked so it wasn't going to work out. It wasn't filthy but I don't think they did a thorough cleaning before we got there :(,,,,
Two other small issues we encountered: some early morning noise due to new construction,so I would recommend ear plugs if you like to sleep in and the satellite tv. We tried to watch Monday night football but the reception was terrible and kept freezing. Not the host's fault,obviously,but had we known we would have just gone up a bar to watch the game.,,
Overall,I would recommend this place because it was pretty spacious and private,but be aware if walking/taking the T are problems for you because that's how you get around. For us,it was fine and we'd happily stay here again.,,

We had access to the downstairs kitchen and washer and dryer.  Others were staying in the house, but we didn't see them at all.  Dan wasn't there during our stay and may have been in a rush to leave because the room/bathroom could have used a bit of a better cleaning job.  The Ensuite was about an 8-10 minute walk to the metro line."

We think we found the perfect instant coffee by Mount Hagen!!!!  We ordered a bunch on line after leaving Dan's wonderful place.  The rooms are exactly as pictured,  The shower water was hot and the bed/all cotton bedding very comfortable.  The communication was superb and the instructions clear.  The cab driver had a little trouble finding the short street but we did find it.  (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) map helped. We would definitely stay here again.  Maybe next time we will meet Dan who was out of town. We walked to the cruise line (an easy 1.2 miles) which was a perfect way to start a vacation. Highly recommended.

4863101,62355476,2016-02-14,37495610,Donia,"The room was spacious, clean and comfortable.  The sheets on the bed were incredibly soft!  I was there during an extreme cold snap and the room stayed comfortably warm.   I didn't actually see Dan while I was there but he was always responsive, helpful and welcoming via text and email.  The neighborhood was indeed remarkably quiet, and while I usually chose to eat and spend time in other parts of the city, it was easy through the T, walking or Uber to get around from there."

Left clear instruction, the house and the room was clean, comfortable, surrounding very quiet.  You can reach the centre with two buses or short walk to subway. There were another guests in the house in the same time, but we met them once and they were not disturbing. thanks Dan for your house during our US visit."

The room & bathroom were very clean. We were provided with the essentials: towels,soap,shampoo.  However,we did bring our own toiletries just in case.,,
If you are planning on visiting Boston,this location is in a pretty convenient location-- about a 10 minute drive into the city.  During our stay,"we Uber'd most of the time.  There is street parking which is free during certain times/days of the week.  The neighborhood is very clean & cute.  It is also safe as well.  The area is quiet with the exception of the garbage/recycling trucks coming around.  \"",,,

It's located about a 10-minute walk from the Broadway T station, or 2 minutes from the bus. It took about 25-30 minutes to get to the popular tourist spots.

T station was only a 10 minute walk from the place, and there were a lot of cool bars nearby (and Broadway Pastry was good for breakfast!) Dan was really friendly and great at communicating, and the room was exactly as described with a big comfy bed and big TV. The bathroom was really nice too. We would definitely stay here again if we came back to Boston!"
4863101,78393350,2016-06-06,60832460,NickSabanFan,Dan was very responsive during my Wife's and my stay in Boston. The apartment is conveniently located within 15 minutes of downtown Boston and 10 minutes from the airport.
If this apt were a hotel room,I would give it 3 stars. The room was a large enough space with a private bathroom. However,the room wasn't as clean as we would have liked it to been.,,,
1) the bathroom sink and shower appeared as if they hadn't been cleaned in quite some time. The floor and sides of the tub were dirty and grimy. Something that could have been easily scrubbed clean if attempted with a cleaning pad. The bathroom sink was the same scenario. There was debris all around the rim of the sink.,,,,,
2) the room had an aroma as if it was quickly cleaned/wiped down,but again not really as clean as we would have liked. Bulbs in the lamps were covered in dust,as well as the blinds,edges of bathroom cabinets,and under the bed.,
3) there was a party next door that ran till almost 5am. Which normally we wouldn't be bothered by,but the homes are so close together we could hear every loud conversation,drunk cheer etc,which led to a poor night's rest.,,
4) To be fair: Dan was responsive to all my texts/emails to where I feel he may have done something if he were present during our stay,"but unfortunately he wasn't. \"",,,,

4863101,81048885,2016-06-20,3017605,Willem,Dan's ensuite room is located in a very quiet street in South Boston ('Southie'). I immediately felt at home. Bed and bathroom were both excellent . I did not use the kitchen as there are several good restaurants within walking distance.
I did not get to meet Dan,"but his communication via Airbnb was always on time and to-the-point. Highly recommended if you are staying in Boston for a few days! \"",,,,
4863101,82819428,2016-06-29,12224050,Tom,"Dan was very accommodating to my very late arrival. The neighborhood is a residential area, the street very quiet as if it were an alley. Lovely home with comfortable bed and pillow. Kitchen was fully functional, laundry available on site. The WiFi is slow but functional. I walked to BCEC for a conference and it only took me 10 minutes (I have long legs:)"

His messages were very quick and right to the point. The place is in a very quiet street, but not far away from restaurants, pharmacies, convenient store, metro, bus station, downtown Boston. It's a bit challenging to park in the area, but not impossible. The private room was clean and is exactly as the picture. The bathroom is huge and very well equipped. The wi-fi was also good. We would definitely stay with Dan again and would recommend him to anyone."

We found out a couple days before we weren't going to meet Dan which now seems to be the pattern. We had a couple issues regarding the heat in the summer and Dan had his brother install a window unit in which was greatly appreciated.  We were assuming the person cleaning isn't aware how long we were staying and only left us one wash cloth each and one bath towel and no hand towels. We didn't get anymore for another 2 nights.. My wife and I really enjoyed south boston and safe area to walk around at night and again Dan's place was clean and he responded when we contacted him, but my wife and I enjoy meeting the people we stay with and more feedback on what the locals enjoy in the area and finding more about the city that way. That's why we truly enjoy air b and b.."

The bedroom and bathroom are entirely private (though the kitchen is shared) and Dan was extremely helpful in making making our arrival, stay, and departure as smooth and enjoyable as possible."
The South Boston neighbourhood is one of the most diverse and interesting parts of town,and while it's not quite walkable to downtown and the main tourist attractions,it's well worth visiting in its own right. The subway station is only a 10-minute walk from the apartment and goes straight into the centre of the city.,,,

It's on a one-block long (unmarked) street, so you'll benefit from a good map/GPS to find it, but once there, it's very safe, and you have the whole house to use, including a beautiful full kitchen two flights down!"
I was unaware that the house is shared with others,but the folks there were very nice (as are all AirBnB travellers!) and even gave me their cereal and other goodies when they left.,,,,
It should be pointed out that one of the three nights I stayed there,Logan flights began taking off and flying overhead for about an hour,every 1 to 5 minutes,beginning at 5:50 AM.  Not sure when or why they would do that--I guess it's a luck of the draw.,,

Close to transportation, the great food of the North End, the fabulous waterfront, in the shadows of the Old North Church and close just about anything else you'd want. The place was clean, charming, and with a hint of intrigue as it was found tucked behind a corridor that gives you a feeling that you're entering a secret hideaway. Gina was extremely responsive and got back to us immediately if we had a question. I would recommend staying here without question. My family and I really enjoyed our stay."

While this area draws in a lot of tourist traffic, you will find families coming and going from apartments, stores and eateries along the quiet side streets. Gina's apartment is right off of one of those streets in a nice little courtyard. It's a nice retreat from the busyness of the city while being only a short walk to restaurants, stores and public transportation. It is tastefully decorated, immaculately clean and well-appointed. Gina's hospitality and professionalism are top-notch. Her communications with us were strong from start to finish. We thoroughly enjoyed working with her and hope for the chance to do business with her again."

The North End has amazing restaurants and shops, we especially enjoyed Gina's recommendation for Neptune's Oysters (best oysters I've ever had!!). Gina is a great host, she provided lots of restaurant recommendations around town as well as useful information for getting around the city. She was also always very prompt to reply to any of our inquiries which made our stay very pleasant and smooth. The home was beautifully decorated and very clean. The beds are super comfortable also. I have no complaints and would definitely stay here on another visit to Boston!"
5782221,47165821,2015-09-16,4185049,Victoria,"La Gemma is the best! I loved how it was tucked away in Boston ' s North End, but totally accessible to getting around the city. The apartment was beyond my expectations in style, cleanliness, privacy, and creating a home away from home (and I am one picky person!). I liked the spiral staircase that led down from the main floor to the bedrooms, but my favorite part of La Gemma is the kitchen. It's a place that everyone can gather in the morning, cozy up to breakfast and conversation, and Gina has it laid out perfectly.  Let me not forget to mention the beds - so comfortable - which we sank into each evening after being out all day. I look forward to staying at LA Gemma on my next visit to Boston."

Everything was in walking distance, including the T.  You are truly tucked in the North End and all that it has to offer.  Gina provided us with helpful information prior to our stay that made it easy for us to find the home, gain entry,  plan our stay and our day at Fenway.  I will definetely stay again if I have the opportunity to travel back to the area."

Full review.  The North End is an incredible place in Boston with the history and food options,in addition to the proximity to the rest of the city.  La Gemma is located in a great area,quiet at night,yet so close to everything.  Imagine walking past the North Church (one if by land,"two by sea) every time you head \"\"home.\"\"  Great restaurants are all within a 5-10 minute walk",and a couple of T stops only a few more minutes than that.  The place is completely modernized and the pictures and description totally accurate.  Everything works
5782221,50445449,2015-10-12,39838127,Portia,"This is a very nice place in an excellent and friendly neighborhood.  Restaurants and shopping at Quincy Market are within walking distance.  Gina and her husband took good care of us and the residence is located near the train and bus line so a car is not needed.  The residence was cozy and clean.  It was a nice place to stay in Boston. Gina left restaurant recommendations, coupons, and maps of the city which were much appreciated.  I would recommend this area and residence as a great place to stay in Boston."

5782221,51015537,2015-10-17,35883929,Sara,"This is my first experience with Airbnb and Gina set a very high bar. My co-worker and I were traveling for business and decided it would be nice to relax at the end of the day with the comforts of home and we were not disappointed. Finding the door was part of the adventure, but it was the only testing part of our stay. After that it was enjoyable, relaxing and the perfect place to wind down after a long day of meetings. The neighborhood was awesome, we walked home later in the evening from the local restaurants and felt safe and a part of the city. And you can't beat the awesome food that is just a few blocks down the street."

5782221,69257915,2016-04-10,61887678,Jill,"Gina and her husband Matt couldn't have made us feel any more welcome in this lovely little North End gem. Gina was incredibly quick to respond with suggestions for restaurants and help wherever we needed it. The condo was perfect for our family of four, providing our 15 year old daughter with her own room and our 13 year old son control of the remote while on the fold out bed in the living room, it completely suited our every need. The use of the beautifully appointed kitchen came in quite handy when we would return in the evening with our delicious finds from the neighborhood, the perfect way to end a day of sightseeing and talk about which North End restaurant we would enjoy for dinner that night! The time spent in this beloved neighborhood was the absolute highlight of our week in Boston. Gina and her husband went way above and beyond to accommodate our every need and make sure we were comfortable in Boston and their beautiful home, they too are true gems!!"
5782221,69568140,2016-04-11,26022740,Tari,"We thoroughly enjoyed out stay at La Gemma.  The location was perfect (and quiet!), the home lovely and everything exactly as described.  We would certainly stay here again on a future visit!"
5782221,70188545,2016-04-16,50748471,Mike,This was my first Airbnb experience and I'm a fan. Gina's home was as great as described. The location was fantastic. All the history just steps away. Wonderful restaurants at every turn.
5782221,71036202,2016-04-23,45662972,Marla,"We just returned from Boston and stayed at La Gemma, and it is truly a gem!  The accommodations were charming, perfectly located and very comfortable.   Everything was exceeded our expectations, including Gina's attention to detail.  We were welcomed with a warm note, chocolates, lots of information and maps.  We just could not have asked for a better experience.  Our daughter ran in the Boston Marathon and being on the North End was perfect.  We could not have asked for a better experience, and Gina made our Boston experience one to remember!"
5782221,72280597,2016-05-01,2650789,Erica,My brother and I enjoyed a few days in Boston and the visit was made so wonderful by our stay at La Gemma in the North End.
Gina has made such a comfortable,cozy space to return to after a full day of sightseeing and the condo location couldn't be better. Right in the heart of the Italian neighborhood of the North End there was no shortage of restaurants and cafes and although we really only prepared breakfast at the house,everything you could need to cook is supplied in the kitchen.,,,
The living space and bedrooms were exactly as described and pictured and all amenities needed were in good supply.,,,,,
It was lovely meeting you both,Gina & Matt,"and we loved our stay at La Gemma - a true Gem!\"",,,
5782221,72785573,2016-05-04,16533197,Ed,"La Gemma was perfect! Close to a lot of activities we wanted to do, plus restaurants we loved. Gina was very helpful guiding us to the place (not accustomed to courtyards!) and provided very thorough information on the area. We'd love to stay again on our next trip to Boston!"
5782221,73588251,2016-05-08,52417258,Laura,"The perfect location and setting for the North End with easy access to TD Gardens and the downtown hub.  Gina is the perfect hostess, giving us tips for dining and making our stay so comfortable in her home!"
5782221,74301006,2016-05-14,50767607,Michelle,"La Gemma, was a great find! We would make the same choice again, no questions asked."
The unit was everything we expected and more. The location was superb for sight seeing-close to the Freedom Trail,subway system,local restaurants,bakeries,and shops. This would be a great location for first time,and returning visitors. We quickly found our bearings navigating the neighborhood and felt safe at all times. It was a very quiet location
Gina was in contact with us from the time of booking throughout our stay,as needed. She was also a great resource for getting around Boston,things to do,"and all things \"\"North End\"\".  She provided very thorough \"\"instructions\"\" prior to arrival which alleviated our anxious tendencies. Though we never met","I felt as though we were old friends. \"",
5782221,74944875,2016-05-17,58238720,Karah,"We arrived early and the host allowed us the drop our bags off there while they finished cleaning. We walked around the neighborhood and got aquatinted with the area. The apartment was even nicer than expected with lots of places to try in the neighborhood. The facilities were great and we were more than comfortable. We had ample pillows, blankets, and towels. It was a nice home base and had ample space to relax and have a couple drinks. The restaurant recommendations were on point and we enjoyed many from the list! Needless to say, we will be back!"
5782221,75890190,2016-05-23,42594779,Susie,"Gina was so sweet and welcoming from our first contact to her texts welcoming us to Boston as our flight got in, to the card & chocolates & fresh flowers on the counter when we arrived.  The apartment was immaculately clean, really charming (exposed brick, cool touches everywhere) and so comfortable.  We loved every minute of our trip, and much of it was due to the home we went to every night at the end of our busy days.  We sat out in the tiny courtyard with a glass of wine each day.  The whole experience was amazing.  Thank you for everything, Gina."
5782221,76872064,2016-05-29,20122303,Jonathan,"This was a first-rate experience:  a clean, well-appointed apartment, an attentive, pro-active host, and a great North End location.  The rooms, one could say, are slightly smaller than typical, but really they are very much adequate in size.  Also the spiral staircase can be a little tricky.  Still, I include these details to present a balanced view, but make no mistake, this is a great option for a first-rate Boston experience, only a few short blocks from Mike's Pastries and the literally hundreds of wonderful restaurants and coffee/dessert shops of the North End.  A few steps further (9 minute walk) gets you to Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market, and another 10 minutes perhaps to Park Street, the State House, and Boston Common.  You will be very close to the airport here, and much less subject to traffic challenges getting in and out of town."
5782221,77904024,2016-06-04,21530039,Cheryl,"There were lovely flowers on the island in kitchen.  Gina provided list of restaurants, bakeries and sites close by.  The condo instructions were clear and we had no trouble finding the condo and gaining access.  It was a lovely place with a lovely courtyard and the neighbours were very friendly.  We were in north area near water and close to the sites we wanted to visit.  I would tell people about the wonderful condo we had in Boston and would  stay there in future."
5782221,78734261,2016-06-08,243313,Theresa,"Gina was gracious and helpful even before we arrived at the condo, helping us arrange to drop off luggage early and sending us information on the neighborhood and restaurants there and elsewhere in Boston. Fresh flowers and a welcome note awaited us when we arrived. She was concerned and prompt in addressing a small problem we had with an appliance (our fault-user error!) after we arrived. Just a few steps from the condo onto Salem or Hanover Streets were more restaurants, shops and sites than we could take in in the few days we were there.  The lovely greenway a few blocks south on the way to the T station (Boston subway) was a refreshingly open area in this urban enclave of narrow streets and dense housing. Being an historically Italian neighborhood, most things were deliciously food oriented - just what we love! The two-level condo itself was very charming, furnishings were stylish and very comfortable and the kitchen was just great! Having a half bath in addition to  the full bath made the place very comfortable for the 3 of us staying there.  Having the 2 bedrooms at opposite ends of the hallway, downstairs from the public areas meant everyone had their privacy and could sleep or be active on their own schedule. Everything was perfectly clean. This was a great comfortable place to stay, with good, easy access to all parts of Boston."
5782221,79196374,2016-06-11,25340578,Ranald,"We have just had a lovely stay at La Gem in Boston.  Gina was the perfect host providing lots of useful information and great tips on where we could eat and what we could do during our stay.   The apartment is brilliantly located so close to the City Centre and in the heart of the buzzing North End.  We found it a perfect base for our family to enjoy the City. The highlights of our stay were the Childrens Museum, Greenway fountains (which our 3 year old loved splashing in), Aquarium, Harbour Boat Cruise, Boston Common / Public Gardens - and the food!  The apartment is beautiful and so comfortable with plenty room for our needs.  The spiral staircase kept us on our toes as our 1 year old likes to explore but a suitcase at the top worked well to deter our explorer.  Gina very kindly arranged a travel cot (lay and play)  for us to use which we thought so kind as it saved us taking one with us on our flights from Scotland. We would recommend La Gem without hesitation. Great apartment, wonderful hosts (both Gina and Matt)."
5782221,80048689,2016-06-15,15476412,Melanie,"We had a great time at Gina's place. It's fantastically located in a beautiful part of Boston close to lots of interesting restaurants and little shops. We stayed with our two young boys so were a bit worried about the spiral staircase but we put a suitcase in front to block it off and it was fine. The bedrooms are on the lower floor which was great as they are dark, cool and quiet. The apartment was very well equipped and stylish with interesting prints and homewares. Gina was easy to contact and was really helpful, getting us a travel cot at no extra charge. I definitely recommend."
5782221,80506431,2016-06-18,27609407,Julie,"Loved loved loved the neighborhood and the convenience of everything. Such an awesome place to stay! Gives you a wonderful Boston (URL HIDDEN) much nicer than any hotel. Tons of room for my 2 small kids, husband and mother! Beds are comfortable and we never heard any of the neighbors. Only added expense we ran into was parking our car...the North end is resident sticker parking only, however there is garage down the street so we opted for that."
5782221,81358621,2016-06-22,24634855,Natalie,"\"Gina's \"\"La Gemma\"\" provided us with a truly special stay in Boston's North End. The location could not have been more perfect. A stone's throw away from the Freedom Trail and the most delicious Italian savory and sweet treats!"
We were extremely satisfied with every bit of our experience. Gina was so considerate and thorough in providing us with suggestions of places to eat. She was in constant contact with us,and when we had a little confusion over how to work the tv she called immediately to help problem solve. Which we did!,,,,
The apartment itself was so comfortable,cozy,"and CLEAN! The beds were heavenly and so was cooking in that beautiful kitchen. We had so much fun and would love to come back someday. Thanks for everything Gina! \"",,,
5782221,82067165,2016-06-26,55204552,Mona,"Our stay at La Gemma was an exeptional experience! The entire family felt welcomed. The condo was immaculately clean, well stocked, and comfortable. It was located in the perfect place to explore Boston's North End. It allowed easy access to the subway system. Gina was the most wonderful host! We loved her dining suggestions as well as the Boston literature and pamphlets. You can believe all the previous reviews. This place is a winner!"
5782221,83192129,2016-07-01,57280758,Dennis,"We had a wonderful 3 night stay at Gina's apartment in Boston.  It is located in a courtyard on a quiet street near the waterfront in the North End, only a few steps from the best bakeries, coffee shops, and restaurants.  From the apartment, we were able to walk easily to the Aquarium, Quincy Market, Public Garden, and many other attractions in-between.   We had a one year old baby with us and this location was just perfect as the adults can have a great time while still accommodating to baby's nap and food schedules without having to use the subway or a car.  The apartment  has a separate (i.e. not inside a bedroom) full bathroom located on the same floor as the 2 bedrooms.  And the half bathroom is on the same level as the kitchen which is very convenient.   Gina was kind enough to provide a pack and play for the baby and some food coupons for the adults, a very nice touch(URL HIDDEN)"

5782221,88557662,2016-07-24,4324554,Yutaka,Gine was an unbelievably responsive and friendly host.
As for her space,it was beautiful.  It is only a couple of blocks from the main,commercial part of the North End,so was very convenient but also very quiet.  Inside,the space was beautifully appointed and very peaceful.,

The condo is perfectly appointed and comfortably handled 4 adults. Please note that the spiral staircase is tough to handle; it's steep,narrow and short steps. We traveled very light. If you have larger suitcases you may want to leave upstairs. Not for someone with troubled knees,obese and other mobility issues. We adored it and thought it fit perfectly w the unit and area.,,,
Loved the courtyard and upgraded kitchen. The beds were so comfortable! So foolish to even consider a hotel.,,,,,

In fact, we walked everywhere from here - Faneuil Hall, Boston Common, Back Bay, etc. Nice kitchen and well equipped too so easy to eat in as well. Good communication from Gina so that made things easier as well. Would go back for sure. Thanks."

The location was fantastic, right in Little Italy, walking distance to parks and playgrounds, and within sight of Old North Church. The space was new and  well appointed. We felt safe and secure there. Gina was an excellent host, and was flexible and attentive."
5782221,92680625,2016-08-09,11516220,Liz,"La Gemma was the perfect place for a long weekend in Boston. We were welcomed with guidebooks, maps, cards for public transportation, and great restaurant recommendations. Gina even left a nice note with fresh flowers and vegetables from her garden for us to enjoy. The apartment was well stocked with all of the comforts of home- from coffee and olive oil to nice soaps and great linens. The closet was stocked with hats, umbrellas, an extra blanket, and even a printer! The decor was modern and comfortable."
The location couldn't have been better! We were able to walk to many historic sites,museums,and parks. The neighborhood has amazing restaurants and bakeries.,,,
My only caution would be about the staircase. Both bedrooms and the full bath are down a tight spiral staircase. It may be hard to navigate for the elderly or physically impaired.,,,,,

Outside noise was pretty minimal in this unit due to it being brick construction and facing the back alleyway. The bathroom was nice and featured new marble tile. I also appreciated shower water pressure; it was fantastic! There was always plenty of hot water in reserve too."
The A/C was able to cool this place very quickly,which was great since outdoors it was in the upper 80s the whole time.,,,,

754845,7718171,2013-09-30,1732428,Danielle & Torsten,This studio was in a great location and fulfilled our needs. You simply cannot beat this location. Quiet at night too.
754845,7834789,2013-10-05,8608636,Joseph,Let’s start by saying that we have enjoyed our Boston visit.
The apartment is situated at corner of the lovely Newbury street,full with elegant shops and many dinning choices and only three minute walk from the Hynes T station on the Green line - everything you need for a short stay. On the down side which needs to be consider: there are no place to sit and rest,you need either to lay down  in bed or sit on a high bar chair. The apartment is part of an old house with no elevator. We had studio #3 which requires to climb some 40 stairs in a narrow and tough slope staircase. Quite inconvenient to drag up your heavy luggage. But as we started,to sum it up,the pluses of the apartment made our stay enjoyable (on top of the great weather we were fortunate to have),

There was no one to welcome me, however, instructions for entry via key codes were clear and adequate. The location is great. I was attending a large conference at the Marriott Copley Plaza, and it was about a 10 minute walk, way cheaper than staying in the hotel. The hosts responded promptly to Airbnb messages as well as providing a 24/7 phone number. The only major problem I had was that the WiFi was so slow as to be unusable for normal business work (connecting back to my corporate network via VPN was impossible). They sent someone over twice to reset the modem and router, however no improvement resulted. If you are a business traveler and need WiFi, be sure to check with them that the WiFi has been upgraded. I ran (URL HIDDEN) several times and got download no higher than 0.25 Mbps which for Comcast in Boston is rediculously slow. I ended up having the set up my phone as a WiFi hotspot, but that was eating up my data allocation. Also, their WiFi is insecure, requiring web browser login. Most browsers with security in mind put up multiple warnings when you are being redirected to the web-based login. Authentication should be changed to WPA2 which is way easier to deal with and is secure."

We invited over friends for a roof top cocktail  which was also beautifully decorated with a good view.  Pluses:  great bed and variety of pillows, welcome package of juices, oatmeal, Coffee, and fruit bars (this ranked high), clean,  fluffy white towels and nice hotel quality sheets."
This building seemed to have a few units in it.  Ours was on the top floor which was a lot of steps to carry up heavy luggage.  This is typical for Boston,however if you have medical issues ask for a lower floor.   The room has a great orientation manual that was very helpful !!  The location is ideal between two subway stops and walking distance to the Freedom Trail.  Walking a lot is expected in Boston.  Internet was iffy so we used our data.  There was no air conditioner but there was a fan and a ceiling fan.  I would definitely stay here again and really enjoyed the brown stone experience.  Tips:  The Bistro downstairs was fantastic.  Do not use any taxi from the airport except the airport cabs.  Our taxi fee was $28.  compared to the $50 another company tried to charge.  Parking is not impossible but can be difficult to find.,,,,
"Bistro downstairs was excellent\"",,,,,
10427199,78564056,2016-06-07,50150418,Monica Beatriz,Muy bien equipado el apto. Sólo necesita agregar una mesa pequeña al lado de la ya existente para poder apoyar utensilios cocina. La señal de wifi en el apto 9 era muy débil y en consecuencia inconstante. Limpieza muy buena

Everything worked in the house, washer/dryer, heat, etc.  The bathrooms were clean and spotless.  Cindy is a wonderful hostess who is friendly and accommodating.

"Thank you.\"",,,,,
3412990,48890761,2015-09-29,37324571,Janet,"This was a very nice place to stay.  It was in a street and back in where it felt like it was a safe neighborhood.  The room was nice as described and the bed was absolutely comfortable.  I did not care for the wicker chair that was in the corner. However, we were seldom in our room so that didn't matter.  We communicated through cellphone messages and Cindy was quick at getting back to us. I loved having a fan as well and Cindy was willing to make provisions about storing our luggage early due to arriving early from the airport."
3412990,49445017,2015-10-04,33310057,Kyle,She was very helpful in giving great directions and willing to help in whatever way.

3412990,50640678,2015-10-13,42323431,Patty,"The listing was just as described, in a safe location close to the T, and the bed was comfy. We never met Cindy, but she was great at communicating via text/email and her directions were perfect. We were around so little that we made no use of the rest of the house, but she provides coffee, cereal and laundry facilities. Only complaints: For some reason, the bathroom was freezing and our bedroom doorknob came off in my hand the morning of our departure - giving me a few panicky moments! - but I was able to get it back on  enough to get out. Would stay there again!"
3412990,50789460,2015-10-14,45170229,Katrina,Cindy was a great host and the room was wonderful! Although I din't see her while I was there she was very helpful and allowed me to leave my stuff in her house before the room was ready. The room was extremely clean and quiet. I have no complaints!

Cindy was friendly and very responsive to any questions that I had.,,,,,
Cindy's home was more hostel-esque than I was expecting-- but in the best possible way. The other guests were quite,"curtious and I had the opportunity to chat with some very nice people over coffee in the morning. \"",,,,
3412990,52116017,2015-10-26,38288011,Kristen,"I did not meet my host, but she was kind enough to make sure I received all necessary check in information."
The neighborhood was okay,not great. I think serene is not the right word to use. It was a low traffic street so secluded is appropriate with the consideration it is in an urban area. It was a good location for using the public train and in walking distance of conveniences.,,,,
The entrance to the home was cluttered/dirty. We were not expecting there to be three rooms rented out to different people,all sharing one bathroom,the ad could be more specific. The bigger issue with this was it was very loud. The door upstairs to the apartment and the doors to the adjacent rented rooms were very loud/squeaky and people were up and opening/closing them after midnight- it was very difficult to get rest. Also,the bathroom was small and the shower could have been cleaner. I did not use the kitchen,"but seemed fine at a glance.\"",
3412990,52314391,2015-10-28,36535207,Bárbara,"The apartment was so nice and comfy and super close to the venue. Just what I was looking for! Very clean, very equipped with everything! Even tho we didn't have the chance to meet in person, Cindy was a great host! She sent me any and all instructions for my arrival to the place making everything so easy.

9259184,54642501,2015-11-22,5522021,Catherine,We had a great time in this Airbnb. Check in was easy. Jay was happy to be flexible. There was excellent attention to detail. The apartment has nice furniture and fixtures and a super comfy king bed. Everything was very new and clean. It is a good location right in the little Italy of Boston.
9259184,55287304,2015-11-29,48567629,Faith,Jay was a FABULOUS host and the location was great.
I was traveling to Boston to spend Thanksgiving with my two sons so I wanted to find the perfect place where we could feel at home,have plenty of space and relax for the holiday.  Jay quickly responded to all of my questions (and believe me,there were quite a few).  He went out of his way to be sure that we had everything we needed to enjoy the holiday.,,,
The apartment was newly renovated and furnished,and was clean and  ready for us when we arrived.  I loved having a washer and dryer right there in the apartment so I could take my son back to college with clean clothes,and I didn't have to do a lot of laundry when I returned home.,,,
The gym was a great place to get in a workout,and had plenty of equipment to do the basics.,,,,
"I would love to stay here again when I have a few days in Boston.\"",,,,,
9259184,55773839,2015-12-05,8649874,Michael,Amazing place and even better host!! Stay here!
Place is actually more convenient than stated - great location in North End.  Near the subway stop and close to a million cool restaurants and bars.,,,,,
Bed was extremely comfortable and enjoyed Jay's style in putting together the place.  Great wood floors,and woke up to the sun shining through.  Great home feeling. Only disappointment was that I wasn't staying longer.,,,,
There is a gym too which has all the basics for a great workout.  Great place,internet,cable and a gym.  Way better and much cheaper than a hotel.  No brainer to stay here again.,,,
Jay was great - last minute booking and Jay interrupted his night to meet me and make sure everything was all set.  Gave me recommendations for dinner,coffee,"and night life.  Just ask him next time. Thanks Jay for letting us stay at your place and look forward to staying next time with you. Everyone else this is a great place to stay and see Boston. \"",,,
9259184,56084098,2015-12-08,21406932,Alex,"Everything was as Described but better. Very nice, spacious flat in the heart of the North. Great Location that was very walkable to many destinations.  Beds were super comfy and just nice all the way around. Jay was very accommodating with small requests and did his absolute best to get us in early."

Apartment is clean, big and well appointed.  Great food and restaurants just steps away - we did takeout pizza from Ernesto's which was awesome."
4th floor walk up,which was not a problem for us - just good to know.  If you are driving,don't bother trying to park on street -not easy.  Just use the parking garage on Commercial Street - a 3 minute walk.,,,
"Would definitely stay here again and Jay is a great host- very helpful. \"",,,,,
9259184,58091326,2015-12-31,25442871,Jennifer,"\"Jay's place was great and in the perfect location - right on the edge of Little Italy - seriously steps away from great bars, restaurants, Mike's Pastry (went there twice!) and the T if we wanted to go to neighborhoods further away.  Almost a stop on the Freedom Trail!  Faneuil Hall area was also super close.  All of that and the parking garage about 3-4 blocks away made it easy to just park the car ($34 per day - cheapest rate we saw) and either hoof it or take the train.  There were some \"\"ceiling leaking\"\" issues (it snowed and rained quite a bit while we were there)"
9259184,58195692,2016-01-01,2399582,Adam,"The apartment was a dream. I wish I could live there, but I'll settle for recommending it to anyone interested in a stay in Boston. Jay's email (and one phone call) communication was absolutely stellar."
9259184,58415266,2016-01-02,16687724,Jennifer,"Jay was a great host. We didn't get to meet in person only via phone, but the check in process was seamless. His place is immaculate! It was exactly like the pictures, very clean, and had everything we needed for our short stay. I recommend his place to anyone looking to visit Boston.  We were within walking distance of pretty much everything. Thanks Jay for the perfect stay! I'll be sure to stay here when I visit Boston in the future!  :-)"
9259184,59245220,2016-01-08,608864,Anne,"Definitely enjoyed my stay in this North End apartment - 15mins walk from MGH where family member had surgery and hospital stay. Very clean, spacious and comfortable apartment for two of us. Apartment is street facing an active arterial, so if you're not accustomed to street noise/city living pack some ear plugs for a good night's sleep. Beds are particularly comfortable - one's a king and other a queen; new heating/cooling system quiet, adjustable and responsive. Nice kitchen to come home to after long day and eat in..and great to have the gym access. It's a terrific location for Boston visitors - seeking a home base from which to explore. Jay was extremely responsive and accommodating when we had unknowns about length of stay and needed to add an additional night. Completely recommend!"
9259184,59803014,2016-01-15,39014257,Jiachen,"The apartment is very good-clean and spacious. The location was very convenient for us. We enjoyed our stay very much here, highly recommended."
9259184,60028756,2016-01-18,7860804,Andrea,"Great location in the North End right in the middle of Little Italy = so much GREAT food everywhere you look outside the apartment. It was right in the middle of the Freedom Trail, so it was easy to follow the path and walk 80% of the places we wanted to go. It was less than $10 to get to Harpoon Brewery, the only real spot we needed a car to visit. The place is exactly as described and Jay was very helpful and easy to communicate with when we had questions. We had two couples with plenty of space for all of us. The bed is very soft and the bathrooms were nice. It can be a little noisy since you're right off a main street. But for the location, I felt it was worth it. Traffic dies down the later it gets, so it's not something that will keep you up all night. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
9259184,60983459,2016-01-30,34283105,Hugo,"Jay is a great host and really helpful for his guest. The flat is in mint condition and very well placed (5min walk to TD Garden, 10 to central Boston). Once again, thank you very much Jay to offer this fantastic flat."

It is located in an adorable nook of the North End.  There were tons of restaurants and coffee places within walking distance.  I also got a great massage just a brief walk away.  I would definitely stay here again if my travels bring me back to Boston."

Jay provided all the information we needed to make our stay great,including clear instructions for the apartment and it's surroundings information.,,,,
The apartment is in excellent conditions. Everything is well kept,clean and comfortable,specially the beds and pillows. We were two couples and having our own bedroom and fully equipped private bathroom was very convenient.  The kitchen is fully equipped so we could prepare our breakfast everyday,and enjoyed eating out taking advantage of all the restaurants in this beautiful Italian neighborhood.,,
The location is perfect. Metro stations across the street,and so many restaurants and historic places walking distance. We enjoyed walking around. The only downside is a construction in front of the building. They start working early in the morning on weekdays,and could be a little noisy.,,,
We definitely love this rental and will rent it again if our travel plans ever get us back to Boston.,,,,,
Thank you Jay for being a wonderful host!,,,,,

9259184,69220917,2016-04-10,1505695,Pamela,My husband and his friend stayed here for the weekend.  They said the place was in a good location and very walkable to Haymarket.  They  were able to get around easily without a car (which is a must for Boston).  Also Jay was super responsive and communicative prior to the trip so they knew exactly what do with check in and check out.  Jay made their trip easy and the place was great.  The only minus  was that there was some street noise but thats unavoidable when staying in the city.
9259184,69612966,2016-04-11,66308307,Nicholas,The Cooper BnB is the PERFECT Boston location if you are visiting the North end area. Jay was easy to communicate with and quick and responsive. We will definitely be staying again thanks!-Nick

The apartment was large and very well maintained and the beds were super comfortable. Jay is extremely communicative and made the check-in process super easy, which was very appreciated. We were only in town for a night, unfortunately, because this place is definitely a great option for spending several nights in the city. I hope to be able to come back and rent it for a longer visit!"
9259184,75521849,2016-05-22,49276949,Artur,"Jay's apartment is very spacious and looks exactly like in the pictures. The location is perfect to walk everywhere. Throughout our visit, there was absolutely no need to use public transport, besides getting from and to the Amtrak station (which is only 15 min on subway). Jay was very fast to respond to any questions that we had. There is a great TV set with Netflix and cable, which was very nice to have. Towels, and bedsheets were clean, as well as the whole apartment. The only issue that bothered us is that the the windows were thin and we could hear noise from the street. However, the street is busy only during the day and it is perfectly fine at nights."
9259184,76213723,2016-05-25,56066197,Richard,"Fantastic location, lovely apartment, wonderful host.   Perfect spot in Boston right next to Faneuil Hall and the heart of North End.

9259184,76432559,2016-05-27,36491628,Cindy,"Jay was a great host and answered my personal queries about restaurants, rental cars and the bedroom door that lead to another hallway.  Unfortunately, we arrived 1 day late due to a medical emergency on the 1st leg of our trip.  We enjoyed the spacious accommodation, location and easily managed the 4 flights of stairs."

"Arrival at the \"\"luxury\"\" apartment was disappointing. Ikea style furniture",uncomfortable dining chairs with cheap poly covers. The master bed room: no chair,no bedside table,a failing light,just a few hangers and a bed so soft one could not sit on it and put on shoes. Worn towels.  The kitchen didn't even have salt and pepper---it really felt like a motel.,
The long walk up 4 flights is no problem,but the halls stink of diesel fuel.,,,,
Although the neighborhood was great,"the apartment is situated on one of Boston's noisiest corners.  Impossible to open the windows.  I think calling this a luxury destination is a total misnomer.\"",,,,
9259184,79882831,2016-06-14,68656768,Lucha,"We are just back from a wonderful vacation in Boston. Our apartment at 59 Cooper Street could not have been more perfect. The apartment was clean, spacious and well stocked with dishes, towels, etc. Everything we needed was within walking distance - historical sites, fabulous restaurants, cute shops, and the basics like CVS and grocery stores. We got almost everywhere on foot which was a real treat since we are from California and have to drive everywhere!"
This was our first experience with Airbnb and we were a bit nervous. However,our host was great every step of the way.  Jay always responded promptly to our questions and was very helpful with the check-in process. There was a minor problem during our stay and Jay took care of it immediately.,,,,
We could not have been happier with our stay and are very grateful to Jay for making sure that everything went smoothly.,,,,,

The unit was very nice, clean and attractive. I would recommend it for people looking to tour around Boston, especially the North End (it's a very short walk to all the restaurants and gelato shops!). I would not recommend it for very light sleepers as it is on a major intersection and is very noisy starting at 6 am."
9259184,81374893,2016-06-22,49818476,April,Jay's place in the North End was great! Perfect location to enjoy all that Boston has to offer. Close to the wonderful Italian district and a Tstop to get to all other points in Boston. Also easy walking distance to the waterfront and Faneuil Hall.

The pictures posted by Jay have said it all. The owner is friendly and nice.  He made us feel welcome."

The neighborhood was great -- restaurants on the same block, a grocery store just behind the building. Cell reception was variable, but there is a phone provided with free local calls. It was very close to the Joseph B Martin conference center."
The bed looked nice,but had a very stiff spring mattress and was not very comfortable. Additionally,with that neighborhood,it was quite noisy at night,with ambulances/sirens and car noises throughout the night. Toiletries were provided,but there was only 1 serving of coffee.
Per the check-out instructions,we were supposed to wash dishes,and while there was a dishwasher,there was no dish detergent provided for the dishwasher (only dish soap for hand washing). I certainly hope the cleaners also wash the dishes in between uses,as I would not want to trust someone else's hand washing techniques. Additionally,in order to not be charged an extra clean-up fee
Overall,it was very clean,safe,and secure,"but for $250/night I expected coffee provided for such a short stay (I was only there 6 days) and less cleaning required at the end to prevent further charges.\"",

The location was super convenient from the airport and to nearby eateries as well as Boston site seeing.

Her flat is well-located and is within walking distance to Back Bay and Downtown Boston. She made the effort to be at the apartment when I arrived and when I left. I got to know her during the stay and by the time I left I felt like I was leaving an old friend. Her fridge is stocked with delicious, local beer she will generously share with you. The room was charming and quiet. I would definitely stay with Celia again."

Got back to me within minutes and we were able to work it all out. When I arrived, she was so sweet and offered me beer or a Pellegrino! We had a nice little chat and made sure I knew how everything worked. I didn't cook while I was there, but it's a great setup. The bed is a futon, so I probably wouldn't recommend it for long term stays, but it was fine for my long weekend visit. The apartment is in a lovely location in the South End, on a gorgeous street!

453660,31978639,2015-05-12,19933433,Jayme,Absolutely fantastic host. So pleasant and helpful. We felt that Ce really went out of her way to make us feel welcome. The area was really pretty and within walking distance of Back Bay station. Downtown was also easily accessible.
The only reservation we would have is that as a group of three,the single room was too tight a squeeze,especially taking our luggage into account. More than enough room in the living room if they're not booked together though.  That made it quite disappointing given we were sharing the living space with another couple. So keep that in consideration when booking. Otherwise,she handled every situation very well,professionally and promptly,we were grateful for such a selfless host.
All in all,"a great host and a delightful area. \"",,,,

Our reservation was made last minute,she was still very accommodating.,,,,
What a lovely ball of energy. She made sure we understood how to get around the city near her Apartment,which café's were closest for breakfast or brunch,and wouldn't even let us look at the room we were renting until it was up to her standards (very much appreciated).,,,

453660,41400873,2015-08-07,37217751,Ankit Kumar,Ce was a good host. She was enthusiastic in telling us about the nearby places to eat and places to visit in Boston.
There are two bedrooms in her house,she lives in one of them and the other one is for guests. There is a bed in her living room as well,which can also be booked on Airbnb. So essentially there are 6 people living inside the house (which we were not expecting,though it turned out to be a good experience interacting with co-guests who were a couple from Switzerland).,,
The bedroom is compact. We were two of us and were just able to fit in the bed. There is no air-conditioning inside the bedroom,though the AC in kitchen was able to keep the ambience cool. The kitchen is well decorated (Ce is passionate about food). The house is tidy,the neighborhood is good.,,,

815639,5599125,2013-07-08,5542066,Tyler,"This is a small apartment, but I absolutely loved it. It is along the Freedom Trail and is literally just around the corner from the Old North Church – a Revolutionary War landmark – and down the street from Copp’s Hill Burying Ground – the second oldest burying ground in Boston. The location is excellent."
The air conditioning kept the apartment cool – even though it was in the 90s my entire stay,the apartment was a delight to be in.,,,,
The bed is amazing,and the sheets soft. I definitely got a good night's sleep while here.,,,,
The wifi is also fast (in the neighborhood of 16Mbps) – something I had not experienced in some of the other AirBNB rentals I had done,so that was nice.,,,,
The apartment is probably 5–10 minutes walk from the T’s North Station,so it is convenient to the Green and Orange lines as well as a bus route and commuter trains.,,,,
I only see two negatives to this apartment:,,,,,
1) There is not a full kitchen,so if you want to cook your own meals while in Boston,this isn't the rental for you. In reality though,this apartment is in the North End and is very close to a ton of restaurants. You won't be starving.,,
2) The entrance to the apartment is at the end of an alley (there are entrances to other apartments in this alley as well,not just this one). While I never felt unsafe,I can see how this might make some people uncomfortable,so take that under consideration.,,
"I would definitely stay here again!\"",,,,,
815639,5639659,2013-07-09,265313,Charles,"Great place and location in the North End. It was a little tricky to find, but the host gave me detailed directions by phone and then I found it with no problems. Terrific neighborhood with a great breakfast place nearby!"
815639,5672631,2013-07-11,645360,Melissa,"Loved staying in this apt.   Convenient location, really charming, and very clean.    Host was super accommodating and helpful."
815639,5748888,2013-07-15,2592181,Cecilia,"We had a nice stay at Jose / Jason 's place. The location is very good in the Italian neighbourhood. This studio is just steps from the Freedom Trail, bakerys and restaurants."
Contact with the owner was easy and the delivery of the key too. The apartment was very clean and neat. Is an generous size studio with a very comfortable bed and a large bathroom. The kitchen is in a corner. Is has a coffee machine,but it needs an electric kettle. The refrigerator is very noisy. At night you can hear the people upstairs and a noisy equipment from the apartment next door. Aside from this,"I recommend it for a few days in Boston.\"",,,
815639,5979757,2013-07-25,4654063,Ken,Had a great stay in Jose's great Boston North End location. Stayed a week. Very convenient to restaurants and waterfront.
815639,6030537,2013-07-27,2036664,Caroline,We had a nice stay at Jose/Jason's place.
The location is really great and a definite selling point! The freedom trail and tons of restaurants and pubs are literally one step away.,,,,,
It was also really easy getting in touch with the host both during the booking process and once we had arrived.,,,,,
The apartment itself was okay: it had a random fridge just hanging in a corner,it could use a little TLC and you could really hear people upstairs. Nonetheless,"it is a great choice if you plan on spending your day out in Boston. I'd still recommend this place.  \"",,,
815639,6044808,2013-07-28,6116446,Gesine,"We enjoyed our stay. Jose is a great host, thank you!"
The apt is clean and the location is perfect. We walked everywhere and there is tons of nice italian restaurants around.,,,,,
You can hear people walking in the apt right above this one,"so if you're very sensitive to noise this might not be for you. We didn't mind at all and had a great stay. \"",,,,
815639,6143516,2013-07-31,2152189,Al,"Great location, very clean and comfortable (and well decorated) place. 24-hour bakery down the street! Jose/Jason was very responsive and easy to work with and everything was as described. Hope to stay again."
815639,6234339,2013-08-05,4756142,Frances,"GOOD: Great location - on the Freedom Trail, old Italian neighbourhood. Clean in all important areas. Roomier than it looks in the photos. Good air con."
The 'random fridge' was being removed as we arrived. Jose has replaced it with a quieter one.,,,,,
Jose was responsive to our communications and offered us help finding Red Socks tickets if we needed it.,,,,,
BAD: Nylon sheets that didn't fit the matress so they didn't stay on. Jose took over as host after our booking,but we go no notice of this. Apartment is a little dark. Musty smell,but that was just the age of building.,,,
OVERALL: If the sheets were cotton,"we'd stay here again.\"",,,,
815639,6319249,2013-08-08,5951566,Diane,This studio is situated in a perfect location for travel on the Freedom trail.  It was very clean and had everything we needed for a short stay.
815639,6370562,2013-08-10,7204571,Sarah,We had a very nice time in their place. The location is unbeatable. It is very clean and the hosts were very helpful. Thank you!
815639,6435224,2013-08-12,7678501,Segolene,Appartment perfectly located. Clean. A bit noisy.
"I recommend.\"",,,,,
815639,6528027,2013-08-16,4653618,Simone,The apartment was as seen in the photos and very clean.
Jose was very helpful in meeting our need for additional mattress.,,,,,
"I recommend with pleasure this apartment.\"",,,,,
815639,6585519,2013-08-18,6846524,Istvan,"My girlfriend and I stayed there.its a very nice,clean place.closte to the Freedom trial,coffee shops and restaurents.I recommend this place and to everyone.I will stay this place next time too.;)Thank you Jason.You're great host."
815639,6630545,2013-08-19,7610301,Michael,Apt was clean and my host was helpful with directions from north station - easy to get in but a little different getting in an alley way in the night if you don't live in the big city - talked to owner of building and some neighbors and everyone talked about how safe neighborhood was - cool space ! Was part of original rectory to Paul revere church across st - underground tunnels in the city came right up in this space !! Pretty cool !
815639,6683083,2013-08-21,3451139,Cory,I had a very enjoyable stay in the North End. The space was charming and in an ideal location. Jose and Jason were great hosts. They were easy to get a hold of and very accommodating. I would definitely recommend staying here for your next trip to Boston!
815639,6728443,2013-08-23,4655244,Hannah,"The apartment is very sweet, nicely decorated and clean with a v. comfortable bed! the apartment is located in 'little Italy' and very close to everything you need in Boston. Jose is a great airbnb host. The communication was second to none and the check in and check out was smooth and flexible, which we were very grateful for. I would recommend to anyone wanting to stay in Boston."
815639,6931387,2013-08-31,1412204,Laura-Celeste,"A wonderful place to stay and would definitely book again. Very clean, lovely towels and a fantastically comfortable bed!  Yes, you can hear people walking upstairs if they thump around - all to do with the wooden floor BUT after a day getting used to it is was not an issue.  A spacious apartment in a very safe area and the food establishments around are numerous and tasty.  Jose was very quick to answer my call when I had forgotten what apartment number I had booked.  Thank you so much for a wonderful stay."
815639,6959084,2013-09-01,2257957,Jenni,This was exactly what my boyfriend and I needed for our one night in Boston.
The apartment is tiny and minimalistic,but it has everything you need. The name says it all: definitely has a medieval feel with an entire exposed brick wall. The neighborhood is historic,lively,and full of great seafood and Italian food (it's in Little Italy,after all). Short walk to public transportation.,
"The host gave great directions (would be hard to find otherwise) and left plenty of tips to help us get around. I would definitely stay here again!\"",,,,,
815639,7006418,2013-09-03,5301880,Ian,"We stayed here for a few days while en route to New York. It was small, but well situated and clean. Steer clear of the coffee shop immediately adjacent the near-by church - better offerings reward a longer walk."
815639,7105186,2013-09-06,6911089,Joyce,Fabulous location and arranging with the owners was seamless and easy. The apt was spotless and the bed is really comfortable.  The only thing to be aware of is that the apt is first floor in an alley and I wasn't comfortable leaving blinds/windows open so it's pretty dark feeling - but we weren't there much and I would certainly recommend it.
815639,7111148,2013-09-07,3461903,Barbara,"Very nice apt, in a nice area.. We stayed very well.. There's all you need.. Jason is a perfect host, I raccomend him.."
815639,7155804,2013-09-09,6440866,Kim,"Everything was great.  A little hard to find in the dark but only took a few extra minutes to figure out.  The room is very quiet, except the little fridge goes on every hour or so but I'm a light sleeper.  No TV but I didn't have time to watch one.  It has a little kitchen with micro and 1 burner if you want a kitchen.  Pillows were very comfortable.  The bed is high and comfortable."
815639,7209882,2013-09-10,8550673,Zahra,Exactly as described and very clean. Jose was super responsive and accommodating. The perfect place for two. We were traveling with our 2.5 year old son and it worked well for the one night we stayed. Wholeheartedly recommend staying here.
815639,7304624,2013-09-15,3218218,Alrik,A great location hidden away in the heart of the North End. Perfect for my stay.  I was even able to drop off my bag a little early.
815639,7349932,2013-09-16,3423821,Johann,"Nice, simple but tidy place perfectly located in the Italian quarter of Boston. Jose was accommodating in terms of check in and out times which was much appreciated. Would recommend it!"
815639,7431539,2013-09-20,2820042,Emanuela,"Host is very helpful, he help us every time we need something. He always answered ours questions quickly. Apt is situated in a great location, it is in italian area and there are very much restaurants and bars. By foot we have visitated all the most importants places in the city. I suggest this apt, if we return in Boston we choose this apt again!!!"
815639,7462438,2013-09-21,8034746,Barclay,Were given all the info we needed well in advance making everything very easy.
815639,7574003,2013-09-25,4644584,Claire,Quiet studio apartment in a great location in north end. Perfect for a short break in Boston!
815639,7766860,2013-10-02,1027783,Carol,"Our stay on Hull St. Ct. was good.  The location can't be beat!  It was about six blocks to the T but that was not a problem for us.  Being right on the Freedom Trail had its advantages.  Also, since the location is in the North End restaurants abound - we were especially partial to Bova bakery (open 24 hours!) and the deli store next door that sold great fresh pasta and sauces along with other wonderful Italian specialties."
815639,7796498,2013-10-03,1898285,Alex And Marita,"Unfortunately, I (Marita) did not have a pleasant stay.  But, let me preface this by stating that Jose was very quick to respond and eager to remedy my situation."
The unit is situated on the ground floor,near the main entrance.  The walls and flooring are super thin,so you hear everything,including people entering and leaving the building.  On the day of my stay,there was construction taking place in the unit above well into the evening (9pm).  Eventually,I spoke with the contractors
I only stayed one night and expected to relax the day before my early morning appointment.  I really wanted to like this place,but I would not stay here again,nor recommend this unit.  As I said,Jose was very quick to remedy the situation,"once notified.\"",
815639,7940454,2013-10-09,6759353,Mark,We had a great stay at Jose's apartment. The check-in didn't involve meeting with Jose but the instructions given were clear.
It was as per the pictures and clean. It was actually a bit bigger than we thought it would be and there is some outside space out the back too. The kitchen area was good for preparing breakfast (although a kettle would be useful) but it isn't really set up for cooking as such,although that wasn't an issue for us.,,,,
The walls and floors are a bit thin so you can hear people walking around and talking in the apartment above but it didn't really disturb us and it was quiet at night.,,,,,
It's right by the Old North Church and close to a couple of T stations,although it's actually really quick and easy to walk around. The North End is a great area to be in,with plenty of bars,cafes and restaurants. Regina pizzeria is a must!,,
All in all,"very good. \"",,,,
815639,7977576,2013-10-11,661188,Gerdien,"The appartment is really good situated near to al lot of very nice italian restaurants and (coffee)shops. Al the sites you want to viset in Boston are on walking distance, but the subway is also very nearby. The bed is comfortable, althought maybe perhaps al little bit high. The appartment is little, cosy and clean. And the towels are really soft! A good place to stay while you visit Boston!"
815639,8003501,2013-10-12,4909099,Zach,"Jose was very hospitable. The space was as described. A very nice place to crash after a day of sightseeing in Boston. Ideally situated in Boston's North End, near many great bakeries and restaurants."

815639,8249608,2013-10-22,7612265,Rachel,Great location in the north end! Pretty clean. Can be a little noisy from the floor above but wasn't really a problem for us.
815639,8290856,2013-10-24,6695421,Dr. Maren,"Perfect experience in a nice apartment located in the historic center of North Side Boston. The host is professional and lightning fast with regard to communication, the apartment is clean and tidy and in a historic house in a very good condition. Triple A for this great place!"
815639,8345982,2013-10-27,8181404,Jackie,Jose and Jason's place was very beautiful! the studio apartment was very tidy and homey feeling. it had everything we needed including brochures on the table upon entering which always come in handy. overall it made our stay in Boston very pleasant and we would definitely stay there again.
815639,8382093,2013-10-28,9261733,Chandra,"Jose and Jason have a wonderful place in an awesome location. Just outside of this North End studio is the historical Freedom Trail, complete with the Paul Revere statue. There was a bit of hustle and bustle to be heard during the day because of the surrounding restaurants and shops (we recommend trying Caffe Vittoria's cappuccino). In the evening the street noise was next to none and we enjoyed a wonderful nights rest in Jose and Jason's clean and comfortable accommodations."
815639,8425425,2013-10-30,7074785,Claire,"Lovely little apartment, in a fabulous location.  Neighbourhood was quiet, and safe.  The North End is a perfect base for exploring Boston.  I would recommend this listing to anyone, and I would stay again.  We actually had two apartments in the same building, and had no issues with either."
This was our first Airbnb experience,and everything went smoothly.  Because of this,we did not have any interaction with the hosts while we were in Boston,but they were helpful prior to our visit,"and instructions for entry were very clear. \"",
815639,8635922,2013-11-10,7496311,Andrew,The apartment is in a great location in the heart of the north end (little Italy) so you're spoilt for choice for eating (try Regina's pizza on thacher street if you want good cheap pizza!)
The apartment was as clean as could be expected from a genuinely old building although we weren't sure if the random toiletries were left on purpose or just hadn't been cleaned away from the last stay!,,,,,
The kitchen is small but functional.,,,,,
Mainly though Jose and jason answered all our queries very quickly and we had a great stay!  We would come again!,,,,,
One thing I'd ask all airbnb owners though is for a really brief welcome manual as it would make knowing what to do with heaters/bins/recycling a lot easier...,,,,,
"Thanks!\"",,,,,

The apartment it well furnished, very clean and smells fresh. Wifi works really well too. Though the entrance is down a walkway between buildings it is very well let at night. I would not hesitate to return to this delightful North End location. I even found on street overnight parking at no cost!"

815639,8991600,2013-12-01,479390,Lee Ann,"Clean, warm and convenient, we had a fantastic stay ithe Medaeval Modern Haven! Jose emailed detailed directions before we left home which made finding the apartment and letting ourselves in a piece of cake. The historic space is a gorgeous mix of brick, plaster, wood and tile:updated and fresh. Though we could occaisionally hear the neighbors, never did noise interfere with sleep or relaxation. We walked to the Aquarium, Italian markets, and restaurants and the T was less than ten minutes away too. Loved our stay and highly recommend it for two."

Little Italy is right at the corner with lots of nice italian restaurants and pastries. It is a very safe and generally quiet environment. The apartment is clean, warm and pretty cozy.

Communication with the hosts was easy,the flat simple but nice (and warm) and the bed really comfortable. Oh yes,the shower was great!,,,
Although you could hear people upstairs it was not disturbing - in fact it was quite soothing as there is no television or radio to listen to. Not that I minded about the latter as the wifi worked perfectly well.,,,,,

815639,10945282,2014-03-14,1816520,Lou,"Great, convenient location in the North End of Boston. I enjoyed staying here, but just a warning there's no sound protection in the entire building and you can hear the other residents just talking at normal levels."
815639,11313478,2014-03-29,13223409,Sara,"I greatly enjoyed my stay at 2 Hull Street Court. The apartment really does have a medieval feel with the beautiful exposed beams, but it offers all the modern amenities of a chic North End one-bedroom. You can hear the upstairs neighbors move around and can occasionally hear the television, but I tolerated it easily. I would definitely stay here again if I return to Boston anytime soon."
815639,11397194,2014-04-01,11730957,Jaime,"Jose/Jason's apartment in Boston's North End is an excellent place to stay.  The apartment is unique with charm and character.  The location was both convenient and safe.  The apartment was clean and had everything we needed for our stay.  We thought the apartment was an overall great value.  The only potential consideration for future visitors is that the building is not sound proof at all.  When we first arrived, we could clearly hear the tenant/renter in the flat above us walking around and talking.  Happily, it seemed no neighbors were active or loud later at night.  Jose was very attentive and helpful with all communications.  I would definitely stay at Jose/Jason's apartment again in the future."

I was in Boston for business, and my partner was in Boston for pleasure, and this apartment served us both very well. The apartment is in the heart of the North End, on a quiet alley, on the same street as Old North Church. It is convenient to great attractions, like the Freedom Trail, while being in a quiet part of the neighborhood. It is about a 10 minute walk to mass transit, about 15 minutes by foot to the financial district, and about 30 minutes by foot to the seaport. There are many great restaurants and bars located with in 5-10 minutes - we recommend Neptune Oyster Bar!"
The apartment itself is cozy and warm. The bed is extremely comfortable and the shower is unbeatable. The kitchen is small,but has dishes,a coffee maker,fridge,and microwave. You will need to bring your own food and oil/spices. There is a large dining table for eating at.,
Other guests have mentioned the noise,and while noise can be heard in the building,we didn't have much of a problem with this. I will say that I definitely noticed when other residents arrived late at night,but the noise subsided rather quickly. Jose and Jason leave many reminders to be quiet in the building,and it seems that some other guests and residents choose to disregard this reminder. If you are sensitive to occasional noise,"this might not be the best place for you. But if you don't mind a little bump in the night - or sleep like a log - this is a great place!     \""
815639,11642780,2014-04-10,8401568,Alan,Jose and Jason's place in the Northend of Boston is perfectly located and a great place to stay to get the full Boston experience. There is a little bit of noise from the upstairs neighbors (the floor/ceiling is a bit thin) but nothing that unusual for an apartment in the middle of the city. Highly recommended!
815639,11742126,2014-04-14,11872444,David,"The apartment was located in a fantastic neighbourhood of Boston and 2 min walking distance to tons of restaurants and coffee shops and 10 min walking distance to the aquarium, Quincy market and the trains.    I couldn't have asked for a better location."

"Nous avons beaucoup aimé notre séjour! Le studio est bien situé et l'ambiance est chaleureuse. Nous étions près à pied de la \"\"Freedom trail\"\" et des principales attractions. Nous pouvions aller manger au Quincy Market ainsi qu'au petit café juste au coin de la rue. Nous avons aimé être dans le feu de l'action du quartier North end avec ses marchés et restos italiens. Finalement en arrivant du nord ( du Québec) on a pu stationner à 2 coins de rue du studio",juste à la sortie du pont!,,,,
We really enjoyed our stay! The place is well located and the atmosphere is warm full. We were close to the freedom trail and all the main attractions by foot. We could easily go to the Quincy market for a good meal and there is a small café at the corner of the street. We also enjoyed to be in the action of the North End with his Italian restaurant and market. Finally,coming from the north,we could park at the exit of the bridge,"just two corner from the studio.\"",,
815639,11964970,2014-04-20,6537284,Alan,What a place!
Easy self-check-in,,,,,
Ample space at an affordable price,,,,,
Place looks even greater than the pictures show,,,,,
Central location: situated along freedom trail,easy access to a large number of great restaurants,,,,

"Highly recommended!\"",,,,,
815639,12107993,2014-04-23,8462846,Mark,The neighborhood was great and the location in Boston was ideal to be close to everything but away from the commercial hotel zone. Really felt like a local staying at this place.
815639,12279193,2014-04-28,11700385,Minna,The apartment was very clean and neat and very suitable for a couple. Not that much of natural light but didn't bother as we spent the days mainly outside. The bathroom seemed new and the shower was great! Sound from an apartment upstairs were easily heard but didn't bother too much.
North End neighborhood is beautiful and cosy and full of nice Italian restaurants,cafes and bars.,,,,
Overall,"we enjoyed Boston and neighborhood very much. We would recommend the apartment for someone wishing to have nice base from where to get to know the city.\"",,,,
815639,12430132,2014-05-02,1813138,Simon,"Warm, clean, spacious and (if you want to be in the North End) very conveniently located a few paces from North Church. The shower is great, there's a kitchenette with a microwave, china and utensils and there's a table to work at. The property is in an alley with little natural light so you'll not want to stay in all day. The room overhead is just a floorboard away so you'll hear everything from whoever is there."
Overall,"I loved it and would stay again.\"",,,,
815639,12680273,2014-05-08,1428651,Karen,"We had such an enjoyable stay in Boston. Our base in the north end was central to it. The flat was clean, warm, wonderful bed, with the softest bedding. The flat is a large studio. The entry is very well lit at night. The neighbourhood is quiet. You can hear neighbours upstairs when they come home at night, but they settle down quickly and you will not be disturbed."
Such an ideal location! Steps to the Old North Church. A multitude of great Italian food in the north end and also an easy walk to both Haymarket station and North Station. Quincy Market and Fanieul Hall are near by too. I can really recommend Lil Italy for coffee across the street.,,,,,
If we are ever lucky enough to come back to Boston,we will definitely check availability of this flat!,,,,
"Thank you \"",,,,,
815639,12742443,2014-05-10,11188863,John,Great location in the North End!  Perfect for a single person or a couple.  The host had the place nice and clean before we arrived.  Shower was awesome!  Would definitely stay here again.
815639,12866066,2014-05-12,4275998,Kelly,"This place is such a gem! It was a great location in the North End with good food, shopping, and transportation all very close. For my visit to Boston, I was all over the city, and it was very easy to navigate from this as home base. I think it helped me feel like a real pretend Bostonian. ;) The hosts were super easy to work with and very responsive to my questions and requests. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it."
815639,13023758,2014-05-17,3805497,Kamil,Jason is a great host. Staying at his place could not have been easier! Very good value.
815639,13431705,2014-05-27,14905066,Erin,"We were in Boston for two nights and stayed at this property.  It was clean, well equipped, and VERY convenient to a really wonderful part of Boston called the North End which is also little Italy and right along the Freedom Trail. We used this as home base and covered on foot a very large portion of Boston between the two days.  I would highly recommend this property!"
815639,13576392,2014-05-31,3096859,Brittney,"Amazing location surrounded by incredible food, history, and beautiful architecture in the North End. The apartment was easy to find and access, and Jose was quick to respond to any questions we had. I would absolutely stay here again!"

815639,14031945,2014-06-10,15011249,Marty,"What an absolute treat to be able to stay in a neighborhood such as this.  I felt a part of it, and learned much more about Boston than I would have had I stayed in a hotel.  Jason was a great host and was very responsive to my emails.  The apartment was very clean, well-kept, and exactly as described in the listing.  I highly recommend this location and this apartment.  It was an excellent experience."
815639,14282664,2014-06-16,14818507,Kris,"GREAT location - 76 steps from the historic Old North Church to our front door (we counted!), yet off the street and quiet. Very charming, full of character, and a nice mix of old historic feel with modern conveniences. Very clean, comfortable bed, nice linens/towels.  Bring your own shampoo and bath soap. Small kitchen has the basics. Jose was very responsive and directions for check in/out were easy to follow.  We loved being right in the heart of the North End - the only difficulty was deciding which of the many fabulous restaurants nearby to choose from.  And easy 7-8 minute walk to two metro stations, and multiple historic sites within a 15 minute walk or less. Great stay for two. We definitely hope to come back another time."
815639,14498026,2014-06-20,10993638,Robin,"Great apartment in a prime location! Jose was more than accommodating to letting us drop our bags off early, and the place was better that advertised! If you're staying in Boston, you've gotta stay here!"
815639,14981244,2014-06-30,1390180,Stephanie,"Perfect home for the weekend!  We spent the majority of the time exploring Boston - mostly on foot, which is totally doable with a good pair of sneakers.  We balanced out touristy items (cannolis in the North End, duck tour, Freedom Trail) and recommendations from locals (Fiore, Beehive, Gaslight restaurants, SoWa market).  Jose's haven was the perfect cozy spot to slumber, with the comfiest bedding and linens.  Can't ask for anything more! Thank you so much for hosting us - will return!"

They are pet friendly which apparently does NOT include  pit bulls but I was never asked the breed of my dog BEFORE we got there so how was I suppose to know??. ( I have a pit/mixed breed who is VERY friendly) so after being yelled at by the owner of the building"
815639,15507584,2014-07-10,17206226,Suzanne,"Hi Jason,  We did not enjoy your appartment very much, we were expecting something  clean and it was not, lots of dust on the headboard, a/c, by the windows, and  the floor in the bathroom was dirty,( I picked up something that had fallen with a tissue and the tissue became grey !) It would have been nice to have 2 towels each, maybe a bottle of cool water in the fridge. The bed is not confortable.  Also maybe you could install the a/c in the next window, it is too close to the bed. And of course no Internet, we were expecting that you would call us back or fix the problem.... .hum !  We did not feel welcomed. Too bad because going with airbnd we thought we would live something different, friendlier than a hotel.  One positive thing, the location."

815639,15626606,2014-07-13,15280748,Gloria,"My boyfriend and I recently visited Boston for the first time. While planning for the trip I looked into hotels and possible areas to stay in and found all the great areas involved hotel prices of $300 to $400 a night. Luckily I stumbled across airbnb and found this perfect modern haven in the best possible area. The price was perfect, the location amazing and the actual apartment was way better than any hotel. The bed in the apartment should be listed as a must see sight. The apartment had tons of character and the perfect amount of space. To top all this off it is in the best location we could have asked for. Stepping outside there's a wonderful cafe with yummy coffee and a front row view of the Old North Church. It was easy to walk all over to see the sights, and the subway was easy to find and jump on and off. When we return to Boston we are definitely booking this apartment again!!"
815639,15834686,2014-07-16,5616955,Chris,Jose was really easy to deal with. Cosy apartment in the perfect Boston location.

I loved the privacy of the entrance and the quiet neighbourhood. The north end is a beautiful place to stay. Everything is so close by! You can either walk, which doesn't take long at all and is extremely enjoyable or cab which will take 10 mins or less and never costed more than about 10$!! (Usually around 6$ plus tip) :)"
Jose/Jason was very responsive whenever I had a question. I loved boston and staying at this place SOO much and I felt totally safe,comfortable and at home. I'm even considering relocating to Boston one day!,,,,
It's honestly better than staying at a hotel! I don't think I'll ever look to stay at a hotel again! I recommend that anyone who stays here,takes a walk down to Bova's! Amazing bread and baked goods! Really nice people too!,,,,
Great host,GREAT place,"great neighbourhood! Oh and the bed was really comfortable!!  I recommend it 110%. Thanks again for everything!! Until next time! :D \"",,,

815639,16874497,2014-08-03,19064236,Andrew,"My parents were visiting me in Boston, so I was looking for a place in my neighborhood (the North End) for them to stay. This was perfect for them!!! It was on the first floor, which is a big deal in the north end, because many of the apartment buildings have very steep, narrow staircases that are difficult to lug suitcases up. The apartment itself was as described. It had a nice little patio in the back. The only thing my parents mentioned is that they wished there was a TV and coffee in the morning, but that's no big deal. Overall it served it's purpose well."
815639,17145059,2014-08-08,13504007,Trent,"This place is in a great spot, right in the north end and only a few blocks away from multiple T stops.  There are quite a few restaurants nearby and it's a short walk to the waterfront.  Getting in was easy, no trouble with keys or anything.  The hosts were very responsive when we had questions about the wifi."
The place is even nicer than it looks in the pictures,very open,nice sized bathroom,wifi.  The kitchen is small (no oven) but it works for a short visit,"especially if you plan to eat out often.  Overall it was exactly what we needed.  \"",
815639,17312555,2014-08-10,19129694,Michal,"I had a wonderful time in Boston, mostly because of the location of the flat. Almost everything is within a walking distance. It is a spacious and clean apartment in the old part of the north end. Easily can hosts a couple.  Located on a high ground floor but next to a quiet street so it is calm and quiet. Flat looks like on the pictures which is cool. There are cafes bars restaurants and groceries around."
In the flat there are towels and bed linen to use.,,,,,

815639,17503210,2014-08-13,10998672,Laurence,"As I already told Jose/Jason by mail, I've been disappointed by the apartment because I think it was not really welcoming : minimal furniture, not decorated at all, no shelf or place to put our clothes and toilet items, the apartment wasn't too clean, the bed wasn't comfortable, well it was different from the description and that's the first time this happens to me because I'm used to rent flats in the US, Canada, Italy, Spain but this was my first time with AirBnB so I don't know if what is said by the owners is checked or not. Well, this was not a nice experience and I'm sorry to say so. I think a few things could be done to improve the apartment."
815639,17684126,2014-08-16,13827797,Florian,Our stay at this place was perfect. The location just beats everything and the apartment is very cozy. There is everything you need (except an can opener) and the wifi is strong.

815639,18060003,2014-08-21,17085690,Nancy,"Jose was very communicative and helpful before we arrived and the instructions for locating the apartment and key were very simple.  The apartment location is fantastic since it is close to T lines and the Amtrak station.  We were in Boston during the summer and got lucky with the weather so did not need the AC but it was there if we had needed it.  The kitchen is limited so this apartment is perfect for those that are out and about in the city, eating lunch and dinner out, and just need a home base without all the comforts of home.  I would stay here again and would recommend the apartment to others, depending on their needs.  Thank you!"
815639,18148415,2014-08-22,9710092,Louise,"The directions to the studio apartment were detailed, easily understood and accurate.  We were totally pleased with the place.  It was very quiet,  very clean and spacious.  It is quite dark given that all the buildings in the area are very close together, but the location is superb; literally just up the street from the Old North Church and around the corner from countless fine restaurants.  The area felt very safe, interesting, and quiet"
Jose was very kind to let us stay a couple of extra hours while we were awaiting a phone call to confirm an appointment before we left the city,which was enormously helpful.  If we come back to Boston,"we will certainly book reservations here if  possible.\"",,,

It was comfortable and clean, and had everything we needed (except maybe the kitchen that wasn't as equiped as I originally thought).  The location was perfect, and we could walk by foot to pretty much anywhere we wanted to go.  The street on which we were was super quiet, with barely any cars using it (wonderful to get a good night sleep).  We were very satisfied with our stay."
815639,18921697,2014-09-02,5268790,Marla,"This was overall a great stay at Jose's apartment.  We only needed the place for one night, and Jose quickly approved our request. He was very responsive and accommodating, especially for our arrival time and advising us with parking options in the area."
The room is a great deal for the location,which is awesome. North End is really a fun area of Boston,and you really shouldn't need to be inside much if you are there anyways. Looking forward to our next visit!,,,
"\"",,,,,
815639,19028208,2014-09-05,890762,Juan,It is good value for money. Excellent location within north end.  The apartment does not have a real kitchen and electric heater would not have been able to operate.
815639,19309468,2014-09-10,12644681,Stacey,Stayed here from the 4th Sept for 5 days! I'd never used Airbnb before but would 100% use it again!  The apartment was as advertised and Jose was on hand whenever we needed anything (which we didn't)! The location was in a lovely area with a 5 min walk to the subway! Highly recommed! Thanks!
815639,19416731,2014-09-12,19320009,Bettina,"The North End neighborhood is great. This place is located on the first floor of an old building at the end of a narrow court. It's practical to deal with our luggages but means also that the natural light is rather poor and gloomy. And also, walls and floor are really thin : we share the neighbors' life. The kitchen-bathroom are okay but what happened to the nice furniture that we saw on the picture ?! Eaten by the ugly plastic coated couch and the old bed and mattress ? If you consider the roaring noise of the AC system under the front windows and the lack of cleanliness in parts of the place (man, take a look at the layers of dust on the fan, the brick walls, below and around the bed) we were very disappointed. We hope the price we paid for cleaning will benefit the next guests."
815639,19719622,2014-09-17,12244470,Richard,"From the beginning, Jose and Jason were accessible and responsive.  They gave clear instructions and were very flexible with our arrival time, allowing us to check in early.  When I called for assistance, Jason arrived within a few minutes to bring what we needed.  All communication with these gentlemen was a pleasure, whether it was an email, a phone call, or face to face."
The lock box and security instructions were perfect and the WiFi worked like a charm.  However,the location is the primary positive feature.  For my wife and I,"it had \"\"The BIG 3\"\" : 1. It's nice and cozy. 2. It's in a great neighborhood. 3. It's close to public transport.",,,
We don't need much in the way of a kitchen - just enough to do quick breakfasts,pack lunches,and bring back take-out or leftovers.  Between the local pizza,pasta,and pastry,we collected some amazing leftovers.  (Maybe THOSE are my BIG 3!)
The close proximity to North Station was a primary reason for choosing the Medaeval Modern Haven.  We used the Charlie Card to ride the T and for bus travel as well.  But,you can reach out to all of Little Italy by walking less than 15 minutes.  It's so fun to explore the area on foot,beginning with the Old North Church.  It's right on the Freedom Trail,less than 50 paces from your door.,,

The historic neighborhood (North End) right outside the door had plenty of restaurants, bars and coffee shops.  We especially appreciated Jose's flexibility on timing.  Since we had a wedding to get ready for, an early check-in was appreciated, as was a late checkout after a late night out."

815639,20987702,2014-10-09,8035038,Terry,Hosts were very responsive to my inquiries prior to arrival and throughout the week. Location was amazing - loved being in the North End and also a close walk to the T. Accommodations were simple (comfortable and cozy) but completely met our needs. Our week long vacation in Boston was everything we hoped for and more!

- Great communication with our host. Jose made sure we had everything we needed prior to our arrival.,,,,,
- Great location and value. Hard to beat stepping out the door and being greeted by Old North Church. And the short walk all that the North End has to offer was ideal.,,,,,
- Comfortable space. Just enough room for the two of us.,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
- The bed wasn't all that comfortable. Tolerable for a two-night stay,but it wouldn't be for longer than that.,,,,
- Minor cleanliness issues. The place was tidy and neat,but it could have been cleaner in some places.,,,,
- Sparse,"minimalist decor.\"",,,,

There were two of us and I had asked for use of the pull out day bed (twice in e-mails) which came with no bedding and it was plastic! Horrible (URL HIDDEN) not sleep on it.  Jose was pretty attentive at bringing some linens a few hours later but arrived with them stuffed, unfolded, in a plastic garbage bag; two sheets and a pillow case, really?  Also, as another guest advised.....use the payment from us to clean that place!"

815639,23323857,2014-11-29,21958988,Ann,"Jose helped make our stay comfortable after a misunderstanding about our needs. He replied quickly to phone calls and emails. Our apartment was large enough to have 5 adults eat Thanksgiving dinner around the table and the couch and another chair (plus a couple of the dining chairs) let us enjoy conversation.  Do not expect to be able to cook in the apartment. There isn't a stove/oven and the hotplate I found didn't work. The dishes aren't microwave safe even though the only means of cooking is a microwave. Fortunately, my daughter who lives nearby had a working kitchen where we cooked the big meal. The location was great and there were many restaurants, bakeries, and coffee shops close by. Not to mention the Harbor."
815639,23473859,2014-12-01,20904715,Irene,"We had a very good time in Boston in Jose appartment. It was very well located, with lots of restaurants, cafes and historic buildings to visit."

We have stayed at this apartment before and were very satisfied with the accommodations.  It was exactly as described and the pictures on the website are excellent.  It is a spacious and comfortable place to stay.  We had a small problem when we arrived and called Jose who immediately took care of it.,,,,,
"The neighborhood is great;  we felt totally safe and were within very easy walking distance of great North End restaurants.  We would certainly plan to stay here again if we return to Boston.\"",,,,,
815639,24047570,2014-12-18,20401,Jennifer,Jose was helpful and responsive. The place was clean and as expected. As other reviewers have mentioned - the bed is not the best. It was so soft that both my partner and I had back aches after just one night. Jose did assure me plans are in progress to update it.
Despite the bed this apartment is really wonderful. Perfect location to explore the north end of Boston,"my favorite part. \"",,,,

I'd definitely stay here again."
815639,25582797,2015-01-19,13945598,Alan,Cosy ground floor apartment in the heart of Boston's little Italy. The apartment felt antique and welcoming with all the mods and cons. Fantastic value and also just on the freedom trail!
815639,25819423,2015-01-26,24480929,Nicolas,"Le studio est sympa, plutôt grand et situé dans une ruelle calme d'un quartier sympa. L'équipement est basique mais le nécessaire est là. Il y a un canapé à la place du fauteuil sur les photos, le lit est correct (matelas un peu mou). Le chauffage peut être réglé à volonté, ce qui est nécessaire car en hiver, il y a des courants d'air importants !"
Au global,"le séjour a été agréable.\"",,,,

Nous avons découverts de beaux endroits, des cachets du quartier. Nous sommes arrivés juste après la tempête du siècle et c'était magnifique. Jose était disponible, nous avons eu la chance de le rencontrer. Nous a recommandé des endroits où manger. Le studio en soi était à la hauteur de nos attentes. Rien à dire. Je réserverais à nouveau sans hésitation. Merci."
815639,26552049,2015-02-15,7397787,Natalie,Always an easy experience with Jose. Apartment was as advertised in a great location in the North End. Simple check-in/check-out experience.

815639,27331366,2015-03-02,2638328,Scott,The apartment is great and perfect for a stay in Boston. I love staying in the North End.

815639,27761092,2015-03-11,8922581,Þórunn,I was very happy with everything The keys were were supposed to be and apartment warm and cosy It was very cold in Boston on my visit so the fact that the apartment was warm was great.On check out day we had a flight late in the evening and asked Jason if we could store our luggage for the day in the apartment This was not a problem The apartment it self was nice and cosy and had everything we needed The shower was good and everything spotless clean and tidy. I have no complain over the apartment or Jason and will be happy to return to Boston and 2nd Hullstreet again
815639,27967578,2015-03-15,5864919,Hailey,"The apartment wasn't the cleanest. The floors were kind of sticky and dirt and dust were in the corners. Checking in and out was easy. If you don't plan on spending a bunch of time in the apartment then it's a good place to stay! It's in a good location, close to many restaurants. Over all I would stay here again."
815639,28009303,2015-03-16,3495101,Raul,Cozy comfortable studio apartment that was perfect for our Boston gateway. We felt at home as we arrived. The apartments wonderful location allowed us to fully immerse our self in the neighborhood and have a one of a kind experience. Truly special :)

The apartment was spacious and provided the essentials (iron/ironing board/blow dryer/soap/shampoo).  The shower was awesome!  Jose was easy to contact/communicate with throughout the entire experience.,,,,,

815639,29036843,2015-04-03,18796497,Alan,I was in Boston for a conference and decided to stay in an AirBnB rather than book a hotel.
I am so pleased that I booked with AirBnB and also with Jose. The apartment is lovely; warm,comfortable and in a great location!,,,,
Jose made the experience wonderfully easy. I knew exactly what I needed to do well in advance of my arrival as Jose communicated everything with me very clearly (and after arriving off the back of a 30hr journey this was really appreciated).,,,,,
"I would definitely stay with Jose in Northend again. The process was incredibly easy and the apartment was beautiful. If you are going to be staying in Boston I highly recommend this place.\"",,,,,

815639,30373701,2015-04-21,9857261,Jill,"This place is WONDERFUL!!!  Jose was very attentive prior to our arrival by providing us with instructions to access the apartment and access the key.  The location of the apartment is by far the most wonderful location in all of Boston.  Right outside the apartment is the Old North Church, and the apartment is right in the heart of the North End with fabulous bakeries, restaurants, and shops.  The apartment was spotless, the wifi worked perfectly, and there was plenty of hot water for showers.  The location was quiet from street noise.  If you are driving to Boston, please note that there is no street parking available, so you will have to put your car in a city lot ($34.00 each 24 hours).  However, the lot is down the street and easily convenient.  Having lived in Boston and traveling to Boston often, staying in Jose's apartment gave us new insight and a new Boston experience like never before.  We would definitely stay here again!!!"
815639,30440829,2015-04-22,26216056,Buz,It was awesome staying in the middle of Little Italy and all the charm of North End. The room was very clean and comfortable. Can't wait to come again. Our host provided timely information and was readily available for any questions. Excellent host.

Within walking distance of downtown, the Public Gardens and the freedom trails. The only downside was the tiny kitchen with limited cooking ability but if we are looking to eat out during your stay this is the perfect spot."
815639,31672068,2015-05-08,14654182,Laurence,"An entirely  enjoyable experience. Although I did not meet the hosts, they made  arrival easy with a convenient lockbox for the key, and made themselves available if necessary by phone."
The apartment was perhaps even better than described: immaculately clean,simple and charming with great historic details of ceiling beams,original brick walls,and gleaming wood floors.,,
Situated within steps of everything in the North End,the private entry court off the street made it a true haven from the busy tourist streets.  Other than an occasional barking dog,it was completely quiet,especially at night.,,
The bed was extremely comfortable,and the simple furnishings and  entire apartment had a warm and cozy feeling.,,,,
The location in the North End is the best in Boston: just around the corner from outstanding restaurants (excellent meals at Nico's and Panza,)  bakeries (Modern and Mike's,)  a very  friendly and safe neighborhood feel,significant Boston history on every street,Old North Church on the corner,good harbor views down the block
I enjoyed every part of my stay and would gladly return for another visit.  Highly recommended!,,,,,

It really gave me a feel for the history of the city and the area. There are lots of great Italian restaurants and shops very nearby. Great restaurants of all types are a short walk, as is access to public transit that can get you to and from anywhere in the city. The apartment is centrally located but on a quite, pedestrian alleyway, so it's away from traffic nice and very private. I highly recommend this one!"

I walked to everything and if you didnt feel like walking you are not that far away from public transport.  The Bed was super comfortable and the Wifi was fantastic.  Check in was super easy. I was an hour early and Jose allowed me to check in early which was great.  Very safe area. Plenty of restaurants near by. Does not disappoint.  Would stay here again without question.

815639,36777733,2015-07-01,8771258,Stacy,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay! We planned a vacation for New York and Boston.  After staying in a fourth floor walk up with very limited space, this apartment in the North End was a dream! First floor, with a nice closet space, and a good size table to dine at if needed (or to plan out your next day, as we used it). Even though it was on the first floor in a bigger city, we always felt safe, due to hidden entrance. It was a very quiet part of neighborhood and very easy to sleep at night. The north end is RIGHT THERE, with great great great food, of course!  We also liked that the apartment was close to North Station with the commuter rail, because we were visiting friends in suburbs while in Boston. A great stay for us! When we come back to Boston, we will definitely be back to this apartment!"
815639,37458475,2015-07-07,1491666,Ariane,"This location is amazing. We loved staying in the North End, literally across the street from the Old North Church, 10 mins from North Station on the green line, and a 30 minute walk (or less) to almost anywhere in the city. The apartment was very dark (not much natural light) and the upstairs neighbors could be heard easily, but for a place to sleep and leave our things as we explored the city, neither of those drawbacks were a big deal. Thanks!"

On the day I arrived the weather was hot & humid, but the air-conditioning had been left on so the place was pleasantly cool. We didn't meet our host Jose during our stay, but all the arrangements worked perfectly and he patiently answered some initial questions by telephone even though it was late at night when we arrived. The North End is a great place to stay, with many Italian shops and eateries."

It was a very old building (which added to the charm) a stone's throw from the Old North Church and the Freedom Walk. There. A fantastic breakfast place (Theo's) is just around the corner, as are great restaurants on Salem and Hanover. Positives were price, location, charm. Negatives were the cleanliness, furniture, and the bed (mattress). It reminded me of my frat house, but the essentials were there. I must reiterate: the positives FAR outweighed the negatives, and we'd stay here again."
815639,43287190,2015-08-18,1436219,Tom,Great apartment with cool architecture and nice amenities in a great location. Jason was very responsive. The only downside is that quite a bit of noise from people moving around upstairs makes it into the apartment.

Right in a central location in the North End of Boston, and with accessible parking right down the street, this could not have been an easier location for a night in Boston while traveling up the East Coast. The apartment was more than spacious and included a great bed, couch, tv, kitchen area, and bathroom. Past that, you get a great sense of the character of Boston versus staying in a generic hotel."

The apartment itself was perfect.  There was plenty of room for my husband and I, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was nice.  The location is convenient to the T stop, the freedom trail (considering it’s ON the Freedom Trail), and the famed North End bakeries.

815639,49218382,2015-10-02,37127392,Sharon,Jose emailed regularly to let us know details and was very good at responding quickly. His apartment was just as the photos.  Clean and very quiet as it is down a narrow alley.
"We loved staying in such an old historic district and Boston itself is glorious. \"",,,,,
815639,49597801,2015-10-05,18750033,Christopher,Jose was a great host -- he followed up within 24 hours of my request for the reservation and then provided instructions on how to get into the unit several days before my visit.  Everything in the unit was as described -- completely no hassle.  This one is a gem.
815639,49983282,2015-10-08,21042574,Melissa,"The quintessential apartment in the North End!  Amazing location right next to the Old North Church - such a beautiful sight to see every morning on my way to get an espresso at the neighboring Italian Cafe.  The apartment was spotless, quiet, safe, and cozy.  The bed was so comfortable and had really nice linens on it.  The hosts went above and beyond in their communication and made me feel very welcome.  I can't wait to go back to Boston and stay here again!"

815639,51057104,2015-10-17,35952715,Ann,"I very much enjoyed my stay at Jose & Jason's place! It's in a lovely part of the north end, and the apartment was comfortable, clean and exactly what I needed for my business stay in Boston. Jose was also extremely quick to send over all the information I needed as soon as the stay was confirmed - something I really appreciated! As a business traveler it was also really convenient not to have to schedule time to meet up in order to check in - thanks gents for that!"
The bed was very comfortable,the linens and towels all fresh,and I felt very safe in the apartment. My ONLY small issue (and not at the fault of the hosts) is that the people staying in the apartment above me were not particularly quiet walkers up and down the stairs late at night on a weeknight.,,,
The gents also make sure anyone visiting the location as a tourist have all the information available that one would want to easily find their way around the city in the apartment.  Having wifi and cable available to the apartment was also ideal.  I would absolutely stay again. As a frequent traveler to Boston it would awesome for me to be able to actually grocery shop,have a place that felt homier than a hotel and be able to settle in. Thanks,"Jason & Jose!\"",,,
815639,51431331,2015-10-20,22462520,Nancy,"\"Our host was quickly available if needed.  We came in a bit early and were given access to drop off bags.  Location was perfect for access to everything for Boston 'newbies\"\"': Walking"
815639,51577126,2015-10-21,42857709,Josh,"The location is hard to beat, right across the street from the Old North Church.  It was a quick but fun stay.  The apartment was fine with great brickwork.  I enjoyed breakfast at Theo's Cozy Corner."
I got in late and it was fun to walk down the alley,but I did have trouble figuring out which unit was mine.  With my cell phone dying,I was really glad Jose answered the phone and talked me in.  Thanks,"Jose\"",,
815639,51705879,2015-10-24,15156606,Idyl,"My boyfriend and I had a very comfortable stay at Jose's studio.  His first floor unit was spacious, clean, and contained everything that we needed.  The location is amazing.   Located in the North End, you're surrounded by history and a great amount of Italian restaurants and bakeries.  We especially appreciated convenience  of the 24-hour bakery that was just a couple minutes away by foot.  Great place to get last minute goodies for folks back home.  This airbnb is very close to Boston's other popular attractions.  Walking to the harbor, the aquarium, Quincy Market/Faneuil Hall, the downtown area, etc.  was a cinch.  Communication with Jose was great.  I received prompt and helpful emails from him.  Because my boyfriend arrived much earlier than the check-in time, Jose was able to make arrangements without any difficulty.  When I visit Boston again, I would definitely want to stay here."
815639,52084910,2015-10-26,43357803,Ziyuan,Really wonderful experience in Boston. The house is cozy and well organized. What's amazing is the old neighborhood. The oldest church in Boston is right beside the house. And the host Jose is really nice and responded to questions quickly and patiently.
815639,53001432,2015-11-03,46670449,Natalie,"We had a great stay for two nights. The apartment was clean and cosy, and the location is ideal for exploring the city. Our host was easy to reach, and let us store our bags in the apartment before our official check-in time (and again after our check-out time), which really helped us.  Thanks for the great accomodations, Jose!"
815639,53119779,2015-11-05,44829071,Seth,"\"This place was PERFECT! We even had a third unexpected guest at the last minute and they accommodated our every need!  Location is snuggled into the heart of the north end, where EVERYTHING is such a close, scenic walk. There is a little mart within a 2 minute walk of the apartment if you want grocery or toiletry items etc., and Hanover (the main strip) is literally less than a block away--so all the restaurants and coffee shops are super close. There is even a little \"\"mercato\"\" where locals have salamis and cheeses that is a must-try right down the street. We came to city to visit a couple nights"
815639,53457584,2015-11-09,41075130,Lisa,"Loved the neighborhood! We stayed 4 days and 3 nights! The room was spacious! Jose was a real accommodating host by allowing us to check early and we got to explore earlier! We loved the fact we could walk the city, in fact we walked to Fenwway and then ubered back! I would definitely come back again! Thank you Jose for making our first time memorable ❤️"
815639,53908690,2015-11-14,11542551,New,"The place was cozy and in a great location in the North End. Very walkable to restaurants and historical sights. The bed was comfy, the bathroom was spacious, and the shower had great pressure. The kitchen has a small fridge and a microwave for your leftovers or drinks."
815639,54065792,2015-11-15,48599390,Hallie,Listing was just as described! Adorable place right in the North end-the most convenient location. Loved being able to pop back in for some warmth between exploring. Host provided all the necessities and we were impressed by the chic style and cleanliness. Would definitely recommend!
815639,54315334,2015-11-18,4784268,Amber,Loved this place! Location is great and so convenient. Couldn't have found a more perfect little hideaway. Hope to come and stay again!
815639,54739363,2015-11-23,47269552,John,"The apartment was clean and centrally-located. It was super easy to get to the train station, and being right off of the Freedom Trail made sight-seeing a breeze. Great place--I'd definitely stay here again for future Boston trips!"
815639,55524844,2015-12-01,19865628,Matthew,"Everything was perfect.  I couldn't have asked for a better spot in the N End of Boston.  The location is perfect, in the shadow of the Old North Church, close to the restaurants and all that Hanover St has to offer, but far enough away (1 block) to allow an authentic and private experience of the historical residential area.  There is a cafe on the corner that serves hot sandwiches and coffees.  So perfect, I woke up in the morning, walked out the door and down a short alley in pursuit of a cappuccino while the bells of the Old North Church rang as back ground music.  The apartment itself was on the first floor, easy to get into, bed was very comfortable, the kitchen has everything you need, bathroom is clean.  The exposed brick wall and timber beams on the ceiling also helped to create the feeling of going back in time.  I no complaints on this location and the host was fantastic to work with."
815639,56000982,2015-12-07,3962606,Casey,"Great apartment tucked into the North End. Easy to access, and really convenient to be able to pick up the key any time day or night. Jose's communication was awesome. Super responsive and a great host. I would definitely stay here again!"
815639,58406941,2016-01-02,23543303,Matt,My girlfriend and I went to Boston for NYE 2016 and stayed at Jose's place.  It was very easy to find and was exactly as described.  It is located immediately across from The Old North Church and is a very short walk from restaurants and nightlife.  Highly recommended for a weekend getaway!
815639,59647568,2016-01-13,10345104,Andria,"Great experience overall. The apartment is in a perfect North End location close to amazing restaurants and Freedom Trail but in a quiet alley. Clean and convenient. I had trouble with the lockbox on arriving (my fault, I was tired from driving all day and misread the instructions) but Jose responded immediately and helped me out. Highly recommended, would stay here again."
815639,61003978,2016-01-30,28937340,Carolyn,"Host let me check in early, and check-in was really easy.  This is a North End studio apartment with private bath and kitchenette.  Apartment is spacious by Boston's standards and in a great location, though it's hard to knock anyplace in the North End.  Photos are reflective of actual apartment, which was clean and stocked with all promised in the description.  It was comfortable and quiet, and the first floor location was especially convenient."
815639,62853461,2016-02-17,33598949,Yazeed,The room was as described. The process was simple and quick. Jose was very helpful and responsive. He always responded to all my questions. Would definitely recommend.
815639,63410132,2016-02-22,11163013,Greg,"Stayed at Jose's apartment for 3 nights. This apartment was perfect. On the freedom trail, steps away from the Old North Church, cafes and restaurants of little Italy. About a 7-10 min walk from the train and more bars and restaurants. The apartment was cozy and warm which was nice because two nights there it was freezing. I highly recommend this apartment and would definitely stay here again."
815639,65186734,2016-03-11,628322,Scott,The hospitality and communication could not have been better. I had an issue with the shower curtain rod that was immediately remedied. I cannot emphasize what an absolutely awesome location this is. When I have to come to Boston again in the future it will be my default location!
815639,66434817,2016-03-22,11136440,Jared,Great location in the North End with access to everything Boston had to offer. We would definitely stay again.
815639,67006967,2016-03-26,28823179,Samantha,"Apartment was exactly as described and was perfect for a two night stay with my husband. Location cannot be beat.. Right next to Old North Church. We were able to walk to the majority of places of interest in the city and enjoyed dinner in the North End and cannolis for breakfast from the cafe on the corner near the apartment. We had a question at the end of our stay and Jose was able to help us out immediately. If you're looking for a clean place to stay in a great location in Boston, this is it!"
815639,67466438,2016-03-29,13586326,Amy,"This is a warm, cosy little place in an excellent location. It really made our trip to Boston to be right in the thick of the little italy area and close to all the main historic sites. Because it is tucked away in a little lane, it is very quiet too. Communication was straightforward and easy. Bed was comfortable and wifi worked well. Thank you!"
815639,68671696,2016-04-06,32373919,Patrick,"Absolutely wonderful first Airbnb experience.

815639,70014560,2016-04-15,9462808,Emily,"Perfect out of the way spot in North End! Mostly great, had one night where the people upstairs had a dinner party until 2 am on a Wednesday night, but other than that, an excellent location and very straight-forward stay!"
815639,70584719,2016-04-18,9857261,Jill,"This was our second time staying at Jose's apartment.  The place is spectacular.  The location is the best in Boston, and the apartment is clean and well-kept.  We were pleased to see that Jose had thick, new towels this year.  It really shows that he listens to feedback and cares about his customers.  The description of this apartment does not due justice to the LOCATION.  This place is right outside the Old North Church, and is in the heart of the North End.  You will never get such a great Boston experience in a hotel!!!  Retrieving and returning the keys was a breeze, and although we did not need his help while there, we were provided with a phone number and email address by which to reach Jose if we needed.  We're looking forward to our stay next year!!"
815639,70922041,2016-04-22,59481021,Bob,Had a great stay in this place! Great location for an easy commute all around Boston and blocks away from amazing Italian food. Jose made everything very straightforward. Highly recommend.
815639,71603921,2016-04-26,1655114,Joan,"He always answered any questions.  No trouble getting in touch with him.  It was a little confusing which lockbox to use to get the key, but we called him and figured it out."

815639,74138339,2016-05-13,45463958,Ellen,"I really enjoyed my experience in this studio apartment. I was in Boston for job interviews and the building and the street outside (it's basically an alley) were super quiet, so I got two great nights of sleep. It was easy to find, especially knowing that it was near the Old North Church (as listed in one of the descriptions). I had no problem getting the keys from the lockbox and immediately falling asleep in a very comfortable bed! I also had no issue returning the keys to the lockbox this morning. All in all, a fantastic experience. Definitely stay here if you want a peaceful, clean apartment for your trip. And it doesn't hurt that there is great Italian food for dinner right around the corner!"
815639,75145592,2016-05-19,65429584,Paula,"\"The location just can't be beat. It's so super safe and Jose/Jason let us to drop off our bags early before check in & also let us leave them after check out. They were also very responsive by air bnb message. We are not used to city apartment life and the whole set up was strange to me at first. I was confused as to how to get in. They walked me through it and we got in w/o issues. We didn't use the kitchenette much but the fridge was very convenient and there is even silverware, plates, and a coffee and espresso maker. The only \"\"negative\"\" was that I'm pretty sure there was a herd of nocturnal baby elephants staying above us. Wouldn't have been so bad but they sounded like they got home at 12 and2 am and got up at 4:30am. \""
815639,75352986,2016-05-20,37732838,Uwe,"The room was clean and looks like in the pictures. Bed was very comfortable. Location is fantastic, right of Salem St. Great, affordable option for a visit to Boston"
815639,76132194,2016-05-25,38831437,Nancy,"This studio was very good value for the price, and the neighborhood can't be beat. I really enjoyed the heart of Old North End! Jose/Jason was readily averrable when I had difficulty with the lock box on the front porch. The bargain price may be due to the depression in the mattress, the noise through the ceiling from (polite) footsteps overhead,  and the loud industrial air compressor just outside the window. Personally, I'd consider myself lucky to snag this booking again in Boston for a touristy visit."
815639,76314482,2016-05-26,30920479,Nancy,Our first AirBNB experience and it was exceptional.
Jose was easy to reach,went out of his way to be in touch with us.  He was flexible when we needed to arrive a little early.  Pictures and description were accurate,if not a little understated,since it exceeded our expectations.  Everything clean and as-promised.  Bed,kitchenette,TV and bath were all great.  Directions on getting keys and accessing the unit were clear and easy to follow.
Location was outstanding and exactly as promised:  in the heart of the beautiful North End of Boston,literally across the street from The Old North Church.  We dumped our rental car as soon as we unloaded luggage and walked everywhere from Jose's apartment for two days.  Coffee shops,great restaurants,bakeries,convenience stores all close at hand.  Stress-free all the way around.,
We can't imagine a better way to stay in the North End or,for that matter,anywhere in Boston,"now that we've had this experience.  We will definitely stay here again and will recommend to friends and family.\"",,

The only negative thing to mention is that there is not a full kitchen; this may have been mentioned in the description, and I simply didn't notice it. There is no stove or oven, though there is a fridge and anything else you'd need in the kitchen."
815639,78099490,2016-06-05,31078060,Jon,"We had a good stay at Jose's place. The location is perfect, steps away from the start of the freedom trail and nearby lots of shops and restaurants."

815639,78950338,2016-06-10,76190832,Kent,"This was my first Airbnb experience but it was great.  Check in was easy, the accommodations were just as advertised, the location was awesome.  I will start here the next time I look for a place in Boston."
815639,79113882,2016-06-11,8925210,Michelle,"We loved our stay here!! Long story short, we had some not-so-ideal experiences before we arrived, and were so relieved and delighted when we got to the front door of this place. The location is amazing, the building is so cool, and the Airbnb was clean and spacious for the 2 of us. We would absolutely stay here again if we came back to Boston!"
815639,79344793,2016-06-12,74039200,Danny,"First off this is a very nice apartment in a very beautiful area! When we first got there everything was clean and fully stocked. The bed was extremely comfortable! I slept like a baby, the entire feel of the apartment was homey and clean. This was our first trip to Boston and I feel this place played a huge role in making our first trip amazing and fun! Next time I come to Boston I am definitely getting another place hosted by Jose."
815639,81399796,2016-06-22,64986829,Deborah,"Our host was easy to communicate with and very responsive! Pictures of the studio are exactly what you get - no misrepresentation! Neighborhood was FANTASTIC! Literally steps from Old North Church. We had everything we needed plus a great location for a reasonable price. Only complaints: some noise from overhead occupants but not enough to keep me awake; mattress topper made the bed hot and a little uncomfortable. Having said both of those things, we'd definitely book this place again if we are able to make another trip to Boston!"
815639,81611162,2016-06-24,77342349,Michael,Very nice neighborhood.  Jose/Jason were both really great and super responsive. I'd never used AirBnb before and that were both just really cool.  The place was as advertised and the bed was wicked comfortable.  It's literally across the street from the Paul Revere House!
I would definitely stay here again and it was a lot more quaint and nice than a hotel.,,,,,

815639,83128852,2016-07-01,6675979,Justine,The apartment was clean cool and welcoming after a long day of travel. The space was cozy but for 1 night in the North End it was exactly what we needed. The bed was comfortable and the extra futon was perfect for our 6 year old.
815639,84195340,2016-07-06,73111470,Rosemary,Fabulous quiet location just steps from North Church.  Close to tons of amazing food yet private and safe.  Comfortable studio apt with nice bathroom.  Would stay again.

"I am on crutches right now and we initially booked a 3rd floor room.  Jose was a big help in getting us into the first floor which was so much easier.  He was quite helpful during the stay and promptly responded to a few text questions we had. We plan on returning in the future. \"",,,,,
815639,87041679,2016-07-18,78183980,Dan,"Jose did a great job coaching this first time Airbnb user through the process.  I am Platinum Starwood and Gold Marriott, but it was just plain fun to stay in and explore this North End neighborhood.  I would definitely stay here again.  The apartment had everything we needed for a weekend.  The location is great - 1 block to Hanover street with all the restaurants - but without the hustle and bustle.  A great and cheap breakfast spot is a block away. The Freedom Trail runs right past the front door. It was a perfect base for our 'tourist' weekend."
815639,88788274,2016-07-25,15350347,Simon,"Beautiful apartment in an absolutely fantastic old town location, we were almost sad we only stayed for one night. Excellent communication, everything was super easy."

Her place is in a really great location, and is a good sized bedroom and bathroom.  I had the impression that Sherry would be available for any questions and responded back quickly when we were arranging times for meeting (she was very flexible)."
Things to note for future guests that might be helpful - the room is in an apartment shared with two male roommates.   There is no lock on the bedroom door.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
4603803,31589345,2015-05-07,26133648,Delian,"Sherry was an extremely accommodating host, and responded to all enquiries immediately. I am grateful to her for this. The room was very clean in an excellent location and with a fantastic view. I'd highly recommend a stay here."
4603803,32000232,2015-05-12,29160122,Josefina,"Sherry's place has the perfect location, it is one block away from the prudential mall and really close to newsbury street and if you are willing to walk, you can go everywhere!"
The room was clean and the fact that the bathroom is connected to the bedroom was great.,,,,,
The One problem we had with the roommates consisted in the kitchen (being that it was a shared area),which was dirty when we got there and remained like that all the way through our stay. But if you keep to your bedroom and stay out of there and common areas then you're golden!,,,,
One more thing was the internet,"it was very VERY bad and unfortunately we did not know about that until we were already there. \"",,,,
4603803,32356939,2015-05-17,9241469,Dominique,Well  situated! We didn't  see  sherry  but she  was avalaible  for all our  questions. We recommend this room!
4603803,33702380,2015-05-31,32677488,Joshua,"This was my first time with Airbnb, so I didn't know what to expect. You stay in Sherry's room while she is away, so there isn't really a host other than her orientation when you arrive. The arrangement was as Sherry described it, and the comments of other reviews were accurate. There are two male roommates in the apartment who keep their doors shut. They are rarely there and there is no common space, as one of the lives in the living room with an accordion door shutting it off. I was able to meet one by knocking on his door, but not the other. It's a bit strange not knowing who they are or if they are there or not, and there is no lock on the bedroom door. Also, the exterior door is often left open, but Sherry assured me that it was safe, and my possession were untouched in the 5 days I was there.  The ensuite bath room made it feel like a hotel or hostel room. The traffic noise outside is moderate for a city dweller, but it kept me up the first night. The shades don't really block the sunlight, so it's good for early risers. The location is perfect for getting around the city, and is close to the Marriott and Sheraton hotels on Prudential Plaza. If you stay here, make use of the hotel shuttles to and from the airport, as well as the Back Bay Logan Express bus that stops by the Hynes Convention Center on Boylston Street."
4603803,38848414,2015-07-19,714437,Carolyn,"Sherry was nice and was mostly responsive to my messages. When I had to move my stay to a different date, she was very accommodating. When we met up on Friday for her to give me the keys and show me the place, she was prompt, which was greatly appreciated. She gave me a quick tour of the place and then left and because I didn't need her assistance the rest of my stay, I didn't see her after that."
The room was okay: carpet was showing some wear and stains,bathroom was clean enough. Bathroom shower had some broken pieces of bar soap,light bulb out in the bathroom and the bedroom lamp by the closet. Shampoo and shower gel for use aren't anything to write home about,so I'd strongly recommend you bring your own shampoo/conditioner/body soap/shower gel.,,
Water pressure was pretty good from the adjustable showerhead.,,,,,
View from the window is great...you oversee the fountain for the Prudential Building.,,,,,
Hair dryer was not working,which sucked because I didn't bring my own since I'd expected to be able to use the one here. When I turned it on,it made a crazy noise so I turned it off right away (higher speed made a worse noise than lower speed). Not interested in getting electrocuted.,,,
No lock on the bedroom door,which was a bit unsettling. I brought a portable alarm system to use after reading about no lock from other users.,,,,
The wifi is absolute garbage. You can barely get email on it,much less watch movies or stream music or work. I resorted to using the internet on my iPhone the whole time. She warned me it was bad unless you use an ethernet cable,but obviously the iPad and iPhone don't use ethernet connections. Plus,I didn't bring my ethernet adapter for my Macbook Pro because I didn't need it.,,
Something about the bedsheets made me incredibly itchy. Maybe it's the detergent used to clean the sheets,I don't know,but it got so bad that I even checked for bed bugs. Didn't see any.,,,
One of the roommates was super loud in the early hours (maybe around 4am?) my first night there (he was talking with someone,not playing music or anything),which sucked because I was exhausted from a rough work week.,,,
Didn't see any projector for use anywhere. Maybe I just overlooked it?,,,,,
The best things about this place are: (1) the location (it's fantastic,close to everything within walking distance),(2) the proximity to the train stop (a little over a street away),"and (3) the room having its own bathroom. \"",,
4603803,39463364,2015-07-23,10880119,Victoria,"Sherry was a great host! So hospitable and flexible with working around my travel arrangements, friendly, and gave me plenty of recommendations of what to do around boston. The room is large, has one of the comfiest beds I've ever slept in, and you can barely notice the roommates (who are very friendly when you do talk to them). The location is great for tourism and shopping. Very safe location where I felt comfortable running alone at 6 am and just as comfortable walking around alone at 11pm. 10/10 would rent again or recommend to a friend"

The only issue was that he didn't tell me which room inside the apartment was mine, so I ended up walking into another person's room at the start. I texted him and he then told me the right room. I was a little worried about the lack of a lock on the door, but everything was fine and the other people in the apartment were nice. Also, the room was freezing at night when the building AC came on. I only stayed one night but I would stay here again."

12344014,76362157,2016-05-26,39612001,Behnam,"We didn't like the neighborhood but had good access to public transportation. Inside the apartment was fine but a few problems; during our stay it was around 83 degree and I wish it had AC, I really recommend to provide AC for future guests. Also the toilet's flush wasn't working probably and we asked for service but the service wasn't satisfying. Last but not least host's attitude was really nice. :)"
12344014,76885087,2016-05-29,39909085,Chris,"Great apartment, very clean and comfortable for 4 guests.  Not much activity in the neighborhood but still convenient to get into center city by Uber."
We had some trouble with the toilet and contacted our local contact and host,who was overseas on vacation.  Kayt was quick to respond and have her plumber scheduled to make the repair that day.  It worked perfectly after the service call.,,,,
The two days we were there were in the mid 80s and low 90s.  Unfortunately,we did not realize there was no AC,though the listing does not list AC.  However,we were able to manage with the windows propped open and some fans.,,
Kayt was wonderful to communicate with and quick to respond,again,"even when she was overseas on her vacation!  Sorry for the trouble Kayt :)   Thanks for sharing your beautiful place with us!\"",,,

1867881,11082776,2014-03-19,12874861,Monique,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Emerson.  The operation was run in a very professional manner.  When we arrived the concierge quickly was able to locate our welcome package which included the keys to our unit.  When we entered the apartment it was clean and exactly as expected.  Additionally,upon entering we found spare keys and various packages which included clean spare linens, fresh towels, fresh toilet paper rolls, soaps of all kind for the bathrooms, coffee, popcorn and unopened cleaning items for the kitchen (sponge, dish soap, paper towel) etc."
The condo had a clear check-in and check-out policy however they were able to accomodate our need to store our bags for the day as we had a late flight.,,,,,
We rarely took the subway opting to walk.  The condo was in a good location about 10-20 minutes from Little Italy,TD Garden,Union Oyster house,"Beacon Hill area and only about 20 - 30 minutes from Beacon Hill and the Back Bay areas.  There were also a couple subway lines within a 10 minute walk from the condo building.  All in all the location was really quite great.  \"",,

Receptionists were always kind and smiling. Gym was of adequate size and not overpopulated. I didn't get to check out the pool, but I'm sure it's fine. Good amount of complementary goods. Excellent bathrooms. All rooms were very spacious and comfy. The only problem was that the futon bed was mediocre. If you bring a fifth, have him (you better not put a lady on this bed) be prepared for less than comfortable bedding (literally an inch of yellowing bedding)."

We were visiting our son who is a student in the area and my wife was thrilled to be able to prepare a home cooked meal for him. And we just loved staying in Beacon Hill.  Very convenient location, with a short walk to either the Park Street or Bowdoin (which directly connects to the airport) T stops. There’s a convenience store at the end of the block and a Whole Foods market and liquor store another block away. Xerxes was very friendly, helpful with suggestions and especially accommodating with our need for flexible check-in/check-out times. We loved our stay here and would definitely stay here again."

The apartment looks exactly like the pictures and was spacious even with 4 of us. Xerxes was very accommodating by providing us with an air mattress for the little ones and was very quick to answer our questions or provide recommendations when asked.  We would definitely stay there again if we were to return to Boston.

The apartment itself was clean and comfortable with everything you could need to feel at home. The internet was fast as reliable and there were plenty of places to buy food and supplies within a two minute walk. Slightly further afield, downtown Boston- Tremont St and the Commmon was only ten minutes away on foot."

It is well equipped with a fabulous range of kitchen equipment. I was able to do a dinner for my daughter and 6 friends with ease. The shower is wonderful and the bed is really comfortable. There is lots of wardrobe space and lovely touches like spare towels and sheets. It compares to a luxury hotel but has the benefit of lots of space. The Beacon Hill area is one of the nicest in Boston. Lots of great restaurants and shops. Close to The Common and very handy for the T stops at Charles/MGH and Park. Xerxes was a great host, communicating well and recommending restaurants. We would definitely recommend his apartment."

There was an a/c unit in the living area, and a fan in the bedroom. As it was hot (July), these were much appreciated. The bay window in the bedroom is a wonderful spot to sit, read and relax after a busy day of sight seeing. There was some street noise at night in the bedroom with the windows open, earplugs Were helpful. This apartment felt very luxurious, and the kitchen had everything we needed, including an espresso maker. Thank you Xerxes!"

The Beacon Hill luxury apartment is great (and now I'm afraid it has spoiled our family and set a very high bar for other AirBNB places). My preteen and I enjoyed  the apartment (its comfort, location and convenience). It was such a treat to be in a nice-sized apartment that is in walking distance to T stops, good restaurants, the Whole Foods, Boston Commons and the Freedom  Trail. Also, I loved the rain shower head! Xeres is a responsive and courteous host who will go out of his  way to get you what you need (thank you again Xeres for offering to FedEx  wash clothes to the apartment) and Olga is patient and kind (thank you again Olga for meeting us later at the apartment so that we can grab something to eat after our very long flight). If our family had to change anything, it would be the upstairs neighbors (we live in a house so we're not accustomed to people living above us) and tighten some screws  on the bed frame (it squeaks a little), but those are minor things. We would definitely stay at the Beacon Hill apartment again."

3520353,48084777,2015-09-23,40702791,Peggy,"We were very happy staying at Xerxes' place in Beacon Hill.  The apartment was located in a tiny street across from Suffolk University and down from the Mass State House.  Being across from the university was not an issue at all - the street is very quiet and not busy.  The apt was very nice - comfortable furniture and bed, fully stocked kitchen, and beautiful bathroom (large tub and separate large shower).  We were originally planning on staying in Back Bay but we are so glad we stayed in this location as it was within walking district of Boston Commons and the Public Gardens, Charles River, Quincy Hall and the start of the Freedom Trail.  The apt is also close to the Park metro station which was very convenient.  We would stay here again and we highly recommend this place."
3520353,48518610,2015-09-27,27545923,Tony,Our hopes were high having seen the photos of the apartment and knowing its location - but when we checked in we found it even better than we'd expected.
The apartment is clean,spacious,comfortable,tastefully decorated and very well equipped. The bedroom offers great hanging and storage space for clothes as well as a large and very comfortable bed. The bathroom is clean,with a great rain shower as well as large bath. And the lounge/kitchen is a fantastic use of space for comfortable living. The kitchen has all the equipment and utensils you could ever need,there's a great fridge-freezer
Beyond the basics of the apartment,the host is brilliant too. Great communication before we checked in with helpful advice,and nice touches around the apartment once you're in - good local maps to use,local information and tourist books,a great selection of coffee table books to browse while resting your feet,a good selection of DVD's to play.
And the location is perfect,2 mins from the State House,10 mins from North End,5 mins from Park Street. Shops and bars are just at the end of the street. Only word of caution - plan ahead if you have a car. Parking is extortionately expensive in Boston,and you can't park outside the apartment so coordinate your arrival and key collection carefully.,

Xerxes was so incredibly responsive to every single question I had.  When I was fussing with the heat he assured me that it was ok to clear the programming.  When I left an important medication at home and needed to fedex it,he gave me an alternate box address to send it to if I encountered any problems.  Our flight wasn't leaving until late in the afternoon and he allowed us to leave our stuff there while we spent our last few hours exploring Boston (which was a lot later than traditional hotel checkout times).,,,,
"I'll be returning to the area in a few months and will be checking with Xerxes on availability before booking anywhere else.  Thank you again for everything!\"",,,,,

The bed was really comfortable and the apartment itself was very clean and well taken care of. We also enjoyed the huge tub. Xerxes was easily available by phone and/or text and followed up with me to make sure we made it in the apartment when we got there a little earlier than anticipated. Overall a wonderful experience that I would highly recommend. Thank you."

Xerxes' place is just as described and beyond! Great location (beautiful, felt safe, central to many things, within walking distance to practically everything). Well equipped kitchen. Absolutely wonderful shower. I loved sitting at the 'bar' each morning eating breakfast and enjoying my coffee. Pretty close to the Charles River where I was able to get in some long runs away from all the hustle and bustle. I would definitely stay here again!"

3520353,83224802,2016-07-01,40392435,Joanne,"The Beacon Hill location was perfect for my trip goals with my granddaughter.  It is a safe area, quiet with the exception of ambulances headed to Mass General a few blocks away.  It is an easy walk to T stops, Heritage Trail, and Whole Foods.  Xerxes offered help with anything I needed, and answered texts within a few minutes.  The apartment is located in a historic building, and has been updated with a modern kitchen.  Most of the other tenants were extremely quiet, while the level above was active on 2 of our 5 nights until 2 am.  Temperatures were in the 80s during our week, and we learned that the window air conditioner in the living area needed to be set on high fan in order to keep the entire space cool.  There is a fan in the bedroom.  Overall a comfortable stay."
3520353,84229034,2016-07-06,53354513,Sue,Best thing about this apartment is the location. You can walk to all areas in Boston!

3520353,86014019,2016-07-14,28463967,Hannah,"Xerxes' apartment is absolutely beautiful! Located on a beautiful street in the historic Beacon Hill district, the apartment is close to many amenities and points of interest. Capitol Coffee around the corner has a great latte, and if you walk down to Charles Street you will find many beautiful shops, restaurants, bakeries etc. Be sure to grab a goat cheese and spinach pastry from Tatte! We were only in town for a few days for work and needed a place that felt homey where we could hang our hats and rest after a long day and we felt very comfortable here. Xerxes has taken very good care of the space and everything was in good working condition. Xerxes was very helpful and attentive when we were checking in."
If you are driving into the city,be mindful that there is absolutely no street parking to be found in Beacon Hill. We had trouble finding parking that wasn't overpriced,but found that the most convenient and affordable parking was in the Boston Commons parking lot. It's a bit of a hike but the Commons are beautiful and if you're sightseeing,the walk/drive to the parking lot offers you a great tour of the area.,,
All in all I highly recommend this beautiful apartment for one person or a couple,"we were very pleased with our stay and would definitely stay again!! \"",,,,
3520353,89525088,2016-07-28,15800247,Linda,"This is simply one of the best places to stay in Boston.

3520353,96306172,2016-08-22,18770964,Wendy,"Xerxes' property was absolutely perfect for a weekend getaway to Boston! Check-in was a breeze, and we were greeted on our arrival by Olga, the manager of the property. She let us into the apartment, showed us where to find extra towels, and promptly left us to unpack before heading out for the evening. The apartment is very large and spacious, especially in Boston, and had we been traveling with another couple, and someone been willing to sleep on a couch or air mattress, there would have been plenty of room to accommodate 4 adults (or maybe 2 adults and a few kids). We almost felt silly having so much space for just two of us, but it was so nice to not be cramped into a small hotel room."
As far as location goes,we found the apartment was exactly where we wanted to be! Boston Commons was only a short walk away,as were the Park Street and Government Center T stops (which gave us easy access to the green,orange,and red lines). The apartment is situated in a very safe part of the town,and we made it to the Back Bay
I can't recommend the apartment enough- if and when we make our way back to Boston,"we will definitely be staying at Xerxes' property again!\"",,,,

It offered an extremely short trip to the T (literally right next door) for an easy trip into the city. The house was beautiful, well kept and well lit.  Paul and Lauren were quick to respond to any questions and left clear instructions for the house and provided some good advice on local attractions, stores, restaurants, etc.  It was a nice home away from home for our family.

If anyone is concerned, the subway's noises were barely noticeable, if at all.  Lauren made sure we were comfortable and knew how everything worked in the home.  We had plenty of room for all four of us and all our things.  Her recommendations for restaurants and points of interest were great.  We left our stay here feeling very grateful for the opportunity to stay here and, maybe, also feeling a little inspired by her sense of aesthetic and organization!"

Location is very good, parking is convenience and subway is just behind the house( a little bit notice but can be acceptable). Our kids love to stay here because there are a lot of toys:) A small suggestion to make it perfect, we have a lot of luggages, the closets in every room are almost full, we have to put all the stuff on the sofa, if there is empty space in closet that can accommodate my suitcase it will be much better."

Michelle is a great and kind person and her bakery skills are outstanding. She will even walk you from the nearest T station to her house and back again to make sure you will find your way. The neighborhood is quit calm and downtown Boston is conveniently accessible with the orange line.

It is even more spacious than it looks like on the pictures and the furniture is very tasteful. Kitchen, bathroom and living room are shared. The kitchen is fully equiped."
Some daily-life facts about the location/neighbourhood: There is a liquor store around the corner,where you can get basic groceries. To get to downtown Boston takes approximately 45 min using the T. The direct neighbourhood is safe,but there are some corners nearby (Dudley station) where I had the feeling of wanting to speed up a bit when passing by in the late evenings or at night.,,,

The room is bright and extremely spacious: it's perfect if you plan to work from home or feel the need of your own space from time to time. The house is a typical new England two storey house,located in a quiet but multicultural neighbourhood. Michelle will tell you all the story of the area as soon as you arrive and will give you precious suggestions on how to make the most of your time while in Boston. I thoroughly recommend a stay at Michelle's,be it for a few days or for a long stay: to me,"it felt like home from the moment I entered till the time I - sadly - left. \"",,
1403408,44374598,2015-08-25,40109424,Rebecca,"Michelle was an exceptional host! As other reviewers have stated, she met me at the train station and, very smartly, pointed out interesting landmarks on the 5-10 min walk to her house to help me remember my way. She showed me around the place and the bedroom (exactly as pictured), including the laundry, which yes it is in an old basement-- but it's laundry! Which is fantastic! It's coin operated ($1 per load each), but Michelle gave me enough quarters for a load to supplement what I had. There were two other gentlemen renting out rooms in this flat, which you share a bathroom with and both were very pleasant/kept to themselves. The public areas are well kept, with free coffee :) and lots of info on things to do in Boston. Michelle even made banana bread for the morning I was leaving so I had a snack on the way out! It was great :)"
Also,there are some cute cats outside that Michelle has been taming. They're fun to play with if you like cats,and if you don't,"they can be pretty skiddish. \"",,

The location was perfect for our activities at Boston University med school, and it is a very walkable area.  Laurel was prompt with replies to our questions and we loved Flour, his local restaurant recommendation.  The condo itself was just as pictured, very nice and comfortable.  We will return happily on future visits to Boston."
11856912,70641491,2016-04-19,2711246,Valerie,"Laurel's flat was really comfortable and well situated for my husband I to stay in on our Boston Marathon weekend trip. The flat had everything we needed to be well rested and prepared for the tough race ahead. The fireplace was a fabulous bonus on the cool nights, and the location was simply superb. Definitely recommend taking Laurel's advice on the Blackbird donuts! I wouldn't hesistate to recommend the flat and Laurel as a host to anyone!"
4173285,28480019,2015-03-24,25072920,Diego,"Angela is the best!! She is so friendly, so helpful with everything, I felt really good in her apartment. She helped me with everything that I asked, she offered me a lot of times her food ( she cooks a lot), and I appreciate that so much. She is a person that you can talk about everything."
The apartment and the room are like in pictures. The room has a big and comfortable bed,with 4 big drawers under the bed where you can put all your clothes,it's has a lot of space. Besides you have a rack when you could hanging jackets,jeans,etc.,
The neighborhood was quiet,The apartment is just one block to the red line station,and it's takes like 20-25 minutes to arrive to downtown.,,,
I spent almost 2 month in Angela's apartment,I  recommend the apartment and her host,"if I return to Boston definitely would return to this apartment .\"",,,
4173285,44793128,2015-08-29,35909316,Gabriela,"Angela and Marco are really friendly, helpful and amazing people! They made me feel like home, and gave me lots of tips about things to the in Boston and around it. The room is exactly like it shows on the pictures, very comfortable (the bed is really good), with a lot of space to put my stuff and the little fridge makes it even more complete. The house is very clean and comfortable, and very close to the train/bus station. I had an amazing time during this month I spent there, and I'll definitely go back there if someday I return to Boston."
4173285,53757930,2015-11-12,41938499,Hye-Lim,"Angela and her boyfriend Marco was very hospitable. The room is exactly as shown in the pictures. The flat is very close to Ashmont station, which makes walking to the house from the station after dark pretty safe. Angela keeps the house very clean and tidy. I liked that she had her own system of organization, which was clear to follow. For some nights we had interesting conversations over tea. Angela is well-traveled and and open-minded so I have no doubt that she can accommodate any type of person."
4173285,71926629,2016-04-29,22608638,Enrico,The room was great: very clean and with everything new.
The apartment as well was perfect organized. Angela was always available to help me.,,,,,

2931870,13637395,2014-06-01,14728013,Rose & Tim,"My self and my partner stayed for 4 days, and can honestly say , we would definitely stay again if in the area, can highly recommend, the family really do treat you like one of their own, between morning conversations to playing with izzy the Pomeranian , it felt like home to us, the breakfast was super and we had everything we needed, the bedroom was cosy we had our own television and our own bathroom, plenty of space and privacy, would definitely be revisiting !!! ... 5 stars - keep up the great work guys !!"
2931870,13727421,2014-06-02,16149203,Todd,I had purchased tickets to take my son to Fenway Park. After I purchased the tickets I then looked to book a room and could not find anything below $300. I rembered that I had read an article n the paper on airbnb so thought I would check it out. After looking through hundreds of ads I decided to send Cynthia and several others a question in regards to parking. Within moments Cynthiia responded to my question and let me know that there was adaquate parking on the street. She also sent me several options on how to get to Fenway from her home.  I made the reservation.
On my way to Boston I was thinking what in heck have I got myself into,I am going to be staying in a strangers home. From the moment I arrived at Cynthia's  home any concern I had went away. I was warmly greeted by Cynthia's daughter. She gave us a tour of the home,introduced us to Cynthia and showed us to our room.  I have stayed with relatives before and have not felt as comfortable as I did while staying at Cynthia's. There is not a single negative thing that I can mention. The rooms were clean,the beds were comfortable,"the hosts were amazng and In the morning we were treated to a homemade breakfast and great conversation. When we left in the morning my son turned to me and said that if he ever returned to Boston he would not want to stay anywhere else. \"",
2931870,14097912,2014-06-11,16043686,Kevin,This listing was what we expected and even more. Tremendously gracious hosts who were more than accommodating! I would recommend this spot to any friend and anyone looking to see Boston. Downtown is a quick hop on the T and parking at Forest Hills station is super cheap. Cynthia and her family (including Izzy) are real rad! Wicked impressed with our experience!
2931870,16774049,2014-08-02,15208513,Brendan,Cynthia and her whole family were welcoming. We had some passport troubles meaning numerous calls to the embassy which Cynthia allowed us to use her house phone.  Cynthia even checked up on us after we checked out to ensure we were ok! The house is a little far out of the city however we had a car and it suited us perfectly! It is only a short  bus and train ride in if you don't have a car.  The room was clean and tidy.  We had our own bathroom so it was very private however we spent most of our time downstairs chatting with Cynthia & other guests.  Cynthia also provided us with an array of breakfast items each morning! Amazing experience for our first Airbnb stay!
2931870,17479891,2014-08-12,19292009,Alejandrina,"Nuestra estancia fue buena. Sus propietarios furon muy agradables con nosotras, asi como sus mascotas... Como inconveniente,  la localización de la vivienda, ya que para llegar al centro nos suponía coger un autobús,  el 31 y el metro, la linea naranja."

2931870,19497545,2014-09-13,2006424,Beth And Tom,"Cynthia and her family were just what we needed after a long day of traveling. Cynthia answered my inquiries and texts almost immediately.  The bed was clean, breakfast items were provided and we had a great conversation.  They were so helpful they gave us a couple of rides which I was happy to tip them for. As an Airbnb.com host, I learned a couple of things to help me be a better host. The house is definitely an active family household. Great value."
2931870,19909870,2014-09-20,21299897,Joanna,We stayed for two nights at Cynthia's house. It was a great experience there. The house is about 15min drive from downtown Boston which is very convenient for us.
Cynthia and her family had been really helpful in every way. By the time we arrived at the house,we were warmly greeted by Cynthia's daughter who showed us around the house.,,,,
Our room is upstairs in a private area. The room is clean and cosy with everything we need.,,,,,
"The family also offer a free breakfast in their dinning area every morning which is very nice. We would definitely recommend it to others.\"",,,,,
2931870,20395828,2014-09-28,16220836,Linda,We arrived much later than expected but Cynthia waited up for us. The place was a block away from the bus and a short train ride into Boston. Very convenient  for exploring. Our room had a private bathroom which we needed. Her family was lovely and very welcoming. Having breakfast and coffee every morning was a big money saver for us. Overall it was an excellent value compared to prices in Boston. We would definitely stay there again.  I miss the little dog Izzy! What a sweetheart!
2931870,20460025,2014-09-29,21420642,Carlos,"Thanks to Cynthia and her family for the time we spent in Boston, even when we were not too much time in the house, everything was comfortable."

2931870,21108257,2014-10-11,22123584,Bridget,We had a wonderful stay at Cynthia's. We felt like we had privacy  but at the same time were treated like family.  My boys loved her and are still talking about her and her house.  The room was clean and the beds comfortable.  Cynthia made pancakes for the boys and had breakfast for us.  Will be going back in two days to finish off our trip.
2931870,21361470,2014-10-15,22123584,Bridget,Great visit this was our second stay.  Everything was great thanks Cynthia for the warm welcome!
2931870,21471128,2014-10-18,20775933,Mimi,"Cynthia and Keith are warm and friendly hosts.  The room is clean and as described, small and cozy.  It's nice to have a private bath and the water was nice and hot for the showers.  The neighborhood is busy, yet not any noisier than elsewhere in a big city!  We felt safe and welcomed.  Keith makes some killer jerked dishes!  There is a good Jamaican take-out near by.  We enjoyed meeting the rest of the family and the breakfasts we had there."
2931870,22630364,2014-11-10,21463365,Murilo,"Cynthia was very kind, we arrived late and she still showed us around the house and gave us advice about Boston and transportation. The place was exactly as described, it fits 4 people confortably, we had a room bathroom, which was very convenient, the neighborhood was calm and we always found spots to park our car, I would definitely stay there again."
2931870,28046478,2015-03-16,5256339,Nils,"Unfortunatly we only had one night in Cynthias room, but it was amazing. Cynthia and her family are awesome and really helpful."

The room was as expected, and she even provided us a hearty breakfast the next morning. Would definitely stay here again if we were to visit Boston a second time!"
2931870,32089530,2015-05-13,27419407,Chris,"Our host Cynthia made us feel very welcome and was super helpful explaining where to get a Charlie Card. The bagel breakfasts were delicious and much appreciated, and I was able to cook eggs on the stove. Best of all our room with an ensuite was on the top floor and private, it was like being in the top of a castle tower. Good wifi too."
Bit of a distance from downtown Boston via train and then bus,but nothing too tricky.,,,,
"Would stay again in  a heartbeat.\"",,,,,
2931870,32352612,2015-05-17,30704202,Brit,"Vi følte os meget velkommen da vi ankom -Cynthia og hendes familie kendte vores navne. en meget venlig rundvisning af værelse, køkken og stue. Cynthia og hendes mand var meget opmærksom på hvad vi fortrak til morgen, så der var masser af frisk brygget kaffe og frugt mm.  beliggenheden  i forhold til Boston var perfekt, hvor vi tilbragte dagene. vi fik gode tips til hvad der var værd at se i Boston."
2931870,32560457,2015-05-19,31616577,Rachel,"Our stay was brief, but just lovely. Cynthia and her family were so warm and welcoming, and we felt right at home in their lovely home."

2931870,33204454,2015-05-25,17452994,Liliana,Cynthia and Keith are really nice and caring people. The room is as described with a private bathroom which is convenient. Breakfast in the morning is a nice touch. It is not close from Downtown but transportation is easily accesible.
2931870,33557317,2015-05-29,32947533,Deborah,The host was very hospitable and friendly. The area was further out of town and more run-down than I expected. The room was clean and the air- conditioner and fan helped but I found the room a little claustrophobic.
2931870,39876789,2015-07-26,17456845,Meg,"Hmm.... This review will be a bit of good and bad.  First off, I must say that Cynthia and her family seem like lovely people- very kind and helpful.  After staying in several AirBnB's over the last year, unfortunately I do not think I could rate this one as top notch compared with the others.  Still, I realize that each property is different, and this one does have its plus'."
Here are some things to note.  I wish to be honest.,,,,,
1.      Nice,friendly,helpful family. Cynthis helped us get oriented to Boston and told us where and how to purchase a Charlie Card for public transportation.,,,
2.      Inside the home seems very safe and comfortable.  We were given a key to the home,and our room had a lock on it as well.,,,,
3.      Breakfast was nice. It consisted of cold cereal,milk,orange juice,bagels,and fruit.  She also offered eggs,but we had to cook them ourselves (which we were surprised to discover).
4.      Friendly,small dog.,,,,
5.      Very close to the bus stop (maybe 50 yards).  When heading into Boston,take the #31 bus to whichever T connection you want.  Very simple.  In the morning,you must cross the street to catch the #31 inbound.,,,
6.     Free Wifi.,,,,,
7.      We stayed in the very top room on the 3rd floor,and it is in need of updating.  The sheets and bathroom were clean,but the room itself was very dusty.  The room,bathroom,and ceiling are in need of a good painting.  The room has way too much furniture and stored items in it.  The four of us were always climbing over each other.,
8.      The neighborhood around Cynthia's home appears to be sketchy. The area is named Mattapan,and since we did not know Boston at all,we picked this BnB based on photos and reviews. Still,once you are off the main road and onto Cynthia's street,it seems very safe with friendly,hardworking people. The homes are very old.  When walking along Blue Hill Rd. to buy the Charlie Pass
9.     Considering the price and all the above factors,I am pretty sure we could have stayed elsewhere for cheaper.,,,,
10. I wouldn't mind staying at Cynthia's again but only for one night while we got our bearings.  They are a nice family,and I hope they improve upon the room,"because it could be very nice indeed.\"",,,
2931870,40284540,2015-07-29,39305335,Julia,"Cynthia and her family were very accommodating and we had a lovely stay at their place. The room was very cozy with private bathroom, and the location was very convenient. Everyone in the house was very nice to us and we enjoyed their company. It was a big pleasure to stay with them and we would highly recommend it!"
Some particular things about our stay that I would like to add. We always felt welcome. Breakfast in the morning was a great asset and I liked that I could cook eggs the way I want. But most importantly,I wanted to talk about the hosts,,,,
Cynthia is a very caring and pleasant person. We really appreciated that she landed us a Charlie card when we did not know how to get it,found a coupon for my contact lenses solution when I suddenly ran out of it,and texted me when noticed we had left a light inside a car on.  She helped us save time and money which was very thoughtful and helpful since we came for just a couple of days and had a limited budget. We felt like we are not alone in this new city and someone actually cares about us. Hotels would never offer you that.  I think Cynthia went an extra mile for us because she has a big warm heart. You can tell that by looking at how all her family and guests love and appreciate her.,,,
P.S. It was super nice of Keith to make delicious scrambled eggs for us on our first morning!  This was a great icebreaker: he showed us the kitchen and explained everything; otherwise we might have been too shy to start cooking ourselves. Also,we really liked chatting with him.,,,,
Also,the cat Lucy and the dog Izzy are very cute and added even more to the warm atmosphere in the house.,,,,
It was a great stay! My husband and me are very grateful for Cynthia’s,Keith’s and their family’s hospitality 3,,,,

2931870,40411290,2015-07-30,39654155,Loekie,"If you just need a place to sleep and have breakfast, this is the right address. Clean sheets and towels in an airconditioned attickroom were the 4 of us stayed. Don't expect the luxury of a hotel but do expect to meet the lovely family of the house."

Some specifics: It was very comfortable,cool,and just right for our group of 4 (even a little roomy when only 3 of us could make it). We loved coming back to it each night! Despite the neighborhood's reputation from some sources,"we found it to be peaceful and friendly at all hours of the day and night. Public transport was very accessible through the 31 bus. Wifi was fast and reliable.\"",,

2931870,45817203,2015-09-06,13421891,Melissa,This was a very clean home with a warm and friendly family.  Our bathroom was small but having it 'en suite' was a big plus.
2931870,46936090,2015-09-14,14805364,Nicole,Cynthia and Keith welcomed us fondly.  Cynthia is a baker and shares her cake with her guests. Breakfast could be better. There was bread and banana. I am sure most guests would appreciate some protein.
The neighborhood was quiet and the street was not too difficult to find.,,,,,
Our room was on the top floor and pleasant. A/C did not work properly. Wouldn't be comfortable on a warm day.,,,,,

Even though it was past her bed time,she was understanding and had her husband let us in an show us to our room. They are both so warm.,,,,
Our room was clean and comfortable,and we woke up to fresh coffee,fruit and a hot meal.,,,
They then provided us with directions and assistance getting Downtown Boston.,,,,,

This listing is on the top floor of a 3 floor house, there's a long room with 3 beds (1 full & 2 twins). You have your own full bathroom on the 3rd floor. These accommodations are priced perfectly for 3 traveling, low budget individuals, however if you are a couple perhaps you might want a listing with a bit more privacy. The house was very active when we arrived, friendly people, cooking in the kitchen. Street parking was easy. If you're in a pinch and on a budget, this is the ideal place near Boston or Quincy."

7988755,45427870,2015-09-02,30078423,Denny,I had an amazing stay with Sarah at her place in Southie. The room (and private bath) were great. She made me feel very welcomed and gave me a great tour of the place (upon my initial arrival). Her place is fantastically situated just a 5 minute walk to Andrew T stop (the Redline subway line) making it super easy to get around.

She was very knowledgable about the Boston area and things we could see and do while we were there. Her fiancé was very helpful as well! We would definitely stay there again if we could!
7988755,46786268,2015-09-13,29298384,Sam,Sarah and Kader were amazing hosts. When I arrived Sarah greeted me and gave me a tour of the house which included an AWESOME rooftop patio and my own private bed and bathroom.
They also provided me with a welcome packet including the WIFI info,keys,chocolates,and toiletries.... what more could someone ask for!,,
The neighborhood was within walking distance to a number of places,including restaurants,beaches,"and the Convention Center where I was spending most of my time.\"",,

I am happy to offer them the highest rating.  Although my contact with both of them was limited due to my schedule, I really enjoyed my conversations with both Sarah and her husband.  They are both very pleasant and interesting people to spend time with.  Their home is lovely and I would happily revisit in the future."

My favorite part was sitting up here and enjoying peacefulness and the great city of Boston.  The minute I walked into Sarah and Kader's place I felt welcome. They put special touches everywhere, chocolates by your bed, clean towels, a little sewing kit, all thinks that luxury hotels offer. Plenty of room for clothes, your own bathroom and the most comfortable bed. I got to know the subway system quickly and the Andrew station on the red line was so easy to get everywhere. The place was spotless. Together they are a couple you instantly feel comfortable around, and at the same time have your privacy.  I walked daily to the South Boston Yoga Studio in about 15-20 minutes, but could have taken the train to Broadway one stop over.  I have had many wonderful experiences on Airbnb, but this ranks up there as one of my nicest. Thanks so much for opening up your lovely space to me. There is not one thing I would change. Jodie"

7988755,49467158,2015-10-04,20119700,Jamal Eddine,It was a pleasure staying with Sarah and Kader . It is an adorable and sweet couple. They were very welcoming and helpful. They make us feel at ease and like if we were home
Their space is very clean and comfortable. The most is that we had a bathroom to ourselves with all the necessary accessories.,,,,,
We also have access to a fitted terrace from which we had enjoyed a beautiful sunset and view of Boston.,,,,,
Their house is only few minutes walk from a large park and the coast where you can make a beautiful walk along the sea. Andrew subway station is at 5 minutes walk from the house,it serves all Boston.,,,,
"Sarah and Kader told us about the good addresses of restaurants and places where one could shop \"\"smart\"\".",,,,,
We'd return at their space if we get the opportunity to visit again Boston and we highly recommend them to other Airbnb travelers. Great thank to you both Sarah and Kader and hope seeing you again soon,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
7988755,50094273,2015-10-09,36688082,Tracy,Sarah was very helpful and responsive to all the queries I had prior to reaching her place.
The apartment is just like the pictures and has recently been given a fresh coat of paint. The floor is a little dusty but not a problem since you're going to be wearing slippers around the house anyway. Both the private bathroom and the bedroom is spacious enough for two. The bed is a little lumpy and may be problematic for those of age/with back problems (travelled with my elderly aunt and she didn't find it too comfortable). Otherwise,the apartment is in an exceptionally good location,a 7-10 minute walk to Andrew station on the Red line which conveniently takes you to most major stations in downtown Boston.,,,
"Also worth mentioning is that the apartment does have access to the roof lounge which provides a relatively good view of some city lights and is a nice place to relax and lounge in if your itinerary provides time for that.\"",,,,,
7988755,50482073,2015-10-12,39790022,Carolina,We had a great time at sarahs place. The room and bathroom were exactly as discribed and very clean.would recommend!
7988755,50862099,2015-10-15,29931183,Janet,"Sarah was the most welcoming host, nothing was too much trouble for her."
The room was lovely,the house was spotlessly clean throughout. The bathroom,with its lovely jacuzzi was very nice indeed.,,,
We are an older couple and were treated like friends.,,,,,
The bed was comfortable,not in the slightest 'lumpy' as previously described. I have a bad back and it worked really well for me and my husband.  The mattress is firm and seems fairly new. (The bed creaks a bit,but I think that's the frame.),,,
Sarah encouraged us to use the kitchen and lounge as we needed,which was a huge bonus.  Her fiancé,Kader,is also a lovely person,he helped with luggage and nothing was too much trouble for this lovely young couple.,
"Much better than staying in a hotel. Thanks for s wonderful time. \"",,,,,
7988755,51291384,2015-10-19,42029642,Michael,"Sarah was an exceptional host who made us feel welcome by opening her lovely home to us. We surprised her by being a bit early and walked in on her immacuatelty kept home. Her place is more beautiful than the pictures. The bed was extremely comfortable. Sarah took care of all the little details, including preparing a hand-written guide to Boston that we ended up referencing more than a few times. The house is gorgeous and it is clear that Sarah loves meeting and hosting people."
7988755,51753743,2015-10-24,17041499,Michel,"Bonsoir Sarah,"
Nous venons vous remercier pour l'agréable séjour que nous avons passé chez vous. Vous nous avez très bien reçus.,,,,,
Merci pour votre gentillesse et pour toutes les info utiles à notre visite de Boston.,,,,,
Bien sûr nous ne manquerons de vous recommander auprès des personnes susceptibles de se rendre à Boston.,,,,,
Encore merci.,,,,,
"Véronique et Michel\"",,,,,
7988755,52219351,2015-10-27,41814867,Tahuriah,"Sarah was one of the best hosts I have ever had. She thought of pretty much everything you could need for staying away from home: from cookies and assortments of tea and coffee, to tylenol for headaches next to your bed, to a personalized list of nearby places to go, to air mattresses for an extra guest and towels. She and Kader were very welcoming and opened their home to us. They were also very quiet and didn't disturb us, even when we felt like we were being a little loud. Not to mention the rooms looked EXACTLY like the pictures and were very comfortable and clean. I will definitely be staying here if I ever return to Boston."
7988755,53605035,2015-11-10,42630458,Ron,We greatly enjoyed our stay.  Very accommodating and the apartment was beautiful.  The deck on the roof was incredible...wish we would have taken more advantage of the view.  Walking distance to plenty of places to eat or drink and most importantly walking distance from our daughter who now lives in South Boston.
7988755,53776463,2015-11-12,38391840,Dawn,"Overall my stay at Sarah and Kader's place was wonderful! The apartment was easy to find and felt to be in a very safe neighborhood. The bedroom and private bathroom were clean and comfortable and was perfect for my short stay. Sarah was not able to be there which I found out upon my arrival and even though as a solo female traveler, first-time air BnB user, I was specifically searching for places to stay with females also present, her fiancé, Kader, was very welcoming and helpful and I never felt unsafe. The only negative from the experience was the communication about parking. I had never been to Boston before and drove my car. When Sarah and I had been communicating post-booking, she had mentioned she could hold a spot with her car for me since I would be arriving later than the check in time. But with her unable to be there, Kader instead pointed me a few areas I could park, but all were either not overnight visitor spots, or if they were, they were taken. He didn't seem as familiar with parking for visitors which was not as helpful as I would have hoped for. I drove around for an hour looking for a spot I could leave my car overnight without having to move it every two hours, before finally asking a group of really nice neighbors who pointed me to park on a big main road a few blocks away. I parked there easily and the walk to and from the apartment was relatively short (and again felt very safe as I was always walking from my car at night). I would definitely stay with them again... Only next time I would fly in and walk/take public transit around the city and leave the car at home!"
7988755,53981803,2015-11-15,8611082,Cameron,Kader (Sarah's fiancé) was there to meet us on arrival and was very welcoming. The apartment was very clean and smart. The apartment was located very close to the Andrew (red line) metro stop which made it very easy to get around.
7988755,54339817,2015-11-18,47351689,Rhondel,My first experience using Airbnb was amazing.  Even though plans did not work out as planned communication was quick and clear and everything that was listed was provided.
The location of the house made traveling really easy to most of the surrounding areas.  I'm from a smaller town however if you take the public transportation or uber,no destination is to far for being a larger city.,,,,
"I didn't have much expectations as this trip was about business but I would defiantly stay with Sarah and Kader if I was to travel back to Boston.\"",,,,,
7988755,54857922,2015-11-25,27390648,Kazusa,Sarah is wonderful host and her home is tasteful and comfortable. Close to station and easily can go to downtown. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would love to stay here again when I visit Boston.
7988755,55052374,2015-11-27,47903850,Miguel,"Clean, very peaceful, and comfortable place. The neighborhood was safe, with easy access through the Redline T. The description was very accurate, and as Sarah mentioned, Kader (her fiance) welcomed us to their home. He was very kind and informative. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat."
7988755,55366180,2015-12-01,13792573,Jessie,The description is very accurate and the neighborhood is very convenient.
7988755,56243654,2015-12-11,8177741,Aspen,"Sarah's place was exactly what we needed for our Boston trip. It was spotless, quiet and cozy and she goes the extra mile to provide the small amenities (coffee, toothpaste, etc) that make the AirBNB experience that much more convenient. The proximity to the Red Line train is big plus, we saved a lot of money on Uber/Taxi by being able to take the train pretty much everywhere."
"We would definitely stay here again. \"",,,,,
7988755,57889162,2015-12-30,47638448,Soo,"I liked this place so much, I and my friend really enjoyed staying Sarah's house. The place was exactly same as pictures and cleaned up so nicely. The best part of her house was her rooftop!! :) Such a great view and breeze out there. We loved to be in Boston as well as Sarah's place! Thank you Sarah, and hope to see you again."

It was in a great location and was really easy to get everywhere in the city from this place. Sarah was accomadating, and nice and she made our stay there very easy."
7988755,61193716,2016-02-01,47745938,Ozan,"Sarah's place was really nice to stay! We had everything which we need. Sarah and her husband Kader helped us for discovering Boston.. Our room and private bathroom were clean and comfortable. We also used kitchen and living room, we felt like we were in our home! And location and location... The house was 2 minutes to walk Andrew subway station and you can go to downtown in 15 minutes! It was a great thing for us. Also there was a shopping area (South Bay Center) 5 minutes away so you can easily find what you need.. And I have to add last thing: you can walk to the beach in 5 minutes and enjoy the day.."

"\"",,,,,
7988755,65214925,2016-03-12,15432319,Linda,There was only one nearby restaurant (a delicious polish restaurant) - all the others we found were either pizza or donuts - neither of which work for us so finding dinner in this neighborhood is problematic.  The room was nice although I probably wouldn't call it a suite since the bathroom is not connected to the bedroom but its is very close by.  We had a nice clean room.  Unfortunately we were unable to meet the host as she was out of town but her substitutes were very helpful and nice.
7988755,65627133,2016-03-15,35435872,Dennis,Our host was awesome! She welcomed me and explained everything well. Description was accurate same as website and quite & nice neighborhood. It was only 4min from T train and easy to go anywhere. bathroom and bedroom were sooooo clean I love that. It was best place ever.
7988755,68671664,2016-04-06,24322667,Giovanni,"Sarah and her husband were great hosts! They are super nice and they are there to help you any moment with whatever you might need. The apartment is great, from top to bottom, and very very clean as well! It is also very well connected with the tube. You can reach the city centre in 2 stops on the red line! If you are lucky enough to have some good weather the roof of the building is amazing! Boston is great and if we happen to go back there we will choose Sarah again without a second of hesitation!"
7988755,69142219,2016-04-09,27533065,Martijn,We have had a great stay at Sarah's place. The sleeping room and bath room were very comfortable and clean. The apartment was located close to the subway and therefore provides you fast access to all the cool places in Boston.
Sarah prepared the room very well. She even supplied us chargers for different types of phones...,,,,,

7988755,69939857,2016-04-14,23228072,Leo,Good location close to Andrew T in red line. Rooms and house was as described. Sarah was a mindful host who gave us all needed instructions clearly. We had a peaceful stay.
7988755,70748501,2016-04-20,19597051,Laura,"I was in town for the Boston Marathon and her home was an ideal location in a great neighbourhood.  As an AirBNB host, I have exceptionally high standards and Sarah exceeded them.  My room was extremely spacious, wonderfully warm & quiet, and had everything I needed including towels, electronics chargers, books & flyers on the Boston area, etc.  The bed was very comfortable and the private washroom just down the hall was also beautiful & perfectly located.  I instantly felt comfortable in Sarah's home and would love to stay there again on a future visit."

7988755,71981146,2016-04-30,62516173,Elizabeth,Great time in Boston. Staying in Southie felt safe and fun. Sarah's apartment was very nice and so was her hospitality. Easy access to subway transit too.
7988755,72518790,2016-05-03,18595207,Jason,"Sarah has a great place to stay in Boston! The convenience of being so close to the subway is really nice. Sarah herself was very welcoming for our stay, and had a handy little booklet filled out with everything we needed to know about her place and the surrounding area. We took one of her recommendations for brunch at The Paramount and thoroughly enjoyed it."
Sarah also provided nice touches like chocolates by the bed,as well as made it clear that we could use her tea/coffee/bread in the morning.,,,,

7988755,73066633,2016-05-06,21024054,Megan,"Sarah's house was beautiful and very close to the city.  It is close to several breakfast restaurants also.  The bathroom was very nice and updated.  We loved the artwork and wished we could have enjoyed the rooftop deck.  One complaint is that the mattress is very squeaky and very loud [but very comfortable], which made for a lot of stress with the after 10 o'clock quiet time.  Parking was a bit confusing because all the streets surrounding it are for residents only during the night time and are only 2 hour parking for visitors.  We stressed about it but did not have a problem [or a ticket].  It is easier to get around Boston [and a million times cheaper] to take the metro/train anyway, so definitely consider doing so!"

There was a smoke alarm going off the last day but it didn't wake me up at all at night, which I was worried about. Sarah did mention when she gave us the tour that the bed was very loud and that was really the only downfall of the entire experience. I would definitely stay with Sarah again!"
7988755,75020117,2016-05-18,67321758,Lydia,I was made to feel welcome and given a full tour of Sarah's lovely home as soon as I arrived. The house is easily accessible to the Boston metro and was a great spot for me to stay overnight while in town for a few days.

Je ne connaissais pas du tout cette ville et était venu juste pour visiter les universités mais finalement le freedom Trail fut beaucoup plus intéressant et permet de faire découvrir la ville .

Staying with Sarah and her husband felt like staying with friends. They were extremely welcoming and truly made us feel at home. We arrived on Friday evening and Sarah and her husband were both working (we met them both on Saturday). They had a friend let us in who was wonderful. The apartment is gorgeous with so many little touches to make it feel like home. Our bedroom was so cute and quaint, and was full of information to help us explore. The roof top deck was AMAZING. Everyday we were up there enjoying the view. Sarah's apartment was located just 2 or 3 blocks from Andrew Station which was so easy to navigate. It made exploring Boston a breeze. We had a wonderful time staying at Sarah's place and when we decide to come back to Boston, we'll be renting here !"

The bathroom, while not connected to the bedroom, was right next door and was clean. We were pretty much in walking distance from anything we needed, but there are also bicycles for rent (I recommend it as its a great way to explore the city) and it's a block away from the T.

From Sarah's apartment it's only a short way to the train Station,  into the heart of the city you need about 15-20 minutes . It is a wonderful flat , the room and bathroom also and the terasse on the roof is great! For breakfast we could take everything out of the fridge. Sarah helped us with many informations."
7988755,92518605,2016-08-08,66202704,Simon,It was just awesome at your Place. It's a really short trainride downtown and the having breakfast on the roof is just amaizing. We loved it. You could tell by the interior that there is some French and African influence. Loved that too:)

5953696,64736050,2016-03-06,8703492,Rachael,"Kierstyn was an outstanding host. She went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable both arriving at her apartment and during our stay. The listing is EXACTLY as described and displayed in the pictures. It may seem too good to be true but I promise you it's not! Gorgeous, clean, comfortable, and best of all central. She really is in the heart of downtown Boston with amazing restaurants, nightlife, Faneuil Hall, the Freedom Trail, Boston Common, the Public Garden, and much more right outside her front door. And as if that's not enough the T (subway) is literally steps from her apartment making it easy to travel all around the Boston area. I seriously cannot say enough about how lovely of a host Kierstyn is and how unbelievably perfect our stay was. This really made our trip. If you want to experience Boston to the fullest you MUST book with Kierstyn."
5953696,64892585,2016-03-08,11854642,James,"We absolutely loved staying at Kierstyn's place in Boston. The location could not have been better: it was close to a few tourist attractions, good restaurants, and public transport. Kierstyn always made sure we were having a good time and were well looked after. Her apartment itself is also really lovely."
5953696,65906562,2016-03-17,28521991,Ting,"Lovely and cozy apartment. Kierstyn is very friendly and caring, and we really enjoy our stay there. Hope to stay there for a few more days."
5953696,66466084,2016-03-22,46731478,Amanda,"There's so much to say about this property and host. This was not only my first time to Boston, but my first time using Airbnb and Kierstyn definitely set the bar high. I could not have asked for a more generous and caring host. Her location is SO perfect that my boyfriend and I were able to walk around and enjoy every bit of Boston without having to take cabs/uber a everywhere. We walked to the aquarium, Harpoon Brewery, Chinatown and Charles Street (a quick walk through the park) just to name a few. Kierstyn was away for the weekend, but still kindly checked in every day to see if everything was okay and to give a few suggestions! If you're going to Boston completely clueless on what to do, what to see, where to eat etc., don't worry! She leaves you a very informative list of amazing restaurants, quick grab and go joints, places to grab a few drinks, coffee shops, and attractions to check out while in the area.....most, if not all, in walking distance !"
Another thing I find worth mentioning is that the day I was scheduled to fly back home,the forecast was calling for snow. Kierstyn kindly let me know this information two days before arriving in Boston and offered to extend our stay if the weather was bad enough to where our flight got delayed or cancelled. That alone made me realize how great of a host we were booking with.,,,,
Without her,I can go honestly say my trip would not have been as enjoyable as she had made it. There should be no hesitation in booking with Kierstyn,"for I know I would book again with her in a heartbeat.\"",,,
5953696,66923597,2016-03-25,7064606,Charlotte,"Fantastisk ophold! Kierstyn var så sød, hjælpsom og imødekommende og lejligheden var så smuk og ren. Den ligger perfekt midt i Boston downtown lige overfor Macys og i gåafstand til det meste + meget tæt på metroen. Kierstyn havde lagt nogle rigtig gode anbefalinger klar til os, da vi ankom. Det eneste minus ved vores værelse var at det var meget varmt, men Kierstyn havde på forhånd gjort en fane klar til nedkøling. Hvis du skal til Boston kan denne lejlighed virkelig anbefales!"
5953696,68450541,2016-04-05,12875698,Kym,"Kierstyn’s loft was exactly what we were looking for in Boston; it was very clean and comfortable, exactly like the photos and the location was so convenient, we walked everywhere."
Although Kierstyn was away for the weekend her communication was super clear; we had no problems locating or entering her apartment and she left some very handy information about places to eat and drink in the local area.,,,,,
We would definitely recommend. Thanks Kierstyn!,,,,,

5953696,68982625,2016-04-08,21142093,Donna,What a great place to stay.  Lovely apartment in the heart of Boston.  Warm and welcoming hostess.  Can't wait to go back.
5953696,69381810,2016-04-11,8085141,Laura,"Great location. Finding a property close to the red and green T is a big plus. Apartment was spot on. Quiet, clean and comfy. Would highly recommend."
5953696,70476971,2016-04-18,57459048,Quentin,"Kierstyn's place couldn't have been better. The loft was clean, spacious, and looked just like the pictures. The location is right in the heart of Boston and steps away from the T. Boston Commons, as well as lots of restaurants and shops, are within a block. Kierstyn was out of town for the weekend, but checked in daily and made sure we were enjoying our stay. Accessing the building was easy and Kierstyn left lots of useful info about the area. I would definitely recommend her place to anyone visiting Boston!"
5953696,70662706,2016-04-19,64825804,Joann,Kierstyn was a terrific host and the apartment was absolutely beautiful.
5953696,71182547,2016-04-24,48090718,Kylli,"Staying at Kierstyn felt like staying at home. The location is superb and the room is nice. In case temperature needs to be adjusted, fan is helpful. Thank you so much for a welcoming stay."
5953696,71430848,2016-04-25,21142093,Donna,Kierstyn is a warm and wonderful host.  Her apartment is beautiful - the bed's the best and I love the upbeat neighborhood.  Will stay there again and again.
5953696,71532681,2016-04-26,64825804,Joann,"Kierstyn was so accommodating and welcoming, she made the whole experience easy.  Her place is beautiful and very  clean.  I will definitely want to stay again!"
5953696,71797583,2016-04-28,13421808,Mo,"Kierstyn was awesome and very friendly. She is very easy to communicate with and gave me directions and suggestions for fun/good places around her. She even offered me sushi when I arrived! Throughout my stay she kept in touch and asked if I needed anything. I loved Kierstyn's place, as it's very spacious and comfortable, not to mention in the middle of everything!"
5953696,74150611,2016-05-13,24149802,Melissa,"Kierstyn was so easy to communicate with! She was prompt in her responses and gave us great information about the neighborhood. Unfortunately our visit was cut short so we only had a brief opportunity to meet Kierstyn but she seemed lovely and very flexible. The location is super - very convenient to walking just about anywhere in the Boston main area. Good shops and restaurants close by, just one block from the Boston Common."
5953696,75100171,2016-05-18,34932930,Todd,"Kierstyn was great and her place is clean, as advertised and ideally located downtown right next to shops and transportation."
5953696,75190709,2016-05-19,21142093,Donna,"Once again Kierstyn was a perfect host - friendly and helpful.  I, as always, I thuroughly enjoyed staying n her beautiful apartment."
5953696,76181816,2016-05-25,13421808,Mo,Kierstyn is awesome! This was my second stay at her place.
5953696,80007613,2016-06-15,41770147,Brittany,Had a great experience at Kierstyn's loft. She was out of town but she left very good directions and kept in contact with me and gave suggestions on places for food. Beautiful space right in the center of everything. We walked to most places including the Freedom Trail from her place and extremely close to the railway to hop on and off for farther distances. Definitely recommend for a solid Boston experience!
5953696,80769353,2016-06-19,28584108,Katy,"\"Kierstyn was extremely accommodating and kind, and also very responsive. She was thoughtful about giving us recommendations for restaurants and things to do in Boston, and helping us with anything we needed (which wasn't much, as she had everything all set!).  The apartment was adorable and in a very central location.  It was also clean and comfortable, and felt just like \"\"home\"\" for the weekend!\""
5953696,81884570,2016-06-25,31040482,Carol,"Kierstyn's place is a quiet oasis in one of the livelier parts of Boston, within walking distance of historic sites, the theater district, shopping, the harbor and restaurants. It is also right on two T lines. Kierstyn is a warm thoughtful hostess who worked hard to address our every need."
5953696,82841806,2016-06-29,62709494,Charles,"Host left snacks/drinks, a nice info sheet to local dining. Very quiet, nice light, except bedroom which had no windows. A large food store across street had abundance of ready-made salads, breads, deserts, etc.  Very convenient locale to touring city by foot. Clean, bright and comfortable."
5953696,87094504,2016-07-18,34536871,Lou,The host canceled this reservation 56 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

Kierstyn was very helpful and easy to reach. Her loft was a perfect place to spend our couple of nights in Boston, and we'd definitely stay there again."
5953696,90263804,2016-07-31,21444753,Dan,"Kierstyn, was super responsive and attentive of every detail, from the booking communication, checking in, and throughout our stay."
5953696,91239122,2016-08-04,202346,John,"Amazing place! Very clean, perfect location, and easy communication with the host. Easily one of my best Airbnb stays."
5953696,92878568,2016-08-10,84438697,Tricia,"Beautiful loft in a great downtown location - nicely decorated.   All the little touches (basket of toiletries if you've forgotten, list of favorite restaurants, etc.) were very thoughtful and appreciated.  Not the best air conditioning in the building, but it was a hot stretch in Boston and the fan in the bedroom was helpful."
5953696,93975011,2016-08-14,42500801,Jenny,"We had a fantastic stay at Kierstyn's apartment.  The location was perfect as it was within walking distance of everything, including The Commons, Boston Public Market and the Boston Fish Pier.  The apartment had everything we needed (and anything else we could get from the massive grocery store across the street) and was the perfect size for the two of us.  We hope to be back!"
13796564,93354470,2016-08-12,88757291,Ilaria,We stayed at Marie's house for a couple of days and we had a great experience. Prior to our arrival she gave us a couple of tips about the weather and offered to pick us up from the airport. Marie and her family welcomed us into their home with kindness. The room was clean and quiet. Marie is very knowledgable about the city and the surrounding area. She helped us figure out the best way to move around the city and to decide what was worth seeing.
10811,59324269,2016-01-09,5297851,Kelly,"Loved it!!  this place is absolutely gorgeous and very spacious for a studio.  Amazing neighborhood, everything is in walking distance.  Michelle is very nice and very responsive to inquiries and it was a very easy transition in arrival."
10811,68636139,2016-04-05,4130561,Dana,"The check in process could have been a lot smoother, and the bed was about as comfortable as can be expected for a Murphy bed (not listed as such). I'm also a pretty light sleeper and was woken up several times by the upstairs neighbors' footsteps. Great location but disappointing for the price."
10811,77559826,2016-06-01,26482906,Carol,"This apartment is a little gem. Its Back Bay location was handy for nearly everything we wanted to do. The little kitchen was well equipped, no oven, but a useful dishwasher. The apartment was nicely furnished and clean. The shower worked well. We would gladly stay here again the next time we are in Boston. There are loads of restaurants and a very good Star Market nearby. The Boston Women's  Memorial is also near."
14203428,91713238,2016-08-06,36142964,Linda,"The Smiling Buddha Bedroom exceeded all my expectations which I find very appealing and refreshing.   Todd was especially attentive to details for travelers like myself who are use to high level of service.  The house was impeccable and furnished with taste and style which made for a relaxing, restful stay.   I couldn't be more pleased with how beautiful this house is.    The neighborhood was quite, safe and an easy walk to Harvard Square - which is a must for food, fun and people watching.   Having other guests in the house created a warm feeling of international community and interesting conversations.  The sincere caring that Todd shows for his guests leaves you with a feeling of being welcomed and wanting to come back.   I would highly recommend Todd as a host as he provided such a comfortable and amazing experience for myself and the other guests."
14203428,92226227,2016-08-08,31989269,Nancy,"We absolutely LOVED staying at Todd's Airbnb!!!  This is the by far the nicest Airbnb we have ever visited - a super high-end, beautifully appointed house in a fantastic location.  We had an amazing Airbnb dinner party that Todd organized (he has a few other Airbnb apartments and brought everyone together) and met some really interesting guests from all over the country and world.  Everything in the house was so well thought out, he even had mini toiletries (we needed a toothbrush and toothpaste) available for us when we asked.   Harvard Business School is about a 5 minute walk away, and   there's terrific restaurants within a 10 - 15 minute walk with any kind of cuisine you could imagine.  We will definitely be coming back to Todd's house next time we visit Boston."

13590412,85646735,2016-07-12,15870700,Amy,I loved this little apartment and thought it was cuter in person compared to the photos. It was clean and had a very comfy bed.
It's in a really great neighborhood across from a healthy grocery store,"an urban outfitters and a Dunkin. Tons of eating/shopping options within a short walk and 1 block from the T.  \"",,,,
13590412,85825179,2016-07-13,45689075,Kevin,"The listing was accurate, the apartment beautiful, and the host gave great information and was incredibly helpful once contacted (though we did not hear back/any actual confirmation that our booking was legitimate until shortly prior to arrival)."
13590412,86410386,2016-07-16,33662460,Chris,I've stayed at this apartment before and was fortunate that it was available again for me to use.   Easy access from the host.   It's a great place in a great spot.
13590412,87698796,2016-07-21,83124196,Ben,"This apartment is very nice and it is in a very convenient location. It is very clean. The host was very accommodating when it came to checking in, and check out was very simple. I would recommend this place to anyone trying to stay in Boston. It is very affordable and has all that you need."
13590412,89723956,2016-07-29,23754706,Lexi,The place is perfect for anyone visiting BU! Located very conviently near all manner of reasturants and shops. The place is very clean and confortable. I would stay again!
13590412,90106905,2016-07-31,72190106,Santi,"The staying was great ! Nice apartment , the only problem was that there wasn't a table , but it was very clean and it's great for four!"

6742905,34916620,2015-06-13,3140211,Nancy,"The best thing about Sean's apartment is the location, so"
If that's important to you,you may overlook its very real dark side. In addition,Sean's partner was pleasant and available for key pickup and drop off.,,,
However,this is a small room that is simply not ready for guests. When it's ready,it may be fine. Until then,"buyer beware.\"",,
6742905,36127622,2015-06-25,7601835,Nicola,"Sean have been a very good host. All was smooth and clear with him. The apartment is in a great location and quite cheap compared to others. Inside it is not the Ritz, but all works fine included the A/C and has its own character, anyway i feel we come while Sean was improving it so maybe next guests will have even better accomodation."
6742905,36723573,2015-06-30,36086849,Jody,"The studio was cozy and sufficient for a 1 night stay.  The mattress was very squeaky, there was some sort of plastic cover over the mattress, under the sheets...  The location was great though, very convenient."
6742905,36824327,2015-07-01,7316737,Shane,"This is not someone's home. This is simply a sad, dirty apartment used only for Airbnb. The address on Airbnb was different from where we actually met Sean and stayed, which was probably our first clue. The apartment does not come close to matching the beauty of the surrounding neighborhood, or the photos on the listing. You get what you pay for, and I would recommend getting more in the Cambridge area."
On a positive note,"Sean was very easy to get in contact with before arriving. We arrived early and he was still able to accommodate us.\"",,,,
6742905,36983011,2015-07-03,15030586,Brigitte,Sean's place was very nice. Great location and clean! A/C was much appreciated as was having the second mattress. Space was small but functional and had all the necessities. Sean was easy to communicate with and made our stay easy.
6742905,37088336,2015-07-04,30430038,Charlotte,"I was able to chat with Sean for a bit when I met him at the studio. He is friendly and, while I did not need to meet with him again before I left Boston, he lives super close to the studio which was nice in case I needed anything. The studio was exactly as described and was perfect for what my two friends and I needed: a couple beds, a bathroom, and a great location. I was able to find parking on Cambridge and spent about $15 total for one day's parking (and I could pay the meter with an app on my phone!)."
6742905,37510683,2015-07-07,31764198,Aaron,"Convenient, reasonably priced and the host was friendly and helpful."
6742905,37675813,2015-07-09,35429307,Kevin,"Apartment was small but very functional. It had what we needed for a few days touring Boston. It was very close to attractions. AC worked well and kept the place cool. Sean was there to meet us and show us the place, then didn't intrude again."
6742905,37999286,2015-07-12,6870904,Valentina,"Una location da 5 stelle, un host molto gentile, ceck in rapido..peró l'appartamento andrebbe un pochino rinnovato.."
6742905,38152215,2015-07-13,33830436,Roro,"\"When my friend's told me that parking in Boston was terrible, I now know what they mean! Everything is for residential only. I managed to find a spot four blocks away next to a sign that read \"\"Visitor's Parking.\"\" It's only 2 hours max Monday-Friday. If you're there for the weekend"
We stayed at Sean's for one night only. If you're looking for a place to just sleep,it's really not too shabby. The place may seem a little run down,but it's fine short term. I always bring my essentials when I travel,and I suggest that you do the same.,,
Boston is quite small,everything is reachable within minutes. The train/subway is walking distance.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
6742905,38309248,2015-07-14,3189845,Abigail,"This was quite a disappointing Airbnb experience for my partner and me. Sean was extremely difficult to get in touch with prior to our arrival - we did hear from him but only briefly. As we were arriving after a four hour drive I tried to keep Sean informed of our arrival time, yet when we got to the apartment the sheets were still in the dryer in the basement of the building. While the sheets were clean the bathroom was anything but, the floor was covered in dirt. This was thankfully only a quick stop over for us but quite a disappointing stay overall."
6742905,39028826,2015-07-20,502890,Daph,"Didn't meet Sean and didn't receive instructions he apparently sent so the arrival definitely could've been improved. The space was fine. Nothing fancy but the basics were there. The apartment could have been cleaner - apartment, towels, floors, etc. but overall it was fine and the location was convenient."
6742905,39516415,2015-07-24,27145268,Sushma,Soan was warm. Collecting the keys was not at all difficult. The area was as described in Beacon hill. But the apartment was too small and it was not in good shape. We stayed here in hot day of July and Air conditioner was not working well. May be some renovation going on which the owner did not mentioned.
There can be remarkable improvements in cleaning,amenitites and air conditioning. Actually,this property is superbly located and can be great with proper cleanliness and adding few more facilities like  proper crockery sufficient for 3-4 persons,vessels,kitchen amenities and some small things like soap in bathroom,clean towels
Soan can be good host with improvements as mentioned.,,,,,
Also there were no proper Maps etc. in the room,but when asked,Soan guided well. I suggest him for keeping some basic maps or other things,"which can be useful for the tourists.\"",,
6742905,40223799,2015-07-29,1777946,Julia,"Sean was a very responsive and helpful host. The apartment is centrally located in the Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston. The apartment is nothing fancy, but you can't beat the price or location!"
6742905,40463822,2015-07-31,36137781,Haleigh,"Super happy with my experience. The location was great, and Sean was nice. We did our own thing and came and went as we pleased without the worry of bothering anyone. Would definitely use again."
6742905,41137592,2015-08-04,29444541,Bin,"On time for appoinment, very kind for clearance, and show me the ways to local places. Thanks a lot. Bin"
6742905,41442326,2015-08-07,38208266,Sarah,"Sean was accommodating at first by letting us drop our bags off right when we got off our flight, this enabled us to explore the city and was extremely convenient."
That is unfortunately the last and only pleasant experience about this stay. When we arrived for our check-in,there were no sheets on the bed and we were asked if we would like some. There was a dirty comforter that needed a duvet,which again,we were asked if we wanted one. Considering that the blanket had sweat stains,we certainly wanted the duvet. Sean had to leave after letting is in the apartment to retrieve the blankets that were still in the laundry. We had just gotten off a flight and desperately needed a shower. There were no towels and my boyfriend had to use his dirty airline clothes to dry himself off. Sean came back while we were still in the apartment getting ready and proceeded to make the bed and continue putting dishes away in front of us.,
All of that aside,the photos completely misrepresent the place. The bathroom is in disrepair,the floors are dirty and there are no amenities. He seemed like a nice enough guy,but to charge over $100 for a weeknight in that hovel is unconscionable to me. Not sure why the other reviewers are so delicate with with their responses,"this was not a good experience. \"",
6742905,41829799,2015-08-09,39052236,Meghan,"Had a great experience. Sean was pleasant, and pretty quick to respond to messages. Check in/out was easy. Neighborhood was a great central location for what my friend and I had planned. Easy walking distance to the T, and popular sites. The description of the apartment was spot on, and also it was very quiet for being in downtown Boston."
6742905,41958900,2015-08-10,6071049,Maria,"Квартира очень тесная, душная. На кухне нет ничего для чая-кофе. Постельное белье чистым можно назвать только с большой натяжкой."
6742905,42163632,2015-08-11,17147810,Yu Ning,"The location of the apartment is pretty good, nice street views. We arrived the place when the host was out so when we saw the apartment is a mess. However the host clean it up after we went out and came back at night. So cleanness is one of the problem of this stay. It is said there will be a second bed however it is under the queen bed and you have to drag it out. The sheet is not very clean, so many dust. In addition, the trash of the last person was not clean up. Both trash bin the in room and the bathroom were half full which is kind of disgust. There is a bag of rotten peach in the refrigerator and you won't want to use this kitchen. Overall the apartment location is great great great, but not clean."
6742905,42461014,2015-08-13,40215694,Guanjie,"The place was nice for accommodating my parents and I for one night and thanks to its perfect location, we were able to pay a quick visit to Boston Common and the Aquarium in a single morning. It is also within walk distance to a Whole Food and two metro stations. Thanks Sean!"
6742905,42688128,2015-08-15,998739,Nicolle,We had a great time staying at this location in Boston. Truly walkable to most of the Boston area and very close to the Boston Commons area as well. This was our first time visiting the east coast and we had such a great time. We would stay here again in heartbeat. The place was cozy and it was nice to have our own little kitchen and bathroom as well. Sean was really easy to get a hold of to get the keys and to drop them off when we were checking out.  Sometimes it was little tricky to get the keys to lock and unlock the doors but after a few times we got the hang of it. I would highly recommend this place for anyone who is searching for a place to stay in Boston and doesn't want to use a car.
6742905,44421481,2015-08-26,11165813,Megan,"This apt is in a great location, host is friendly and prompt. It's great to have a full refrigerator. Towels are a bit rough and the bed wasn't the most comfortable"
6742905,44953300,2015-08-30,40104768,Kathy,It was ok for a place to sleep! Sean was very accommodating since we got in after midnight. Good location!
6742905,45078295,2015-08-31,18391132,Teddie,The neighborhood was nice and Sean was very helpful and accommodating.
The room was clean enough and comfortable enough to sleep in... I would not recommend staying here if you plan to spend a lot of time in the room. It is a VERY tiny studio in an old building,2 flights up. The foundation of the building makes it so the floors in the room and the bathroom come to a point in the middle.,,,,
Also,if you are planning to drive and need to park a vehicle overnight,this is a tough area.,,,
There is very limited overnight parking if you are not a Beacon Hill resident with a sticker. There are meters but they need t be fed every 2 hours. There are a few parking garages near by,"but they are expensive. We ended up paying $48 to park the car overnight in a garage. \"",,,,
6742905,45664420,2015-09-05,5577028,Cheryl,"Checking in was quick and easy -- we negotiated a rough time frame to meet beforehand, and I called when I was on my way. One thing not pictured (although I should've realized because I'm familiar with Beacon Hill) is that the stairs are steep and small. Fortunately, my luggage was about 40 pounds, so I was able to manage. The apartment was charming, a bit run down-looking here and there, but mostly fine. My only issue was the bed, which I found to be hard and noisy and leaving only a small space to walk through to the bathroom. I think the size and age of the apartment and definitely the stairs are part of its character, making it less like a hotel. Some features that I appreciated were A/C, magazines, the full size refrigerator, and a box of teabags."
The location is fantastic! I indeed had easy access to all of the T lines. I walked to Charles MGH (Red),North Station (Green/Orange/Commuter),and Bowdoin (Blue). Restaurants and stores were right there,"and it was great to wander around through the Boston Common and North End. \"",,
6742905,45937341,2015-09-07,17192394,Hilary,"My husband and I stayed in Sean's studio apartment over Labor Day weekend. The location was a quiet, great spot in Beacon Hill. Our flight didn't arrive until late so Sean was lenient with our arrival time and worked with us. I recommend staying here when visiting Boston for a weekend."
6742905,47074763,2015-09-15,3040140,Benjamin,Sean's apartment was in a fantastic location and key pickup and drop-off were seamless. Excellent value on Beacon Hill!
6742905,47148930,2015-09-16,35682469,Yi Yang,Pros: Very good location
Cons: Host was not responsive at all. Did not leave instructions despite my repeated emails & calls. When we showed up at the door we still had not received instructions on how to get the key. Internet was not working & was not fixed during our stay. We requested for a 3rd bed and the host promised to send sheets,etc. over by night time. However,"when we got home at 9-10 pm the sheets were still not there and we had to call Sean again. Place was not well maintained.\"",,,
6742905,47637839,2015-09-21,13974467,Starr Cummin,"Sean made us feel welcome, telling us we could leave our bags anytime after noon, even if he hadn't cleaned yet.  It appeared that was indeed the case because there was food in the frig, the paper towel roll was empty, there was hair in the bathtub drain, the blinds had so much dust you could draw a line in it and dust balls on the floor.  I let Sean know that we had dropped off our bags and would not be back until much later so he would have a chance to clean.  Unfortunately, nothing changed between 12:30 pm and 10:30 pm, which surprised us, but we felt it too late in the evening to call him."
"Also the place was much darker than the photos on line indicated. I guess they were overexposed.\"",,,,,
6742905,47827083,2015-09-21,43691051,Mary-Anne,"We had a great stay at Sean's place in Beacon Hill. It was a perfect place from which to explore Boston. The room was clean, and getting access to this private space was a simple process (key pick-up, etc.)."
6742905,47993894,2015-09-22,13247853,Megan,"Great location!!! Right across the street from a drugstore, a bank, and Whole Foods Market. Right around the corner from a really great bar. Right down the street from the T, and tons of history. Very firm bed (which I appreciate) and cozy accommodations. Perfect bare bones living for anyone who wants to be close to everything."
6742905,48506367,2015-09-27,22480976,Peg,"Directions to the space were easy to follow and Sean also gave us simple directions to our other destinations in the city. The apartment was sufficient for our needs, but a coffee maker would have been a nice touch.  There were no towels available yet when we arrived after 3:30 and so we went out without showering."
Unfortunately when we came back late at night after a show by Fenway we found that the primary bed had been made with just a bottom sheet and a comforter - no top sheet. Maybe the comforter is washed between bookings but I still would have preferred a sheet.  Worse,my friend slept on the second bed [really a comfortable mattress stored under the bed] but not only did it not have sheets,"she had to sleep under a towel as there was no second blanket available.  She was cold and had poor sleep. I suppose we could have contacted Sean but it was 2 am...\"",,,
6742905,48797530,2015-09-28,11292741,Skye,"\"This apartment is definitely in a great location. We found free visitor parking immediately and were able to stay in that spot all weekend, which was great. However, the photos of this listing make it look like a cute dorm room, which it is not. I would call this place an \"\"efficiency\"\" rather than a studio and it is in need of some repairs. Sean was very difficult to get ahold of in the days before our stay"
6742905,49591767,2015-10-05,33375203,Andrew,"Great location, able to walk anywhere in Boston and close to multiple T stops. Apartment was as advertised. Sean was a very responsive host, even helped us Saturday night when we got locked out."
6742905,50067266,2015-10-09,37497220,Clint,"Sean was very helpful in helping us find the place and get in and telling us about a place to park and about the on site laundry facility. If you have a car this is not a good place to stay as that will cost an extra $35/day and it is crazy trying to get to the place in a car. Otherwise it is very conveniently located for walking and taking the T. The space however is cramped and pretty rustic. It is difficult for the person sleeping next to wall to get out of bed safely. Their were only two mismatched bath towels/no hand towels no soap. The bath mat was an old torn raggedy towel. Their was old food left in the refrigerator from previous guests but no other food- just some tea bags. The window blinds were filthy. Otherwise the place was clean, kitchen area had the basics - stove/micro/toaster/dishes, etc. Steep stairs to climb. Good place for the young at heart."
6742905,50257135,2015-10-10,19164714,Daniel,Everything worked out well. We immediately found the apartment. The location was great. We liked the old buildings and the short distance to the metro station as well as shops and cafés. The room was good for one night. Thank you for the quick response and the possibility to stay in Boston. Greetings from Germany!
6742905,50294598,2015-10-11,6677999,Daniel,"We were very happy with this place. It's small, but clean and well-organized--the rollout bed slides under the main bed and is super comfortable. The apartment is in a great location. Sean was very friendly and responsive to our questions. There's a parking garage nearby (Charles St parking garage) for those with a car. Highly recommend as an inexpensive place in central Boston."
6742905,50616659,2015-10-13,387441,Donna,"First of all, the location was wonderful!  But that’s where the wonderful ends."
After climbing 3 flights of stairs hosting the most disgusting carpet I have ever seen,we arrived at our Beacon Hill efficiency – it was 2:45 pm and had not been cleaned yet which was OK so we had high hopes for the after effect. Wifi said it was working but was not able to connect to internet. I reported it to Sean and he said he’d look into it. We ended up using a WiFi device that used our cell phone signal.,,,,
We left to go out sightseeing,returning later that evening. Sean had been there because we found 2 clean towels and the bed was made.  The fridge still had someone else’s half eaten food in it. There were no glasses,only 1 Mason jar and some coffee mugs….which was ironic since there was no coffee maker! There were plates and cutlery,a microwave and a toaster oven,a fridge (no ice cube trays) and a stove.,
The apartment is in dire need of a facelift. There was trim falling off the baseboards,the entire place needs painting. Part of the wall in the awful bathroom appeared to be patched with white tape of some kind.  The light fixture over the sink lacked a cover – just a bare bulb.,,,,
The tub was awful – mildew lined the tiles and the tub was long overdue to be re-glazed. Some new floor tiles had started to be laid near the tub only which makes you wonder why.  Single ply toilet paper (1 roll).  The hand soap next to the sink was like water – instead of replacing it,water had been added to it.,,,,
Then we got ready to go to bed only to find there was no top sheet – a fitted bottom sheet and the nasty comforter was it!!  I found an unopened twin bed sheet in a package in a bin on the wall and promptly opened it and laid it across the bed to have a barrier from the comforter touching us. The bed itself was super hard – I think it was the box spring and not a mattress at all!,,,,,
This place could have been fixed up pretty cute which is the sad thing.   It’s an old building and I know you can’t make it look new,but there is no excuse for this. We are Air B & B Superhosts and we have an 1882 carriage house that we rent out. Parts definitely look old but the parts we can do things about,like bathrooms,we have fixed up very nice.  This was a huge disappointment for a beautiful area of Boston.  I took photos of all the issues I noted if anyone cares to see them as proof as to what I noted.,,
"\"",,,,,
6742905,50759416,2015-10-14,5042721,Melissa,Sean was a great host! He contacted me in advance and provided specific and easy to follow directions to check in.
The apartment was great. It was almost exactly as described with some minor changes to the positioning of the furniture. It was a great place to stay in Boston. Close to the subway station. It is on the 6th floor so if you are not used to walk-ups,please take note. It was a little stuffy after the rain because apparently a previous guest may have stolen Sean's extension cord so the air conditioner could not properly plug in the outlet. Other than that,it was great.,,,
The street the apartment is on is cute and quaint. Parking is a pain though,but it is a little difficult in all of Boston but Sean provided a nearby parking lot.,,,,
"We had a later flight and asked Sean if we could check out later and he was more than accommodating. We actually met Sean since he was prepping the apartment for the next guests. He does the cleaning himself.  He was really nice and provided us with some information on sights to see. Thanks Sean!\"",,,,,
6742905,51427132,2015-10-20,22852040,Anke,"Sean hat von Beginn an sehr zuverlässig geantwortet. Auch die Schlüsselübergabe über einen Schlüsselsafe funktionierte problemlos. Die Wohnung ist innerhalb Bostons hervorrragend gelegen, so dass die Stadt problemlos zu Fuß zu erkunden ist. Leider entspricht der Standard der Wohnung nicht den veröffentlichten Bildern und wir waren sehr überrascht über die hervorrageden Bewertungen dieser Wohnung!!! Die Wohnung war nicht nur alt, sondern insgesamt schmutzig und schmuddelig. Erreicht werden konnte sie über ein völlig verschmutztes Treppenhaus. Die Einrichtung war teilweise kaputt, es fehlte an allen Grundlagen, die eine Wohnung benötigt: keine Kaffeemaschine, kein Wasserkocher, kein einziges Glas im Schrank! Wasser stand nach kurzem Duschen in der Wanne, zugige Fenster, dauerhaft piepender Rauchmelder im Treppenhaus.  Handtücher alt und verfärbt."
6742905,52041982,2015-10-26,35855345,David,"Neighborhood was fantastic. Close to T stations, wholefoods, CVS, starbucks, post office and many stores. The neighborhood is great too as it is near Beacon Hill and we were able to walk to TD garden, Farmer's market within perhaps 20-30 min. Banks were around as well if needed. Close by charles river for a great sunset view. Sean was nice in giving us instructions on getting in and checking out."
6742905,52560645,2015-10-30,22814905,Alex,Sean's instructions were very thorough and easy to follow which made finding and getting in to the place very straightforward. The apartment was small for three but the location was fantastic and within walking distance of city centre attractions. It's real upshot is the convenience of the location.
6742905,52695388,2015-11-01,24186878,Stephan,"The location if the appartment is perfect. Bakery, Starbucks, Liquore Store, Restaurants, Take aways are all around the corner. Boston Common is just a short walk away. Sean provided us with clear and detailed information to enter the appartment. The appartment itself is pretty small and not in best shape. But for one night, it suffied."
6742905,52850413,2015-11-02,44767872,Scott,We stayed at Sean's place this past Halloween night. The room was clean and what we expected. Beacon Hill had a lot of activity Saturday night so the stay was fun. How to get into the keys was a little of a treasure hunt which was fitting for Halloween. We plan on using his place again next time we are in town. Highly recommend for the money
6742905,53462841,2015-11-09,32783789,Shane,Our stay was good.  The location of this condo was ideal right in the heart of Beacon Hill.  From here you can walk just about anywhere you would want in Boston area and even in other areas like Cambridge.  It is steps from the start of the freedom trail if you intend to walk this trail.  I will say the room was accommodating but you are paying for the location not the quality of the room or softness of the bed.  I would stay here again and again just know the location is the charm.

6742905,53952591,2015-11-15,30756041,Jeremy,"Excellent host. Very well organised and great communication. If you are looking for a basic accommodation in a perfect location, you can be assure that you can explore Boston on foot. Starbucks nearby etc... TD garden to watch the NBA, Boston commons. I even walk to Newburry street. Perfect"
6742905,54320986,2015-11-18,2106756,Raina,We had a great one night stay at Sean's place. It was in a good location and safe neighbourhood. Everything was within walking distance. I would stay here again.
6742905,54435899,2015-11-20,43716500,Kirsten,"I was in town for a few nights with my boyfriend, we loved the place! I'd say the studio is the perfect size for 1-2 people, although I noticed there is a pull out mattress so there is the potential for more. The location cannot be beat - we loved being able to stay right in the middle of Beacon Hill. All of the 'major sites' were within walking distance or easily reached on the nearby subway. Sean was very nice - he let us drop off our bags early which was very helpful. He also sent detailed instructions for how to get there from the airport, which we also appreciated. It was clean and had everything we needed. If there was one downside, it would be that the noise from the street could get a little loud in the room, but it didn't bother us too much and that's just par for the course if you want to stay in an older part of town like we did (walls are thinner haha). Overall, we loved our stay and would stay again."
6742905,55611956,2015-12-03,42928957,Thea Marie,Staying at Seans apartment was really nice and pretty easy for us cause we could pick up the keys when ever we wanted and bring them back as easy as we got them.
The apartment is based in a lovely neighbourhood with easy access to the freedom trail and the most lovely shopping street. The apartment was small but perfect for two,"there's nothing you need more. If I come back to Boston I'd try to stay there again. \"",,,,
6742905,56179526,2015-12-10,27131098,Nancy,"Sean was easy to work with and the location couldn't have been better. While the important features (bed, sink) seemed clean, the rest of the space is in need of a serious deep clean. I would have paid more for a cleaner space, but considering the location, the price is good."
6742905,56263228,2015-12-11,19773156,George,"Great place, really convenient for going around Boston. And Sean was very helpful and quick to get back to me whenever I asked anything!"
"Would definitely recommend!\"",,,,,
6742905,56331406,2015-12-12,50172240,Tyler,Sean was geat! Awesome location.
6742905,56489807,2015-12-14,45282480,Daniel,"I had a great experience overall.  Being in this great location definitely made my trip more authentic.  The room had the basic necessities that I needed and was clean, quiet, and comfortable."
6742905,56777642,2015-12-18,21999314,Ignacio,La descripción del anuncio era correcta y Sean aclaró en un mail con las indicaciones para encontrar el departamento que la limpieza se hacía después de llegar y no antes. Esto podría ser un inconveniente para algunas personas pero no es mi caso.
La ubicación del departamento es sin dudas uno de sus mayores atractivos. Está a menos de 5 minutos de la linea roja del metro,en uno de los barrios más lindos de Boston y con todo lo que uno necesite cerca. También hay que señalar que todo en el departamento funciona bien: ducha,cocina,wifi,etc. Por último,el departamento tenía una plancha
6742905,56943599,2015-12-20,48102837,Jonathan,"Sean was easy to contact which allowed us to find our way easily. The apartment was what we expected and the neighbourhood was terrific. This is a great location! We stayed on a Friday night, so there was a bit of noise outside, but not for too long. We had no trouble falling asleep. All-in-all, our stay was very pleasant."
6742905,57212041,2015-12-23,23457845,Jieun,it was good to stay for 3days. location was good and Sean was nice.
6742905,57561019,2015-12-27,36985123,Olivia,I had a great time at Sean's place! It was sunny and perfect for the night. Good location and great price. Getting the keys was easy. I would definitely stay there again!
6742905,58343510,2016-01-02,20118167,Josefina,"it is a small and old apartment, but on a great location. Ideal for one or two people. everything was accessible, even the airport as well as the center of the city. Sean was flexible with our check I and check out times. thanks for everything, we enjoyed our stay"
6742905,59293542,2016-01-09,44012376,Beike,"My stay with Sean was good. To be honest, this apt was old but Sean did a great job to clean this room. Also, the location was in Beacon Hill and it was so convenient to get to almost anywhere. I strongly suggest you guys choose this apt."
6742905,59459098,2016-01-11,29241747,Leonardo,"Nice place, good located, just like the photos. Sean was always available to help."
6742905,59614252,2016-01-12,53633637,Nicole,"Sean was a great host; although we never met in person he provided us with plenty of fresh towels, extra blankets, and a clean apartment. The studio is small, but fine for 1 or 2 people and is in a really convenient and quaint neighborhood. Overall, it was worth it for the money as this price really can't be beat in a city as expensive as Boston."
6742905,59643991,2016-01-13,50754603,Amanda,I had a great experience staying at Sean's apartment. Very easy to find and close to the hopsital I was interviewing with (MGH). The apartment was clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay again on another visit to Boston.
6742905,60602255,2016-01-25,53206123,Ashley,"I want to lead this review off by stating that this studio apartment is in the most amazing location.  Everything that you could possibly need to get to is in walking distance.  If the destination is too far, than the subway stations are very close as well.  Beacon Hill is such an amazing area, and so are the surrounding areas like the North End, Financial District, Waterfront and West End.  We walked everywhere, even during the blizzard.  The accommodations, unfortunately, weren't as amazing.  This is a very old studio with little to no updates.  The pictures Sean had posted definitely make it look nicer than it actually is.  The kitchen, well was not really a kitchen.  Definitely no cooking during your stay.  We used the bathroom when we had to.  Didn't feel comfortable spending a lot of time in there.  Not due to the cleanliness, but again everything was very old.  The entire bathroom is at a slant, but that is nothing that Sean could help.  The bed was either broken or just extremely used, it bowed in the middle and at the foot of the bed.  Sean was very helpful and always responded very quickly if I had questions.  Overall, our trip to Boston was amazing and luckily we did not spend hardly any time in the apartment.  If you are looking for just a place to stay and nothing else and could care less about the accommodations, than this is your place."
6742905,60894444,2016-01-29,52585158,Nathaniel,"Couldn't have asked for a better location for my first time in Boston. The place was fine, nothing to write home about. But It'd be hard to find a location better than this one."
6742905,61015347,2016-01-30,8032541,Nanue,The studio was in a very good location and Sean was really nice and welcoming
6742905,61553376,2016-02-06,2955449,Hilleke,"Location was great, right in the middle if beacon hill with everything you need closeby. Sean was easy to communicate with and the check in/out process was easy. The building is old which comes with some issues like draft and noisiness but that didn't effect our stay. We had a great time in boston!"
6742905,61676776,2016-02-07,16436479,Cathy,Our communication with the host was by email/text.  There was no personal check in.
Access to the room was by a lock box on a sidewalk railing around the corner from the room itself.,,,,,
Entering the room,we saw dishes piled up on a drying rack and dirty standing water in the kitchen sink that was plugged off.  Opening the door under the sink (which had a broken hinge) we saw a plunger.,,,,
The bed was pushed over against an old electric wall heater that is located below the window.  The bed frame was supported on the window side of the bed by a gallon can of paint wit(URL HIDDEN)on top.,,,,,
The mattress itself had a fitted sheet but no top sheet.  There was a  thin duvet (comforter) and no additional bedding provided.  There was a single bath towel and hand towel.,,,,,
The general state of this place was such that we (my husband; a sewer plant electrician,and I) immediately booked a room at the Holiday Inn Express in Cambridge and for a $7.00 Uber ride and $10 more than for this room,we were rescued.,,,
"As we left the room we tossed the keys back into the room through the 1/2 inch gap between the top of the door and the door frame.\"",,,,,
6742905,62721511,2016-02-16,54343558,Lauren,"Very nice location, very close to the subway and a decent can ride to the airport. Definetly an older place so don't expect luxury but still nice and well represented in the photos. Beware of steep and twisting stairs with large luggage. Overall quite happy with out stay, very easy to get into and amazing location in Boston for a great price."
6742905,62980107,2016-02-19,53459979,Cindy,Location was a big bonus to this place.
The room wasn't the cleanest but was good enough to feel comfortable living in it.,,,,,
Sean was helpful to provide us with some local eateries when we arrived so thank you!,,,,,

6742905,63103789,2016-02-20,33823152,Marianne,Thank you Sean for our stay in your very traveler-friendly home ! It is very comfortable and not far away from the park and the center :)
6742905,63580010,2016-02-24,7504787,Joseph,Nice residential neighborhood close to transportation. The apartment had everything I needed and was clean and easy to get in/out.
6742905,63670344,2016-02-25,51346614,Titania,"Sean was great, friendly & informative."
6742905,63741606,2016-02-26,14734926,Pik Yuk,"Hm...it was small room which is fulfilled your basic needs.The room is inside the old buildings,don't have any expectations for the room,you definitely with disappointed!one night is enough!Btw The location is not far from subway,but if you visiting Boston with few person,you can take Uber install of subway,the price was much cheaper,and the location is not important anymore!"
6742905,64205122,2016-03-01,49303908,Paul,"Excellent location and great value for the price.  The studio apt was a bit worn and could use updating.   Felt like a college dorm, but this is reflected in the room rate."
6742905,64857321,2016-03-08,58523949,畅,It is a small one but it is very convenient to go out!
6742905,65252212,2016-03-12,59479351,Courtney,Good location. Inexpensive place to lay your head. Sean was fast and easy to communicate with.
6742905,65497981,2016-03-15,5254070,Jaclyn,"This apartment is very conveniently located. The pictures are deceiving though, and is much smaller than anticipated. It is one room approximately the size of a master bedroom, which contained the kitchen, desk/dining table, full bed and twin trundle. There was hardly any room to walk when trundle was out. No HVAC system was present, but luckily we were able to sleep with the windows open, and there was not too much road noise/pedestrian traffic at night. There was very little comfort, including limited linens, dirty floors and walls, 1 roll of single ply and well-worn towels. The host did accommodate us by purchasing a wine bottle opener and giving excellent directions from the airport. We did try and check out a little late, or leave our bags until our afternoon flight, but the host was unable to assist us with that request (possibly due to the high traffic through this bnb), so we had to tromp around Boston with our luggage. So if you bring your own toilet paper, stick to the check-out time, and plan on disinfecting, this is a perfect little dorm away from home. The location and vibe was perfect and we would have not wanted it any other way."
6742905,66024369,2016-03-19,38166213,Laurie,"Before I start this review, I have some notes for the owner/landlord: 1. Make (and follow) a cleaning checklist for yourself that is used after each tenant departs. This checklist should include: *Change out all linens and replace with clean, fresh, linens (including mattress pads). All pillows and down/faux down comforters should have fresh/clean covers. Replace towels with clean/fresh towels that are in good condition and free of rips/tears/frays. *Wash all dirty dishes, dry them, and place them away neatly in the cabinets. Wipe down all surfaces with an antibacterial cleaner. *Check for trash and remove all trash from apartment (includes looking inside the bathroom medicine cabinet and refrigerator). *Dust all surfaces (including window sills, table, cubby/shelves. *Scrub shower and toilet (Mr. Clean bathroom magic eraser works well for the tub). Also wipe down walls and sink with a bathroom cleaner (and ceiling if necessary). *vacuum all floors and follow with mop or Swiffer mop. *shampoo area rug every month. Vacuum after every tenant. *check bed frame for needed repairs. Repair (professionally) as needed, before renting to a new tenant. Check mattresses for stains/wear & tear and replace as needed. *Check all areas of apartment for needed repairs and repair as necessary. Upon arrival, it was easy to find and open the lockbox. Apparently the address is no longer on Irving St. The key wouldn't work, so I had to call Sean. He said the new address should have been emailed to me, but it wasn't. The new apartment is just around the corner though and easy to find. The entry from the street was easy to find and enter. After going up to flights of stairs (no elevator, beware if you have a lot of luggage), we made it to our door (#6). Entry was no problem, but locking it from the inside and outside was hard and took a lot of effort to get the door just right so it would lock. Sean thought we were arriving later than we did, so he said he was on the way to change/do the laundry. When we walked in, the previous tenants bedding was on the bed, and trash was under the sink area. We were hungry anyway so we dropped our luggage and went to find dinner. When we arrived at the apartment a couple hours later, fresh bedding was on the queen bed, but the twin bed underneath was only covered by a mattress pad. Upon sitting on the queen bed, it made a horrible creaking noise every time we moved even an inch. Upon further inspection, we found a paint can supporting the bed frame as well as broken slats underneath the mattress. It also sounds like there is a hard plastic cover on the mattress. I looked for a sheet to cover the twin mattress, but the only thing I found was an uncovered faux down blanket. I text Sean to ask about the sheet, and after 15 minutes of no response, I called him. He..."

6742905,66875751,2016-03-25,53171138,Lorenz,Sean's apartment is in the best location in Boston! You can walk everywhere and it is absolutely safe!
Sean provides loads of city guides and the kitchen is equipped with all you need for a few days.,,,,,
The bed is the loudest in the whole city but it's comfy enough.,,,,,
Sean is a great host and he replies immediately to messages! Thank you,"we would come back \"",,,,
6742905,68981289,2016-04-08,41692052,Lisa,The best thing about this apartment is the location. It's central to a lot of great sights! On a cute street and in a safe area. The bed is very ordinary and there's not much to the place but it's tidy enough and was suitable for a short stay. Sean is great and fast with communicating and when there was no hair dryer in the place he quickly brought one over. Thanks for having us!
6742905,69078857,2016-04-09,57219001,Patti,"\"Sean was available to let us into our \"\"apartment\"\" despite our late arrival due to a very long wait to deplane.  He settled us in on the 1st floor as we were dismayed at having to carry our luggage up the steep stairs to the 3rd floor.  The bed was comfortable"
6742905,70699625,2016-04-19,46389612,Jeremy,"Apartment is in an excellent location for Boston visitors that want to see/walk to as much as possible - which is the category my wife and I were in for this stay. Sean was great at communicating with us ahead of the trip and also gave us suggestions on nearby sights and some parking advice when we arrived. Free parking for visitors in the Beacon Hill neighborhood was very limited and difficult - the difficulty being compounded by the fact that it was Boston Marathon weekend. The apartment was a little smaller than we expected, but served us well as a good home base with essentially everything we needed. Check-in and check-out were easy, the space was clean, and the neighborhood was safe."
6742905,70723880,2016-04-20,35542772,Freek,"Sean heb ik niet ontmoet. We hebben enkel contact gehad voordat ik arriveerde. De procedure van het arriveren heeft hij duidelijk beschreven, toch bleek dat de woning niet op Irving st is, maar Philips st. Dit vond ik een beetje raar."
6742905,70953921,2016-04-22,46372287,Lilian,La ubicación muy buena.
La comunicación con el anfitrión y acceso correcta,a pesar que tuvimos que subir dos piso por escalera con el equipaje.,,,,
"Faltaban detalles de presentación para sentirnos completamente cómodos.\"",,,,,
6742905,71180368,2016-04-24,43307209,Agustina,"Si bien no hemos tenido la posibilidad de conocer en persona a Sean, él ha sido muy claro con las instrucciones y siempre ha contestado rapidísimos nuestros mensajes. El departamento esta ubicado en un lugar estratégico, el barrio es hermoso, y muy seguro. Solo hemos dormido en el departamento ya que durante el día estábamos recorriendo."
6742905,71988168,2016-04-30,9372588,Mariana,"Sean was very disposed and helpful with everything we need, he also let us leave our lugagge on the basement until the end of the day. The apartment is in the best location. You can go walking everywhere, its in the middle of the city in an amazing neighborhood. Its not big and not luxury but ideal if you go for a couple of days"
6742905,72533309,2016-05-03,44934707,Victoria,"Sean appartment it's great. The location is eveything, near all the important things and the neighborhood is so beautiful and quiet. The place is small, for one tops two persons, and is also ok, good bed, good bathroom, good kitchen. I did not have the chance to meet Sean in person but he was really helpful all the time."
6742905,73079027,2016-05-06,38854599,Charles,"Great experience! Instructions were clear and place was cosy, clean and tidy. Would definitely stay again :)"
6742905,73149626,2016-05-07,15515604,Deo,"This place was perfectly located for a night in the city. I got to stay out late, then it was an easy ride to get to the house. Sean was very responsive and helpful throughout the stay."
6742905,73721188,2016-05-09,694582,Kelly,"Definitely the best location in Boston, but the space is small and could use some updating."
6742905,73776215,2016-05-10,47143853,Daniela,We didnt meet with Sean. The apartment was fine and it has good location. At begining had been misunderstanding about check out time but had willingness to resolve.
6742905,74100854,2016-05-13,44330323,Gustavo,El departamento estaba limpio y tal cual se ve en las fotos. Causa un poco de impresion el desnivel del piso pero no genera inconvenientes y te acostumbras rápido. El barrio es verdaderamente hermoso. Todo salió de acuerdo a lo planeado.

6742905,74526586,2016-05-15,24987966,Erin,"Location was great, walking distance to everything. We strolled down to Charles St, Boston Common and even walked to the North End during our visit. The building is an older building, as to be expected in Beacon Hill, but it was comfortable and had the amenities you would need. One nice touch would be a fan, we were there in the spring and though it wasn't quite summertime hot, it was a bit muggy and some air movement in the apartment would have been nice."
6742905,74841397,2016-05-17,71669075,Westin,"Excellent communication before arriving and very understanding of my situation. Loved the location of the studio, a quick walk to everything."
I was disappointed in the bed,it was as hard as a rock and seriously contemplated moving to the rug on the floor. Other than that,"it was an awesome little place!\"",,,
6742905,75309751,2016-05-20,21851579,Haleigh,"The apartment is in the typical old downtown Bostonian style. It is small, quaint, and older but functional. Great location. Do not expect a luxury apartment, this place is all about functionality. It's a good place for a young couple on a budget. Better not pack bags too heavy to haul up a few flights of stairs :)"
6742905,75401994,2016-05-21,56862172,Jessica,"This apartment is definitely in a great area of Boston's Beacon Hill neighborhood. We loved being able to walk out the door and find ourselves instantly immersed in Boston's history and current culture. It's location is definitely a huge plus. However, the space itself just barely met our expectations based on the pictures. Simply put, if your priority is to be out and about in Boston and you just need a place to crash, this place works well. Directions for checking- in and out were clear, smooth and flexible!"
6742905,77547533,2016-06-01,43794474,Lorena,"El departamento en el que alojamos no era este que es el que habiamos reservado, sino otro que tiene tambien publicado por la zona. El cambio se realizó sin que se nos consultará, solo se nos notificó; pero bueno, era una noche y decidi no discutir."
Estaba bien para 1 noche o una estadia muy corta,no más tiempo.,,,,
Si bien debía haber elementos básicos tal como dice la publicación,eramos 2 huespedes pero sólo había un único toallón para ambos y ninguna toalla de mano; y la limpieza del baño era un tanto deficiente.,,,,
Si bien Sean demoró en responder nuestras consultas y lo conocimos sólo por casualidad,las indicaciones para entrar en el depto fueron claras y concisas y en tiempo y forma.,,,,
Ahora bien,siendo el check out al mediodía uno entiende que estando el departamento ocupado el propietario se encarga de avisarle a los huespedes que siguen que no pueden ingresar antes o que al menos irá a verificar si uno ya se retiró para poder adelantar el check in de los que siguen; pero no... No eran ni las 11am cuando  alguien empezaba a abrir la puerta del departamento,al pedir que aguarden porque nos estabamos vistiendo y salir a verificar eran los huespedes que seguian entrando en el departamento sin que nosotros nos hubiesemos ido aún.,,,
No es culpa ni responsabilidad de ellos,que les explicamos la situación y les pedimos que esperaran afuera mientras nos apurabamos para poder irnos antes ya que la situación se habia vuelto incomoda con gente desconocida llena de valijas esperando del otro lado de la puerta. Nos pareció desorganizado y una falta de respeto para nosotros y para ellos tambien por parte del propietario.,,,,
Nosotros nos fuimos pidiendoles disculpas (como si fuera nuestra culpa!) porque logicamente el departamento no iba a estar ni limpio ni con toallas porque no habia mas que una y la habiamos usado.,,,,,
Esperamos unos días a ver si el dueño nos contactaba para pedirnos disculpas por lo ocurrido,pero no,"no supimos mas nada de él.\"",,,
6742905,78444892,2016-06-06,19526024,Ashley,The location is perfect. Very clear check in and out email.
6742905,80377518,2016-06-17,2930153,Ruben,"La ubicación del apartamento es muy buena, en un barrio típico y muy bonito de Boston y cerca de todo, pero nuestra experiencia con el apartamento de Sean fue muy mala."
El fue muy claro en su explicación de como llegar al apartamento y de como retirar la llave de un locker a la vuelta de la esquina.,,,,,
Nunca hubo contacto personal con Sean,solo por mail,es lógico ya que si lo hubiéramos visto personalmente nos hubiéramos quejado. La primera desilusión fue al entrar al edificio,el apartamento en un tercer piso con escalera angosta,alfombrada y muy sucia. Las fotos del apartamento son viejas y no muestran su estado actual que es muy malo. En las fotos se ve un apartamento pequeño,sencillo pero aceptable por el precio y nos equivocamos
El closet esta ocupado por maderas viejas,lata de pinturas,persiana rota y cama desarmada por lo cual nuestra ropa quedo en las maletas. Una de las ventanas no tiene la persiana americana (en la foto ventana izquierda). Paredes y techo desparejos y mal pintados. Puerta del bajo mesada rota,el piso del baño desnivelado y con baldosas flojas,faltaba una toalla de mano,que reclamamos a Sean y nunca trajo. En la cama había una sola sabana  y un edredon (que no sabemos si estaba limpio) En la heladera comida vieja y vencida
Lo único bueno es la ducha con abundante caudal de agua y temperatura.,,,,,

6742905,81386333,2016-06-22,13278282,Eva,The apt is located in a good area and the size is okay for two people. There are a lot of restaurants near the apt and there are tourist attractions near. The apt is located on the third floor.
6742905,82601243,2016-06-28,76188391,Howard,The place was very nice.  It was very good for the one night stay.  Air conditioning was available which makes all the difference for me.
The third floor walk walk up may be a little tedious for older or heavier folks as the stairway is a tight spiral design.,,,,,
"A note about parking.  Because I was driving I had my own vehicle and needed to find parking for an SUV type vehicle.  This is very challenging on the city streets of Boston.  I was unaware of some the options to park on the street and should have been more proactive in communicating with the host.  As a result I paid $48 for city garage parking.\"",,,,,
6742905,83026780,2016-06-30,38924283,Sarah,The apartment is really conveniently situated and Sean was really helpful about all the arrangements. Be careful with the hot water - it was occasionally much too hot! We really enjoyed our stay - thanks Sean!
6742905,83343695,2016-07-02,58892657,Alessa,"Nice and cosy studio apartment that did the job for our two night stay. It was easy to find the apartment and to get the keys. The neighbourhood is beautiful day and night and we felt safe coming home late. The studio itself was spacious for us (two people), as we only came for sleeping and did not cook there. We came early to leave our luggage there and met Sean for a small and friendly chat, while he was doing up the apartment. When we came back later, he had the apartment cleaned and prepared for us. An AC helped us through the hot and stuffy July nights in Boston. All in all it was a great stay."
6742905,83904887,2016-07-04,16646596,Theresa,We appreciated the very thorough communication from our host. It was very easy to access and directions were very clear.

6742905,86234891,2016-07-15,8327675,Kaitlin,"Sean was a great host. He sent detailed instructions on how to get to the place and provided all of the information we needed so I never had to bother him during our stay. We were only in Boston for one day so we really only used the room for sleeping and showering, which it was perfect for. It's a simple place but it'll do the trick if you just need somewhere to lay your head at night. The bed is on the hard side but it was fine for a couple of nights. The Beacon Hill neighborhood is absolutely adorable and very walkable - I'm sure other airbnbs in the area are much more expensive than this one."

6742905,87210549,2016-07-19,69441848,Brad,"Sean's listing is a place to rest your head for the night, no more, no less. You're paying for a great location in Beacon Hill, close to great pubs, shops, and Boston Common. Street parking is near impossible to find (we watched as cars got towed, and were yelled at by locals while stopped in front of the apartment to unload our luggage). As a result, we had to pay $48 to park at the hotel down the street. A 15 minute walk will find you cheaper parking, but not by much. Sean communicated well (we didn't meet him in person), and his instructions on getting into the unit were very clear."
6742905,87407574,2016-07-20,15644243,Meg,"Sean's directions to the unit and instructions for entering were super helpful, we found it no problem. The place had everything promised and is in an absolutely ideal location. Perfect for a couple who isn't looking to spend much time in the apartment."
The unit is quite small,and is a 3rd floor walkup. The bathroom was a little dingy and the place felt a little disorganized,"but it got the job done for a one night stay in the city.  \"",,,

It made our walk on the Freedom Trail feel even more authentic.   Sean is very clear in his instructions on how to get there on any of the T stops around, and he also understands the accommodations a family needs with a big fridge, toaster oven, microwave, and Starbucks is a block away.

8439372,52156656,2015-10-26,40869688,Alexis,"The Blackstone Williams group was very great at communicating about arrival. They even accommodated our early arrival as their check-in was not until 4pm but we were arriving at noon. We had one hiccup at the beginning because our key was not in the lock box, but Michelle at BW answered by call right away and was there in 10 minutes to let us in."
The apartment was spotless,and the furniture/kitchen supplies were very intuitive to our needs. There were many items that were nice to have around like body wash,Keurig (with K cups),and ironing board.,,
"The only complaints we have were the lack of mirrors in the bedrooms (which was a hassle with three female guests sharing the bathroom) and the bathroom door handle. Multiple times we got \"\"stuck\"\" in the bathroom because the door knob was broken!",,,,,
All in all,we would recommend this apartment to anyone! My mother was very hesitant to use airbnb because it was her first time,"but because of this great apartment/experience she is already planning her next trip!\"",,,

Neighbors are good and the Fenway park is just across the the Park Drive. It has the wonderful location and lovely apartment. I would recommend this apartment to anyone who can see this post.

The apartment itself was also very nice, everything that's needed was there, everything was very clean. The exchange of keys went without any problems, and our host Michelle always responded quickly and was very helpful in all aspect. One example is that it became quite cold in Boston during our stay and we ask Michelle if it would be possible to get thicker blankets which she immediately brought to the apartment the next day."
We stayed there with three people and we also appreciated the fact that we could all have 'separate' bedrooms (the master bedroom,the second bedroom and the sleeping sofa in the living room).,,,,

L'hôte s'est montrée très disponible et a répondu très rapidement à un problème d'eau chaude et de température de l'appartement. Le lendemain, tout était réglé. Le seul problème que nous avons rencontré et qui a été ennuyant durant notre séjour était l'absence de place de parking.

8439372,60616703,2016-01-25,295298,Miriam,"In many ways, this was the nicest Airbnb place we've stayed at. The apartment was spotless, nicely decorated, and in a super location. The beds were amazingly comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed. I agree that the place needs a full length mirror or two. Also, it's not super bright except in the bedrooms, but that was not a big issue. We had a few glitches (bathroom heater, key malfunction) but Tony/Michelle were quick to respond to and resolve them. We appreciated having more than one set of keys so we could split up. Finally, being from DC, we got stuck in Boston and couldn't get home because of the big snow storm. Tony/Michelle were understanding and helpful, going  above and beyond so we could add a few days onto our trip until we could get home. In short, a great stay!"

It is located right across from a park which was really nice and a short walk to public transportation such as the T and buses. It's also a short walk to grocery stores and lots of bars along Boylston St! Michelle, the apartment manager was really easy to contact and organized everything perfectly. The apartment is professionally cleaned before you arrive so it is spotless!"
8439372,65152611,2016-03-11,17616511,Mayra,This was a great place. It had plenty of room for all of us to sleep and a great little kitchen that had everything we needed. The area was very safe at all hours of the day. We came and went and there were always people coming and going in the area. The area had everything we wanted and more. There were suggestions at the apartment about where to go for different things and they were all within walking distance. The tram was really close by and was a short ride away from downtown Boston. I would definitely recommend staying here for all it has to offer.

The  arrival/access was easy with the lockbox at the door to the building which Michelle provided details for on the morning of. As described in another review there were 2.5 flights of stairs to climb with luggage which wasn't a big deal for us. The apartment was spotless. Both bedrooms are sizeable, with plenty of room for suitcase storage and clothes in the dresser/closet. The beds, including the living room sofa/bed, are very comfortable. We all had very good sleeps. Noise was not an issue (from inside the building or outside). The bathroom is tiny but totally adequate. Great bathtub (important when travelling wit(URL HIDDEN)yr old!), lots of towels. Kitchen was likewise small but perfect--even had a little dishwasher which was a surprise. The apartment has character and is well maintained. The walls in the hallway have been recently painted. The location was great--about a 15-20min walk to the subway with kids, with a great playground about 10min away. Grocery store was less than 10min walk. It was nice to get a feel for a residential area rather than the hotel district. We were here for the marathon and could easily walk to the expo at the convention centre, and home after the race. I would recommend this place for sure."

8439372,92424954,2016-08-08,67146231,Lital,"The host did everything in their power to help with the baggage lost that we had due to the airline. The place was clean and tidy. The area was nice, next to a park and stores, the main road is half a minute walk or just use UBER BOSTON to get anywhere cheap and easy."
8439372,93879175,2016-08-14,54908327,Mitchell,Place was great.
8439372,95791591,2016-08-21,68406311,Fawn,"Tony and his assistant, Michelle were super fast in responding to our messages and providing check in information.  The building lost hot water while we were there, and Tony's quick call to maintenance had it fixed before we returned in the afternoon- very much appreciated!  Having each bedroom have it's own air conditioning unit was perfect since we never agree on the perfect temp.  It was super hot in Boston while we were there and those two air units were key to our successful college tour trip!  Our flight out wasn't until the evening and Tony let us leave our bags at the apartment after check out which saved us lugging them around Boston all day- also very much appreciated!"
"Thanks!\"",,,,,
8439372,97197487,2016-08-26,4607014,Sam,Perfectly situated with access to all the necessities in walking distance. The apartment was in great shape and tony and Michelle were accessible. We had a perfect stay. // Sam
8439372,98094528,2016-08-29,24984107,Haley,"We had a fantastic stay - there were a few hiccups with the apartment (Keurig was broken and a doorknob was loose), but Michelle/Tony made sure things were fixed as soon as possible for us! The location is perfect - walking distance to parks, restaurants, coffee, etc., and an easy $7-$10 Uber to most anywhere else. Highly recommend. We would stay here again!"
7933149,45621986,2015-09-04,29863954,Susan,"Excellent space, thank you.  I will comfortably rent any of Brent's places ... immaculate and really great location.  The furnishings are of nice quality and bed/pillows comfortable.  His descriptions and accurate and very transparent.  He had information to help figure out the area, many things that were a nice surprise. The space exceeded my expectations.   I spend 2 weeks a month in Boston and will likely be staying in his spaces on regular basis.  Thank you."
7933149,50763483,2015-10-14,40811539,Matthew,"The listing is extremely accurate.  My girlfriend and I really enjoyed the room and overall building.  The room is private, extremely clean, almost hotel style.  Sharing bathrooms was never a problem, since there is two on each floor.  If you were in a pinch, there's four other bathrooms.  The kitchen is well stocked for what you need, and the living room area is a nice place to hang out and meet the others if they're around.  The neighborhood is perfect because the Red Line is right across the street and used for almost every connection.  The diner down the street serves great and cheap breakfast ($6 for a full breakfast).  Starbucks right across the street for instant coffee fix.  Neighborhood is clean and safe.  A few subway stops from Boston's main attractions.  Would recommend all my friends to stay here."
7933149,51544666,2015-10-21,1501777,Lisa,The place was perfect for what we needed. Clean and in a great location. Would definitely stay again. Great value for the price.
7933149,52486645,2015-10-30,1498871,Taylor,Brent and the team at Short Term Rental Boston had clear communication and provided all the details I needed for a seamless check-in process.
The room was clean,and as described/pictured in the profile. The shared lounge,kitchen,and bathrooms were clean and easily accessible.,,
"The location in Southie was excellent. Close to public transportation and within walking distance to a number of restaurants.\"",,,,,
7933149,53117418,2015-11-05,13573484,Ellen,The building was easy to find and in a very convenient location across the street from the Broadway subway station and walking distance to the Boston Convention Center.  The neighborhood is lively with lots of great restaurants.
The room was small - just big enough for a comfortable queen bed,a desk and a closet - but very clean with quality bedding.  The two shared bathrooms across the hall were spotless and stocked with wall mounted shampoo,body wash and conditioner. The wifi was easy to use with a strong signal.,,,
"I did not get upstairs to the kitchen or \"\"public\"\" rooms.",,,,,
All in all,"a good value.\"",,,,
7933149,54339194,2015-11-18,24235743,Aj,"This hostel-like hotel was exactly how it's promoted; clean beds & linens, and clean washrooms for our use. The room itself is small for two people, we didn't have much space to walk around the bed or do anything else except lie down on the bed. Not all rooms are the same size, some are definitely bigger than others (I got to see others from others staying there)."
The kitchen,and lounge area were perfect. Although we didn't cook,you can bring your groceries and cook your meals there no problem. The lounge TV had full cable access and Netflix available (with your own account).,,,
The location of this place is by far the best thing about it. We were right across 'Broadway' station on the red line so we were close to everything. If the weather is right,you could even walk it to some of the major tourist attractions like we did.,,,,
I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a cheaper alternative to hotels in downtown Boston,you'll get way more bang for your buck. If you're looking for privacy,you won't get much more than the room itself which should be enough for most,but that's your call.,,
"I wouldn't hesitate to book here again. \"",,,,,
7933149,55156769,2015-11-28,29812391,Le Thu,Neighborhood was great. Room and the whole house was really clean and well decorated. The location was great as well. There was a train station direct in front of the house. In the same street are also Starbucks and other possibilities to get breakfast.

Make sure you can access internet. The room was clean and looked new, including shared bathroom. This is the best bathroom during my stay in USA. Very clean and large (although bedroom is a bit smaller than what I saw int he picture). The only bad thing is that there is no elevator and I had to lift 30-kg luggage upto the 4th floor!!"

Eric was very helpful and answered all my questions immediately.,,,,,
The apartment is brand new,very nicely furnished and absolutely spotless.,,,,
When we got to the building the man at the concierge help us with the check in process.,,,,,
We had a car and were able to reserve a parking spot in the basement level of the building which was very convenient.,,,,,
The apartment has all the comfort of a high end hotel. There is a laundry room on the roof top which is free and on the same level there are 2 outdoor areas with seating.,,,,,
The neighborhood is very nice to walk around and there are plenty of shops and restaurants.,,,,,
We are very satisfied with the place and the location.,,,,,
I would recommend Eric's place without hesitation.,,,,,

He was very courteous in welcoming me and was very professional in the way he dealt with things. The apartment is very clean and functional, and he makes sure to maintain it well. The one great thing that I liked, is that he really makes sure that the guests have their privacy. Amenities as well as public transport were all close by. It was very easy to reach him at any time in the day and he promptly replies to texts/calls. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is in Boston for an extended stay and wants a  great place for a very reasonable price!"
8962914,61982369,2016-02-10,7653399,Paula,"Emmanuel was a very nice and considerate host. He was always available whenever I had a question and very generous with the apartment. A friend of mine could stay for a few nights with me (for a small fee of course) without any problems. The neighborhood is sweet and well connected to the Green Line trains downtown and busses to Cambridge etc. Grocery stores and a laundromat are just around the corner, as well as some restaurants. The house was quiet and the apartment spacious enough for two people for a full month. I can only recommend staying at Emmanuel's house."
8962914,75429534,2016-05-21,46686141,Luna,Emmanuel and his wife are both lovely! I've had a great almost 3 months stay! The apartment is nice and the room is better than on the web (there is a real and comfy bed!) and it's very close to public transport. Highly recommended for people visiting Boston College but also good connections for Harvard and Boston University.

Also there's a convenience store across the street, you can get almost everything you need during the staying. The room is just like what you see in the picture. I like it a lot because there is some extra space in the room for traveler like me to put/pack my luggage. If you are looking for a place to stay near the airport this is a good choice!"

She was also very accommodating of our check in and check out times.  The place was really awesome.  Just a few mins walk to the convention centre and the westin hotel.  It was also perfectly located,  just a few steps in the other direction, to the Boston downtown and south station.  There were so many good food around.   Grocery shopping was just a little far (c mart is about 15-20mins away.  Only accepts card for orders above $5.).

The neighborhood is peaceful and largely residential, but within a five-minute walk to the village center with a variety of eclectic shops and restaurants.  I couldn't have asked for a more gracious host than Rebecca.  She is so easy to talk to and super accommodating."

She waited for me very late until I finally got to her place. The room is very clean, just like the picture posted, and bigger than I expected. It is very convenient to take a bus to the subway from the house and it only took me 2 min walk to the bus station. The neighborhood is quite and clean.

Rebecca is great with babies and our little guy loved interacting with her. The room was very comfortable, sunny, and spacious enough to fit us, our son's Pack 'n Play, and all the luggage that comes with traveling with a baby. Our one regret was that we couldn't stay longer!"
1810172,32608688,2015-05-19,32774158,Susan,"Rebecca was very hospitable both in our initial email communications and during our stay.  We were away from the house most of our stay and therefore did not need many of the amenities that she graciously offered (e.g. coffee, tea, relaxing in her yard, etc.).  We loved being in Roslindale close to our family and close to the lovely Village of Roslindale, and close to the Arboretum.  The neighborhood where Rebecca lives was quiet and felt very safe. The free street parking was a real plus as was finding a pet friendly place to stay.  We were the only guests at Rebecca's except for our last night there, so we only had to share the use of the bathroom that one night.  This was not a problem since we never saw the other guest, but I would have felt more comfortable if there was a lock on the bathroom door. The house is one of those old Boston homes from the early 1900's which generally require some repairs to the lath plaster, but are also filled with unique historical charm.  We are very thankful to Rebecca for her kindness and hospitality and for giving us a good first experience with airbnb!"

It was a quiet and peaceful place to live. Her house is nice and clean. We finally had a good sleep after few days' hostel life in New York. She has a lovely garden and cats. And actually I think it's convenience to get to the city center from her house. Many thanks to Rebecca. She is a person with real warm heart inside.
1810172,33953702,2015-06-02,33870569,Jaye,"Rebecca's house was welcoming and homey, and it was a great place to relax and recharge. Rebecca was very friendly and easy to talk to, and her two cats are the cutest most friendliest cats ever. The room is exactly as pictured and very comfortable; and I found the commute to Boston to be short and easy (I commuted to downtown crossing which is near the Boston Common). It was my first time using airbnb and it was a great experience. Thanks Rebecca!"
1810172,37568837,2015-07-08,15847654,Adam,"My son and I stayed at Rebecca’s home for 4 weeks. I worked out of the house, while my son was doing an internship in Boston. All I needed was provided: a stable Internet connection and a quite place with a desk that I could use. In short, Rebecca is a gracious host and wonderful human being who will give you as much personal space as you need. If you are looking for a home-away-from-home, an enchanted garden and a good conversation (if you feel like it), this place is for you. I highly recommend staying at Rebecca’s home if you are looking for a place in Boston."
P.S.: There is free parking in front of the house,,,,,
P.S.S.: It is only a 5-minute drive to the Harvard Arboretum,,,,,

1810172,38077177,2015-07-12,6987060,Heather,Rebecca was a very thoughtful and accommodating host; an absolute pleasure! Had a lovely stay. Would definitely book again and recommend to others.
1810172,39866377,2015-07-26,39020967,Sheffin,"The listing description is very accurate. The house was about 30 mins away from the heart of Boston's downtown by public transit. There is also free parking in front of the house. Rebecca was very hospitable, I'd definitely stay there again."
1810172,42011142,2015-08-10,25035363,Siria,"My wife and I stayed 7 days at Rebecca's home and it was lovely. The house was clean and well cared. Our room got a lot of natural light and we had clean sheets and towels during our whole stay. Rebecca's a thoughtful host with whom communication was easy and Roslindale is a story book type of neighborhood, beautiful houses, great neighbors and everything 10-15 minute walking distance. We loved our stay and you will too!"
1810172,59266215,2016-01-08,33943313,Teresa,"This was a great place (I stayed 3 nights, in Jan).  Rebecca was very responsive and easy to work with -- both while arranging the reservation, and while I was staying.  The room is just as described -- though actually feels bigger than appears in photos.  Bed very comfortable.  Very nice to have a desk to work at, and internet.  Appreciated the closet for my clothes, too.  Street parking was plentiful and easy -- right in front of house. Quiet neighborhood.  Rebecca was very welcoming and accommodating, and also sensitive to how much I wanted to interact.  A great place to stay."
1810172,77515930,2016-06-01,39355021,Irena,Rebecca was really great and welcoming! Her place is lovely and has a lot of great public transit options to get into the city.
1810172,80864001,2016-06-20,12801493,Kareem,Rebecca was such a wonderful host. She accommodated our late arrival as we drove from Chicago. Her neighborhood is really nice and relaxed and street parking is just amazing (we had the same spot for almost the three nights we were there).
The room was very comfortable though it was a bit hot for the summer until we discovered the fan in the closet which made the summer heat go away.,,,,,
Her home is pet friendly which we really needed as we brought our two pets with us; a dog and a cat. We did have little bit of Tom and Jerry moment with one of her cats but she was quick to resolve it.,,,,,
"Thanks again for being a super host Rebecca!\"",,,,,

1810172,94436632,2016-08-15,57143028,Ellen,"Rebecca made it easy to feel at home, especially since it was a long stay. There was just the right blend of privacy, sharing of info re new neighborhood etc., and pleasant company. My  small (well-behaved) dog was quite happy too. The room was quite nice and more spacious than it looks in the photo. Location is great, both for driving and public transit, and good dining and groceries are easily accessible. Altogether a lovely stay, even with the record-breaking July/August heat!"
7611271,41688366,2015-08-08,24597659,Jeanne,"I work as part of a family dental sales and service co., so we travel quite often together.  We have used Air BnB several times, and Katie's home has been one of our favorite destinations so far.  The interior design is exquisite, and located in a fantastic neighborhood.  After our business meeting Thursday evening, a couple of us walked to a local Irish Pub and had a night cap.  So much more fun than a cold, over-priced hotel.  There were snacks waiting for us, comfortable/clean beds, and the coolest coffee maker I've ever seen, stocked with whole beans waiting to be ground.  Highly, highly recommend her home."
7611271,42632660,2015-08-14,40470739,Stuart,"Katie, the host was a delight. The organisation of access and greeting notes was first class. Very helpful and hospitable. First class home with high consideration of family needs. Very clean and organised."
7611271,42977251,2015-08-16,16824068,Anne,"The house and the neighborhood are beautiful, and the interior design as well."
All is very clean and same as the pictures !!,,,,,
Katie was very nice with us and very helpful,she left some snacks on the kitchen and some advice.,,,,
the living room and bedrooms are spacious and beds very comfortable.,,,,,
We enjoyed the awesome barbecue!,,,,,
Highly recommend !!,,,,,

7611271,65036979,2016-03-10,24202324,Sergey,"It is very nice place, new and modern. Katie is very helpful and informative. We came for participation in Boston Seafood Expo and enjoyed proximity to Convention Center and all downtown places and quiet neighborhood at the same time. Very highly recommended! Parking can be an issue in South Boston, so better to use Uber or similar services."
7611271,70616242,2016-04-19,1341095,Jeff,"Beautiful home, ideal location, and great communication. The house is very clean and quite spacious. Being in South Boston, it is situated conveniently close enough to both downtown and the airport. It's a great location to stay at if you're in town for the marathon. Katie's home made our trip very enjoyable. Highly recommended!"
7611271,71197282,2016-04-24,50534700,Michael,"Really gorgeous home, everything was very high end. Katie was extremely responsive and helpful. She made us feel very welcome."
7611271,76518908,2016-05-27,21370615,Sparsh,"Katie's house is amazing. My family was visiting Boston for graduation with 2 little kids (3 months, 3 years) and this was a perfect place for them to stay. The house is beautifully and artistically furnished, and lots of toys and a nursery. I would highly recommend this place."
7611271,78172722,2016-06-05,5792452,Jeannie,"Wow, what an experience ! Have rented several Air B&Bs and this was definitely above all the rest. Katie was informative, accommodating and most of all helpful in making our experience in and out of her home a wonderful one. The neighborhood is great and gave us a great feel for South Boston. Everything is accessible from this great location (the beach, stores, restaurants, bars, etc.) This is a full service experience while giving is a local feel. We all enjoyed. House was perfect for a group of us and we did not want for anything. Thank you, Katie !!"
7611271,81366543,2016-06-22,65967621,Eric,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and I have to say that it has been excellent! Thanks to our host Katie. Her house was very nice and clean, and she made us feel at home once we arrived. She helped us with whatever we needed and requested. I would highly recommend this house to anyone looking for a beautiful home to stay in South Boston!"
7611271,92396466,2016-08-08,55823039,Kristina,We had an amazing experience! The house was beautiful and was a perfect location for us to come back to after venturing in the city all day. The house was fully equipped with everything we needed and had plenty of space for the 5 of us. Katie was a great host and always available to answer any questions or recommendations i needed!
7611271,93612242,2016-08-13,1239471,Christine,"Yes, yes and yes!  What a wonderful experience through and through. The description and photos of the home are completely accurate.  Katie was extremely helpful and always available to answer questions.  And the location was perfect for our group as we attended a conference at the Boston Convention Center.  We used Uber to get around (consistently $3.95 to and fro convention center with UberX) and would most definitely recommend that instead of car rental.  Using Instacart for grocery delivery was also a huge help - ordering groceries to be delivered and waiting for us at the door when we arrived from the airport!"
7611271,93958116,2016-08-14,89070841,Hongyan,Thanks so much for the hospitality we received for these two days wonderful stay. The house is definitely well attended and the hostess has achieved excellent score in house management. Called Katie twice for laundry and kitchen questions and were well answered. I had to check out late due to a late flight and asked for a favor. Thank again for that.
7611271,97040493,2016-08-25,31031558,Alexandra,"\"Katie was the best host ever. Her house is a dream come true. We stayed with 5 adults and one child (2) for 5 nights and we had a blast. The house is beautiful and we loved to hang out at the little Patio in the back. She was always answering all our questions right away via Email or (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN). She left us a super sweet welcome note and we felt \"\"home away from home\"\" right away. UBER cars are always available within 2 minutes and we highly recommend UBER POOL - so cheap!! If you are a large family or group you should definitely book this Air B&N house. Its just a few minutes away from a nice little beach and the neighborhood is very quiet and nice. Boston Downtown is easy to reach by Uber - there is no parking around the house - so don't take a rental car. We also enjoyed \"\"Alexa\"\" the Amazon Echo music provider. It was so much fun and we heard some great music during our evenings in Katies huge and pretty kitchen."
We forgot some laundry at the washing machine and Katie took care of it afterward. We really appreciate what you have done for us and we highly recommend your house to everyone who wants to stay in Boston.,,,,,
"Thanks again for our wonderful stay. \"",,,,,
225834,595827,2011-10-03,203287,Mathias,"\"Duane offered a room to us, as an answer to an \"\"last minute\"\" request on airbnb. A good place to stay for a Boston trip"
This place is a bit far away from the last subway station,so that it's not so easy to get there in the evening,"when the buses only drive very rarely. We took our rental car ro get to the station and back.\"",,,
225834,620213,2011-10-11,1198198,Simon,Duane is very hospitality host. His coffee and bread by Mournings is supper! Actually he did whatever I only need to help me and make my stay more enjoyable.
225834,658557,2011-10-24,1192736,Darry,"We had a fantastic stay! Duane is a most gracious and engaging host, quite eager to be helpful yet extremely respectful of privacy. The room, with its great view of the Boston skyline, had a very comfortable bed. We enjoyed the quietness of the neighborhood and its convenient walking distance to Rosi Village, where we found several excellent restaurants (not to mention a real Italian meat market and a classic Boston fish market - they'll get you anything you want fresh from the wharf if you ask a day in advance). Duane helped us track the buses that ran near his house, so we had an easy time gaining access to the T. And his freshly-roasted coffee is amazing! We'll definitely look to stay with him again on our next trip to Boston. -Darry and Susan"
225834,1209266,2012-05-01,1217933,Esteban,Duane is a great host. He will make you feel at home. I spend there 1 month and I totally recommend his place to stay. You will also have the pleasure to enjoy the great view his house has since it is located on a hill.  Do not hesitate to contact him.
225834,1342171,2012-05-24,2326946,Emily,"I stayed at Duane's place for 2 weeks while I was in Boston for some medical testing. I am so happy with my decision to rent a room from him instead of staying at a hotel. I was comfortable there and I loved the cozy feel of his apartment. The views were very nice, and I was able to leave the window in my room open the entire time I was there, letting in the wonderful weather and refreshing breeze. Duane was so helpful whenever I had a question and was completely accommodating whenever I needed anything, even offering twice to pick me up from the bus stop. I always had privacy when I needed it and on the flip side never felt lonely, it was the best of both worlds. I will definitely look into staying here again next time I visit!! Thanks Duane!!"
225834,1448199,2012-06-10,2036607,Sally,"\"The apartment is very quiet, and the views (especially from the living room)  over the leafy roads below give a peaceful feel throughout. Duane is a \"\"natural host\"\" who takes care to make guests comfortable and ensure they have a good stay. I stayed about two weeks"
225834,1956490,2012-08-12,2300879,Furay,"Stayed with Duane for 3 weeks while taking some courses in Boston.  Duane was very accommodating and had fresh roasted coffee with bagels every morning!  At times will also offer to pick up/drive me to the T station.  Transportation is rather easy, will take approx 45 min to get into downtown Boston (not too bad)  The bed was Extremely Comfortable, will for sure stay with Duane whenever I am back in Boston!"
225834,2095932,2012-08-25,818368,Azn,"Duane is an incredibly gracious, helpful, and conversational host. Very attentive, thoughtful and knowledgeable. He made everything easy and hassle free and helped way beyond what one would normally expect (free rides around town). The coffee was great and the location makes it very easy to get to around using the subway system. The room itself was spacious, clean, and comfortable. There was clean linens, towels, and full access to the large kitchen and dinning room. Overall, I had a great time staying there. The hardest part of the whole process was leaving! Highly recommend Duane's place to other travelers."
225834,2321038,2012-09-17,532336,Rafiq,It was a pleasure staying with Duane. He's a great host and very knowledgeable of Boston.
225834,2679989,2012-10-22,2325913,Danny,"Duane was a gracious host. His home is in a beautiful neighborhood, just a few minutes walking distance from a town center with restaurants (one of the best Italian restaurants I've ever eaten at?). His home was spotlessly clean and neat. The bed was comfortable and has a great view. It's about 45 min. from Logan airport. I loved staying there."
225834,3127377,2012-12-21,2634100,Sabrina,"Duane is the best host you can imagine: incredibly gracious, helpful, smart  and conversational. He made my stay in Boston (2 months) very special. I am already looking forward to meeting him again one day! The place is nice, cozy, and quite. Lovely, safe neighbourhood."
225834,3591558,2013-02-19,5106972,William,Duane was a fantastic host. I can't recommend staying with him highly enough. It was my first trip to Boston and he had all kinds of information on what to see and how to get around that proved to be very helpful.
The room itself was nice and the bed was really comfortable. The house sits on the top of a hill and the room is on the second floor so not only does it have a great view of downtown Boston but of the surrounding areas.,,,,,
And finally,"Duane does not overstate his coffee. Both mornings I was there Duane had delicious freshly ground coffee from far flung parts of the world piping hot (this was crucial because I don't think it got above freezing during my trip) and ready to drink.\"",,,,
225834,4403650,2013-05-03,5308766,Liz,"I really cannot add anything else that the others have not already said. Great, excellent host, awesome coffee, bread & he does make an occasional delicious breakfast etc. Very personable & knowledgeable about everything Boston. Loved it & hope to be back in the future."
225834,5229408,2013-06-19,6229181,Lee,"Duane is a small business guy, running soho web services as his day gig, along with his BnB. I can't judge his web services work, but he puts a lot of effort into his BnB business, and it shows. Like, he always offered to pick me up at the subway when it rained, and he also took me to the airport when I left. When I arrived, he took me to a great pizza place for dinner, and on my last night we went to a nice fish place with a view."
It was a real shame watching the Bruins lose the Stanley Cup championship along with his company,but just *doing* it was The Point,and was totally worthwhile and fun! (...and hockey is a big deal in Boston,I have learned). After that,a few nights later we watched the movie Slapstick together via his Netflix and Big Screen TV.,
But don't get me wrong from what I've written about myself,I've seen him leave his other guests in peace as was their preference. He's an extremely accommodating host.,,,,
But that's just to give you an idea as to the effort he puts into it. He provides internet routinely,and when I needed a double monitor for my own work,he set one up for me without hesitation or additional cost. He roasts his own coffee,and often bakes his own bread. Every morning he's up serving these goodies; which is a great way to get the day started.,,
His house isn't fancy,or expensive,and that's what I was looking for. Yet it is always kept clean,and he even provided laundry services weekly while I was there. I chose his house because of the good ratings other guests have left,and I'd like to add my own to the list as a recommendation for others. Consider yourself lucky if you can stay at Duane's house.,
Also,I have stayed in both of the rooms that he rents,and while the smaller *is* smaller,"it has a fantastic private balcony that I thoroughly enjoy when the weather permitted and I had the time to do so. What a treat!\"",,
225834,5401592,2013-06-28,2237,Yemoja,"Duane is a wonderful host. Although I arrived late, he was patient and very welcoming. I enjoyed our dialogue. I felt very safe in his home. I highly recommend booking with Duane."

225834,9223345,2013-12-15,4615093,Tiago,"I had an excellent stay at Duane's house. I stayed five months and didn't have any problem. Duane is a very dedicated host. He does everything possibly to make sure his guests are comfortable and safe. Every morning he sets up the breakfast with fresh coffee and a delicious homemade bread. Occasionally, Duane also makes some pancakes that are very delicious too."
He has all kinds of information on what to see and how to get around. Duane is generous with his time answering questions,what is very helpful for an international visitor.,,,,
The house is well located: near to the public transportation (there is a bus stop on the corner) and a couple blocks from Roslindale Square,where you can find restaurants,markets,banks and barbershops. The neighborhood is quiet and friendly.,,
During my stay,Duane often picked me up at the subway station when was late. On a weekend,he gave me a ride to an exam,what helped me a lot. He also gave me ride to the supermarket and the airport. In other words,Duane was always open to help me during my stay.,

Duane est un hôte accueillant et généreux. Très disponible et toujours prêt à se rendre utile. Son délicieux pain maison préparé pour nous avec soin chaque jour et son café fraîchement moulu tous les matins ont été apprécié. Situé dans un quartier paisible et relativement près du centre-ville, nous avons profité de trois très bonnes nuits de sommeil dans la chambre d'invités avec vue sur la ville. Magnifique! Et nous avons beaucoup apprécié les conversations échangées matin et soir avec Duane et Matheus, un autre invité (d'origine allemande), de passage à Boston pour quelques mois. Une expérience humaine enrichissante et très agréable que nous recommandons à quiconque souhaite expérimenter un séjour différent."

Duane was more than willing to share his knowledge of the surrounding neighborhoods and took an interest in our apt search.  We appreciated his feedback.  The home was lovely- clean and organized.  Our room was comfortable for the two of us and our luggage and met our needs for this trip.  The location was close to downtown Roslindale and very accessible to public transportation.  We would definitely recommend staying with Duane :)"

Le matin, Duane a préparé son réputé café et son pain artisanal. Un délice! Il nous a fait sentir les bienvenus dans sa maison. La chambre est simple, mais c'est ce que nous cherchions parce que nous avons passé toute la journée à explorer Boston et les alentours. Merci pour l'accueil Duane!"

225834,21970990,2014-10-27,21982866,Preetam,Duane has been one of the most gracious host/person I have ever met.
He helped us a lot - picked up twice because it was stormy and also dropped us at Forest Hills station when we left.,,,,,
The room was comfortable with all the necessities in order for us when we arrived. It has a beautiful view in the morning. The house was always clean and silent (even though there was another guest). We were always welcome to join Duane for a talk  even if we did not have much time to do so. House amenities are good and Duane has a list of restaurants,"schedules of all the buses plying in the locality which helped us a lot. I will try to stay at his place when I travel to Boston in future.\"",,,,
225834,23370285,2014-11-30,22368065,Arlo,"It was a pleasure staying with Duane. I stayed with him for my first month in Boston, and he really went the extra mile to help myself and the other roommates find our way around and get used to the city, and he was even willing to help take us shopping a couple of times a week when we needed groceries."
I was working a regular job during my stay with him,and he got up early each morning to serve me breakfast and make sure I made it off to work on time. Like most of the reviews state,he really takes good care of his guests,and at the end of my stay,he even drove me to my next place. He's a very nice guy to talk to and get directions from,and during your stay
225834,31091152,2015-05-02,4615093,Tiago,"It is the third time that I stay at Duane’s house. I feel at home there. Why? Duane is a perfect host for a shared and friendly home experience. As always, he is helpful and professional. The house is safe, clean and quiet. And there are always other housemates who are enjoyable to chat. During my staying, I experienced the strong winter of Boston. Duane helped with everything necessary to overcome the cold weather. Again, I highly recommend Duane’s house to anyone needing a nice and friendly place to stay in Boston."
225834,33672629,2015-05-31,30598618,Heleni,We relocated to Boston from California and stayed with Duane for an entire month so that we could find a place to call our own. The apartment is older but very well maintained and very clean. The bathroom was shared  with other tenants but we did not find it inconveniencing since there was no conflict in shower scheduling.
As described by other reviewers,Duane is a most gracious host that will go out of his way to make his guests feel welcome and at home. He got up at the same time as we did in order to prepare breakfast and he took me to the laundry place and the grocery store when we did not have our car available.,,,,
Also,the house is located close to public transportation - which is very very convenient.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
225834,34615363,2015-06-09,3034908,Bob,"Duane was easy to contact. He is friendly and welcoming; I had a great time talking with him. His space was tidy and aesthetic, and the bed was comfortable. The setting of his apartment on top of hill, on the second story of the building, made it feel as removed as a treehouse. I loved the coffee and homemade cinnamon bread in the morning. Roslindale Center, complete with a beautiful town square, is a short walk away. It's a great location, perfect for my visit to the South side of Boston."
225834,35126613,2015-06-15,10455924,Harish,"Duane is one of the nicest man I've met. He was so kind and made me feel at home in his house which is charming and comfortable. I enjoyed his delicious homemade bread and specially roasted coffee of different variety. Duane very kindly collected me from the subway restaurant and took me there on my day of departure. Thank you, Duane. Highly recommended!!"
225834,35463614,2015-06-19,3350868,Fabiano,"Duane was more than a host. He made absolutely sure we had a great stay. He picked us up from the subway station and told us all about the neighborhood on the way to his place. He is very organized, welcoming,  easy going, helpful and nice to chat with. When we left he drove us to the subway station as well. The neighborhood is nice and with great bakeries, eateries and a pub. Everything is within walking distance and there are plenty of buses serving the area. Duane's place was impeccable and we felt very comfortable there."
225834,35944755,2015-06-23,10455924,Harish,"I stayed at Duane's place for three nights for the second time after attending a week's course in Chester. Really got to know Duane who is extremely kind, easy going, easy to talk to and attentive. He gave me a lift to the Subway station on my last day. Enjoyed his home made bread and home roasted coffee! The room was very comfortable. Boston is an interesting city, historical and there is much to do. Visit to Cambridge is a must! Highly recommended Airbnb!!"
225834,36245193,2015-06-26,24678002,Chakira,"Duane was simply awesome. Kind, generous and even though I was only in Boston for the night... I felt I had a homie :) He was attentive and made sure I knew my way around town. The room was clean, bed was comfy but the BEST part was the coffee and homemade bread (aka the Caveman Bread). I was lucky to enjoy some amazing conversation over breakfast with another Airbnb guest he was hosting and I am sure he also had a great experience. Thanks Duane!"
225834,36489053,2015-06-28,15802896,Bénédicte,"Duane est très accueillant. Propose du bon café et du bon pain maison. Nous avons apprécié de pouvoir discuter avec lui et avec Alex, un hôte présent en même temps que nous. La chambre est simple. La vue sur la Skyline est réelle mais relativement lointaine ! Nous pensons qu'il est préférable d'avoir une voiture pour louer cette chambre car les transports en commun sont assez loin. Surtout si vous avec des bagages lourds. Nous avions une voiture et c'est simple pour aller dans boston."
225834,36950028,2015-07-03,31106316,Julio,"Staying with Duane was extremely pleasant, he made me feel right at home at all times and made sure I had everything I needed."
As a coffee aficionado I enyoyed his various offerings of african as well as south american beans and learned a thing or two about coffee.,,,,,
The neighborhood is a very nice one,quiet  but conveiently close to everything.,,,,
His place was as described,very neat and well kept.,,,,
"I would not hessitate to recommend him.\"",,,,,
225834,47244783,2015-09-17,33268748,Isabel,"It was our first experience in Airbnb and it couldn't have been better. We stayed with Duane 2 months. The room was as described and the house was good. Roslindale is still a bit far from downtown Boston, but the bus stops are near the house. Duane was a great host, very attentive and nice. He helped us with logistic questions which was a great help since it was our first time in Boston. He even gave us a ride a couple of times (which was even better when raining). Duane is very talkative but respects your private space. We had a great time in Duane's house, he really let us feel at home. He makes greats pancakes and coffee! Definitely an experience to repeat :)"
225834,51814537,2015-10-24,46422057,Zak,"Duane was a great host and made us feel very comfortable. We weren't there for very long, but while we were there, we were treated to coffee, bagels, and a cozy room."
225834,56848624,2015-12-19,28832787,Fabian,"We stayed with Duane for two Months, and had a great time! Everything was as exactly as described and shown in the pictures, and Duane is a very nice, well-organized, and knowledgeable guy. He was also very considerate to both our needs and our privacy."
He also drove us to the airport and took us to the grocery store every now and then. There also always was (delicious!) coffee and bread or bagles in the mornings.,,,,,
Overall,"it doesn't get much better than this. Very easy recommendation. :)\"",,,,
225834,72155448,2016-05-01,49794912,Yousef,"Duane made me feel more than welcome at his home, during my 4 month stay he always took me grocery shopping with him, he took care of my laundry and picked/dropped me at the airport. The place is exactly as described in the listing, I loved the coffee every morning and the view of the Boston skyline every night."
Roslindale is a great place to stay,Duane's home is walking distance to many bus stops which take you straight to Forest Hills,from there it's a 20 minute ride to downtown Boston. Uber/Fasten are also readily available in the area. Duane provided a parking spot if you came with your own car and on-street parking is available too.,,,
"I definitely recommend staying at Duane's place whether it's short-term or long-term like I did. \"",,,,,
225834,73637822,2016-05-09,7239326,Mike,"Duane is an amazing host. He went over and beyond to make me feel welcome and comfortable. He gave me rides several times during my stay, which was very considerate. He also made coffee (which he roasts himself), and bread (which he also made himself) for me both mornings. The room itself was very clean, as was the bathroom. The listing was very accurate and I will definitely stay with Duane again when I am in Boston again."
225834,98548440,2016-08-31,76385559,Simon,"Duane is a great host. It was very easy communicating with him about arrival, he drove me to a restaurant for dinner. Clean house, comfortable bed, highly recommend."
8191739,55859132,2015-12-06,9974080,Andreas,Great location! Just a short walk to MGH and the green and red lines. I booked the room very short notice and Eleanor was always very quick in her responses and eager to help with any questions I had. I stayed there for 3 nights and had everything I needed. Towels and sheets provided. Bedroom with a desk and plenty of room to hang clothes. Kitchen access except for the stove and oven. Overall a good stay.
8191739,58619233,2016-01-03,50387705,Debra,Her son welcomed me quite nicely! The place was perfect for what I was looking for!
8191739,68040195,2016-04-01,49867610,Cmbridge1,The host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8191739,70582969,2016-04-18,5594417,Dave,"I stayed with Elle for the Boston Marathon and had a great experience. The location is great for running, as it's just a couple of blocks and over a bridge to the river (no stop lights!). Elle was a very warm and welcoming host; always making sure I had everything I needed."
8191739,76896778,2016-05-29,67214704,Alexis,"Eleanore was a wonderful host. She took the time to show me around the area when I first arrived, and checked in on me throughout my stay to make sure that I had everything that I needed. The room was well furnished with places to hang clothes, a very comfortable bed, and towels and toiletry provided. The common area was quite large with a wonderful view over the river. The location was very convenient--a short walk to MGH, the red line, green line, and downtown Boston. I highly recommend staying here for either a rotation at MGH or just a vacation to Boston."
8191739,78021135,2016-06-05,71954794,Serena,Perfect place to stay. Eleanore responds fast to messages. The apartment is comfortable and very clean. Eleanore's daughter is extremely welcoming. The location is great. Thank you!
8191739,79552241,2016-06-13,12150547,Jorge,"Eleanore was very attentive to my needs and made me feel home all the time. The place is extremely well located, super clean and perfect for a short business trip. Her son and daughter are very friendly and made my stay easy and comfortable. I would stay here again for sure. Thank you all!"
8191739,95649158,2016-08-20,75955456,WaiBun,Eleanore and his son were fantastic hosts. They accommodated my arrival time and was very helpful when I arrived. This place is well located and was close to everything I needed. My stay here was very comfortable and I would stay here again. Thanks you!

14663819,98117567,2016-08-29,14645778,Luise,"Our hosts were very welcoming and friendly, they even offered us breakfast. The room is spacey even though there are a lot of personal belongings inside. Their place is fairly clean even though there was a constant smell of plastic in the basement. Their house is located in a calm, suburban neighbourhood. Unfortunately, public transport isn't the best in Boston, especially in Mattapan. However, there's a red line station at 15min. by foot from the house and the little train is worth a ride if you like nostalgic tains."
11964926,77283866,2016-05-31,8035432,Hang,Nice host
11964926,80259517,2016-06-17,57460255,Tyler,"Very nice location and place. Sulian had everything ready for us on short notice and was very responsive, plus she provided snacks which were a lifesaver after a long day of traveling. Highly recommended!"
11964926,80980033,2016-06-20,73228406,Jc,Really good location. Nice room with 2 separate beds. The only problem is that the room was not yet cleaned when we checked-in. But everything else was convenient.
11964926,82689862,2016-06-28,57218289,Jk,"I stayed at Sulian's place for a week while I was doing an apartment hunt in the area before my graduate studies. The location is quite spot on - a short walk to JFK/UMass station, which connects you to the downtown areas or the Dorchester neighborhood in no time. It felt safe walking in the hood late at night, although not much pedestrian activity was seen during that time."
Sulian is a very accomodating,hospitable,and communicative host. She was prompt to provide assistance on my requests. And she was very understanding to give me instructions when I arrived at the place quite late after missing my bus. I much appreciated it.,,,
The stay was comfortable enough in a quaint modest house. Just don't expect a fancy hotel room quality lol. The only two downsides to consider are: 1) if you are sensitive to noise while sleeping,this may not be the place for you. I wasn't warned although I could have guessed on my own considering the location,but the railroad is in close proximity,so the noise coming from it even at late night felt like an intrusive guest. Fortunately,I am a hardcore sleeper so I was pretty fine and got used to it soon enough. 2) if you are maybe taller than me (I am 6'),then some of the low ceilings at the end of the stairway or at the entrance of the shower stall might be a small nuisance. But you're watchful enough with your movements
Overall,I am very satisfied with my stay at Sulian's,mainly because it was a relatively very affordable stay (what with a weekly discount) & Sulian was such a kind host. Thank you,Sulian!,,

11964926,83537560,2016-07-03,54000490,Silja,"We just stayed one night and that was totally fine. The room was clean and neat. The bathroom was small, but okay. It is located directly at rail tracks, so I recommend ear plugs for the night. The host is very nice. We would come again."
11964926,84460208,2016-07-07,34898588,Qing,It is a good place that is convient to by train to downtown.The bed is comfortable and clean. But it is a noise because of the train and car going behind the house.
11964926,87070913,2016-07-18,69579527,Yan,Sulian is a very good host. Our flight was delayed and got to her place at 3:00 a.m. but Sulian kept waiting for us in order to give us the instruction about her place. We really appreciate her help! Sulian's place will be our first choice if we are to back later to Boston.
11964926,87411927,2016-07-20,49864315,Nicolas,"I consider that the room was little but good. The only issue is the noise. But to be honest, I had no problem with it. It's quite warmed but I would come back to stay."

11964926,89400888,2016-07-28,84856879,Sarah,"We never saw our host, but were greeted at the front door by the downstairs tenant - lovely young man who helped carry our bags. Don't pack heavy to stay here as the room is on the third floor, very narrow staircases. There are two Airbnb rooms owned by SuLian in this location, and they are across the hall from each other, with a small shared bathroom, so be prepared to encounter some strangers during your stay... We had someone poke their head into our room."
"The room itself had two comfortable beds which were clean. I came prepared with earplugs and eye mask after reading previous reviews about proximity to the railway. Slept great! \"",,,,,
11964926,89435563,2016-07-28,41948095,David,"The room is close to the airport, it takes approximately 35min to get to the house."
It is a clean and comfy two single bed room,equipped with air conditioner (otherwise it is really hot since it is at the last floor,under the roof).,,,
Water,snacks and towels are provided which is really appreciated after a long flight landing late.,,,,

But you have to consider, that the metro is pretty loud in Boston, so we could hear it in our room as well. But we had no problems to get to sleep. It was a good starting point for exploring the city. During our stay is was extremely hot, so the airconditioning saved our lives."
"Also the provided instant soup and the water was very nice.\"",,,,,

We didn't get a good sleep during the train operation hours. If you are looking for a good price with a good location close to the downtown or the airport, it may be suitable for you."

11964926,96356615,2016-08-22,11557118,Harshul,It was a good stay in the amount we paid for a city like Boston. I appreciate how quick Sulian was in replying my messages. I also found the parking spot at her house which was a big deal for me as finding a parking spot in the Boston neighborhoods can be very tricky.
Overall it was a good experience.,,,,,

The bus will take you to Boston in about 15-20 minutes. The neighborhood was nice and quiet with lots of restaurants and stores around."
Dawson was responsive and communicated well with me from the very start I inquired about his place.,,,,,
The bedroom was pretty big,had lots of drawers and I really had good nights' sleep in the bed which was very comfortable.,,,,
He provided me with basic stuff that I needed as a guest.,,,,,
It was nice to have met some of his friends as well,after the Boston Half Marathon event.,,,,
It was overall a nice experience staying at his place and being his very first airbnb guest.,,,,,

We had a very pleasant conversation where he advised us to do several activities while in Boston. The room was spacious, bright and clean. It was very similar to what you can see in the picture. The bed was comfortable, and there was a bathroom very close which made it very convenient. The apartment´s structure and the location of the room made it possible to have privacy. The location is great. Only 20 minutes to down town  by subway and approximately 10 minute walking to the subway station."

The building and the area is really quiet and so is the room. The area is just one block from a centre/south street, full of restaurants, shops and a very good bakery, another Boston away from the touristic sites and full of charm. Thank you Dawson for this wonderful weekend at your place!"
4065322,22500760,2014-11-08,12222994,Autumn,Very nice place to stay! Dawson was really welcoming and helpful. Within a 10 minute walk to the subway so it was easy to get around!

The place is very cool. When you enter,you will go up 2 flights of narrow stairs with very little semblance of an entry-way. I actually liked this part as it was unique and all the more surprising to see how much space you have once you enter. The rooms are very large and the dining area is quite large as well. The kitchen is small but has everything you need to prepare a meal yourself. The TV is quite small,but you're in Boston for goodness sake. Enjoy it and get out and see the town.,,,
We took Uber rides into town which cost about $10 each way at night. This is much faster and cheaper than trying to rent a car,"drive to the North End and find parking (which is also expensive).\"",,,,
5526487,35797296,2015-06-22,19556650,Renee,Terry was responsive to all of my questions via text. The flat was represented accurately. It was clean and spacious.  We also appreciated the convenient access to the T.

5526487,43373857,2015-08-19,36214577,Randolph,I love Terry's place. It's just a stone's throw away from the railway station so it was very convenient to go from the apartment to the city. The house has a very simple but well thought of design adding a lot good character to the house aside from giving a home-away-from-home feel.
5526487,46586418,2015-09-12,36636992,Rob,"Great apartment. Out of the congested city area but still close enough to make transit affordable. Bathrooms nice, bedrooms nice and living area nice as well. Would have been happy to stay longer if needed."
5526487,47622430,2015-09-21,841273,Melanie,"We had a fabulous time staying at 2 Centre Place.  The bedrooms were spacious and comfortable.  The entire apartment was clean and nicely decorated.  The unit was located in the Roxbury neighborhood near Roxbury Community College.  When booking the place I was unfamiliar with Boston neighborhoods and Roxbury turned out to be a little more edgey than I would have normally chosen.  But, that was more my fault in researching than the host's fault in advertising."
5526487,49214516,2015-10-02,38500265,Jean,"Terry was very welcoming and helpful when we arrived in Boston. He had maps and a lot of local information in the apartment along with everything else we needed during our trip. The place is in a great location, close to the subway."
5526487,50839258,2015-10-15,14483151,Rachel,"Terry's place was beautiful and a perfect space for our family. It is extremely comfortable, the beds delightful, the towels plentiful, plus a well equipped little kitchen. The apartment was located just a 7 minute walk from the Roxbury Crossing station which got us everywhere we wanted to visit, that wasn't within walking distance. The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum is an easy mile walk in the Fenway area. Despite being fairly central, we  found the neighborhood pretty quiet. This is definitely a neighborhood on an upswing and we felt quite safe walking around in the evening. There wasn't a plethora of restaurants very near by, but with the proximity of the T, or a willingness to walk about 20 minutes (we had a 4, 8 and 70 year old with us, to assess how quickly we walked) you could find some fabulous food and beer - yay Squealing Pig. This was a great base to explore Boston, stellar accommodations without paying downtown prices. Thank you."
5526487,52210636,2015-10-27,38449684,Grainne,"Terry was very helpful and answered any questions I emailed about the apartment.  He was also very helpful when we had a couple of queries and was straight over to help.  The apartment is lovely, over two floors at the top of the building, up two flights of stairs.  Its an old building beautifully restored, the apartment is roomy, well kitted out and well decorated.  Terry has left plenty of info about the area and what to visit in Boston.  The area is a little shabby especially near the train station, but safe for all that. The T rail system is only 5 minutes walk away and works like a dream.  Longest wait was 7 minutes for the train that takes you Downtown in 12 mins.  They have a 7 day pass for $19 - well worth the money.  Other than that we used Uber and that was very reliable.  Definitely go to the top of the Prudential for great views, and take a boat trip, the sea views are great.  Many thanks Terry for a great experience."
5526487,52579565,2015-10-31,15422779,Douglas & Noa,"Terry's place was great!  it was easy to find, we took Uber from the airport, approx 15-20 min drive, and around $75, but we were 6 adults plus luggage.  The neighborhood was quiet and nice, we had no issues.  Terry's place had everything you would need, 3 good size bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, living room and kitchen, as described.  We were 3 couples travelling together.  Terry was easily reached when we needed him or to ask a question, but never actually came to the unit."
I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again,"it made for a great trip to Boston!\"",,,,
5526487,53043592,2015-11-04,39261980,George,"Terry's home was a perfect fit for my party during our stay in Boston.  The group consisted of myself, my wife, a colleague, my daughter (toddler) and  my mother-in-law and we all had sufficient space and privacy. With relatively easy access to the Train and a short commute in town we really got to get a feel for the Boston area.  My wife and I are still talking about how comfortable the beds were.  I Would definitely recommend  to others."
5526487,54975251,2015-11-27,38607335,Brad,"We had a wonderful trip and were very happy with the home.  My wife and our 4 kids had plenty of room.  It is a quick walk to the subway, which we appreciated as we did not have a car on this trip."
It was clean,well stocked,"and we would stay there again.\"",,,
5526487,57624914,2015-12-28,19712239,Cassidy,"I feel so conflicted about this Airbnb. The space is lovely. The carpeted, narrow stairs lead to a warm, comfortable living space on the top two floors. The kitchen is especially nice; it feels larger than it looks and was equipped with everything we needed. The bedrooms are roomy, especially the king bedroom which has several chairs, a loveseat in the corner, and an old stereo that still works somewhat well (the radio, but not the CD player). The bathrooms are clean and had just enough toilet paper for us, something I consider an Airbnb must! The neighborhood wasn’t a place to hang but didn’t feel particularly unsafe, and we loved the short walk to the train."
Terry is very kind and was good at responding to our problems but wasn’t as effective when it came to solving them. When we first arrived,he was helpful in getting us inside,and he took care of a mysterious orange liquid in the basement (where the laundry is located). Unfortunately,our bigger issues were ongoing,the first of which was 8-5 construction happening in the adjacent unit. Terry hadn’t let us know about this,and it may bother most guests
Overall,"this place is nice enough for you to roll the dice! I hope it was just a weird combination of circumstances that diminished our experience.\"",,,,
5526487,60330496,2016-01-22,6721669,Greta,"One of the nicest places I've stayed in Boston. Situated on a quiet, charming old world street with warm, tasteful, comfortable rooms. Very comfortable (firm!) mattresses, functional kitchen, privacy, and plenty of space. This place has personality and is not a hotel. You can hear people coming and going from the other units, one of the showers is in an old claw foot tub with less than robust water pressure, but the linens are crisp clean and abundant, the furniture is very comfortable, and it's a space I sincerely enjoyed being in."
5526487,61649232,2016-02-07,52449150,Lyle,This apartment was perfect for us during my daughter's stay at Boston Children's Hospital. It is about a mile and a half walk to the hospital. Plenty of free parking within 1 minute walk. Subway station about a 5 minute walk. Terry handled all of our questions immediately. Only drawbacks are that it's at the top of two fairly steep and narrow stairs and any noise made goes straight into the apartment directly below. We had to constantly remind our children to try to walk silently. Overall a great experience!!
5526487,65074183,2016-03-10,60361603,Kurtis,Terry was a wonderful host. Everything was immaculate when we arrived and our stay was great! The neighborhood was very close to the orange line which connected us anywhere we needed quickly. Terry left us with a handy guide of the area and the place was well stocked including many towels and everything we needed to cook when we felt like it.
"The apartment was very unique and made us feel like we had a true Boston experience. I would wholeheartedly recommend both Terry as a host and the apartment as a great place to stay. Will definitely be back if in Boston again. \"",,,,,
5526487,68292966,2016-04-04,36891449,Juçaira,"As fotos correspondem à realidade e Terry responde prontamente as mensagens. O apartamento é bastante confortável e organizado. Quanto à localização, é próximo ao metrô apenas distante da área turística."
5526487,74702620,2016-05-16,27713687,Kendall,"Terry's place is absolutely WONDERFUL. He was such a gracious host, he even dug through the dumpster after our trip to find something that we accidentally threw away!!! I just can't thank him enough."
If you are coming to Boston and looking for an authentic experience then this is definitely your place. You'll need to prepare to take uber or cabs to places of interest in the city,but the apartment itself is just wonderful. Two stories,beautifully decorated bedrooms and bathrooms,a large living room for relaxing and hanging out...we had SO MUCH FUN at Terry's place and would love to return. The street that it's on is quiet and seems to be populated with other AirBnBers,"since every time we left it seemed someone else on the street was leaving in an uber as well.  One more thing: The keyless entry is AMAZING!!!\"",
5526487,76854360,2016-05-29,47793004,Gigi,"My guests were in for convocation and Terry's apartment was awesome, perfect and quaint.  The location is ideal in a quiet area and a short walk to public transit.  Two floors of large rooms with very comfy beds, well equipped kitchen and plenty of towels for the group.  Easy street parking, good wifi and convenient keyless entry.  My guests were extremely happy and cozy.  It was hot in Boston and the window a/c units were very good.  FYI - apartment is a third floor walk up somewhat narrow stairs if you have large suitcases."
"Terry was an excellent host.  He responded quickly to my questions and everything was exactly as described.  All the comforts of home in this lovely apartment made the Boston visit even better.\"",,,,,
5526487,83212967,2016-07-01,57891861,Laurie,We loved our stay in Terry's home. The beds are super comfortable. We UBER'd our entire trip; getting in to the downtown area was quick and affordable. Terry has a flair for decorating!
5526487,87716252,2016-07-21,63103697,Braulio,"Good space. Plenty of room for 5 of us to sleep comfortably. Terry was responsive when I would contact him. The area is not very lively and not many places were walking distance, über and lyft to get to the main areas or you can rent a zipcar which is only 2 blocks away."
"It was nice to be in the A/C during the heatwave. \"",,,,,
5526487,91610071,2016-08-06,80974288,Bob,Good value for money;  close to t station and then quickly downtown;  clean; roomy;  property as described;  all appliances present; airco worked really well;  excellent experience & would do again

There isn't much in the area though in terms of restaurants, bars or coffee shops, however the area is safe and pleasant. Terry was responsive and helpful."
5526487,94792495,2016-08-17,2642180,Zivi,"It was a pleasure to stay at Terry's apartment. My family and I had a great long weekend there. Parking was quite easy. On Centre street, we could park on the weekend without a permit and during the week, we parked a block away on Lynwood. The T was a quick walk away and Uber/Lyft rides into downtown Boston were also reasonably priced. The weekend was super hot but the air conditioners worked well and kept us cool."
5526487,95785407,2016-08-20,66563333,Aymeric,"Very nice and cosy apartment. We really felt at home, thanks to a very warmful decoration. The neighborhoods are Ok, with a fast metro (orange line) only 8 minutes away. The only inconvenience is that there are no food shops in the nearby."
5526487,96605098,2016-08-23,87779052,Scott,"I was blown away in ever sense. Terry was great, the space was great, the location was great. Will certainly be going back to stay!"
12233043,69180249,2016-04-09,7837955,Sharon,"Ricardo was very responsive and helpful. Very convenient location about a block away from the Maverick station (blue line) that is itself a stop away from the airport and from aquarium (north end). The rooms seem to be newly remodeled. We came towards the tail end of winter, and the rooms were surprisingly warm for an older house. Thanks Ricardo!"
12233043,70396405,2016-04-17,65963813,Jordi,"Ricardo was an amazing host. Overall the experience could've not been any better. Myself and my friend were more than satisfied with the apartment, which was clean, had space and had a wonderful atmosphere."
The location is also very good since you are 2 minutes away from the subway station.,,,,,
"I can only thank Ricardo for providing us with a comfortable place for our stay in Boston and I definitely recommend it to anyone who visit's Boston and needs a place to sleep.\"",,,,,
12233043,71623501,2016-04-26,5691359,Lu,"The room was just as described. Place was neat and clean. Ricardo was very nice and accommodating. He let me know a couple days in advance what I needed to do to access the room and responded quickly to my messages. At the last minute, I needed to check in early and check out late, and Ricardo was able to adjust/prepare as needed."
12233043,72017458,2016-04-30,22273825,Verena,Was a good experience. Ricardo was nice and welcoming and the house is located not too far from the subway station

12233043,73484280,2016-05-08,67462857,Elin,Rummet var precis som beskrivet o mycket välstädat. Hela huset var rent och fräscht. Ricardo va en trevlig värd o hade tagit fram kartor o broschyrer vi kunde titta i. Både incheckning o utcheckning var mycket enkelt. Jättesmidigt att ta sig in till downtown Boston då tunnelbanan låg ett par minuters gångväg bort.
12233043,74142281,2016-05-13,4136165,Andrew,"The place is as described: simple and pretty straightforward hostel situation. Ricardo went out of his way to accommodate my bike, which was nice. The place is just a 3-min walk to the Maverick Station, which is great."
12233043,74880853,2016-05-17,6555095,Andrea,Ricardo's place was great. Exactly as described in listing. It was conveniently located near a T station which made it easy to get around all of Boston. I will definitely stay there again!
12233043,75190364,2016-05-19,17972744,Ugam,Everything is as described. It all worked perfectly! We got there a little early but Ricardo accommodated us very well. The room was clean and great to live in. The entire house has all the facilities you need whilst on vacation - wifi was great. Ricardo also recommended places to visit and how to get there.
All in all,"he's a great host and the place is good to live in. \"",,,,

Highly recommend."

The commons ( bathroom and kitchen ) were very clean too ! We haven't seen ricardo but the instructions he had left us to enter into the building and get access to our room were perfect ! And he was very friendly and easily reachable by email ! In our room, he had left a lot of documentation about Boston and surroundings that was perfect for a first visit to discover the city ! The location of the apartment was also very convenient : just 5 min walk from the blue line and less than 15min overall from downtown Boston ! I really recommand this place and will book it again next time I come back to Boston for sure !"
12233043,78505949,2016-06-07,72391360,Sarah,Ricardo did a great job answering all of my questions. He was a gracious host and this spot is unbeatable for his price. It's a three minute walk from restaurants and the T station... And only one stop away from Quincy Market. I would definitely recommend it!
12233043,79875311,2016-06-14,10145873,Foochan,The host was prompt and our communication was smooth. There was no problem and everything was clear through my check-out.
the building was a bit old with no elevator,but the rooms were clean,simple and commodious enough for me to rest myself. Also vely convenient to access to the fancy markets,lively spots in downtown and airport.,,
"Thank you very much!\"",,,,,

However, my food put in the common fridge were stolen, makes me little frustrated. Sometimes bathrooms on both floor get \"\"heavy duty\"\". One thing we were not very satisfying about is every morning we were wake up by road reconstruction nearby. If you need a quiet place to sleep you might wanna double check with the host.  \""
12233043,81852361,2016-06-25,78030564,Julie,"Ricardo is really super reactive to questions and messages. Place is exactly as it is described except for the view, which changed due to a new building. Really easy to find and to reach from airport and downtown. Really amazing view on Boston downtown at less than 5minutes walk."
Globally clean. Stairs are not large,"a little bit difficult with big luggage. I really enjoyed this place and I recommand to people for a short stay in Boston!\"",,,,
12233043,82570507,2016-06-28,8301888,Sylvain,"The hostel is well located, close to the subway and 2 stops from the downtown. The room was clean and the kitchen has everything you need."
12233043,83077582,2016-07-01,16019862,Makrina,Ricardo sent me all the necessary information to get to the room. He is a nice person. The room was exactly as described in the photos. The location is really close to the airport and you can go there on foot. Its close to subway.
12233043,83944022,2016-07-04,39741407,Khalil,"Although there was a building or two under construction right next to the location of the hostel, there were no issues with noise pollution (it was a holiday weekend, that could be a factor to said). Every room (bathroom, kitchen, lounge) was well equipped with essentials, and available at our disposal. Although the host was not present, we had absolutely no issues with arrival, parking, departure, etc. All in all, for the price and commute time to downtown Boston, you are bound to have a pleasant experience-as did we."
12233043,85432796,2016-07-11,69840246,Mario,"\"After my original host had to cancel finding Ricardo's post was a lifesaver. I was a little apprehensive at first never having stayed at a hostel before. But everything turned out great. The location is on the airport side of the channel or in \"\"Eastie.\"\" I ubered to the apt. but could have easily taken train as train station is short walk to apt. I did use train to airport when I returned. Arrival and check out instructions were easy to follow The common area also had an eraser board with further instructions for guests with cars and use of the common areas. My room was very clean and comfortable as well as the common areas kitchen and bath. I stayed on the top floor and had a cool breeze the entire stay. If like me"

12233043,86719855,2016-07-17,82932220,Anna Dam,Super nice place. Everything worked out great. The room was really hot though seeing as I went in July and there is no A/C - just a fan in the ceiling. Other than that I have no complaints and would definitely recommend it - just not when it's too hot out.
12233043,87311765,2016-07-19,2187122,Benjamin,"We were unable to meet Ricardo in person, but his parents were very friendly and welcoming people, and Ricardo was responsive over email and chat before our arrival. The apartment hostel is located within close walking distance to a subway station, which is a short trip right into downtown. I thought the description was accurate. We were comfortable. The apartment is ideal for someone looking for an affordable place to stay with good location to Boston. Also, Ricardo's place has on-street parking, which is a perk for people like us who were driving into Boston."
12233043,88809828,2016-07-25,862023,Melissa,"The location of the airbnb was located pretty centrally in Boston's east end. The host communicated promptly and checkin/checkout was easy. Although AC was not advertised as an amenity, it would have been nice for there to be explicit disclosure to guests booking in 90 degree plus weather (I'm from AZ, so I didn't think to look at AC because this is a default where I'm from). Due to construction occurring next door, the airbnb was VERY noisy early in the morning. There was a shared upstairs and downstairs bathroom and kitchen space. On one occasion, the upstairs kitchen was locked and we could not access our goods. However, this was quickly resolved with a message to the host. Towels were flimsy and no hand towels or bath rugs were available. Bed was reasonably comfortable. The host provided a fan upon request due to the heat. In nicer weather, the place would have been fine, although there were limited amenities."
12233043,89035733,2016-07-26,61691160,Melissa,"An inexpensive, bare bones (true to listing, not looking for more) alternative to an expensive hotel for the night in Boston. Very convenient for public transportation via blue line. Short 5 min walk to Maverick station, one stop to downtown, one stop up to Logan.  Note: This front room is HOT (July) and very loud with street noise. Tough to sleep."

There is no air conditioner in the room. To keep cool, I had to open the windows. Then there was another problem: it was so noisy outside! Even with ear plugs it didn't work. I was woken up before 6 am!"

5992501,50218689,2015-10-10,6725787,Ron,Great location in Back Bay and Tom was easy to coordinate the details of my stay.  He was flexible with my arrival and departure times so that made it easy for work while in town.  Place was clean and we'll taken care. Only improvements would be the bedding was only a comforter (no top sheet) and the elevator is not working and it's on the 3rd floor. Not really a big deal since I was only in the apt at night to sleep. Tom was a good host and I'd consider staying again when in Back Bay vs going to a hotel.

369940,4544063,2013-05-12,3640486,Rachel,"Fabulous, cosy place. All you need provided. Fab hosts! The greatest part to this stay is the location. Right in the heart of vibrant North End aka Little Italy. We really did have to remind ourselves we were not in Florence or any other quaint Italian town. Highly recommend staying. Easy to move around to the other parts of Boston and lots of public transport close by. Definitely the best neighbourhood of Boston!!!"
369940,8833566,2013-11-20,9279771,Molly,"We could not have chosen a better condo for our stay. This building is centrally located right in between Hanover and Salem streets in the North End. Especially if you are planning on walking the city there are many points of interest about 10-20 minutes walking distance. The condo is a pretty spacious 2 bedroom which provided plenty of room for 3 of us to stay. This was a much homier stay than in a hotel!! Last but not least, Carlos and Cheryl were beyond helpful. Everything was provided exactly as stated and the suggestions we received from them were extremely helpful. I would highly recommend this condo to anyone looking to stay in the heart of Boston."
369940,11070417,2014-03-19,9625431,Douglas,We spent a very comfortable 5 days in this condo.We enjoyed every moment of our stay.We were 4 adults sharing and the appartment was more than big enough to accomodate us all .Everything in the flat was exactly as described.
The location is absolutely perfect for exploring Boston.The North End is a great place to be and one place you must visit is mikes pastries.Join the queue get some great pastries and enjoy then in the flat.,,,,,

369940,13906027,2014-06-08,6116641,Julie,Just came home after a week in this lovely condo. We were a family of 4 and it fitted us perfect with a master bedroom and a room with two single beds.

We enjoyed our stay in Boston and especially to stay in the middle of the great North End area.,,,,,

Apartment is well appointed.  Traditional in decor and very comfortable.  The location of the apartment was fantastic, so many very good restaurants and bars and also we were able to walk out everywhere.  Would recommend the freedom trail - great way to explore the city.   We hired a car for several days.  Parking not easy nor cheap but good to get out of the city and explore the State."
369940,23893608,2014-12-14,15774161,Liesbeth,"Carlos&Cheryl voorzien je ruim op tijd van volledige en goede informatie over hun appartement! Prima accommodatie, voorzien van alle gemakken en voorzieningen. Rustige ligging"
Ruim appartement,twee slaapkamers waarvan een met twee losse bedden. Een extra deken had fijn geweest,verder prima. Geweldige buurt van Boston. Heerlijke Italiaanse eetgelegenheden,alles in zeer sfeervolle kerstaankleding,als in een kerstfilm. Veel historische interessante bezienswaardigheden in de buurt (Freedom trail).,

369940,24462688,2014-12-29,21585489,Yvonne,"The apartment was as described and was very comfortable.  It is very conveniently situated, only a 10 minute walk to Faneuil Hall. My daughter and I met up in Boston over the Christmas holiday and found it a real home from home.  Would definitely stay again if in Boston."
369940,27655107,2015-03-09,26885776,Alexander,"We were very happy about our stay. It was just after the snow storm in Boston in September, but our trip was still very pleasant. We were on a buisness trip at the convention and it being in North End was close and a pleasant neighbourhood. carol and cheryl was very sweet and fast to reply before we got there."
369940,30373464,2015-04-21,11523251,Amber,"We stayed at Carlos and Cheryl's 2 bedroom condo in Boston for the 2015 Marathon. My boyfriend was running, and our moms came along for the trip."
The space:,,,,,
This apartment is small,"but fit our needs completely. It was great to have a \"\"home away from home\"\" as our home base",rather than a hotel,as it was crucial to be able to control our runner's diet prior to race day. The place had plenty of common space in the kitchen and the living room,and there was wifi and cable TV to enjoy when not partaking in local activities.,
The neighborhood:,,,,,
The North End was a FANTASTIC place to stay. It was central to many of the major landmarks in the city,plus it had access to two major T stops. The food was around the apartment was fantastic (Giacomo's is 1 block away and worth the wait!),and you are walking distance to the Freedom Trail.,,,
The hosts:,,,,,
Not only did they contact me almost immediately upon accepting the reservation,they shared important information about the area,the apartment,and their method for distributing keys. They also reached out 2 weeks prior with more stay details and checked-in the day we arrived.,,
Overall,"an excellent experience. I hope to stay here again on my next trip to the city!\"",,,,

The place was clean, comfortable, and more than adequate for our needs.  The neighborhood is charming, with LOTS of places to eat.  It is conveniently located within easy walking distance of buses, trolleys, and the subway.  Our hosts were also very responsive to our initial email questions and phone calls when were staying in Boston.  I can highly recommend Carlos and Cheryl as hosts!"
369940,56297106,2015-12-12,11020250,Titia,"Cheryl an Carlos condo is in a vibrant spot of Boston. T stop Haymarket is about 5-6 minute walk. We found everything because of their detailed information that they send over email. The interior is basic, but everything works well. Beds are very comfortabele. If you just need a place to sleep because the rest of the day you want to be out to explore Boston, this is a very good choice!"
369940,58765853,2016-01-05,11241689,Greg,"\"Brilliant apartment.  In the centre of Boston's \"\"Little Italy\"\"."
Transport,harbour and city all easy walks.,,,,
Carlos and Cheryl are very easy to deal with.  They provide a comprehensive manual on the apartment and all the best spots in the area.,,,,,

369940,69635057,2016-04-12,49766887,Andrea,"Everything was fine. Great apartment, isolated in a good area of the city. The description of the announce war right and everything goes well. The apartment was clean and nice."
The only thing is that there's no parking so,if you have a car,be careful to find out a good place where place your car because near parking areas are expensive (but both told me earlier so that's not their problem).,,,

369940,70675976,2016-04-19,10002397,Angela,We loved our stay in the North End! This condo is in a perfect location to see all the best that Boston offers! My husband was running the Boston marathon and we were in a great location for him to get to and from all the events associated with the run as well as getting to and from the race itself.
Little Italy is wonderful and packed with restaurants. There are also great places for more casual dining. We did not do any cooking at the condo,but all the basic amenities were provided.,,,,
The beds were super comfortable as well!! We have travelled a lot and have had many uncomfortable sleeping arrangements,but the bed in this condo was so nice! Not too firm not too soft. We slept like angels.,,,,
"We would definitely be back in a heartbeat to this location. We can't wait for our next trip to Boston. \"",,,,,
369940,78716507,2016-06-08,34487146,Jennifer,"We so appreciated the clear instructions and all of the traveler's advice and guidance! The apartment was perfect for us- 2 parents and 2 kids (11 and 14.) We appreciated having the well stocked kitchen as a place to have breakfast and not have to eat out every meal. We also appreciated the 2 comfy bedrooms with great beds, and having a separate living room to stretch out on the couch relax at the end of the day."
369940,81551923,2016-06-23,53090911,Amanda Brian,Our hosts were wonderful! Answered all of our questions quickly - especially when I forgot some important information
369940,93760572,2016-08-13,46458636,Graham,"Apartment just as described and nice and quiet considering that it is city-centre.  Great neighbourhood - right next to the Freedom Trail and plenty of Italian-American restaurants, delis and shops. Easy enough to walk to the city centre.  We recommend it."
369940,96809047,2016-08-24,26704884,Jannette,"Carlos and Cheryl were very organized and attentive hosts. Overall,they provided clear and accurate instructions and advice regarding  the listing.They were very easily reached by phone or email."
The space was very clean,charming and had all the amenities promised. It is well suited to the needs of travelers. I stayed with my husband and 2 teenage children. We found the  beds and sofa comfortable and there was adequate space for food prep,eating and relaxing.,,,
The location was excellent. The condo is close to tourist sites and tour bus stops. The area has several restaurants within walking distance with the famous Mike's pastry being nearby. It was a short  walk to the grocery store and we were able to obtain items for breakfast for each day that we were there. There was a palpable charm to the area and it was indeed an Italian neighborhood .,,,,,
The only issue we had was with parking. It was very costly to use the local garage as we were charged an overnight as well as a daily rate regardless of how much time were parked there. The rates also kept changing.We had no choice but to use the garage since we drove into the area. It was also about a five minute walk in from the garage.,,,,,
"I think this location is more suited to travelers who fly into area and therefore would not need to have a car for the most part.\"",,,,,
13443949,80409953,2016-06-18,62176204,Jing,"As you can see from the pictures, this room is in the loft, which is the third floor. I had two pieces of luggages and they are pretty heavy. Since there was neither elevator nor anyone welcoming me, I had to lift all the luggages by myself to the third floor. However, the room was UNBEARABLY HOT in the afternoon. The host said she was going to have an air conditioner in a few days, and gave me a fan that saved my life. The night was fine, but during the day the neighbor was so NOISY. Because every time the redline passes this house, the house seems to be shaken all over so I woke up really early the next morning. When I tried to go out and get some breakfast, a funny thing happened -- I can't open the door from inside anyhow. I was so desperate and called the host for help. The guy who rents this house helped me to open the door. I don't feel I was welcomed at all. Why would anybody think that merely having an empty bedroom would make them an Airbnb host? After all, what people like about Airbnb is that it's supposed to provide good experience and service. This one does none of it. If you don't lack another 20 bucks or so, it's highly recommended that you find a nice hotel in Boston."
13443949,82410556,2016-06-27,69574915,Alexander,Very nice experience. Perfect for cross country travellers looking for a quick place to stay. She left the key at the door for us and walked us up to our private room via phone. Very simple process. definitely would stay again if I'm travelling cross country on a tight budget :).
13443949,84023471,2016-07-05,29003629,Deborah,"The location was conveniently close to the redline and easy to find. When we got there, the owner wasn't there but a key was provided in a lockbox so getting in wasn't a problem. The host was very accessible and responded to texts promptly. She also made checking in and out very easy. We got in pretty early and needed a place to store our luggage when we left and she was very accommodating. Overall, it was a great stay. The room was clean and she even provided ramen and chips for snacks! Highly recommended."
13443949,87692837,2016-07-21,83396653,Debkanta,"I liked Sulian's hosting. I was traveling from New York To Boston and we missed our bus. And we reached very late at 5 am, but still she made sure that we didn't have any problem which was too kind of her. I liked almost everything and also it was very convenient for conveyance since it was just beside the red line and also very close to Boston downtown."
13443949,88033370,2016-07-23,24119236,Danijela,Sulians place is a cheap and good option if you need to stay close to public transportation. The communication with Sulian was quick and easy. The room is quite hot in the summer. But all in all it's a good budget accommodation.
13443949,88571247,2016-07-24,79686368,秉謙,It was good if you wanna save money.
13443949,89052811,2016-07-26,2941738,Lisianne,Cheaper option for a large room since Boston hotels are so expensive. Easy access to public transportation to airport and downtown. Very hot in the summer because the room is right under the roof. The bathroom could be a bit more cleaner but I guess this is what we get for the price. Easy communication with Sulian. Recommended for one night or two.
13443949,89552688,2016-07-29,69798571,Tingjun,Advantages:
1. Cheap,,,,,
2. Good position (near to downtown),,,,,
3. Clean,,,,,
4. Have some snacks for free,,,,,
5. Have some friendly neighbors,,,,,
Disadvantages:,,,,,
1. Hot (They have AC and fan,but you know that it would spend some time to cool down below the roof),,,,
2. Crude decorations (It's fine to live in,but don't have to high expectations),,,,
3. Small bathroom,,,,,
ps: We didn't meet Sulian,but everything was working well. RECOMMEND to YOUNG PEOPLE!,,,,

3075044,47036299,2015-09-15,32775395,Tracy,The house is located in a quiet neighborhood. Everything is just perfect. I will book it without hesitation if I stop by Boston next time.

3075044,51072184,2015-10-17,44362167,Harishchandra,I lived at Andrea's place for 3 nights. It is just 2 minutes from the public transport and very peaceful. Andrea is kind and supportive providing flexible check in times. I highly recommend it for people who come to Boston for the first time.
3075044,51512930,2015-10-20,20523000,Ryan,"Andrea was a great, friendly host. My girlfriend and I were only in the Boston area for a few days and spent most of our time in Downtown Boston and Cambridge. Public transit is close by but we ended up using a combination of Lyft and Uber for most trips. Lyft seems to be growing in the area but not quite on the same level as SF (where we are from). Roslindale itself seems like a great place to relax and I definitely recommend checking out the Arthur Aboretum just a little bit north. Overall, I would recommend Andrea - great experience for our first AirBnB!"
3075044,54485552,2015-11-20,49161302,Christian,"\"Andrea was a nice guy. We didn't have much interaction, but he seemed like a pleasant guy. That being said, and to be honest, I thought the room, specifically the bed and sheets, smelled like they had been used a lot recently. There was a \"\"greasy\"\" feeling to the bed and sheets that made sleeping in it less than desirable. The house also had an unpleasant odor that made me a bit nauseous. Again"
3075044,55042770,2015-11-27,22378665,Remco,"We had an excellent stay at Andrea's place during Thanksgiving. Andrea is a friendly host. The room is larger than it looks in the pictures. There is a wardrobe cabinet. In the cabinet there where towels, coffee, tea. Even toothpaste and brand new toothbrushes, in case you forgot them."
The location is just beyond the reach of Boston metro system,"but there are good bus connections to the metro.\"",,,,
3075044,55698180,2015-12-04,7940742,Margaux,Andrea was a wonderful host and the nearby Roslindale Village has lots of quirky little attractions. His little dog was a delightful addition!

The only thing we regret is not being able to spend as much time with Andrea and Mochino! Thank you for an amazing 5 days in Boston! 10/10 would stay again."
3075044,74907801,2016-05-17,9204142,Sean,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.

The room and the bathroom was very comfortable and clean, and we felt at home. Although we had to take the metro followed by the bus everyday to get to Andrea's house, would still consider it relatively accessible. Great stay overall, recommended!"
3075044,79343812,2016-06-12,39956760,Willie,Andrea was a perfect host. The cabinet with fresh toothbrushes for us and a token for a free coffee at the local coffee shop was a nice touch. What a great experience to start our Airbnb journeys.

3075044,87505047,2016-07-20,34251977,Melvin,Andrea is a great host. He was able to pick us up from Forrest Hills station as there weren't any busses running anymore. The place is quite nice and very close to the bus stop to Forest hills station. Thanks Andrea for the nice time and of course your hospitality.
3075044,88798166,2016-07-25,35728188,Jen & Steph,Andrea was super organized and our stay went off without a hitch! It was a quiet and charming space just as he describes in the listing. Andrea was available and helpful during our stay. The surrounding area was also a nice retreat from the downtown bustle.

He gave us all of the room information quickly and let us crash like the tired puppies we were. He has an adorable dog, too! The room was just as shown and very cozy. Everything was awesome."

44205,104737,2010-09-25,77305,Bill,Elizabeth's Elegance at Salem Street Court listing. What a delight!
Elizabeth was incredibly helpful in setting me up at the apartment. She reached out looking to help me plan my time in Boston,and a nice booklet in the apartment so I could get to know the neighborhood and she even left snacks!  I also needed to make a last minute change to my reservation and Elizabeth was very accommodating.,,,,
The apartment is spacious with a large master bedroom,a nice living room with multiple couches and chairs and a large bathroom.,,,,

Gorgeous artwork, fresh flowers, lovely balcony and shared courtyard for outdoor enjoyment.  Sky lights in bath and living room.  King size bed, very large bath (with bidet)and wonderful towels, small frig which is stocked on arrival with healthy and yummy foods, including coffee, bagels, cream cheese, other cheeses and preserves, orange juice, milk and dark chocolate bar.

44205,115667,2010-10-10,252711,Madge,"We stayed with Elizabeth when we returned to Boston after 30 years.  It was a delightful discovery:  warm, hospitable, and comfortable.  I loved the sophisticated combination of furnishings and the library.  The balcony was a treasure after a long day of walking.  Elegance on Salem Street Court was wonderful and so was Elizabeth.  We will definitely stay here the next time we come to Boston."
44205,120623,2010-10-17,230091,Maria,"Elizabeth was great from the time we started trying to make our reservation, very helpful in every aspect. We felt welcome before we ever stepped foot inside of Elegance at Salem Street Court. The house is great beautifully decorated with top of the line linens and anything you could possibly need. I am sure they are but if Elizabeth treats everyone half as well as she did us there should never be any negative reviews of her. Thanks for a great place to stay we will recommend Elizabeth to anyone that wants to come to Boston and if we ever find ourselves coming back we want to stay here."
44205,121903,2010-10-18,184137,TDizzle,"My partner and I had a lovely night at Elizabeth's property. The historic building has a beautiful interior and Elizabeth's appreciation of design and art is very clear. The space is clean, spacious and welcoming; we could have happily spent our whole weekend lazing about the space. Would definitely stay again."

"C'est un endroit accueillant et près de tout. \"",,,,,
44205,128762,2010-10-28,228771,Karen,"You could never ask for a more graceful hostess than Elizabeth.  She went out of her way to make us feel comfortable and as if we were still in our own home. The home was beautiful with moroccan style furnishings and the leather sofas were most luxurious.  The skylight in the sitting room was fun to look up at the stars or watch the clouds go by. If you wanted, you  could sit in a tub of water in the bathroom, where there was another skylight and gaze up at the stars and it would almost be like you were outside and gazing at the stars. The little balcony overlooks a garden and you could see all around.  The neighborhood was  safe to walk to the nearest shopping mall and to the T station which is about 9 minutes away. There are great places to eat not far away and you could be happy just to stay there all the time. Don't miss your chance to have a great experience with real courteous people like those you will find on Salem Street."
44205,132090,2010-11-02,225937,Sheryl,"Elizabeth is warm, friendly and treated us remarkably well. Her apartment was a lovely oasis to come back to at day's end. I wish we were there right now enjoying the fireplace and cozy surroundings. This was our first experience with airbnb and would consider this suite in Charlestown to be quite a find! Thanks Elizabeth for everything!"
44205,134572,2010-11-07,241575,Rebecca,"We could not have been more impressed or happy with our stay at Elizabeth’s Moroccan suite. She met us outside to help with parking, showed us the suite that had absolutely everything we needed (snacks, breakfast, extra blankets & towels, etc) along with incredible Moroccan decor, and then she even followed up with directions and a map with subway instructions to where we needed to get to that night. The location was great- close enough for a walk to Bunker Hill, an easy walk to the T to get to downtown Boston, and lots of great little restaurants also within walking distance."
In short,we didn’t want to leave! Thanks so much Elizabeth,hope to see you again.  Rebecca & Blake.,,,
"\"",,,,,
44205,141798,2010-11-20,273252,Zach,"Elizabeth's Moroccan suite is a beautiful and unique place to stay in Charlestown neighborhood of Boston MA.  It's about a $35-40 cab ride from Logan.  The suite is on the second floor, Elizabeth lives on the third, and Elizabeth kindly invites you to share the downstairs sitting rooms."
The orange line T train is  a quick walk,and the bus to downtown Boston is also very close.  Wireless access....food...nice lines..local info...are all provided. Great place to stay!,,,,

44205,142303,2010-11-21,282582,Scott,Elizabeth was a wonderful host and the Moroccan suite was a welcomed space to relax in after a long week of working and bouncing from hotel to hotel.  Definitely a place to come back to next time I'm in Boston and will likely skip the hotels altogether!
"\"",,,,,
44205,162382,2011-01-02,128258,Rebecca,Elizabeth's home was a great place to stay while in Boston for New Years. It is close to the T and a nice coffee shop. The house was stocked with lots of great extras for us and the bed was the most comfortable I've slept in for a long while! I would definitely stay here again.

44205,259375,2011-05-11,435929,Hugh,"Charlestown may seem a little out of the way if you're looking at a guidebook but this was a great location.  There are shops and restaurants within a few minutes walk, and a subway station 10 mins walk away."
After the first couple of nights we moved to the other suite in the building (http://www.airbnb.com/rooms/29765) because there had been a cancellation.  It swapped a washing machine and balcony for a well-appointed kitchen,which suited us better.  Both were gorgeous and confortable,though :-),,,
Elizabeth was charming,kind and helpful,"and we'd be happy to stay there again if we come back to Boston/Cambridge.\"",,,
44205,309386,2011-06-12,513163,Anne,"We had a great stay at Salem Street Court!  The rooms were beautifully appointed, clean, and filled with extra touches.  Elizabeth made us feel at home with comfortable linens, special soaps, a bottle of wine and plenty of goodies.  Breakfast of bagels, orange juice, and milk was in our refrigerator.  This property is in easy and safe walking distance of many restaurants for eating out or pick up to eat in the luxury of Elegance at Salem Street Court.  We enjoyed the walk to the subway stop where we could board the T to explore Boston at our leisure.  You can also take the Freedom Trail to walk over the bridge into North Boston for great Italian food.  Charlestown is great too with it's own proud history including Bunker Hill and The U.S. Constitution.  Lots of fun and no problems!"
44205,340660,2011-06-28,441972,David,We stayed @ Salem Street a week ago and if there is one take away it is that I have NO IDEA why I have been staying in hotels up until now.
I own a small production company and we were in town from LA to shoot a commercial.,,,,,
We arrived exhausted (red eye flight) and found a cozy coffee house 2 blocks from Salem Street.,,,,,
Although Elizabeth was out of town she had several people on point to insure everything was dialed. From fresh cut flowers to a fridge full of water and other snacks,nothing about this place smacks of anything but a home away from home. Seriously.,,,,
All the amenities are there. Wireless internet,cable television,air conditioning. It also happens to be one of the oldest structures in Boston of which you can read about in a detailed book of notes that also includes where to go secrets about town.,,,
I was weary to do this as it was my first Air BNB experience and we were going to be working 15 hr days but I am so glad we did.,,,,,
If you are considering staying here you should just do it. It rocks.,,,,,

You will barely hear anything from outside traffic.  The location is a quick walk to the orange line so it easy very convenient to downtown Boston.
44205,538746,2011-09-17,864171,Laura,We stayed at Elegance at Salem Court for five nights and we loved it. The apartment is gorgeous - as nice or nicer than a hotel room but with a more homely feel. Elizabeth was the perfect host too. We were really sad to leave and will definitely stay again if we return to Boston.
44205,553986,2011-09-21,976759,Christian,"This was a wonderful suite very near downtown Boston and only minutes from the T.  We loved our stay as it included not only a beautiful bedroom with an amazingly large and comfy bed, it also had a beautiful living area and bathroom.  The balcony was great and nice and sunny in September!  Elizabeth is very friendly and even provided us with coffee and fresh pastries in the suite each morning!  There is a washer/dryer in the bathroom too and although we did not use it, it is helpful to know that next time we can save on baggage fees and pack a little lighter if we feeling like doing wash."
Only suggestion to people is that if you plan to go back and relax in the evening make sure,if you want it,"to buy your wine or any beer while still in downtown as the convenience store across the street does not sell alcohol and there are no other places to buy any alcohol after 9 pm it seems. (except for the restaurants and bars of course!)  All and all this was 100 percent worth the money and much better than a hotel!  Also we used a cab to get to and from the airport and it will run you between 25 and 30 dollars with tip each way and definitely is worth saving time with your luggage and not using the T for that as the T is a maze in itself and takes some time to figure out!  Thanks!  Chris and Jen\"",,,
44205,596577,2011-10-04,822590,Darby,We had an amazing experience at Elegance at Salem Street Court. Very beautiful place. Really convenient to all of Boston.

Every photo that is published is 100% true and refelcts how the environment looks like.,,,,,
In other Airbnb rentals we have to take care of everything,but here we got the bed made and each morning a fresh breakfast was in the fridge.,,,,
The location is in Charlestown,only 500 meters (sorry,don't know it in feet or yards) from Bunker Hill Memorial. That means,if you do the Freedom Trail tour and come to the end of it,you're almost back home. How great is that?,
If we come back to Boston ever again,"we will first ask Elizabeth if we can stay there again.\"",,,,

Elegance is unique and Elizabeth knows how to make your stay special with all the small details that make this your own home throughout your stay. We enjoyed all the luxuries that the apartment had to offer especially  the wonderful log fire on our return each night!,,,,,

44205,1167354,2012-04-23,1800878,Laura,"This place was a fantastic find! We stayed for 5 nights in this luxurious and comfortable suite with extremely attentive and friendly hosts. The rooms were well decorated and very clean and we had complete privacy; so much so that we only met the hosts in person on the last day (a shame as they are lovely people). Each day while we were out they replenished our fridge with tasty breakfast foods, changed the towels and tidied up the suite. Any queries we had were answered quickly and we were made to feel important. The area itself was also very pleasant, was within walking distance to central Boston and felt safe at night. Overall we could not have asked for better accommodation and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to friends. If ever we are in Boston again we will be sure to stay here!"

It's right by the T (subway), which we took everywhere we went, and it's also by some great coffee places and a little convenient store. We really couldn't have asked for a better place to stay during our time in Boston, and when we go back there for another visit we're hoping she'll have a room available! Don't talk yourself out of staying at this place, I promise you won't regret making it your getaway home."

The beautiful and roomy bathroom was a nice surprise, but I think it was the softest sheets ever that put Elegance at Salem Street over the top.  We will be back:)."

The location is lovely, in a quiet, historic neighborhood in Charlestown. We actually found ourselves not wanting to leave to see the sights, it was so nice!"
The bed is amazing,you will sleep like a rock here. Beautiful linens and towels,and the art and fine furnishings all contributed to a 5 star stay.,,,
Elizabeth was a great hostess,as well. I ran into some personal challenges leading up to our stay and she was in regular contact with important information so that once I had my ducks in a row,we were able to head to Boston and knew exactly what we needed to do (and where to go) for checking in. We had a great initial tour of the apartment,including help in navigating the neighborhood parking zones,and had appropriate communication from Elizabeth during our stay to ensure everything met our expectations,and then in arranging for check-out.
The apartment is a quick hop to the subway,about 5-10 minutes depending on how fast you walk. Elizabeth also provided us with a phone number for the local taxi company,which we used once,and they were very prompt,clean and courteous. She also left a guide with things to do in the neighborhood and nearby neighborhoods (North End,Cambridge
All in all this was a great experience and I'd highly recommend staying at Elizabeth's beautiful apartment.,,,,,

The accomodation was superb with a large comfortable bed,a large sitting area and well equiped bathroom,all very clean,both the bedroom and sitting area had TV,,
Elizabeth,the hostess looked after us very well,giving us a briefing of what to see,where to go and the local restaurant scene.,,
"Charlestown is 5-10 mins away from downtown Boston on either the \"\"T\"\"(metro) or local 92 bus",which passes the end of Salem St.,,,,
The accomodation is also very quiet.,,,,,
Charlestown is a lovely neighbourhood just a couple of miles from downtown Boston and a 5 minute walk from Bunker Hill,,,,,
I certainly would have no hesitation to stay here again should we visit Boston again and I have told Elizabeth,that should any of my friends be in Boston,"I would point them in her direction\"",,,
44205,2728281,2012-10-27,3421759,Joanne,"We had a nice stay at Elegance at Salem Street.  It was just 3 stops from downtown on the subway and a 5-10 minute walk with a grocery store and CVS on the way in case you need anything.  The apartment was fairly spacious, but there was not much place to put things, such as luggage, due to so much furniture.  The bed linens were great, soft and comfortable.   It was nice to have breakfast, but would have been nice to have some variety and more space to prepare and eat it.  If ever in Boston again, this would be a good option."
44205,2747016,2012-10-29,102304,CHRistine,"Elizabeth was wonderful.  Completely professional in her response time, that is always helpful when trying to plan a extensive trip.  She contacted us the day before letting us know that a family emergency had come up and that her boyfriend would be our new contact.  Bill was great, he made us feel right at home and made sure we had everything we needed."
The photos don't do the space justice,it is much larger and comfortable then we had hoped.,,,,
The bottle of prosecco on the balcony at our arrival was such a lovely touch to begin our sunny weekend in Boston.,,,,,
"My next trip to Boston will no doubt include a stay at Salem street!\"",,,,,
44205,3446785,2013-01-31,2755474,Colin,"The Moroccan suite is such a beautiful and romantic room. It is clean, cosy, rustic and meticulously decorated, (very true to the photographs listed!). The bed is huge and so comfortable that it makes it hard to get up in the mornings! The place is also very well furnished with lots of television channels, and strong and fast internet connection. Elizabeth has a good collection of art books on her shelves, but nothing beats reading her extremely informative guide to the history of the house (and treasures around the house) and Boston."
I'll rate this as one of the best Airbnb experience I've ever come across,and would recommend this place in a heartbeat. Elizabeth and Bill are fantastic hosts! They are very hospitable,patient and gracious,"and they will do their very best to make your stay a more than pleasant one. Thank you Elizabeth and Bill! :) \"",,
44205,3487351,2013-02-06,4174394,Catherynne,"Elizabeth is an absolutely amazing host. She made us feel so cared for--brought us breakfast pastries every morning as well as wine and orange juice. (Her romance package is wonderful!) She was available for any questions we had, changed linens, shared maps and guides, and our experience could not have been better. The apartment is even more gorgeous than the pictures, impeccably decorated, centrally located to airport and trains, and in every way a completely rewarding and luxurious getaway. I cannot say enough good things!"
44205,5131992,2013-06-14,5474393,Michael,"We had a great stay in Elizabeth's Moroccan Suite. The place itself was extremely comfortable, and provided a great mix of a New England bed and breakfast and an exotic getaway."
Before I mention anything else,the bed is probably the most comfortable I have ever experienced. It is huge and fluffy. I could have stayed in the bed for hours upon hours.,,,,
Also,the place is easily accessible from downtown Boston. A subway stop is less than a 10 minute walk away and only a few stations from anywhere you would want to go.,,,,
Elizabeth was a great host as well. She responded quickly to any questions and emails,and provided an extensive guidebook that had great restaurant recommendations.,,,,
The suite is in the Charlestown area,which is historically beautiful and nice to walk around. The only downside is the lack of decent restaurants in the area. There are a few but you'd be better off going into Boston proper for a nice dinner. At the end of the day,this did not take away from our stay at all.,,,
I would recommend staying here 100% and would not hesitate to book the place again!,,,,,

44205,5251113,2013-06-20,2152579,Anita,"I had a wonderful stay at Salem Street Court, I highly recommend this place. Elizabeth is a wonderful and knowledgeable host, I loved that she stocked the fridge with milk, O.J, water and a few snacks. The apartment is beautiful with the exposed beams and European touches. This neighborhood is quieter than many in the Boston area, yet lovely (boasts an amazing café just around the corner) and would be great home base for any length of stay. Thanks again Elizabeth, I hope to be back soon!"
44205,5883536,2013-07-21,6053801,Hristo,"Amazing! Very kind hosts, wonderful atmosphere and great time! My one stop when visiting Boston"
44205,6598528,2013-08-18,7722883,Clint,"I do not believe that we could give praise and thanks enough for Elizabeth's fantastic property and even more generous hospitality. My wife and I spent our honeymoon in and around Boston and returning here each afternoon was such a welcome treat. From the flowers and decor to the historic nature of the exposed ceiling beams, everything about this suite speaks of tasteful luxury and comfort. We could not speak highly enough of this rental, its location (Charlestown is more than beautiful), proximity to local culture, and walkability to the city, and we would not hesitate to visit again."
44205,6831740,2013-08-26,7313869,Giacomo,"If you found a vacancy in Elizabeth's place, book it now!it has been a great experience for my family. The place is fantastic, the location is great and Elizabeth will help you from the moment of booking, in case you need it."

44205,7011787,2013-09-03,2011415,Sarah,"Elizabeth's apartment was the perfect place to stay in Boston. The decor of the place is fantastic and totally different than anywhere else we have stayed. The bathroom is fantastic! The bed... the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever experienced. The apartment was close to the T (5-minute walk) and there was a Whole Foods and CVS two blocks away. Staying in Charlestown was so much better than staying in busy downtown Boston and the T makes it simple to get anywhere in the city anyway. We were given orange juice and bagels/pastries every morning by the wonderful B&B manager, Margaret, who checked on us frequently to make sure we had everything we needed. Both Elizabeth and Margaret were easily accessible via text/phone throughout the duration of our stay. Although we did not meet Elizabeth (she was out of town), we did have the chance to chat with Margaret as we were leaving and she was delightful! We will definitely be back the next time we're in Boston."

Elizabeth and Bill were gracious and generous hosts...dietary needs were met...the accommodation ever so comfortable...the decor exquisite!  We walked miles and miles exploring various routes to numerous destinations and found the location in Charlestown to be perfect...historically interesting, central and yet quiet.  Do not think twice about making a reservation at this location!"
44205,8286247,2013-10-23,9406857,Tony,"Elizabeth was more than accommodating. She was great. The place was great. We had a full trip planned but if I got the opportunity to go back I would definitely plan some time to hang out in the room. The book selection was amazing, and the patio was great."

44205,9149750,2013-12-09,2858236,Hope,"Elizabeth and Bill have created a luxurious and homey oasis at Salem Street Court. The suite was gorgeous and comfortable, complete with a fireplace, beautiful decor, and every amenity you could want - even a small white noise machine! (Perfect for a restless sleeper like myself.) Elizabeth and Bill are also incredibly attentive to your needs, providing a lovely variety of yogurts, breakfast pastry and bottled water (amongst other goodies). Thank you again for a wonderful weekend escape!"
44205,9539790,2014-01-02,1846535,Kris&Kristin,The apartment is fantastic. Incredibly well furnished. Large and spacious. Liz and bill go the extra mile to make sure we are accommodated and have everything we need. A great breakfast is provided. Wine on arrival. Coffee and juice etc. couldn't have asked for a better place in Boston. Easy access to the train line. Walking distance to the city as well. It is only a few minutes walk to bunker hill which is at the start of the freedom trail (must do when in Boston). Cannot recommend this place enough. Better than staying at a hotel.
44205,10113980,2014-02-01,9886966,Pat,It was fantastic experience to stay in Elizabeth's suite. Elizabeth is a very kind and thoughtful lady who provided the completed travel reference docs for us in advance and as well as the health breakfast when we arrived. I do appreciate of her kindness and would like to recommend Elizabeth's amazing & comfortable suite to the friends who has the plan to Boston.
44205,10140438,2014-02-02,11615136,Thaddaeus,"I had the delightful experience of staying in both suites that Elizabeth offers on airbnb and would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone visiting Boston.  Every detail was perfectly attended too, from fresh flowers and wine, to firewood ready to light.  Its easy to see that Elizabeth loves what she does and has filled her elegant home with a romantic blend of antiques from travels near and far.  What are you waiting for?  Surprise your sweetheart with a home away from home weekend in one of America's most historic neighborhoods!"
44205,10280210,2014-02-10,3320541,Dan,Elizabeth was an excellent host!  Her place is very unique and cozy.  We enjoyed some of the special touches she provided like a bottle of wine and refrigerator stocked with breakfast items along with a real wood burning fireplace.  This was our first trip to the Charlestown area of Boston and we thoroughly enjoyed the neighborhood.
44205,15537646,2014-07-11,6723807,Harald,We had a wonderful stay in Boston at Elizabeth's loft. The apartment is very stylish furnished. We loved to take our breakfasts on the balcony watching the tomatoes and peppers growing on the rooftop. Most of all we enjoyed the very comfortable bed! Elizabeth provided us with all information needed in advance so that everything went well. We can fully recommend this place. Thank you! Stephanie & Harald
44205,16452992,2014-07-28,12718699,Alison,Elegance at Salem Street more than surpassed our expectations. The apartment was very clean and comfortable and Elizabeth was the perfect host. She got the balance perfect between catering for our needs and letting us enjoy our privacy. The neighbourhood turned out to be an oasis in a busy city and after long sightseeing days we were perfectly happy to dine in the many fine restaurants we found in Charlestown. We would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone planning a visit to Boston.
44205,32918658,2015-05-23,32601288,Chuck,"Wonderful place to relax - in Boston for work, and great to come back to a real home, not a hotel. Everything was as promised and pictured. The bed was heavenly. Thank you, Elizabeth."

Anthony without you i would have been homeless....You got back to me so quickly, i was alone in Boston having finished a surgery when my original Airbnb had cancelled on me... I took a leap of faith with Anthony and he came through with flying colors.. i am forever grateful for his hospitality his patience in my not knowing how to really navigate this site and his way of just reaching out to help was truly remarkable. His studio apartment is beautifully crisp and immaculate streamlined to perfection. Everything you need is right there for you, - i am a bit of a clean freak and let me just say i couldnt find not one thing to clean for the life of me- unreal so cute and pretty,cozy and perfect, your someone i will never forget and i thank you from the bottom of my heart."

He gave clear directions on how to get to the apartment which was greatly appreciated as we had never been to Boston before. The apartment is on a nice old street with very beautiful buildings. The room does look like the photos, though one thing to note is that the \"\"queen bed\"\" is actually a futon. Which we did not know and was not very pleasant to sleep on. Other than that the rental was good.\""

But the best part I have to say was the host. Upon my arrival, my clumsy hands dropped the apartment keys in the elevator gap and I was locked out and stranded. Anthony left the keys for me a safe box outside the building so I wasn't sure if he was able to help. But he responded within 15 mins and gave me a new set of keys without even asking for a fee or anything for the lost keys! I really appreciate the hospitality!"

The apt is fully stocked (minus a toaster) on a quiet side street just minutes from Fenway. Great location for games!

Even though it is a basement apartment, there is planty of natural light coming in. It had nice space; my family of four was very comfortable.  The location is great. We were in town to visit come colleges (BU and Northeastern) and to see the Red Sox. All of this is within a very short walk. The neighborhood is great. It felt very safe and was pretty quiet despite being in the middle of everything.  Nearby there is a wide range of restaurants, a grocery store, Target as well as other nice sights like the MFA, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, the Fens... Great hombase for seeing a lot of Boston! Page is VERY responsive and easy to work with."

Paige is readily accessible via text which makes communication seamless.  The condo is just a couple blocks from the Fenway T stop on the green line so traveling in Boston is a breeze.  Beds are comfortable and kitchen is stocked.  There is plenty of room for a family to spread out comfortably.

The location was perfect for getting to the T or going to the ballpark, less than a 10 minute walk to each. The rooms were cozy and clean, the apartment itself was cozy and a nice kitchen.  We picked the hottest weekend all year to go so it was a little warm in there with no AC, but leaving the windows open helped. The only negative thing I would have to say is the seating, says it accommodates 8 but the only seating in the place is the futon in the living room that fits 3, 4 if you squeeze together, so had to sit on the floor most of the weekend. Besides that though the place was fantastic, would definitely stay there again!"
12592117,89030646,2016-07-26,44211515,Jason,Great place! Near Fenway.
12592117,89943969,2016-07-30,35766,Michele,"We rented this apartment as a group of colleagues attending a conference at Simmons, and it was wonderful to be so close! The listing accurately shows what this apartment is like, and it was a great space and good value for our purposes. We did wish there had been a small table and chairs for eating, given that there is a full kitchen, and that the only place to sit in the common area is a futon (which didn't fit the 4 of us staying in the apartment.) The realtor Paige was offsite but very responsive to questions. Thank you!"

Walking distance to Fenway, BU, Kenmore Sq - lots of restaurants and coffee shops. I would mention that there are AC window units in the living room and one bedroom."
12592117,92554516,2016-08-09,29404429,Lee,The hallway needs to be cleaned or part of the description.  It's truly disgusting.

6015995,49270442,2015-10-02,37247030,Amanda,"The location was great. The building had tons of amenities, and the apartment was spacious and nice. The move in instructions were helpful, and Kara was quick to respond. The only downside was the description was slightly off from the actual apartment. Pictures show a larger bed (double, queen, or king possibly?) Mine had two bedrooms each with two twin beds. Not a deal breaker by any means, but worth noting for expectation purposes."
6015995,68514666,2016-04-05,21689231,Kate,"The apartment is almost exactly as it looks in the photos.  It was clean, well furnished and spacious for two people.  The host left nice welcome packages. The one for the kitchen included laundry detergent, dish soap and a new sponge along with microwave popcorn."
It is in an apartment complex that feels separated from the surrounding neighborhood but is actually very accessible after crossing a couple of busy streets. It is adjacent to Mass General.,,,,,
There was a small issue was related to the host being based in a different state.  The concierge,who is employed by the building not the host,couldn't find the spare key to let us in to the apartment.  We had to wait in the lobby for 45 minutes while she resolved the problem. That being said,the host has a 24 hotline that we could have used but the concierge kept telling us she was working on it.  For all we know had we called the hotline,"the problem may have been resolved much more quickly.\"",

The apartment was adequate.  On arrival the unit was missing flat ware,dishes,a vacuum,frying pans and other kitchen utensils.  They were supplied within a few days.  There was broken furniture that needed replacement and repair; these were corrected within a few days.  A broken light switch and burnt out light bulbs were fixed by the building manager.,,
Overall,"it has turned out to be a comfortable temporary living quarter.\"",,,,

Kendall Square is lovely (if a little pricey) but a great location. The concierge was super helpful and the apartment complex was so easy to navigate. I cannot recommend this place enough!"
3867014,68765802,2016-04-06,1261246,Derek,"Third Apartment was one of the best airbnb experiences I've had. Not only was the apartment tidy and clean, it was well equipped with kitchen appliances when you need them. The receptionist was also incredibly helpful in helping us store our baggages before the check in time. I am extremely satisfied with the location and the size of the apartment. If I were to ever visit Boston again, I would definitely stay here again."
3867014,71422530,2016-04-25,24182445,Matthias,"Apartment nice, clean, perfect location - service not very good ..."
3867014,72547676,2016-05-03,31755069,Chris,I had a great experience during my time in Cambridge and this Airbnb was a big part of it. The location is very convenient to the MIT campus without being noisy. I stayed here while I attended a conference and it was great to be able to 'get away' to quiet bedroom only a few blocks away from everything.
I also appreciated their responsiveness to questions. There was a mix-up regarding check-in,but they messaged and called me very quickly to work it out. After that,"my stay was smooth sailing.\"",,,
3867014,73577779,2016-05-08,8494472,Kunal,Northeast Suites is an amazing place to stay at great price. I stayed at the Kendall square and loved the location (very accessible). Our suite was fully equipped with everything that we needed and the check-in/check-out process was quite easy and explained with detail. The best part was a full kitchen. oh and not to forget the view!!
"Would love to stay here again! \"",,,,,
3867014,74529256,2016-05-15,45405893,Diana,"\"The apartment is new, clean and very well located. It is also fully equipped with everything you might need. The down side though, is that the service team is not very helpful. I was not given the instructions until I asked on the day of arrival. Then the instruction listed the wrong Building (west vs east). The instruction says parking can be arranged if asked. However, when i asked, i was just told \"\"park in a nearby garage yourself\"\""
3867014,90357799,2016-07-31,53475107,Ivan,Excellent location. Facilities and apartment very good. Definitly I would rent again next time I travel to Boston.
7239024,38080508,2015-07-12,37995295,Simon,"We had a fantastic stay. Minter and Scott are wonderful and were extremely hospitable hosts. The room and bathroom themselves are great. Like our experience with the place in general, facilities include all first world comforts but so much more too. Minter and Scott are craftspeople and it shows!"
The house itself a great timber frame home built up against a grassy bank in one of Boston's historic neighbourhoods. The area is charming,with a park just across the way and plenty picturesque tree lined streets to stroll and explore. Also,the T is a few minutes walk away so traversing Boston at large is no sweat.,,,
What suited us especially was that we were given room to sit back and enjoy the house. It has a fantastic porch out front where we spent hours relaxing,having meals,etc,etc. It was undoubtably the centrepiece of our weekend.,,

The  room and bathroom were nice and clean and very spacious. Her home is only minutes away from Boston by Uber. Super convenient. We have nothing but positive things to say about our stay with Polly. Would definitely be coming back for our next trip to Boston!"
7239024,40645056,2015-08-01,20933235,Marta,"We had a wonderful time at Poly's house. 1) Poly is a generous host. We liked her breakfast, especially fruit salad and freshly baked muffins. In addition to usually offered in hotels bath amendments Poly provides with less common, e.g. shave foam. Poly is very responsive and helped us to print parking pass when we urgently needed it. 2) The house is old, however the bathroom and the room are well managed and clean. 3) Neighborhood is friendly, quiet, and the house is from walking distance to subway station. Thank you, Poly, for great Boston home stay experience!"

7239024,41665136,2015-08-08,11022738,Kate,Polly was an absolutely brilliant host. She was very warm and friendly Andrade us feel comfortable as soon as we arrived. She was also very flexible about our arrival time which was a bit later than expected as we were driving up from Cape Cod.
The house is beautiful,spacious and clean. Polly went out of her way to ensure that we had everything we could possibly need including beautiful breakfast muffins,fresh coffee and fruit. The neighbourhood was lovely and a short walk to two different train stations. Absolutely brilliant and with wonderful people. Highly recommended!,,,

She even showed up early to get coffee and fruit ready when she knew I was leaving early! Takes about 15 to 20 mins to get into town via red line, if you do not mind spending a day in town and come back to a quiet place to sleep, this can be for you :-)"

We were made to feel very weclome by Polly and her husband and as AirBnB first timers couldnt have hoped for a better host! We were a nightmare with communication as phones/laptops wouldnt get online, so we were uncontactable for the 2 days prior to arrival but Polly was very patient and proactive in trying to organise us! Would happily stay there again next time we visit Boston and would highly recommend!"

Nice cosy and romatic room,we loooved the flowers! We enjoyed the linnen en towels in a large clean room and great bed,perfecty arranged with the next door bathroom with all comoft too. You really know how to receive and please your guests Polly and go on like this!,,,
Breakfast was more than we desire and the extra use of the kitchen,front porch,relax areas were an abulous added value. Great location too,a nice walk to the subway and easy to visit Boston downtown.,,
To be honest,minor firts impressions on the house exterior but major respect on all the ongoing plans you're making to uplift all that.,,,,
Great,correct and respectful offer,"fully AirB&B worthy!\"",,,

Prime location with convenient access into Boston. Lovely home and hostess. If you are seeking comfort, cleanliness, hospitality and serenity look no further - Minter & Richter is it. I would highly recommend to all. 5 stars across the board."
7239024,47598590,2015-09-20,1897847,Kathrin,"Polly has been a very kind host. Communication was very good and she was caring a lot for us. She even came over and prepared breakfast early in the morning, which was pretty nice. We had our own car with us and Downton Boston has only been a 15 minutes drive away. Everything has been well prepared for us, although we just did a last minute booking. Thanks a lot!"
7239024,47988961,2015-09-22,40877891,Rene,This was our first experience with Airbnb and we could not have asked for a more perfect place. Great accommodations lovely owners and awesome hospitality. I would definitely return and recommend!
7239024,48197622,2015-09-24,39318567,Ruth,"We would highly recommend staying at this delightful property to anyone visiting Boston. Polly was a very gracious and helpful hostess and we were offered everything we needed for our stay, including a light breakfast every morning which was great. Our room was clean and well kept and the location was great, with a short walk to the T line for trains into downtown Boston (or if you want to drive the Interstate is just down the road). We would not hesitate to stay here again. Thanks Polly!!"
7239024,48368608,2015-09-25,4026432,Carina,"It was great at Polly's place. Very clean and quiet, and I liked that they provided small drugstore items of everything you can possibly need for a few nights if you forgot own stuff, and a fridge with free drinks. We just stayed a night and did not use it as a base for sightseeing, so I cannot speak to the location."
7239024,49075604,2015-09-30,39342596,Mauricio,"Staying at Polly's was akin to arriving at an oasis after traveling across harsh desert land.  I had spent the past 24 hours scrambling to relocate to Boston on short notice for a job I was going to start the next day.  It was a mad rush for me to pack my things and get to Boston with enough time to decompress and settle in properly. I had never been to Boston before and this was going to be my first time using Airbnb.  On my drive up, I took solace in the positive reviews and pictures of the accommodations - it certainly looked amazing and inviting......."
When I arrived,Polly and her family made me feel at home from the moment I stepped onto their property - their warmth,hospitality and amazing positive energy really was the icing on the cake - the place was even more charming in person - perfect ambiance and I quickly forgot about how arduous the previous 24 hours had been.,,,
Top notch accommodations - Thank you Polly and family!!!!,,,,,

She was prompt in responding to my inquiry, gave us helpful tips about directions and made sure we felt welcome on the afternoon of our arrival. The room was clean and nicely decorated. The bed was very comfortable and we slept well. Although we were just there one night we enjoyed dinner out in Dorchester and a lovely walk through the neighborhood the following morning. Polly was there early preparing fruit, muffins and coffee as she does for all guests."
7239024,49503878,2015-10-04,27495972,Leslie,Polly and Scott were great hosts.
Polly returned emails promptly and was very accommodating to our plans and schedule.  We were very comfortable with our rooms,they were clean,well decorated and spacious.,,,

7239024,49870773,2015-10-06,12582154,Kristy,I am so thankful for Polly's hospitality!  My husband and I were delayed in Boston due to flights cancelations and she excepted our booking at the  very last minute in the late evening.  She was super responsive and made us feel at home as soon as we arrived.  The bed was extra cozy and we truly enjoyed sitting on her front porch that evening.  She also answered all our questions about the getting back to the airport and suggested the most amazing Thai food restaurant. Polly really gave us a sense of comfort that evening. We are grateful to have met her.
7239024,50144585,2015-10-09,45173268,Ralph,"The facilities were very clean. The bed was comfortable & bathroom was big & handy. Loved the old world look of this period home.

7239024,51725758,2015-10-24,38919963,Mike,LOVED THIS PLACE!! Polly was an amazing host. It was the next best thing to being home. The room was clean and comfy and the kitchen always had fun stuff to eat. The location is close to everything and I loved the neighborhood!
7239024,52378597,2015-10-28,3429534,Crystal,"Due to a miscommunication, Polly was unaware we were coming in so room was not ready when we arrived. Luckily Polly was around so was able to get it ready while we enjoyed dinner nearby. Room is beautiful and looks just like the pictures. Loved that our dog was allowed to join us and the great lengths Polly goes thru to make sure guests are satisfied (providing bathroom toiletries, baked goods, etc). I woke up with one of the worst stomach bugs I've ever encountered and Polly thoughtfully gave me ginger ale and toast. 10 am checkout does seem a little earlier than most places, though understandable since they run a business downstairs. Location is great, would definitely recommend!"
7239024,53724796,2015-11-11,113991,Anya And Roman,"We absolutely loved our short stay at Polly's place! So cold outside, so cozy and warm in the room! A lot more than expected was in the room! Heater if needed, romantic led candles, live flowers!! Lots of bath treats. But most amazing - next day breakfast, we could hear incredible flavor of freshly baked banana bread the minute we woke up. Very hospitable and helpful host!"
Ps,although we rented a room,it was basically just us in the house. Came with a 3 y.o. child,"who loved it too!\"",,

She was super friendly,very accommodating,and generally a really neat person.  Very dog-friendly place - and her dog (next door w/ shared backyard) is super sweet.,,,
She baked coffee cake/muffins every morning (not only were they great,the place smelled amazing) and gave us fun recommendations and fun facts in/around the area from restaurants to dog (URL HIDDEN) the fact Mark and Donnie Wahlberg grew up at the house on the corner :) .  This was a GREAT first Air BnB experience - we'd definitely stay with Polly again if we make it back to the area!,,,,

Told polly we'd be staying for a stay-cation involving board games and such and she left us a small set up downstairs to play but also brought a card table up invade we wanted to play in the room.

Located in a beautiful Dorchester neighborhood on a dead end street with plenty of parking space this was just what I needed for an easy visit to Boston. A playground was located right next door and it was only a 15 min walk to the Red line at Ashmont Station. (Only a few stops into the heart of the city) The humidity was on 100% during my stay and it was so nice to walk into our room with the air conditioner pumping. The house itself is gorgeous with 300 year old wood floors. Polly checked in to make sure we arrived safely and gave us free access to anything in the fridge.

7239024,93346052,2016-08-12,87037774,Francis,Nous avons eu un séjour agréable et tout ce que nous avions besoin. Nos hôtesses étaient gentille et on répondu à toute nos demandes.
7239024,94110609,2016-08-14,78304990,Amber,"We loved staying at Polly's place!  Everything was super clean and comfortable.  When we arrived, there was a fridge full of cold refreshments we could enjoy, welcoming faces, and a nice, cool room to relax in before we went out for the day.  My favorite part was that she welcomed my dog as another guest.  We all felt at home during our stay."
7239024,96601988,2016-08-23,6772815,Sophie,Polly is super charming and welcoming. I had a great time staying at her place.
7239024,97022979,2016-08-25,16615233,Naomi,Polly was welcoming.  Clean bathroom and bedroom and wonderful front porch where I enjoyed breakfast every morning.
7239024,97923332,2016-08-29,72840003,Kathryn,Great quiet neighborhood full of classic Victorians. Well lit walkway and lovely front porch. Easy access process. Very nice room and bathroom. Super clean and pleasant. Nice towels and bed linens.
7239024,99098208,2016-09-03,3392521,Brandon,"Our stay here was great, especially since we were able to bring along our dog, Lucy. Very nice room and shared bathroom with plenty of towels and necessities. They've thought of everything! They also had plenty of parking on the street and coffee was waiting for us in the kitchen. Highly recommended!"
7239024,99336073,2016-09-04,44035774,Stefania,Great neighborhood and beautiful room.  Coffee was delicious!  We would stay again.

11772497,67070445,2016-03-26,48537878,Hung,"The apartment is conveniently located in the Chinatown area with many access to food and transport. It is clean and spacious. Overall, my experience in Boston is much more pleasant when staying in Alex's apartment. Although the Internet is pretty slow and there are not many amenities in the apartment, the apartment is a pretty good deal, considering how close it is to the central area. The host is really fast in response and helpful."
11772497,68038520,2016-04-01,64546673,Giacomo,The location is in downtown and this is fantastic for who will visit the city
11772497,68247804,2016-04-03,13854069,Natalya,Alex's place was great. Was only in town for one night and needed somewhere close to downtown to sleep. This spot was perfect. Alex's communication was quick and the place had everything I needed. Thanks!
"\"",,,,,
11772497,68627011,2016-04-05,41711074,Kevin,"Alex's apartment was very accommodating for me and my friends stay. It was tucked in the heart of Chinatown. While the building was a little sketchy, the apartment had an open layout with two very nice bedrooms. It was tough to get in contact with Alex during our 3pm check in, but that was partially my own fault for not notifying him about my arrival time. I would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to friends and family."
11772497,68942849,2016-04-07,42460451,Christine,"This apartment is in a great location in between china town and the financial district. Alex keeps everything clean and welcoming for his guest. There is plenty of sleeping space for multiple people, a fully equipped kitchen, comfortable living room area that even had a guitar for me play! Alex is a great host, he responded immediately to my messages and checked to make sure everything was satisfactory. I plan on revising on my next trip to Boston. I have stayed in many hotels and other air bnb's in the Boston area. Considering price, location and comfort, this place by far has the best value."
11772497,69836568,2016-04-14,20986273,Alexis,Alex's place is in a great location and close to everything. It's very spacious and definitely a steal in Boston.
11772497,69845799,2016-04-14,65128499,Andrew,Apartment was very clean and close to everything. Very easy to access building.
11772497,70251823,2016-04-17,59599759,Marybeth,"Alex's place was in a covenient location, very central to everything my friends and I did over the course of the weekend. He was quick to respond to any questions I had and checked in with me over the course of the weekend to make sure we were all set. I would definitely stay at Alex's again!"
11772497,70629248,2016-04-19,36379778,Peter,"The apartment is clean and simple. It is a handicap accessible apartment. Alex was as accommodating as possible for arrival times. We had an issue with hot water that Alex said was not typical. Additionally, there is no silverware, cups, plates, bowls etc in the apartment so plan accordingly. There is a tv but it is not connected to any cable so functionally, unless you bring your own system to connect to the tv, it is not really usable."
11772497,70868185,2016-04-21,66950774,Bill,Listing description was accurate. Alex left the apartment was very clean for us. Apartment was also very comfortable.  Overall I really enjoyed my stay.
11772497,71188834,2016-04-24,24984856,Chelsea,"Alex was prompt with all requests for information, and easy to communicate with via text and phone call.  Being really close to Boston Common was great.  Overnight parking was a bit of a bummer, as the lot next to the building charged $45 for the night, and the nearest garage would have meant lugging our stuff a good ways to the apartment. The apartment was comfortable for 2 adults and 3 kiddos, but lacked a little in useful items, such as a sharp knife for cutting fruit/veggies, bowls, real silverware, coffee filters for the coffee maker, and a place to sit and eat.  But, the sheets and towels were freshly laundered and the space was pretty clean.  All in all, a good place to stay, close to food and sights."
11772497,71411445,2016-04-25,67112480,Junjun,"Very convenient location to Freedom Trail and Tea Party Museum, vary spacious apartment. The check in and check out process are easy. What my kids like most is the books Alex left in the apartment. They are funny and informative."
11772497,71920191,2016-04-29,37758774,Frank,The house is clear with some drinks in the refrigerator.
The community is located in downtown area,and thus is somehow noisy in the night.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
11772497,72077139,2016-05-01,5799591,Emily,The apartment is really tidy and has everything we needed. It is exactly as the pictures show. It's also located conveniently near South Station/Chinatown and a two minute walk from the T.
11772497,72573765,2016-05-03,25229783,Weishun,"The place is a hidden gem in Boston. The location is great, and the apt is clean and spacious. I would recommend staying at Alex's place if anyone travels to Boston. The only thing can be improved is that maybe Alex can send us check-in information a bit earlier, but it is also partly my responsibility that I did not contact him in advance. Overall it was a great stay!"
11772497,72869899,2016-05-05,45615218,Pascal,"Large, clean, central apartment, very competitively priced vs Hotels."
11772497,73123717,2016-05-07,44354628,Lex,Excellent! Was able to accommodate our entire team of 6 in their stay to Boston.
11772497,73832471,2016-05-10,11745750,Jing,"Alex is great host! Although we never met when we stayed at his spacious and clean apartment, but he's very attentative and helpful. Not mention the location's great. Within a few minutes' walking distance to Chinatown, CVS, and sight seeing. We'd love to stay at his apartment again if we re-visit Boston in the future."
11772497,74021501,2016-05-12,63032141,Chen,"该房间地理位置非常好在唐人街,周边好吃的很多去哪里都比较方便。"
11772497,74199993,2016-05-14,25297811,Gabriel,Really easy to get in touch and get all the information we needed! Place was clean and bed were comfy. Nice place to crash to visit Boston! Id recommand it.
11772497,74563087,2016-05-15,63547863,Christine,Listing was accurate. Great location and great apartment. Alex was very professional and always available to answer any questions. I would definitely stay in this apartment again. Thank you!
11772497,75292129,2016-05-20,30135287,Hurriyyah,"When we arrived at the apartment, it was dusty all over the floor, the coffee table and the kitchen.  Cleaned up the apartment a little, so it was only a minor issue."
The apartment is just like in the photos and description. Great location for being near to the South End Station and T lines.,,,,,
Communication with Alex was great,"his responses were fairly quick. Alex did not check us in personally but his instructions were clear and very helpful too. We enjoyed our stay in Boston!\"",,,,
11772497,75408391,2016-05-21,64247785,Elicia,"Alex was very accommodating throughout my first Air BNB rental experience. Myself and four other friends rented out Alex's place for a girls weekend! The space was exactly as pictured, very cozy, comfortably accommodated all guests, and was a short walk to Downtown Crossing and South Station (which was very convenient for friends that were traveling from out of town). The location was definitely a bit closer to ChinaTown but it is definitely competitively priced compared with a number of other hotels that I was considering for the weekend. Very clean and the space smelled nice as well which is always a plus =]! All of my friends loved it! We had a lovely weekend!"
11772497,75688090,2016-05-22,35343712,Marykate,Listing was very accurate and check-in was very smooth! Would stay here again with friends for sure!
11772497,75933321,2016-05-23,20776603,Florencia,"The apartment was spacious and comfortable for four people. Location is great, near good restaurants in Chinatown and a few blocks from downtown. Good for one or two nights in Boston. The kitchen lacked a little in useful items, such as bowls, silverware, cookingware, coffee filters for the coffee maker, and a place to sit and eat, so if you stay longer, you should plan accordingly. We had an issue with the wi-fi, but Alex said it was not typical. Check in and out was not flexible as there were other people coming to the apartment. Alex was easy to reach and answered our questions quickly, he tried to help us find a place to leave our luggage after check out."
11772497,76148465,2016-05-25,60684352,Nevena,Everything was great!
11772497,76316194,2016-05-26,69400658,Tom,"Comfortable, clean and simple place at a great price in a good location.  Host was easy to work with.  Would use again and certainly recommend."
"\"",,,,,
11772497,76672357,2016-05-28,17462474,Jacklyn,"Alex was welcoming,  his information  made check-in easy, and he was prompt with responses to questions.  Mist info about listing was accurate, but we were disapointed about not having the cable TV as promised. Apparently this is an issue with building management,  but would have been nice to know."
11772497,76868563,2016-05-29,50086984,Brad,Pros: Alex was very responsive to emails and texts and had the AC running when we arrived (which we really appreciated on such a hot day!). The apt was very clean which we also really appreciated because we stayed at an Air BNB in Cambridge that was anything but. It's located in Chinatown and was only a few blocks away from Boston Commons where the music festival we went to was held.
Cons: The apt has one couch in the living room that's quite comfortable but doesn't provide much seating for a group of four or more. There weren't any coffee mugs or coffee filters,could use more blankets and a little head-up about the area: there's a couple blocks nearby that seem to be a hangout spot for drug dealers and homeless people. We saw a couple drug deals go down etc. during the day and were a little sketched out so we decided to take a cab home at night instead of walk. This might make some family's pretty uncomfortable. Also,the apt is quite loud.At night on a Saturday we could hear all the horns,yelling etc. from the street. It was so loud that I thought a window was open. But that's city life I suppose.,,
"All things considered we would probably stay here again.\"",,,,,
11772497,77207044,2016-05-30,64108787,Rob,"Exactly as described. Clean and comfortable, good location. Alex was very communicative. Try the Chinese restaurant below."
11772497,78193779,2016-06-05,56025793,Ben,"Had a great time and everything was as described! Only a block and a half from the Chinatown subway station so it made using the T very convenient and we even walked many times no problem, thanks again Alex!!"
11772497,78754813,2016-06-08,9209873,Chloe,"Alex was very quick on replying to all the queries we had. Location was nice and central, It is close to Chinatown, so as always be aware that some people might not find it comfortable. The flat was clean and the building was newish in general."
Could do with some pots/pans/kitchen utensils for some minor cooking.,,,,,
Towels/blankets don't look very clean,"but we were only there for 2 nights. \"",,,,
11772497,79003010,2016-06-10,63179282,Bowen,"Alex was great as a host and me and my family thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. The apartment is located in Chinatown and is within walking distance to Boston common and Newbury street, including many restaurants and malls. The apt is very spacious and everything is neat and tidy"
11772497,79390828,2016-06-12,66879649,Veronica,Decent stay. The home was clean and had plenty of room. My party and I were in town celebrating Boston Pride so the location of this home was actually perfect. With the T station very close it made the commute to each event easy. I'll choose this home again if I ever need a place to stay while in Boston.
11772497,80232386,2016-06-17,67787881,Shawn,"Was great and everything that I needed was right there for me during my stay. One thing and it's a minor gripe listing mentions cable TV, there is a TV there, just no cable. Yet, for what I was staying there for it wasn't a big deal at all. Look forward to staying there again!"
11772497,80533586,2016-06-18,51479411,Chiara,"The apartment is very well located, clean and with good size comfy beds. It's very basic but got all you need for a week end break."
"\"",,,,,
11772497,81002547,2016-06-20,68690989,Manuel,Our host let us take the room into out own hands. The kitchen had enough equipment to make us feel like we were living in Boston.
11772497,81296788,2016-06-22,31163384,Kiernan,Check in instructions were clear and Alex was available to text with any questions. Cable didn't work but I think that's more of an issue for the building. Quiet apartment building~~ some parking options (garage a block away/ lot right next to the building)~~both kind of expensive but thats parking in the city in general. The location of this apartment is great! A great spot for a night in the city/ comfy beds and lots of room for guests. Will keep this spot in mind next time I'm in Boston!
11772497,81419094,2016-06-22,69067267,Kelly,Basic but value for money considering the local rates. Friendly helpful host. Comfy beds however TV wasn't working.
11772497,81588274,2016-06-24,17919786,Ryan,"Great location for nightlife and late night eats in Chinatown. Easy access to the T, and within walking distance to almost anywhere downtown. Was perfect for the 6 of us on our overnight stay!"

11772497,83946519,2016-07-04,39286668,Megan,"Alex did a great job making us feel comfortable in his rental. Things were ready for us and he even let some of the group check in early the day that we arrived. He also let a group check out way later than expected which was nice. The neighborhood was in Chinatown, but we were able to walk to mostly everything. Alex was quick to response with anything that we needed."
One downfall about the place is the shower. There is hardly any pressure,so it was tough to take a normal shower there.,,,,
Overall,"it was a decent place to stay in the city of Boston.\"",,,,
11772497,84651476,2016-07-08,32913107,Raimo,Alex was precise and prompt in answering the booking request and all other questions. The apartment is very basic and minimally furnished. Ok for survival. No more than that.
11772497,85633534,2016-07-12,77534312,Laura,"Alex was great to work with and was very flexible on arrival and departure time. He would check in on us and make sure everything was going good. If I had a questions about something, he would respond right away. The location is perfect. It is walking distance to so many places and it was perfect for the six of us staying there. The view is incredible and it was super clean and it has the homey feel to it. I would definitely stay here again and I will be recommending to all my friends. Such a great place especially when you want to see so many things in Boston. Thank you Alex for everything :)!"
11772497,85826940,2016-07-13,79468970,Laura,"Great location, lots of space, and excellent communication from host.  Our texts were answered within minutes.  There was a minor issue involving the linens and towels not having been changed before our arrival, but it was solved by Alex within the hour when a laundry basket of clean laundry was dropped off.  Would stay here again."
11772497,86355961,2016-07-16,78976070,Ingrid,Alex was very nice. He made the check in process very easy and was accessible when needed.  The only problem was that the air conditioner did not work properly and the apartment was very hot. It didn't help that there was hot weather during our stay.
11772497,88515832,2016-07-24,64811729,M.Antònia (TANI),El apartamento está muy bien situado: Ubicación genial!!. La cocina completamente equipada: todo nuevo limpio y en correcto uso. Nos sentimos como en casa. Hay el inconveniente de un solo cuarto de baño...y eramos 6 personas. Para cuatro personas seria mucho mejor; peri nos organizamos y con buena disposición por parte de todos lo solucionamos haciendo turnos. Dos de nosotros durmieron en cama inchable y sucedió que estaba pinchado el colchón; pero Alex nos dió la solución y todo quedo en una anécdota.
Previamente le pedimos a Alex un secador de pelo y una mesa plegable con sillas... y a nuestra llegada allí estaban!,,,,,
Sin dudar que aconsejaremos este apartamento a nuestros amigos y que si regresamos a Boston lo volveremos a alquilar.,,,,,

11772497,94461337,2016-08-15,15789628,Jack,I think that this apartment is the nicest place to stay the price is good and your right by the commons. Host very kind and easy to talk too.
11772497,94985564,2016-08-17,87818707,Jonathan,"Great place, accessible host, would definitely stay here again."
11772497,95386812,2016-08-19,526358,Amanda,"This was a great place to crash for one night. Very convenient to the most popular sites and attractions Boston has to offer. We walked everywhere and used this apartment only for showering and sleeping. It was not luxurious by any means, but it was clean, secure, and comfortable. The parking lot located right behind the building was a huge benefit, only $25 per day and $15 overnight and we had no issues leaving the car there. The neighborhood (Chinatown) is what you might expect-- a grab bag of all things urban. Coming from Baltimore, we were comfortable with the area, but others might find it a bit shady. Alex was a great host, easily accessible before and during our stay."
11772497,96535850,2016-08-23,13668566,Tom & Jen,"Pro's: convenient location, easy access, good communication."
Con's: We got what we paid for in retrospect,"but only fair to note that it is essentially a \"\"college\"\" guys place in regards to furnishings and appearance - beds",lines,etc.,,
"I understand this last part is completely out of Alex's hands but we feel we have to state that we did have a shooting occur down below the apartment on our last night. I'm sure it's situational and surely isn't a frequent occurrence but is only fair to state.\"",,,,,
11772497,96692125,2016-08-24,85190614,Brooke,"Is this the place for you?  Maybe!  Pros:  Alex is an an excellent communicator, timely in responses and very flexible.  The location is good for walking downtown Boston, close to subways, Boston Common and the Public Garden. The apartment is clean."
Cons:  The apartment is located near a really noisy street.  Strongly recommend a white noise machine.  The bedding/towels are all mismatched and threadbare.  Several pillow are completely flat,couch is peeling pleather.   Light pours into the bedrooms at dawn.,,,,
The price of the apartment reflects some of these issues.    None are necessarily deal breakers,"but good information for a prospective guest to have. \"",,,,
11772497,97273135,2016-08-26,66243714,Shannon,Alex was extremely responsive and helped us have everything we needed.

11772497,98145060,2016-08-29,53808561,Laura,Great location for awesome Chinese food. Easy walking distance to Boston Commons and Freedom Trail. Perfect for our family of 6! Wifi was a bit weak and TV wasn't working while we were there.
11772497,98390592,2016-08-30,15849876,Jake,The apartment is a bit bare but in a really central location. Very clean and had AC which was awesome for during the summer. Alex was super responsive as well.
14013583,95132835,2016-08-18,26298413,Tammy,"Alex was a wonderful host, extremely accommodating and very responsive to any questions I had. The location couldn't have been better. It was situated on the Freedom Trail and just a few blocks from Bunker Hill Monument and within walking distance to TD Garden, Aquarium, Quincy Market, public transportation and many other great historic locations in the area. My room was cozy with lots of natural light and the new mattress was very comfortable. The property is exactly as pictured. It was spotlessly clean and exactly what I had hoped for. Would highly recommend and hopefully, I will have the pleasure of staying here again soon."
14013583,96354423,2016-08-22,2168232,Kyle,"Alex had plans to go away the weekend I stayed at the Rainbow Room, but he delayed his departure in order to personally greet me and answer any questions regarding the well-appointed room and townhouse.  This is a testament to Alex's professionalism and dedication to being an exemplary airbnb host.  The room was as advertised, spotlessly clean and has access (shared if the other room is rented) to a very large, renovated and well-appointed two-story space.   The 'assigned' bathroom for the room is located downstairs, which was a small inconvenience.  But that minor point aside, I highly recommend the space for its value and amenities as well as the hospitality of Alex."

13730500,87796739,2016-07-21,80478830,Jonathan,"The property is in a great location! If you plan on visiting Boston, I would recommend you stay here. You can literally walk anywhere you really need to be, with regards to tourist sites and great food. Subway station underneath building, so easy access to public transportation."
13730500,88433128,2016-07-24,82109301,Sunny,"We actually met with a woman instead of Ismail, however everything went smoothly. We met her in front of the building and then she took us upstairs to the room. There are 2 beds that are somewhat small but can fit 2 people each. The couch is fairly comfortable for sleeping as well and is quite long. There is a TV with cable as well as wifi. For parking there is a public parking garage nearby at Post Office Square. I recommend this place!"

Thank you Larry for a great experience!"
196806,761062,2011-12-03,1001977,Ardavan,"I stayed at Larry's during a conference I was attending. It was in the Prudential building. This was the first time I traveled without driving my own car with the hope that I could stay close to the conference place without being worried about finding a parking spot. Therefore Larry's place was located perfectly and was terrific for my purpose. It was only 5 minutes away from Prudential tower. It was also very clean, and organized. Larry himself was a very nice and respectful person, and very considerate. He also shared with me some homemade cookies which was awesome! I will definitely stay at Larry's place next time and I highly recommend it."

Larry's place is quiet,clean,and comfortable. And Larry is a gracious host and super nice!

196806,55714901,2015-12-05,32639477,Ruslan,I really enjoyed my stay in Boston at Larry's place. Larry was a wonderful host. His apartment really feels like home except you are in the very centre of Boston. Despite my dense working schedule I got some free time to visit the fine art museum using the member card that Larry gave me. It was fantastic!
196806,62334651,2016-02-14,32628247,Viraj,I was very fortunate to stay with Larry during my stay in Boston. The location was perfect for the conference I attended.

6072693,75693553,2016-05-22,25369408,Joe,"Thanks for everything Jamison! The apartment was the perfect place for a weekend Boston trip. Jamison greeted us with a friendly, quick breakdown of the apartment and was available, via text, for anything we could've needed (recommendations, directions, etc)."
It was a quick 5 minute walk to Fenway Park,where we caught a Red Sox game; and only a 10 minute walk to Newbury Street,which has an unbelievable selection of stores and restaurants with side-walk seating.,,,
Parking is tough,but that's in any city; there are a few parking lots/garages within walking distance that you could call ahead and reserve for the weekend (more expensive when there are Red Sox home games).,,,,
Trains were so easy to navigate,within walking distance to the apartment. And naturally,a Starbucks 3 blocks away was a nice way to start our day.,,,
As for the sights: I wouldn't recommend Quincy Market to anyone,ever. The North End is perfect for a late dinner; Newbury Street is perfect for shopping and a late lunch/early dinner; and Fenway Park is a MUST see. If you could get into a game,even better.,,,
I highly recommend this place for anyone traveling to Boston for a Red Sox game or any other reason.,,,,,

The location was extremely convenient for anyone interested in visiting Fenway park. The ballpark was only a few blocks away!,,,,,
The apartment is also within short walking distance from good restaurants and shopping. A subway stop that can be used to travel to and from the airport was only a short walk away too.,,,,,
"The host was very communicative and answered any questions I had right away.\"",,,,,
6072693,82720789,2016-06-29,23180120,Loren,"Great location for attending a conference at the Hynes Convention Center and for doing a little bit of sightseeing during downtime. Close to public transportation was a big help. The neighborhood is a great area for going on walks through campuses/neighborhoods, a beautiful park, or alongside the Charles River. The apartment itself provided all we needed for a comfortable stay (AC, comfortable bed, equipped kitchen). Check-in/out was convenient, and Jamison was very responsive when we texted."

He worked with me to get the key to me since I was already out of town & he was going out of town also. His condo was exactly what I needed in the location I needed.  Walking distance to virtually everything & if it was further a T stop was close by.  The unit was comfortable (although if you are vertically challenged like me at 5'1\"\" you either need to work on your vaulting to get into the very comforable bed or get a step stool.) The kitchen was well equipped.  The shower worked well. The building is quiet. I would definitely recommend renting from him & have book marked the place to stay again.\""
6072693,87783341,2016-07-21,72531576,Denise,Jamison's apartment was located so conviently for us...right off Boylston Street and within walking distance of Fenway Park!

6072693,91334006,2016-08-04,284599,Gyuri,"Jamison was very responsive, courteous, available and on time when I arrived.

6072693,93160771,2016-08-11,75315139,Jeff,"We enjoyed our stay at Jamison's. The one bedroom unit is in a great location for exploring Boston, with easy access to the T green line, nearby restaurants, museums, Fenway Park, and more."
Jamison's place is in a classic Boston apartment/condo building from the 1st half of the 20th century. The unit is on the 3rd floor of the building. There is a small,primitive elevator that is helpful when dealing with luggage. There are two stairways in the building as well. The main interior stairway circles the elevator shaft,"and is more\"\"luggage friendly\"\" than the \"\"rear\"\" stairway",which is somewhat steep and narrow.,,
The unit itself has a living room,kitchen,bathroom,and bedroom. There are ceiling fans in the bedroom and living room,and a window air conditioner in the bedroom. We visited during an unusually hot spell and really appreciated the air conditioner and ceiling fans.,
The bathroom has a toilet,sink,and shower (no bath tub),and a few shelves for storage.,,
The living room has a leather sofa,coffee table,small dining table,"and TV with cable TV. And \"\"Rock'em Sock'em Robots!\"\"",,
The bedroom has a comfortable bed,dressers,and a closet with hangars and shelf space.,,,
The building is near the world famous Berklee school of music. As such you may hear various musicians practicing their craft during the day,but the building was quiet in the evening,and we found it easy to fall asleep at night.,,,
We didn't have a car during our stay,so we didn't have to deal with trying to park a car in the neighborhood. The street in front of the building requires a permit to park,so parking might be an issue but no more of an issue than any other Boston neighborhood.,,,
"I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Jamison was very responsive and accommodating with respect to our check in/check out times.\"",,,,,

The host was very responsive to our questions and even found a fifth bed (a cot) for us. Thanks!"
1731639,84140770,2016-07-05,1214027,Yelena,"Francine's house is very nice and large. It has high sealing which helps during summer with keeping the temperature down. The house has everything you need to stay at home away from home. Francine thought of everything! The place is also very conveniently located in Boston, waling distance to many attractions, restaurants and entertainment. Francine is a great host, she stayed in constant communication and was available to us at any time."

Small market at the corner, Boston Commons across the street, waking distance to Everything!  Small apt, but just the right size for our family of 3. Everything looked cleaned, all the appliances worked, and there is cable and internet access.  Washer & dryer was located down the hall, and it was great to use during our stay.  Anne was really helpful and accommodating to us."
This is a great way to stay in Boston,without all the expenses of being in a hotel.,,,,

There is a ton of closet space, towels and some toiletries provided, and a kitchen stocked with various kitchenwares and all appliances. Anne texted me with all the information I needed to know when I told her I was arriving from the airport, and getting into the apartment and acquiring my keys was very easy."
When I first arrived and tried to access the wifi,the router was acting up,"so Anne ordered a new one and had it installed the next day while I was gone. I was happy about this quick response.\"",,,

Roomy enough for 2-3 people. Anne is very communicative. Close to MGH, since I needed it for work.  Would stay here again."
8014383,46946604,2015-09-14,6273172,Melissa,"The apartment was perfect. It was on the street level and was easily accessible. The apartment was very clean and well put together. It's a cute, cozy apartment and well decorated to feel very homey. The bed was comfortable and there was a portable AC unit that Marie and her Bed and Breakfast team put in the living room that I was able to use during the hot days I was there. I would absolutely stay there again."
The neighborhood was very safe,had amazing food options and had wonderful brownstones all around. There were a ton of taxi's and Uber drivers were mostly available in that area. Additionally,"the train station is about a 8-10min walk away so you can take that if you would like. Parking is tricky there because you need a parking permit to park over night - so you need to park at a public garage overnight for about $25+ per night. \"",,,
8014383,51661043,2015-10-22,7260242,Philip,This was a really great place. Highly recommend.
8014383,68986264,2016-04-08,66268757,Michelle,The host canceled this reservation 46 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8014383,79847669,2016-06-14,25797553,Susan,The listing description was accurate and is exactly as pictured. The location was perfect for our visit to Boston. It was very quiet in the neighborhood.
8014383,87163976,2016-07-18,519681,Paulina,"We splurged and booked this place for 3 weeks in the summertime while my fiance was there on a project, thinking it would a great spot for me to work from while we also enjoy Boston. Unfortunately the minute we walked in we were really disappointed and ended up canceling our stay, hoping we could get a refund and find another place. Even though the sun was shining brightly outside, inside it was really dark. The pictures were clearly taken by a professional and a lot of light was added to brighten the photos. The apartment is the ground floor and gets virtually no light. I think this place would be fine for someone who just needs a place to crash for a few nights and wants to be in the South End, but its not an enjoyable space to spend a lot of time in, work from etc because its cramped and dark. Be aware there is a strict cancellation policy so airbnb won't refund you. The host, a private apartment rental company, agreed to partially refund us according to their policy."
8014383,92469494,2016-08-08,77703873,Gabriella,"I had a wonderful stay here. The instructions to enter the apartment were very easy. Parking was also very convenient, there is visitor parking right across the street. I can't wait to come back and visit!"

11521541,80505832,2016-06-18,20335795,Andrew,"Charming historic 3-story house in a cute residential historic neighborhood walking distance to Bunker Hill Monument, and an Uber ride or half-hour walk to the heart of historic Boston."
Katy was very responsive throughout our experience,allowing us early check-in,easily accessible when the air conditioner broke.  She has agreed to refund us 25% since it wasn't fixed before we left,although we haven't yet been paid.,,
Beautiful things in the home.  It would have been helpful to have had some bath soap/shower gel and basic shampoo and conditioner in the top floor bathroom,but we appreciated the towels and sheets laid out in each applicable room.,,,,
Boston is great,and we largely Ubered or walked everywhere,as public transit didn't seem as convenient or economical for 7 of us.  Nearby Whole Foods and CVS were handy,especially because we needed to buy some toilet paper on the first day; not sure if that's due to the early check-in or not.,,
Overall,charming historic home in the city but outside of the hustle and bustle and responsive host,"thanks!\"",,,
11521541,85202363,2016-07-10,45223104,Jason,Fantastic home!!!  We really enjoyed our trip to Boston and Katy's home was a big part of that experience!
11521541,90690965,2016-08-01,12666466,Ronda,I will never forget our anniversary weekend with our kids and their spouses at Katy's lovely brownstone. Her decor is just stunning. We spent mornings over coffee planning our day and evenings over wine reliving our adventures in the gorgeous dining room. Our beds were soooo comfy (important in our family) and the bathroom situation for six people was better than convenient. There was plenty of space in the kitchen for everyone to make their own coffee and get whatever they wanted for breakfast. Katy was a gracious hostess. I made a special request and she honored it prior to our arrival. We walked most places. The location of the brownstone is quite good.  Comfort and charm are here! Don't miss it!
8814479,53844052,2015-11-13,30179925,Joe,"The concierge was available 24 hours to let me in, that's awesome. I did wait more than 15 minutes for them in the lobby, but the lobby was out of the elements and comfortable. The facility Gym is very nice with up to 100lb dumbbells and exactly as pictured, which was key for me. The apartment itself was spacious with lots of room for a family, and a pack and play was provided too which is awesome. The furniture was new and stylish, and the layout would work well for a family. The building itself has old old doors and popcorn ceilings, but good views and some targeted pleasant updates like the master bath shower. Good value, great location."
8814479,60883625,2016-01-29,25615821,Ignacio,"We had no personal interaction whatsoever with the host as it was self check in/out. The apartment did, however, have a folder with recommendations of nearby restaurants and attractions as well as the different amenities and services it offered."
As of the apartment itself,it is very spacious,with nice furniture and it immaculately clean. What is more,is very well located.,,
We didn't get to use much of the services the building had to offer other than the laundry room.,,,,,
Overall,despite us being a party of five,the apartment felt big enough for all of us,"and it surpassed our expectations. Would definitely return should we go back to Boston!\"",,
6882615,54466700,2015-11-20,16560005,Ryan,"This was the perfect crash pad for a week-long Boston work trip.  Plenty of space, all the amenities you need (kitchen, private bath, laundry, cable TV, WiFi), and a at reasonable price (compared to most of the hotels downtown).  The location was ideal too-- right on Newbury Street, steps away from the Prudential Center, or the Hynes or Copley T stops.  And even though we never met in person, Alicia was always prompt to respond to messages and problems. I'd highly recommend this unit for business or long-term visitors."

The area is beautiful, there's a bunch of natural light and the apartment is very modern and clean. Alicia was very prompt in getting back to me and although I didn't see her much (which isn't even a bad thing) I feel like she had everything very put together and cohesive! Great trip, great place, great apartment."

The pictures are very accurate, but don't do justice to the lovely neighborhood that accompanies the studio apartment. Walking distance to anything you could need, right next to a small market, and not far from public transportation if needed. I really enjoyed my stay here!"

He was very helpful during my stay and even introduced me to a new app, Transit, for navigating public transportation in Boston, as well as many other cities.  His home is an easy commute from Boston, located just outside the city.  I enjoyed riding the trolley that dropped me off at the corner of Walter's street, leaving a short and peaceful country walk up the road to his home.  The room was quiet and the bed comfortable."
3839678,21552950,2014-10-19,18848967,Mariëlle,"Walter is an excellent host. He gave me tips on the subway network, made fruit salad every day and picked me up from the station the first night with my luggage. He answered al my questions I had."
The room is spacious and the bed sleeps good. If you're very tall you might find it too short but it was fine for me.,,,,,
The room is about 45-60 minutes by subway from central Boston (depending on where you want to go),but the system works very good. The nearest stop is very nearby.,,,,
The house is located in a quiet neighborhood so no noises that will keep you awake at night.,,,,,
Walter does get up early,so if you're not an early bird,"that could be a down side but for me it was not.\"",,,

The room was as described, sheets were clean and it was homely. Other areas of the house could do with a bit more  of a clean IMHO. The apartment was too far out for evening entertainment in town to be a realistic prospect (45 minutes on Tline and trolley) so I moved after 2 days."

I arrived late in the evening and my hosts made me welcome. The bed is very comfortable and the the room is quiet."
Walter made a lovely fruit salad for breakfast with fresh ginger seasoning - delicious!,,,,,
There is fast transit nearby,40 mins to Boston city centre by tram so you could use this as a base for Boston sightseeing if you want somewhere and peaceful and hmey to stay away from the bustle of the city. i recommend!,,,,

The cats are very sociable, if rather fond of sneaking into the bedroom. There is an excellent selection of books on the shelves and great art on the walls, which adds to the joy of being there. Great food for thought, then, but there's also a good supermarket up the street for real food."

Alishya was extremely helpful and communicative, and her place has a fantastic energy to it. It is also very conveniently located walking distance from all of the cool things happening in Jamaica Plains (in my opinion, one of the most exciting parts of town, and I speak from experience, having spent 3 years in Boston for college), as well as from the Orange and Green T lines, and several bus lines."

She even left us some Boston Maps at her home and gave us here own Charlie Card. So nice!"
Jamaica Plain is magnificant and a very special neighbourhood. It felt like home after three days. Nice people,nice restaurants around and you can go for a walk . You only need around 30 mns to be Downtown Boston. The T is just around the corner and there is a bus taking you there.,,,,
This was my first air bnb experience and because of Alishya the best.  Everything was uncomplicated (check-in,check-out,any questions...) and you will get two lovely roomates who are tryin´to sneak in your bedroom: the cats :-),,,
We really loved that place!,,,,,

The only small problems are that it is located on the main street in town, which made parking a problem some nights of our three week stay, and the flight of stairs is difficult for two seventy-two year olds to manage. Otherwise it is a perfect home away from home."

Nous etions 5,3 adultes et 2 enfants. Logement confortable pour 4 personnes mais juste pour 5 en raison du canape depliable au confort tres limite. Cependant Alishya nous avait prevenus.,,,,
Les chats sont bien chez eux,ils prennent leurs aises mais sont assez gentils.,,,,
Bosco est finalement le plus sociable.,,,,,
Le voisin du dessous,a ete d une grande aide lors de petits pepins rencontres. Nous n'avons pas rencontre la proprietaire Alishya mais celle-ci a toujours été reactive a mes demandes (sms,mails ou appels).,,,
Je recommande cet hôte.,,,,,
Nice appt,we were 3 adults and 2 child.,,,,

Alishya a parfaitement préparé notre arrivée et nous avons eu plaisir à nous occuper de ses deux chats. L'appartement est charmant, décoré avec beaucoup de goût et très bien équipé. La description et les photos correspondaient bien à la réalité."
Le jardin commun (à l'arrière de l'immeuble) est agréable et Alishya nous a gentiment proposé de nous servir dans le petit potager.,,,,,
L'immeuble est 5 minutes à pied de la station de métro Forest Hill sur la ligne orange. De là vous pouvez accéder à Downtown en 20 minutes. C'est pratique,mais attention : il y a peu de trains (10 à 15 minutes d'attente en journée) et le réseau de transport de Boston est globalement médiocre. Heureusement,vous trouverez toutes les commodités à proximité dans le quartier de Jamaica Plain : commerces,restaurants.,,
L'ambiance y est très sympathique. La rue peut être un peu bruyante,mais cela reste raisonnable. A noter qu'il est très facile de stationner gratuitement.,,,,

732999,35380596,2015-06-18,31413495,Helaine,"\"From the moment we entered Alishya's home, we knew she had been truthful in saying it was a beautiful place. With lovely décor, a fantastic library, and a well-stocked kitchen, it also boasts a gorgeous back yard with hammock and tables and chairs.  We loved the small porch that was framed with profuse hanging baskets - a great spot for morning coffee.  The bedroom was perfect with soft sheets, a good mattress, and fabulous blackout shades that allowed us to sleep past 6:00 a.m.   The bathroom was spacious, and Alishya gave us plenty of space for our belongings. Since we stayed 10 nights, we appreciated not having to live out of suitcases.  The house is right on the bus line, and it's within just a few minutes of all the Centre Street and South Street restaurants and shops.  The Forest Hills T station is only a 10 minute walk at most.  Alishya made us feel so welcome with beautiful flowers and a bottle of wine and great coffee.  We really appreciated being able to use pantry and refrigerator ingredients since we wanted to do some cooking for ourselves.  Alishya does have two cats - she mentions them in her listing - and we did have to get accustomed to closing bedroom and bathroom doors to keep the cats out.  We occasionally needed to stop what we were doing to let the cats in or out (their mewing was our clue), but they didn't really disturb us.  We met the downstairs neighbors, who were very nice, and who told us to just knock on their door if we needed something.  All in all, we loved our stay at Alishya's.  If you want to stay in a part of Boston that has a \"\"village\"\" feel"

Her home was exactly as advertised - sunny,well-decorated,quiet,clean apartment in Jamaica plain,close to a subway station.  We were able to park my car on the street for the weekend and use public transportation.  I was running the Boston Marathon and came from Montreal with three of my girlfriends.  Her home was the ideal size for the 4 of us for the weekend.  It is a very convenient location to explore the city and to get to and from the race.  Alishya was super accommodating of my running needs and I was able to have a hot shower after the race,which is always appreciated

Mark met us promptly with the key and invited us to contact them if we needed anything. The apartment is properly outfitted, and very recently renovated. It is located in a private courtyard off the main street and is very quiet area.  It is small, as you would expect in the north end of Boston, but It was comfortable for our family, two adults and one child. I can highly recommend it!"

The condo is outfitted like a boutique hotel – plush towels, comfortable high-end bed, flat screen TV with cable, and a very fast wireless internet. I was able to stream movies via Netflix on my iPad without a hiccup. The location is in the popular North End with lots of Italian Restaurants, bakeries, and coffee shops. The condo is located off the street in a courtyard and was very quiet with no noise from the street or neighbors. The location is also a short distance from the Haymarket T with easy access to all Boston locations.

The condo was a gem - tucked away in a quiet courtyard in a bustling area full of character.  Great bakeries and restaurants just around the corner.  The condo was very well equipped to a  high standard. All you could need had been thought of and standard of decor etc was superb.  Would love to return !
2183058,16197464,2014-07-23,13167339,Lisa,"This condo was by far the best Air BnB experience I've had to date (3 total so far). Cindy, our host, was thoughtful and gracious. She has fantastic taste and it shows in the decor, furnishings, linens and all of the little personal touches in her condo. I loved every minute of our stay there. Location was convenient and quiet, even amidst the bustling North End. I wouldn't change a thing."

2183058,17088489,2014-08-07,12239560,Paul,Had a wonderful stay at Mark and Cindy's superb condo. Smack bang in the midst of the North End Italian quarter of Boston and just a minutes walk from the freedom trail. Just about everything is walkable from here.
Loved the atmosphere of the area with everyone (we met) really friendly. Breakfast at the little cafe round the corner was excellent,we went 3 times! Frequented the coffee shop,the best burger place in boston and even used the launderette all no more than a couple of minutes walk.,,,
The condo is tucked away and quiet despite being so well situated. Our family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids,11 and 9) fitted in really well and made good use of the wifi and tv when we weren't out and about.,,,,
"After a long day travelling it was a welcome surprise to find a bottle of wine on the kitchen table! Really indicative of the efforts Mark and Cindy go to make your stay a great one. We wouldn't change a thing and would love to come back one day!\"",,,,,

The furnishings, equipment, linens etc. are all top quality. Cindy and Mark were extremely helpful and always available to answer our questions. We would definitely recommend this condo. Many thanks Cindy and Mark!"
2183058,18236602,2014-08-24,15863584,Didier,"Cindy and Mark were since the beginning wonderful guests, very helpful and always available for all explanations. Their condo is just awesome in the center of the North End, close to all of Hanover Street restaurants and shops, Haymarket and the Red Line to all major sites in Boston (Faneuil House, Revere house...). The location is quiet in a private court. Condo's description is fine and in line with our expectations. For sure, if we were to come back to Boston, we would ask Cindy and Mark for their condo first!"
2183058,18806169,2014-09-01,15477311,Audrey,"Cindy and Mark were great hosts. The condo was clean, modern, comfortable, and in a fantastic location!

Spotlessly clean, secure, complimentary wine, quality furnishings all made it feel like a home away from home. The location is perfect for everything you would want to do in Boston. Can't recommend highly enough."
2183058,19816097,2014-09-19,979547,Rebecca,Cindy and Mark were just wonderful. Very good communication throughout the process. Cindy even checked in mid-way through just to be sure all was well and that we were finding our way around the city.
The accommodations were wonderful. What a quaint and amazing little side street to Boston! The condo is well updated,comfortably laid out,and was well-stocked for our week in Boston. There was so much within walking distance that we almost didn't know where to turn. :),,,
Two of us stayed in the bedroom and one on the couch - it had a great pull out and plenty of sheets,blankets,and pillows.,,,
The kitchen is great for cooking - or in our case - storing and reheating leftovers from all the wonderful restaurants nearby.,,,,,
I was attending a conference at the seaport convention center while my family toured the city. This was a great home base for both. Cindy and Mark were kind enough to leave a nice bottle of wine and the perfect amount of toiletries,cooking utensils,"and coffee paraphernalia. We were very impressed. \"",,,
2183058,20639038,2014-10-03,12125541,Sylvie,"Le condo est exactement comme il est décrit et les photos représentent la réalité. Un peu petit mais plaisant et confortable sauf pour la table trop haute. Je le recommande fortement. Communication rapide et efficace, malheureusement nous n'avons pas eu la chance de se rencontrer. Autre petite suggestion, il pourrait y avoir un radio-réveil dans la chambre."

2183058,21866828,2014-10-26,13244540,Jess,Cindy and Mark were so lovely to deal with throughout our entire planning and trip. They made us feel very welcome in their condo. The condo was extremely well equipped with all the things we needed during our stay and it was clear Cindy and Mark had gone well and truly above and beyond to ensure this. The condo was exactly as described and was in a perfect location in Boston to the majority of the tourist attractions we wanted to see whilst there.  We have absolutely nothing but wonderful things to say about Cindy and Mark and their condo and we would definitely stay there again if we were to return to Boston again.  Thank you so much for making our first Airbnb experience and our first trip to Boston so wonderful!
2183058,22224070,2014-11-02,7599896,Roberta,"We had a fabulous stay at Mark and Cindy's North End condo. We arrived to a beautiful, spotless, cozy and comfortable space, and we were welcomed by our hosts with a lovely bottle of wine. Mark and Cindy provided us with very clear instructions to all of the condo's amenities, and were always on hand to answer questions. The condo is also perfectly situated in walking distance from any place you'd want to visit in Boston. Staying here felt just like home. Not only would I recommend our gracious hosts and their condo, I also look forward to staying again. Thank you Mark and Cindy for making our visit a wonderful one."
2183058,23003578,2014-11-20,17874020,Long,"This was my first airbnb experience, and it was a fantastic one! Beautiful place in middle of the north end, and had everything you needed there to enjoy your stay. Much better and cheaper than a hotel and within walking distance of many places that you would want to go to explore. Cindy and Mark gave very clear instructions on how to get to the condo and left a binder inside the house with information about the condo and the city. Very happy with my first experience, and thanks again to Cindy and Mark for making it a good one!"
2183058,23319505,2014-11-29,18392636,William,"The apartment is a perfect location to enjoy Boston. It's in the heart of the North End with walking access to Boston's subway (the T), historic places related to the American Revolution, wonderful restaurants, Quincy Market, and nestled in a cozy courtyard. The place is newly appointed with comfortable and top-end amenities, yet still preserving the historic nature of the original construction. The unit is one of four in a quiet courtyard, and it has several windows that bring in natural light. Each unit in this courtyard likely has 4-6 apartments contained in it. The courtyard and unit is safe and I never once felt concerned for personal security within the apartment, or within any place in the North End. Stepping out of the courtyard, you can see the steeple to the North Church a couple buildings away -- it's that close to it. I was there with my wife and two college-aged children for the Thanksgiving holiday. Both my kids are on the east coast, so we thought rather than the kids coming back home, we'd travel to see them in Boston -- a town we did not know well. This apartment was an excellent location to come to know the city. We walked to several restaurants throughout our time there, the Haymarket transit station is 10 minutes away and central to everything. The sleeping arrangements worked out well with my son and me in the pull-out sofa (which was the most comfortable sofa bed I've slept in, particularly with the foam padding supplied in the living room closet), and my wife and daughter were in the double bed of the bedroom. There were ample linens, towels, and pillows to go around due to Cindy having a couple extra boxes/chests filled with them. She thought of everything for us, including leaving a supply of essential kitchen supplies -- pots, dishes, silverware, scissors, trash bags, toilet paper, paper towels -- and also food stuff, like tea, coffee, margarine, bottled water, sugar, and so forth. As a welcome gift, there was a bottle of red wine that greeted us. What could be more welcoming?! The bathroom was in excellent shape, again newly appointed, with shampoo and soap amenities like an upscale hotel would provide. Lots of hot water, a bathroom exhaust fan, and well lit -- all unusual in old buildings and clearly part of the remodeling. I talked with Cindy twice as part of my visit, and did not meet her. On the first day, I needed some help with the lockbox directions, and at the end, called to thank her and let her know we're checking out. On the first day, I asked about restaurant recommendations. As part of this conversation, we shared stories about our family and eating preferences. I was grateful for her good sense of where to recommend for my family. We took her suggestions and had an amazing visit to Boston. Compared to any hotel within two miles of the North End, I have no..."
2183058,23709529,2014-12-08,17344353,Kristen,"We had a wonderful stay in Cindy and Mark's beautiful North End Condo. The condo is cozy and beautifully renovated and sits in a little nook in the North End. You are a short walk to Hanover street, the main street in the North End and a quick walk to Haymarket Square and various T stops. When you want privacy you can retreat back to your cozy condo and it feels like your out of the hustle and bustle of the city."

The location is phenomenal- amazing food within close walking distance, and the condo sits away from the street (quiet) with it's own private courtyard.  The inside isn't too large, but Cindy and Mark have made the most of the space.  It's divided into three separate spaces: kitchen, living room, bedroom (and a bathroom right off the kitchen).  The old/original hardwood floor is beautiful as is the exposed brick wall in the bedroom.  The paint colors, art, and molding were all appreciated.  The bathroom is gorgeous and the shower water pressure was nice.  The strategically places coat hooks worked well for us too!  The kitchen has all new appliances and I really liked the cabinets.  Speaking of cabinets they were fully stocked with dish ware, tea, and coffee which we indulged in.  They also left us bottles of water and a bottle of wine.  Since there were 4 of us they had plenty of towels available too, towels that were large and soft!  Speaking of soft, the bed was nice and soft and comfy too!  They also left a nice host binder explaining what to see in the city as well as their fav places to eat and a list of need to know places in the area (pharmacy, police, grocery, etc).  I cannot recommend this place enough.  We loved our stay here.  Additionally, Cindy and Mark were very easy to get a hold of and through messaging through Airbnb.  They were quick to respond, very accommodating, and extremely nice!  Thanks again.  Hopefully, one day we'll be back."

The couch bed was super comfy,and I even shared it with my aunt!,,,,

We travelled me,my husband and our two kids age 1 and 4. Our 4 yo slept on the pull out couch and we had brought our own cot for the baby,which there was room for in the bedroom. The mattresses weren't the best,but they weren't that bad that we felt the need to contact Cindy and Mark.,,
The condo is hidden away from the lively Hannover street,but you are still close to everything by just walking down the street. We truly couldn't have asked for a better place.,,,,
We had great weather during our stay so we spent a lot of evenings picking up a sandwich at Dino's around the corner and going to the long wharf or Rose Kennedy Greenway to enjoy the sun set.,,,,,
The condo had all the basics needed and it was spotless.  We loved the mail prior to our arrival and the welcome folder that really made our arrival and stay very easy.,,,,,

We had an issue with the heating and they were very responsive and helpful. Just one point which may not be visible in the photos, the apartment does not have doors on rooms eg bedroom.

Located just behind more busy streets,the apartment was very quiet,which is great when you're trying to sleep off your jetlag. Also,North End turned out to be a really nice place to explore Boston from. Lots of great places to eat,"very nice people. Really couldn't have turned out better!\""
2183058,72998552,2016-05-06,4942954,JoAnn,"Such a wonderful experience! The place was so clean and suited our needs perfectly! My husband and I slept in the bedroom while my two kids slept on the pull out couch in the adjacent room.  I loved that the place was stocked with extra toiletries such as cosmetic pads and nail polish remover as I needed to give my daughter a quick manicure for the wedding we were attending that weekend.  Such a cute place, perfectly located in the North End within walking distance to the T station and AMAZING restaurants!"
2183058,74471974,2016-05-15,55672190,Mary,"Nice place, great location, comfortable for our party of 3 adults , kitchen stocked, bottle of wine nice touch, appreciated Cindy calling us to check in since we were busy with graduation & sight seeing.  Met Mark while waiting for our uber ride to the airport, very friendly guy.  Thanks."
2183058,75273626,2016-05-20,46823533,Robert,"Cindy and Mark's condo was very cute , no doubt newly renovated and very comfortable. It's location was great ,basically right next to the Freedom Trail , and so close to great restaurants and cafes . We walked through the city quite easily , as well as catching a Hop On Hop Off bus close by. Thanks again for making your place available for our stay."
2183058,77769937,2016-06-03,1399007,Jon,Loved my stay at Cindy and Mark's place. Everything was perfect.

Well kitted out, cosy and clean, the condo was all we needed. Cindy and Mark kept in contact and gave clear instructions to find the accommodation."
2183058,79898608,2016-06-14,54675075,Debbie,Mark and Cindy were great hosts. And if we had any questions their responses were prompt and very helpful. We would definitely recommend both of them to other friends and family.
2183058,81965634,2016-06-26,13490190,Elena,"Our stay at this perfectly located apartment was fantastic.  The hosts were so responsive to our needs, and they made us feel so welcome.  The apartment was cozy and had every amenity necessary for a wonderful stay.  We hope to visit again next year!"
2183058,82785979,2016-06-29,57240607,Cheryl,The apartment that we rented was just perfect for our needs.  We did not feel cramped by any means and it was in such a safe area we were never concerned.  Mark and Cindy were so easy to work with and responded quickly to any and all questions we had.  The decor was great and the bed so comfortable. Thank you again for letting us rent your charming apartment.
2183058,87566204,2016-07-20,43596455,Laura,"What an awesome stay we had at Mark & Cindy's condo. My husband and I stayed with our two boys (10 and 12) for five nights. The condo is compact but very functional. The remodeling work they've done is very nice, and the kitchen with full-size appliances was nicely stocked with essentials and then some.  Loved having an ice maker!   The beds were very comfortable and the air-conditioning was very efficient and kept the condo cool. The real star of the show, though, is the location. You are in the heart of the North End, Little Italy, which is the most charming of neighborhoods and swarming with shops and amazing restaurants. Not only that, the condo was within walking distance of almost everything it seemed...the Freedom Trail, the wharf, Beacon Hill, etc.  Cindy was quick to respond both prior to the trip and once we arrived when I had a question about the WiFi.  Everything was just perfect and staying in this condo made our trip to the amazing city of Boston extra special."
2183058,89095693,2016-07-26,7002992,Robert,"Absolutely charming apartment in the heart of the North End. The beds were so comfortable, even the pull out. The place was very clean and the hosts were always responsive.  We had a wonderful stay. Highly recommend!"

By far the cutest neighborhood in the city! The condo was well stocked with everything you need.  Wonderful place, wonderful people! I don't think our trip would have been as amazing as it was if we stayed anywhere else. When we go back I would love to stay there again"
2183058,94761334,2016-08-16,59924384,Vernon,This is a great location just a block south of The Old North Church. The neighborhood is welcoming and safe with dozens of dining options. Thankfully Mark & Cindy leave recommendations within walking distance. The condo is updated and comfortable. Cindy is always available and responsive to questions.
2183058,96880225,2016-08-24,46033980,Roxana,"We loved staying at Cindy's condo! Although it is located close to a very busy restaurant area,  the condo itself is on a quiet street."
It is small,but very clean and functional,"with everything one might need. \"",,,
2183058,99787585,2016-09-05,28998966,Gary,"Absolutely perfect spot to stay in Boston. It was our first time, and the location could not have suited us more. The place is located less than a block from the bustling Hanover Street, that has endless Italian restaurants and nightlife. It is no more than a 15 minute walk from most of the major spots in Boston."
The apartment itself is clean,newly renovated and we wanted for nothing! Its located just off the street so it is really quiet.,,,,
Cindy was great at keeping in touch too if we needed anything.,,,,,

12973308,75813777,2016-05-23,42716375,Ross,"Eric was a great host. He was responsive, provided clear instructions, was very helpful with recommendations, and made our stay stress free. The pictures of this property are spot on. The bed was extremely comfortable, it is located in a nice area with plenty to do within walking distance, and the property itself is very secure. With private parking underneath the building you won't have to worry about hauling your belongings down busy city streets. I highly recommend this location especially if you are going to a Red Sox game as the stadium is an 8 minute walk right down the street."

4737304,36817435,2015-07-01,35642043,Otis,"It was a wonderful stay, if and when I use this service again in this area I will look for an opening here first because it's homely and comfortable and a close walking distance to the bus and restaurants. And Deborah is a wonderful woman that is very accommodating. I really wish I could of stayed longer."
4737304,40612126,2015-08-01,31645216,Hilal,"\"Deborah is a great host, kind, cheerful, welcoming.. First moment that I've enter to house, she was so helpful. She explained whatever I need. She invited me to have dinner with her. She already prepared a welcoming basket for me which included shampoos, body lotions.. The room was so useful with lots of drawers. You have enough space to \"\"live\"\" in that room. The bathroom was clean. You can find whatever you need in that lovely kitchen! Location of the house is convenient. You can use 57 bus to reach green line"
4737304,43447651,2015-08-19,26183799,Mary,"great stay, convenient and Deborah's home was the perfect place to  be  to explore the sights of Boston.  Look forward to a return visit."
4737304,49221911,2015-10-02,18553221,Lukas,"I absolutely enjoyed the stay at Deborah's place and can only recommend it for several reasons. The probably most important point is the fact that it feels like a very traditional experience, e.g. staying with friends and family."
There is always someone at home and this makes it easy to get to know people from a lot of different places – you will always find someone to talk to.,,,,,
Another aspect worth mentioning is the good reachability by public transport. Given the fact Boston's transport system has a lot of dark spots,Deborah's place appears as a bright corner of Boston as you are able to reach a lot of locations quite fast due to a very near bus stop.,,,,
Deborah is always available if there is something to talk about and she has useful advice regarding stores all around Boston.,,,,,
"Probably the best part of the experience here was that guests do not feel like \"\"just another person\"\"",but rather they are able to enjoy Boston at a place and with a host that is exactly what people are looking for when they decide to come to this New England pearl.,,,,
"I would therefore absolutely come back!\"",,,,,
4737304,49729747,2015-10-05,33813076,Leigh,the host was very nice and  straightforward

The house is very cozy and the room I stayed in was very nice. It is a place that makes you feel at home right away,"even if you're only staying for 2 nights like I was. \"",,,,
4737304,57007459,2015-12-21,12662486,Valentina,"I stayed at Deborah’s for two months and a half during my research period at Boston University as a Fulbright scholar. Being my first experience in the U.S., and from an ethnographic perspective, her colourful place and one-of-a-kind personality represented a privileged entry point into some of the most characteristic features of the American life. I had the chance of spending there, with her and my Australian housemate, some special moments such as Halloween with a cornucopia of candy for the ‘trick or treat’ ritual, ornamental pumpkins and costumes; a pre-Thanksgiving family dinner when Deborah made excellent use of her well-equipped kitchen by serving stuffed chicken and traditional side dishes; Thanksgiving at her sister’s historical barn in Ipswich, where I enjoyed a delicious meal with a barnyard turkey at the centre of it; the setting up and decoration of a beautiful and authentic Christmas tree in the sitting room; without mentioning the football game at the Harvard Stadium and, even more fun, the preceding tailgating. We also happened to share several casual, unplanned dinners and bottles of wine; as well as conversations over my understanding (and misunderstanding) of Americanness and other funny human interactions. Deborah has always been generous in sharing her opinions, perceptions, and support. Profound prophecies based on her expertise in astrology have turned out to be true! Looking at the New World from this unique place has certainly provided me with stimulating insights into new manners and forms of humanity. You will find your second home here if you feel in an open-minded, exploratory and sharing mood, if you look for a place full of reminiscences, if you want to grasp the inner soul and shades of entire life histories. This is a fully lived-in house, with benevolent presences appearing at times to replace bulbs and fix locks and windows, and intense memories of past and present adventures. If you feel minimal and uncommitted, or like to stay on your own with very limited interaction and absolute privacy, you are going to miss a very great deal of the house and of its owner’s character, then maybe better to opt for an undecorated room elsewhere. The place is within walking distance of Boston College, one of the most fascinating campuses in Boston; 40 minutes from Copley and Harvard Square; and only a 25 minutes bus ride from Boston University. The house is situated in a friendly neighbourhood - I was greeted by people the second time we met, and this is certainly something quite rare when compared to the rest of the city. I could enjoy the blessing of a tiny fresh fruit and vegetable shop in Brighton centre, as well as a couple of good Irish pubs, tempting biscuits and cakes at the local pastry shop, and a well-furnished liquor store in the vicinity of the house. Being an insatiable reader and a mildly enthusiastic shopper, towards the end of my stay I would have appreciated some additional space in the room in order to accomodate..."
4737304,73731850,2016-05-09,44451625,Mohammed,"Great and safe neighborhood, bust stops just across the street. Deborah is an amazing and kind person who will make 100% sure you feel at home. A host who will be there for you for whatever you need and will also give you your space and privacy. The room was clean and comfortable with enough space for any visitor. If I ever go to Boston again I will stay at Deborah's house for sure! Thanks for everything :) I will never forget our cool conversations !!"
4737304,75477495,2016-05-21,65050029,John,"Cosy Celtic Retreat was the perfect, affordable place for my two-week stay while I did research at Harvard Business School. The room is exactly as it looks in the picture. The house is very comfortable with lots of local character including TONS of books. The best part about this place, however, is the host. I had never been to Boston before, and Deborah helped me find my way around the neighborhood and city, suggested local places to eat or drink, and was the source of lots of great conversations over wine/beer--literature, religion, history, tv shows, just about anything. As for the neighborhood, it's a great place for younger people, but also felt like home, and had easy public transportation access to get to Harvard or downtown Boston."
4737304,81914142,2016-06-25,54315731,Jen,"I stayed for a month with Deborah and found a warm and welcoming host in this venerable, old home. She is quick to offer insights and opinions about the local area and has great suggestions to make any trip better. This old house, full of the clutter from a busy family life, is showing it's age and not super well kept up; it takes a lot of rules to keep it running smoothly so don't expect a private, clean, hotel-like experience (but you wouldn't be looking at this if that's what you wanted.) I shared my room with a lifetime of memories, just like the photos, and Deborah came in and out as she needed. The room was very quiet, this is a solidly-built,  beautiful home. Not the cleanest place I've stayed, if you are sensitive to mold this won't work for you. This is a shared home and refrigerator space is limited but Deborah is open to communication and the kitchen stays clean and available for cooking. Deborah is a great conversationalist and quick to drop what she is doing and engage in lively discussions on wide ranging topics.  The home is very conveniently located for public transportation and I felt very safe walking the neighborhood even late at night. If you love real life in all it's quirky glory, this is a great, affordable, place to explore Boston from."

11454147,68208761,2016-04-02,57284152,Leticia,"My husband and I stayed at the Evolve Fenway for two nights. The location was superb. Next to Fenway restaurants, night life and the T. The unit was clean, new and modern. The unit came equipped with basic things like coffee pot, iron, wifi, cable etc. There were plenty of towels that were of hotel quality. This isn't an apartment that is used as a regular residence and feels like a hotel. The room was pretty quiet for being in the city. Bedroom mattress was comfortable enough. We initially were given the wrong number for check-in, which made me nervous at first since this was my first BNB booking. Staff at Northeast quickly found us a new number and checking-in and out was extremely simple. We would definitely recommend."
11454147,69964241,2016-04-15,66260545,Heather,The host canceled this reservation 26 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

Our stay at Fenway Entire home (hosted with Northeast Suites) was quite brief - we stayed for two nights. We enjoyed staying at their place for the most part. It is a clean apartment with a great location (close to the T). Each room was clean and the bed was comfortable, though it did have unpleasant noise coming from early morning construction.  I would definitely recommend as long as you're not a light sleeper and can tolerate a bit of noise."

There was a tiny bit of confusion in letting me into the building immediately upon arrival, but it was quickly resolved and everything after that was great."

11454147,78088269,2016-06-05,4477277,Monica,"The house is super modern, spacious, clean and has everything you need available. The check in was easy - they were waiting for me at the building when I arrived, gave me the keys and showed me around. One thing to note is that the building doesn't have onsite concierge so you don't have a place to leave your bags after you check out. Location is convenient: not in the city center but walking distance or a short taxi ride away."

The place is a short walk to Fenway Park, which is great if you are staying for a Red Sox game (or multiple games).  There is a T Station right around the corner which can take you towards the downtown area.  It surely beats much more expensive options you will find closer to downtown."
11454147,90834504,2016-08-02,80841660,Daniel,I arrived earlier than the check in time. I ran into the cleaning people and it was one of the HIGHLIGHTS of my trip to Boston.

La maison est située près de l'aéroport mais on y dort bien. La chambre  était équipée d'un lit simple confortable.Bien qu'assez âgées, un peu défraîchies et plus ou moins insonorisées, la maison, la chambre et les pièces communes  sont calmes et propres. Afiyah m'a permis d'utiliser son stationnement privé et le petit déjeuner est très satisfaisant. Le train qui mène au centre-ville est à 10 minutes de marche; la station était en rénovations et un bus fasait la navette vers la station voisine, L'atmosphère est plus proche de celui d'une maison de chambres que d'une résidence privé, mais les espaces communs permettent de rencontrer les autres chambreurs si on le désire. Première expérience globalement appréciée avec Airbnb."

Metro station is 15-20 min walk from the house,which is not bad at all.,,,,
Just one thing kind of bothered me was the airplane noise. The reason I chose this place was because it's so close from the airport,"(only 10 min by taxi) but one unpleasant thing about that was you hear the planes coming and leaving. It's not that loud but you can still hear. \"",,,,
57800,5705780,2013-07-12,1267472,Pedro,"I decided to do a one day trip to Boston and fixed everything kind of last minute. Everything was very smooth on my stay. I am a host myself for airbnb, and was very impressed with the quality of the communication and the information provided here. Just as I arrived, I received a long text message that included everything I could have needed, it was very detailed. The house is a walk from the subway (right now to a shuttle bus until they finished the station), and the subway will put you downtown in 25 to 30 minutes. A taxi to the airport is fast an inexpensive, but a taxi from downtown can be a little bit more pricey. The room is very comfortable and charming. I read some reviews about the airport being close-by. It is, but did not bother my sleep. All in all, easy and comfortable."

57800,7233556,2013-09-11,8687340,Chengjie,This is really a good place. The room is tidy and clean with beautiful view. Afiyah is a very kind and considerate host.

57800,7429460,2013-09-19,2452117,Kevin,"Had a very straight-forward visit with Afiyah: getting in late to Logan Tuesday night and driving down to parents early next day. She was fast to get back to my initial queries about availability and parking. On the day my flight was severely delayed. When I finally made contact with her from airport she asked if she should stay up to greet me but as her instructions already clear and my arrival eventually past midnight, we agreed that wasn't necessary. Comfortable bed and warm shower, I was out the following morning without hassle. Easy walk to Orient Heights T, will be better when station works done but in meantime easy shuttle to Suffolk Downs. If you're a plane spotter fanatastic views of end of runways at Logan, the noise wasn't at all intrusive."
57800,7438962,2013-09-20,756896,Nichole,"I stayed here for one night and couldn't have been happier! It was perfectly located for my needs (near to the airport) and was absolutely beautiful (both the house and the surrounding bay area). Afiyah and Jim were both kind and gracious hosts. They both go out of their way to make their guests feel comfortable (they have a breakfast and snack table!) and cared for (they have a subway guide for the nearest line as well as a taxi number conveniently located). While in Boston my phone was without a SIM card and I couldn't call a taxi so not only were they willing to let me borrow a phone, but they actually called for me! I highly recommend you stay here if possible. The room was very clean and comfortable as was the rest of the house. The subway is nearby and even though the nearest station is currently closed for construction, the shuttle bus that serves in its place is equally fast and convenient. for transport to other areas of Boston. Thank you both for a wonderful stay!"
57800,7474175,2013-09-21,8228163,Sabrina,"I stayed for one night and it was a good choice. The house is close to the airport and easy to find. Everything you need is ready. The room as well as the house were nice and clean. Afiyah was really helpful and friendly. Very recommendable, thank you."

Al principio tenía temor de regresar tarde por la zona,pero me di cuenta  que no hay problema alguno.,,,,
Pese a estar junto al aeropuerto no se escucha ruido de las aeronaves en la habitación,con lo cual se descansa comodamente.,,,,
Me pareció raro que la habitación no cuente con llave,lo cual al principio me tenia con dudas,pero no hubo ningun problema la casa es muy segura.,,,

57800,7881435,2013-10-07,6784623,Yunie,"The place was well maintained and clean. However, there was a bit of hassle due to the public transportation (subway) temporary disconnection. You have to transfer between subway to shuttle to get to the place. Afiyah was very nice and responsive for the matters."
57800,8114194,2013-10-16,8537509,Douglass,"This was a great place to stay while visiting the Boston area. The location is great with easy public transit and freeway access. Afiyah was great at communicating before and during my stay. Afiyah was great at giving directions to the house by many different means of transportation. Afiyah gave great recommendations as a local of places to visit while in town. The house was very clean, quiet and charming. The breakfast was great to get the day started off right for a day of exploring or meetings. Afiyah was very understanding about about leaving my luggage at the house while I explored the town and had a late flight. Would highly recommend staying here to family, friends, or anybody that is looking for a room in Boston!!!!!"

It is conveniently located a short walk from the Blue Line T Station in Orient Heights which provides easy access to the airport and downtown Boston.  And the breakfast bar is well stocked and convenient in the morning.  The host was helpful with directions and site-seeing tips.  The bathroom is shared, but that was not a problem duing my stay."
57800,12264501,2014-04-27,2393122,Chris,"Excellent accommodation, especially after a nightmarish stay at another place just before. Quiet, spotlessly clean, and the host was a delight to talk to (although mostly I had the place to myself). While I didn't get a chance to check out the area, it is extremely convenient to downtown Boston and the airport. I will gladly stay here again."

57800,12976124,2014-05-16,3664842,Anita,I was in Boston for a couple of days to cover a story and this was a perfect spot for my base of operations. My primary interview subject lives less than a mile away.
Jim and Afiyah's charming house is set in a quiet residential neighborhood and has a wonderful view of the water. Although I had a rental car and didn't use public transportation,other guests told me it was convenient to get anywhere in Boston. The bathroom is shared with two other guest rooms,but that presented no problems while I was there. Jim and Afiyah thoughtfully make coffee,breakfast cereals,and snacks available around the clock. All in all,"it was a very pleasant stay. \""
57800,13221017,2014-05-22,14949656,Rob,Nice and cozy place that over looks the Boston skyline.

"No AC and shared bathroom somewhat cramped.\"",,,,,
57800,14925926,2014-06-29,16390251,Stephen,Everything was as expected. My visit was very brief and only got to meet Afiyah for about 30 seconds. Easy to get to coming from the north and like avoiding city traffic. Very quick to the airport too. Great view at night when the city is lit up. I was a little worried beforehand about planes being loud but the special windows seemed to do the trick.
57800,15911587,2014-07-18,15691387,Cindy,Afiyah and Jim's airbnb is pleasant and easy to find.  Their directions are thorough.  The location is amazing!  Right on the waterfront!
57800,16210439,2014-07-23,16501550,Nathan,"This is a great place to stay while in Boston. The T is a short walk away and the train ride to the Airport or the center of town is not long at all. I only met Afiyah and Jim briefly, but they were nice and so were the fellow guests I ran into. Afiyah was very helpful in walking me through everything leading up to check-in which I appreciated as this was my first airbnb stay. The only words of caution I have are that the bathroom is a shared living area with the other guests and the airport is very close. In the summer, you might have to choose between leaving the windows open for comfort or closed for quiet. I dealt with these things fine though and would recommend this listing highly."
57800,16285379,2014-07-24,18674285,Mark,Great hosts and location on the water in Boston!  Everything worked smoothly staying here and it was super easy to get to/from downtown Boston and the airport on the T trains.

Afiyah is a lovely woman and she and Jim's work was so interesting to learn about.  I loved the neighborhood.  Access to the T is convenient and Boston is only a 20 minute ride.

The airport is only two subway stations from the neighbourhood and using the same line you can reach downtown in 10-15 minutes. I spent just one night in the single room with shared bathroom (both clean) and I haven't heard any  airplane noise. I met Jim just for few minutes, he seemed very easy and nice, with a \"\"mi casa es tu casa\"\" approach. I've been in touch with him before my arrival and the indications he gave me to reach the house were perfect. \""

I got to Boston dirty, hungry and feeling really alone. But when I got to 140 Bayswater Street (my first AirBnB experience by the way) I forgot all about that. It felt like coming home: warm, cosy house with beatiful views AND I had an amazing bed, towels etc. Jim and Afiyah had left a welcome tag on my door, with my name and a smiley and everything! But the best part was the kitchen... Imagine how hungry I was and I had no cash on me so to find apples, milk, fresh bread, peanut butter and jelly and fresh coffee in the kitchen was HEAVEN. I went to bed full, clean (first shower in 34h!!) and feeling safe. It was like coming home to Mom and Dad."

The location was very convenient - only a few mins walk to the blue line and a few stops to downtown Boston. On top of all,"their house overs looks the water and the airport! Can't get better than that! I guess we like planes so the humming sounds doesn't bother us at all (Their windows are also very sound proof so you can always close them if it annoys you).

57800,21015909,2014-10-09,21845462,Makenna,Jim and Afiyah were great hosts and the location of this house was excellent. Very easy to get to and from the airport via public transportation.

I only needed a room for the night convenient to Logan.  It took me 10 minutes from the Blue Line station at Logan (after dropping off my rental car) to Orient Heights Station and another 5 minute walk from the station to their house.  You could literally see the planes at Logan coming or going,but the room was quite,clean and cozy.  The other two rooms in the house were booked and I only saw one other guest briefly.  Since my flight out was at 7:10 the following morning,I was up at 4:30 and out the door by 5:00,but had a cup of coffee and made myself a PB&J sandwich to go from the well-stocked kitchen buffet.,

It was very close to the airport and the T is relatively closeby, so it's pretty convenient for a traveler. I decided to rent a car and there's tons of free parking right in front of the house. They were letting out a couple of other rooms in the house while I was there, so I did run into some other visitors. The only issue with that was that the bathroom was not always available. Check in was super easy and check out was super easy. Just a matter of walking in and walking out, really. I didn't have to wait on anything at all. It was really quite nice that there was a continental breakfast buffet set out 24 hours a day. A great touch. If you want new and modern then this is not the house for you, but if you like the personality of old homes then this place is great. It also is actually right on the water. Just a step out of the front door! Thanks so much Jim and Afiyah!"

57800,27701578,2015-03-09,28689565,Mina,Very nice.  Very cosy.  Very comfortable.
57800,28913058,2015-03-31,15230345,Heather,I had stayed at Jim's place before last year and liked it so much that I chose to stay here again. It was another great stay. Jim is very friendly but also gives you space. The view from the porch is gorgeous & it doesn't take long to get into town. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a reasonably priced place to stay in Boston.
57800,30581897,2015-04-24,30786206,Brenda,"Room was clean & cozy. Briefly met Jim, very nice host. They provided breakfast items & snacks.  Location was very close to downtown and set beautifully on the bay facing downtown.  Loved the little reading nook in the front of the house facing the ocean.  If I were ever stuck in Boston I would definitely use this host again but Boston was not good to me. The only positive experience I had while there was this AIRBNB experience.  Just can't deal with the constant road rage drivers,  rude customer support everywhere and parking ticket cops! Best of luck if you have to come thru this city. Jim, thanks so much,  loved your home!"
57800,30817581,2015-04-27,23227332,Carmen,"The house is homey and fun in a beautiful neighborhood. I was impressed with the continental breakfast spread. There was a guest couple also staying there who were basically holding their family reunion at the house, which was interesting. The view from the sunroom was amazing. I would definitely stay here again."
57800,31123826,2015-05-02,22093025,Lheisa,Jim was welcoming on my arrival and available to answer questions.  Neighbourhood was great!
57800,31836284,2015-05-10,20709298,Shuwen,"I have stayed at Jim's place for a week. The transportation is really convenient if you wanna go downtown. The sea view in front of the house is great. There is also a park nearby where you can go for a run or walk everyday. Jim is very accommodating. The room is spacious and tidy though the bathroom is not as clean as I have expected.  Overall, it was a pleasant stay."
57800,31972581,2015-05-12,22646144,Virginia,"I liked the welcome sticker on the door, and enjoyed wonderful view from the dinning space next to the inlet. The guests there were nice and friendly, was a very good time getting along. Breakfast resources were awesome! The location is only 15 mins walk from T-station, and the cab service provided by Jim and Afi was reliable. Recommended."
57800,32092115,2015-05-13,2377244,Ida,The location was perfect. It is very convenient if you need a place near the airport. Jim recommended an excellent Vietnamese restaurant in the neighborhood and I loved it.  The house was very cozy.
57800,32299004,2015-05-16,18607361,Frank (And Meridith),Another great stay with Jim. The key system has been improved since last I stayed here; be sure to read the instructions!
Still great value,proximity to airport,"and breakfast spread.\"",,,
57800,32700515,2015-05-20,24693465,Changgang,"The location is very good.  The living room faces the ocean and airport.  It's about 5-10 minutes walking distance away from the subway station.  Even though it is close to the airport, I was not bothered by the noise at all, partly because the windows are very good and partly because the airplanes were not flying over this house.  The room is good enough for me since I was intending to only sleep there.  The neighborhood is safe, too.  I got here around midnight and did not feel unsafe walking from the subway station to this house."
It would have been better if the host could have provided hair shampoo.  I understand there is a CVS couple of blocks away,but for many people travelling,"either they arrive at night after the CVS is closed or they do not know the neighborhood.  I bought a 2-in-1 for myself and left it there for everyone to use.\"",,,
57800,33379800,2015-05-27,31699717,Sarah,The directions were great and the place was very easy to find from the airport. The room itself was super quiet.
57800,33715412,2015-05-31,32738410,Barbara,"Quartiere davvero carino, proprio davanti alla baia quindi c'era una bellissima vista dal portico e dal salotto. La stanza era proprio come era stata descritta, e la colazione era sul tavolo in cucina, a disposizione degli ospiti. Comunicare con l'host via mail è stato molto semplice e le indicazioni su come arrivare dettagliate - peccato solo non aver incontrato nessuno dei due durante la mia permanenza."
57800,33832098,2015-06-01,985482,Sebastien,"Very nice and detailed communication for the arrival. I only met Jim and Afiyah briefly the next day.  The room is as described, conveniently located next to the airport and the subway line, with a few restaurants within walking distance."
57800,34329830,2015-06-07,33397095,Naveen,This was my first experience with airbnb and I should say it was a good experience. The place was just as described. Neighborhood was very calm and felt a bit deserted too.
57800,34552672,2015-06-09,20557345,Mihai,It was the ideal choice for a two nights stay in Boston. I needed a clean and cheap place around the airport AND with easy access to the T. This place was able to fit all criteria!
57800,35006538,2015-06-14,31945012,Rosalie,"This was my First Airbnb experience. Jim and Afiyah have a very convenient location, close to the Logan Airport, Boston and the Transit system with in a short easy walk to get to the airport, city and beyond. Even though it was close to the airport the jet noise was not bothersome. The view of watching takeoffs across the water was nice to watch. The neighborhood is very nice and feels comfortable and safe. It was very quiet and private even though there are many rooms being used besides the managers. I did not see them much but they were only a text away and met all my needs. Breakfast was always available in case you are an earlier or late riser or on a different time zone. This was very convenient. I was there 5 nights then back for one so I would be close to the airport. They left a nice note on my door which made me know I was in the right place. The bed was comfortable and shared bathroom very workable. It most likely that is is the only block in Boston on which parking IS NOT a problem. Do take the Transit to the city though.  On the front door instructions: wait after the code for the door to unlock THEN push the latch hard and you will have no problem letting yourself in and out. Thanks again Jim and Afiyah if I need a place there I would stay again."
57800,35111422,2015-06-15,32711022,Wing-On,Afiyah was very gracious and showed me around the house when I arrived.  The room is clean and comfortable.  The location is perfect if you need to catch an early flight out of Logan.
57800,35276543,2015-06-16,16642270,Wanting,"Jim and Afiyah's house is located conveniently for people travelling to/from Logan Airport. The living room facing the ocean has a breathtaking view. My room is spacious and has a fan, which is very useful during summer. Although Jim and Afiyah were not there during my stay; Jim was always available when I had questions. I will definitely book with them again!"
57800,35328524,2015-06-17,31945012,Rosalie,I was there for 5 days then came back  for one a few days later to be near the Airport so see my earlier review. Thanks again!

57800,35531684,2015-06-19,12847512,Jack,When I arrived there was a welcome note on my bedroom door.  Nice touch!  Small but comfortable room.  House was neat and clean.  Breakfast options were on the kitchen table when I awoke.
"\"",,,,,
57800,35591429,2015-06-20,33035668,Yuji,Really neat house and spacious room!!
"I enjoyed breakfast with Nutella lol\"",,,,,
57800,35748098,2015-06-21,36026576,Franckapri1,The place was good. The location has the advantage of being close to the airport and a metro station. Only thing to note is that there was no way of locking my private room.
57800,36141273,2015-06-25,12052490,Giselle,"I had a great stay at Jim and Afiyah's place! The lock system was very convenient; I didn't have to worry about keeping track of keys. The view in the front sunroom is absolutely amazing. I spent most of my time there watching the planes land and take off with the Boston skyline right in view as well. The bathroom was nice and clean. The bedroom was quaint and plenty spacious for me. If you're a light sleeper, there was one night where the planes seemed louder than usual, but because I always have ear plugs on me, it wasn't a problem when I put them on."
The breakfast spread (cereal,toast,apples) and tea/coffee were so convenient! I agree with the other review that mentioned that this was an actual bed and breakfast,"which I hadn't thought of before.\"",,
57800,36246218,2015-06-26,36463983,Kyle,"Really great, comfortable, and clean room. Convenient to get to from the airport, and right near the Blue Line, so you can easily get anywhere in Boston. Would definitely recommend staying here."
57800,36401552,2015-06-28,15945635,Phyllis,super sweet place in a super convinient neighborhood! I have nothing to complain haha. the rooms can't be locked though. if this concerns some people.
57800,36576577,2015-06-29,31793579,Han-Ying,"The place was exactly as described. I checked-in at a very late time, but there was totally no problem because the host gave me the entry security code, which helped a lot! I haven't had a chance to meet the host, but that's not an issue. The free food in the kitchen was really useful since I was wet and hungry when I arrived. The location is quite close to the T station, which one can easily get to via the airport ground transportation. In general, this is a place to stay if you need one near the airport."
57800,36902033,2015-07-02,35520956,Thais,"Jim received me very well when I was arriving and the house is really close to the metro station, which is just 2 stations from the airport"
57800,38001937,2015-07-12,7164925,Vani,"First, Jim was very rapid in answering my mails.  The house is located in an amazing spot with a beautiful view of the bay and the airport.  It is an old style cozy house, it is clean.  The cons:  the fact that the owners were not there disturbed me a bit, when i came to the house it was empty and I didn't feel at ease.  The noise of the planes can be disturbing.  But if you want to stay close to the airport, it is a good place."
57800,38438313,2015-07-15,13740548,Kat,"Jim & Afiyah have welcomed me nicely. The home was easy to find and shown as in the pictures. There was a lot of space and I was allowed to use the kitchen and the living room as well. The WiFi worked excellent and everything was clean. The neighborhood seems very safe to me. The city is very fast and easy accessible. I looked myself out one time and Jim & Afiyah were super easy to contact and helped me out. I can definitely  recommend this place. Best, Kathrin"
57800,39084010,2015-07-20,37792216,Roberto,"Realmente es un lugar muy tranquilo y limpio, nadie te molestaba y siempre había algo disponible para desayunar.  El barrio es bonito y muy accesible al transporte público."

57800,39254929,2015-07-21,38912062,Charles,Afiyah welcomed me. She was super nice.
57800,39587630,2015-07-24,10449935,Kirk,The house was great. Easy to find and conveniently located to public transport. The room was well furnished and was very comfortable.
57800,40187943,2015-07-28,5318730,Ard,"The set up of this house was a bit uncommon, the hosts were responsive via message but I never met anyone at the house, other than another guest looking for  the bathroom."
Everything was  taken care of though: the room was clean,breakfast was set up and the bed was comfortable. It worked perfectly for the night I had to crash in Boston.,,,,
From the front of the house you can see across the water,straight onto the runway of the airport,"which I thought was a neat feature.\"",,,
57800,40542743,2015-07-31,2172140,Shen,"This was a fine place to stay,  quiet, efficient, helpful and close to airport, but set in a lovely location."
"\"",,,,,
57800,40802162,2015-08-02,32933599,Yasha,"I needed a place to stay for an overnight layover, and figured this place would be a good place to stay. I was right. Everything was neat, clean, and orderly, and there was even breakfast foods available. Speaking as someone who just needed a place to stay the night, this place was perfect."
57800,41290735,2015-08-05,5374750,Jo,"This is a good option for an overnight stay in Boston, very close to Logan and just a short walk from public transport."
As other reviews said,this is set up as a bed-and-breakfast with several rooms rented out,with shared bathroom,kitchen,and small living area (from which you can watch the planes at Logan). There's a code for the front door and rooms do not have locks. It was a bit startling when someone opened my bedroom door after midnight (likely looking for the bathroom).,
The hosts sent detailed instructions via message and I had no problems. I did not meet them; after reading other reviews I didn't expect to.,,,,,
If you're looking for a place to sleep for a layover,and you know this is what you're getting,"it's a good deal. Don't forget to take your towel with you to the bathroom!\"",,,
57800,41478135,2015-08-07,38904208,Lilith,The location of the house is very convenient. The bedroom is nice and large. Both hosts were accommodating and helpful.  They even provide food in their kitchen.
57800,41565322,2015-08-07,11737642,Derek,This place was very convenient for my morning flight out of Logan. Check in was a breeze and I slept well. Jim seemed pleasant as well as the other guests.
57800,42016681,2015-08-10,19542416,Ann Elyse,"Hose was so cute. Absolutely love the view of the bay from porch so nice. Even though the airport is close you really don't hear the planes inside with windows closed. My only comment is I wish I had known there was other guests in the home besides me, just as a courtesy to me.  Also another house guest came home at 2am and repeatedly opened the door for about 20min making the door alarm go off every time. I had to be up at 4:30am so this was not convenient for me. Loved the kitchen breakfast station. So nice! There was no dish soap to clean my plates unfortunately, if there had been I would not have left dishes for them. Overall nice stay."
57800,42354967,2015-08-12,36300660,Levi,"This was a good, convenient place to crash for the night. There is some noise from the airport but it didn't bother me. It wasn't air conditioned but with the windows opened I slept comfortably. I do feel like it's worth mentioning I didn't have a way to lock my bedroom and the bathroom didn't lock either. And the shower was disgusting but those are my only complaints. Very much appreciated the breakfast food left out for guests and the overall convenience of the stay."
57800,42577464,2015-08-14,4719230,Albert,"There was a miscommunication when I arrived. The hosts were not home and I did not have in advance the key code to enter the house. They did, however, respond very quickly to my requests for the code."
The house is on Bayswater Street,a very apt name,as it runs along a small inlet that is bordered on the other side by several runways of Logan Airport.  However,I never found the sound of the planes taking off and landing to be disturbing.  In fact,I kind of enjoyed watching this from the porch.  I wish that I had had more time to explore the immediate surrounding area.,
I should add that Jim and Afiyah put out a spread of sandwich and breakfast foods,which was very welcoming.  As it seems they have a lot of guests coming through,this spread is probably a fixture in their kitchen.  As I live in Beijing,being able to prepare a PB&J sandwich -- or two -- was something of a simple pleasure.,,
The bedroom I stayed in,which I refer to as the Lincoln Bedroom (there's a portrait of the president on the wall above the bed),"was very comfortable.  One inconvenience was the WiFi was not working during my one night there. \"",,,

57800,43890468,2015-08-22,24773645,Nidia,Stayed here because we had a layover! This home is unique and charming! Jim was very kind and helpful.
57800,44085602,2015-08-23,41513297,Shameka,It was great and just what I needed.  I loved being right next to the water after a long day of airport delays. The booking process was simple and smooth. No complaints. I'm happy.
57800,44851059,2015-08-29,23925309,Dima,The view!!!!
57800,45036445,2015-08-30,32352423,JIarui,This house is pretty self-served. The host provide the necessary information before you arrive like how to open the front door. Location is perfect. It faces the bay and Logan (URL HIDDEN) is tidy and clean but the bed may be a little small for a big guy. There is no key for your private room which is a little disappointed.
57800,47057433,2015-09-15,40031418,Lauren,The room was just as described but I was surprised by the sign on the door and thought for a second I was the wrong house.
I didn't see Jim or Afiyah during my visit,but I didn't expect to as other reviews stated they did either. It wasn't made clear to me that there would be other Airbnb guests staying,there were 2 other people staying during my time. We all shared the same bathroom.,,,
There wasn't a lock on person room nor on the bathroom door (the bathroom door was some what hard to open after being fully closed).,,,,,
The hosts did have a nice breakfast spread,3 types of cereal and making for toast.,,,,
I chose this room for its closeness to the T (Boston subway) and it was a quick 8 min walk. There are 2 very close liquor store and a CVS.,,,,,
Though there was no AC it wasn't a problem the window fan did a GREAT job. You can see the airport from the house but the noise wasn't bad at all.,,,,,
"I would recommend this place for friends because the price is great and the location in relation to the T is doable. Its about a 20 min ride  on the T into Boston.      \"",,,,,
57800,48194136,2015-09-24,41778857,Jahmai,"I loved this airbnb. For the price I paid, the value was extraordinary. First off it's only 2 stops on the train; it literally takes 5 minutes from the airport; awesome for a traveler like me that takes red eye flights. The house itself is in a quiet neighborhood. There is a very nice beach at the end of the street. When I say nice beach I mean sand, water, public bathrooms, picnic tables etc. An actual beach. The house itself was clean and actually had real noise canceling windows. Now to why you need those. The neighborhood is at the end of a runway with a body of water in between. I enjoyed watching all the planes take off by the window :). The room itself was clean and tidy, with the wifi codes and towels placed neatly in the room. The one thing I loved most though about this airbnb, besides the smiley face next to my name on the door to welcome me was the fact that it's very private. I hardly saw anyone during my stay. I actually do like that. The bathroom could use a bit of updating though but it was clean and served it's purpose so can't complain too much on that."
57800,48363514,2015-09-25,44362475,Bobby,"Listing description was 100% accurate and very thorough.  The best part about using this host is that in my experience they responded immediately, within 1-2 minutes, to my messages/questions.  I was  lucky enough to be able to use the host's driveway for parking during my trip out of Logan airport.  This was a huge convenience and a fair fee was offered.   Airport is easy to get to in under 25 min:  half-mile walk, two stops on the blue line of the T, and a shuttle ride to terminals."
57800,48604458,2015-09-27,43381254,Liam,Although I didn't meet Jim and Afiyah in person- I arrived late at night and happened to leave while they were out of the house- their hospitality was still apparent in our communications.  The space was clean and conveniently close to the airport.
57800,49062883,2015-09-30,2100310,Jeremy,"Not too far from the subway--I just walked there with my luggage. I didn't see anyone else while I was there. I was a little odd, not knowing who else was in the house, since there is no way to see the names or reviews of the other people in the house at the same time--just be comfortable with that before booking."
57800,49510306,2015-10-04,42148384,Hanry,"The room was as described. The bed was ok, I sleep better on firm bed. The quick breakfast (cereal and apple) was helpful especially when you have to drive very early."

From the decoration you will know that he is a taste host. I like his house. The house is nearby the bay,beautiful view and only about 5 minutes to SUBWAY. Good option for your tourism."
57800,51190166,2015-10-18,44397955,Maria Fernanda,I recommend this accommodation. It's conveniently close to the airport. I met host Afiyah and she was very nice and helpfull. There's breakfast in the kitchen and the room was clean.
57800,51354419,2015-10-19,45592717,Jonathan,"Very nice stay. Afiyah spotted me arriving while walking Cassidy and was very welcoming. The door took some shoving to get open after typing in the password, but no major issue there. The shower was a bit old, so bring your own flip flops. Toilet seat might fall down on its own, so guys be careful. Room exactly like the picture, if your not sure which room, look for the nice post-it on the door. No lock on the door, but I knew that already. Wifi worked well, and breakfast was simple, although I think the butter would be better off stored in the fridge. Didn't hear any airplanes, the windows were all sound proof. Great place and great value if your looking for a place to spend the night after a long flight or before flying from Boston (2 subway stations from the airport, 5-10 min walk from the station)."
57800,54020041,2015-11-15,45003269,Rafael,"The place is really close to the airport. However, if do not like dogs (I love them), don't be there. There is a really big and adorable one. The bed is not confortable, the bedroom and the restroom don't have keys. For just one night and the price charged, it is ok."
57800,54212454,2015-11-16,47760829,Elijah,Thanks for your hospitality and your nice house. This house is located at a very scenic place. Highly recommanded.

Everything was excellent,except for maybe the relatively slow internet speeds.,,,,
"Thank you!\"",,,,,
57800,59027392,2016-01-05,36943407,Robert,"The hosts were able to accommodate me and my dog on short notice and were a real life saver during our visit to Boston. The home sits on the shore of east Boston with an amazing view of the city skyline. The house was very charming and bedroom quite cozy. Breakfast was laid out like an actual hotel and I was happy to spend the morning drinking coffee and eating toast with jam before I continued my exploration of Boston. I met Jim briefly and he was very polite and a pleasure to talk to. Plus, he Loved my dog...but how could you not? :)"
57800,60348249,2016-01-22,30443316,Malcolm,"The internet was slow.  Otherwise, I had everything I needed.  The place was clean and spacious.  I was there briefly, and never met the host.  They accommodated my last minute schedule change with no problem, and provided good directions.  One or two other reviewers here have complained about the lock, but I had no trouble with it.  You just need to push the latch harder with your thumb."
57800,61857558,2016-02-08,47843415,Van,"I arrived around midnight because my flight landed pretty late. I had trouble opening the door because it got stuck, and Jim immediately came down to help me out. I'm very grateful that he didn't mind that I was arriving late, and had to ask for his help at midnight. We didn't have much contact as I have to leave the early morning, but Jim keeps the house and room very clean and well prepared. It's also close to Logan Airport, which works perfectly for me. I definitely recommend Jim as a host."
57800,62137366,2016-02-11,56432328,Gabe,"Though I didn't meet Jim & Afiyah in person, they were very communicative and helpful. The residence wasn't far from the airport, and it was quite comfortable. They also had a selection of breakfast amenities for guests, which is a nice touch. Recommended."
57800,62657239,2016-02-15,53873229,Manus,This was a perfect stopover location for me as I was flying out of Logan to Dublin next day! Everything you could ever need is provided and there is great privacy.
57800,63112166,2016-02-20,2470074,Julie,"The room was exactly what I needed for my layover. The food was as big bonus. A word of warning about the taxi service shown on the refrigerator, I called them for a ride to Logan and was told a cab would be there in 5-10 minutes and it didn't arrive until 35 minutes later."

They sent me very clear and thorough directions on how to access the house,where my room was and bathroom. They were very welcoming by leaving a note on my door,clean towels laid out,food set out. Their house was very clean too. I loved jumping into a clean bed that smelled so nice.,,
"I had a lovely stay and I plan on being back. I hope to meet them next time. \"",,,,,

I got the first floor all to myself when I stayed which is great. The house is classic, quiet and has a amazing view of the ocean. Nice experience."
57800,65442030,2016-03-13,24164823,Wei Phang,Check in is easy with Jim & Afiyah. I'm happy to have stayed in their place for my trip to Boston. The room is clean and tidy.
Location-wise,the house is very close to the subway station which makes it easy to travel to places. I find the house very nice facing the airport runway and the ocean. I have no trouble falling asleep as the room is very well sound proof.,,,,

Jim and Afiyah are friendly and generous, and they provide a continental breakfast and coffee for all of their guests. The house is on the water, with a pretty amazing view of the airport and Boston skyline. I have no complaints about my stay, except that the Internet connection was pretty spotty and if I had had to work out of the room, that could have been a problem. In all I had a great stay and would come back in a second."

57800,72497626,2016-05-02,47414050,Tianlin,"The house is very old and the rooms are small, but make a nice place to stay for a one-night stay near the airport. It had wood floors which creaked wherever you stepped. This made me feel bad for making noise when I left for a 6 am flight. The bedroom and bathroom doors had no locks. This isn't necessarily a deal breaker, but as a solo traveler, it would have been nice to know this ahead of time, especially if you wanted to leave your valuables and explore the city."

57800,76879191,2016-05-29,40416938,Fabrizio,"La sistemazione è economica, quindi non si può pretendere troppo. Il quartiere è carino, anche se non vicinissimo al centro (mezz'ora di metro) e anche se l'aeroporto si trova dall'altra parte della baia. Il rumore degli aerei è poco percettibile all'interno, grazie ai vetri fonoassorbenti. La camera era come da foto, abbastanza spaziosa e abbastanza pulita. L'asciugamano fornito non era perfettamente pulito, ma me lo sono fatto andare bene. Come aspetti senz'altro negativi c'erano l'odore pungente di tabacco (o qualcosa di simile) diffuso in tutto l'appartamento, e il fatto che le porte di camere e bagno fossero senza alcuna serratura. Non ho incontrato i proprietari, ma le indicazioni per l'appartamento erano chiare e non ho avuto problemi."
57800,77606369,2016-06-02,8333833,Karen,"Easy communication via text, as I saw Jim only very briefly after arriving. GREAT LOCATION and beautiful views from the house. I went running through the neighborhoods down to the island and felt completely safe the entire time. Room was exactly what I needed for the day prior to the airport- which is easy to navigate to from there on the T without a problem"
57800,77632006,2016-06-02,35904401,Allyssa,I had a wonderful time at Jim and afiyah's beautiful little water front place. It's very homey. I flew in at a ridiculously early hour and they let me come to the house early and set my things in the living room and I read in their sun room out front for a few hours with tea until my room was ready. It was cozy and they offer a little breakfast set up which is very nice for a tired traveler. I would come stay here anytime! I was so sad to leave.
57800,77847345,2016-06-04,15026710,Caroline,"This is a really special place; I was given such a warm welcome by Afiyah and I immediately felt right at home. The house is lovely and beautifully decorated, and is in a great location right on the water and very near a T station, which will get you to the airport and/or downtown Boston very quickly. The free continental breakfast was also great. Afiyah let me leave my luggage in her home and get some paperwork done past check out time, which was so appreciated! This was the perfect place to stay after a weary few weeks working on the road. I hope to stay here again."

The room was nice and clean, and while I had to leave very early for a flight (330am) it was great to get a few hours of uninterrupted sleep for a cheap price."

I needed a clean place near Logan Airport.  This was the right choice. \""

Room was very large and bed super comfortable. I happened to stay on a holiday weekend so all other rooms at this property seemed to be occupied. Fortunately everyone was very considerate of the other guests in the house and were speaking in hushed tones or stepping very lightly... however I could imagine how the wrong type of person could easily make things uncomfortable.  Jim and Afiyah do a great job of ensuring only pleasant and responsible guests.  Perfect stay and I would welcome staying  again if ever on a brief airport stop in BOS.  Thanks!!!"

Afiyah provided me with excellent directions and it was easy to find their house. Right away, Afiyah encouraged me, \"\"Make yourself at home\"\" and provided everything I needed. Having breakfast food and coffee available really does add a feeling of homeyness and made the morning I had to catch my flight much more pleasant. Like I told Afiyah"

57800,86577501,2016-07-17,79903656,Grania,Only stayed one night. Listing was accurate.Room was comfortable. However a lock inside of door would make a person more at ease especially when sleeping.Otherwise very basic and thought a bit expensive allowing for the fact you are near the airport and in a city.  A registered B&B here would cost much less than your price.
57800,86953539,2016-07-18,30912238,Margaret,"It's a good place to stay if you are just in and out of the city and feel comfortable crashing at a friends house. It is in a convenient location, close to the airport, train station and has an amazing view. It was kind of weird at first trying to come in because the door lock was a little hard to deal with. The room was cool. It's a twin so if you are tall it won't work. I  took a shower there and it wasn't anything glamorous so if you choose this place you must be forgiving. The view made up for it though. I went as a lone explorer so coming back to get refreshed mid day was amazing. Overrall, very satisified but not impressed. I am definitely grateful because the price was right for the location."
57800,89219547,2016-07-27,35868568,Claudia,Afiyah was very welcoming.

57800,89807898,2016-07-30,18405585,Karina,"This place was adequate.  It was good enough for one night but I found several things odd/concerning.  There are no locks in the rooms and they book several airbnb guests each night, which leaves lockless rooms with people you have never met or read reviews on before. The house is run down and the airplanes above were very loud, especially since the windows had to be kept open because the fan did not work in my room and it was very hot.  The shared bathroom door does not close all the way or lock; this is the bathroom shared with other guests you have not met.  This was too expensive for what it was; I recommend future guests research all reviews before deciding if this place will suit their needs."

Communication with her was quick and reliable when we had questions. The apartment was very clean, comfortable and tastefully furnished. There was more than enough space for my boyfriend and I, and the bed and blankets were so soft and comfy! We slept so well. I would absolutely recommend this listing, and in the future would stay here again. We didn't have time to take advantage of all the area has to offer, but it looked like there were a lot of cute restaurants and bars in the area. Thank you Natanya!"

I was coming in to visit Boston for a few days and wanted a quaint place to stay in a good location and needless to say, this unit surpassed all expectation. The apartment is a very nice and spacious one bedroom with more than enough elbow room to unwind. And the location is ideal! Just a stone's throw away from Commonwealth Ave., this apartment brings you close to everything you may need."
Natanya herself was incredible! Although I wasn't able to meet her,she kept everything perfectly ready and organized before my arrival. What's more is she constantly stayed in touch with me to make sure my stay was as comfortable as possible.,,,,

Netanya had juices and milk in the fridge, a yogurt parfait, a basket of fruit, nuts, granola bar and a box of cereal. The apartment is in a great location close to public transportation and many ethnic restaurants. Plenty of hot water and a comfy bed, and great internet, strong enough handle working through a VPN.

She handed me the keys, showed me around the house, and everything was spotless, exactly as in the photos."
We had a really nice stay,and the location—very close to Chestnut Hill where we were attending a graduation—was perfect. Finding parking was a bit of a challenge,but coming from New York it was nothing unexpected.,,,

The immediate surrounding area has lots of options for dining, bars, and shopping as well. The apartment is old and charming, just what we wanted! Very clean too.

The location is great - about a 5 minute walk to the BC Green line to get into Boston-proper and a 5 minute stroll to shopping, a vast variety of restaurants, CVS, Starbucks, bars, a gym, and more.

The room didn't have a lock on the door but I wasn't too concerned. The bathroom was in the kitchen area,not next to the room so that was a little awkward but wasn't too bad.,,,,
As for the condition of the room itself,it was a little dirty and had a strange smell,kind of a mix of mustiness and pets. I would say if you are looking for a cheap place to stay that's in a nice neighborhood,go for it--it was a five minute walk from public trans and the conference hotel that I had to go to every morning. But if creature comforts are your deal this is not the kind of room you go home to in order to recharge. It's bare bones--but at $90-something a night,"that's expected. \"",

The entire building, however, was extremely cluttered. There were piles of books and papers everywhere, including the hallways and kitchen. Had I needed to spend time in my apartment beyond sleeping, I would have been very uncomfortable."
526970,2598967,2012-10-13,61417,Bill,Robert was a wonderful host.  He greeted me at the door and we had a nice discussion about literature and history.  He is an expert on the history of the Titanic.  The room was on the first floor and very quiet and comfortable.  The bath was down the hallway and had a very nice shower.  I slept well and hope to return to the same room someday.

526970,2691492,2012-10-22,2819805,Joseph,Definitely read all of the reviews before booking if you are very particular about where you are staying. We stayed in the first floor room which wasn't bad- it's extremely old and pretty quirky but overall a large room and the apartment is on a BEAUTIFUL street and in a perfect location. The bathroom was VERY DIRTY - it literally a layer of dirt on the floor. The rest of the house was just as the reviews said.. full of books and smelled kind of funny. Robert was very nice even though we only met him briefly. They were also very accommodating and let us leave our luggage until later in the evening.
526970,4208611,2013-04-18,5687014,Steven,"Robert was an accomodating, polite host.  He is very good at communicating with his guests, both in person and online.  He also gave me specific directions when I arrived, so I didn't have to venture into the city without prior knowledge of where to go and which trains to take, etc.  The bedrooms are spacious and have a classic feel to them.  Very 19th century brownstone feel to the whole place.  Sharing a bathroom was not as inconvenient as I anticipated it to be.  Overall, my stay was welcome and hospitable."
526970,4719189,2013-05-21,1367952,Cathy,I stayed in this apartment for one night as I was in Boston for a short period of time to do an interview.

In terms of the room, I felt like I was sleeping in a well-stocked library but I did not mind because I love books. I even wrote down a couple titles to acquire for my own library. The room was comfortable and served my purpose while I attended my conference. I felt very fortunate that I was within walking distance from the Fairmont Copley Plaza hotel.  I would definitely return."
526970,5932289,2013-07-22,7469193,Ashish,Prof Robert is lovely person. He guided me very well on places to visit nearby and assured me that public transport in Boston is good to rely. But I felt bad when he provided me ground room even when my booking was for first floor. Kitchen attached to room was horribly mismanaged. Room on ground floor was stuffy and stinky. There are book all around and I did not feel like staying in that room.
526970,6295670,2013-08-06,7877429,Mani,"I had a pleasant experience there. I stayed on the top floor for the first night, it was such a lovely and cozy room filled with books. the second night i moved to the main floor (the bigger room) . I loved the building, it was old and characteristic and you could see it's been through a lot. It added so much to my Boston experience.. Robert is a very interesting man that  I was overall completely  happy with my stay. Robert is a very interesting and cultured man. he helped me plan by sightseeing and told me a bit about the history of the town.. If I ever go back to Boston, I'll stay there again."
526970,6361195,2013-08-09,7884797,Deliang,"It's our first visit to Boston. We got to Boston late that day, it was 9:00 PM and we hadn't find a place to stay. I tried to search on Airbnb app if there's any luck, and Robert literally saved us for the night. Beautiful Victorian building and neighborhood. Books about Chinese history and literature were filled in the stairhall and in the living room. Robert is a Chinese history and literature professor and I am Chinese. We talked until very late that night and Robert invited us to walk around this beautiful and historic community after that. He is so considerate and offered us generous help for out touring in Boston. He sent us the Boston south station when we left. By the way, he is 65+ years old. Thank you so much, Robert."
526970,6673497,2013-08-20,8052725,Jessica,"This brownstone is a great place to stay, especially if you are coming in via Amtrak.  It is within walking distance of a lot of awesome things, too."
"Keep in mind that this is someone's house so if you are expecting hotel \"\"clean\"\"",you may be disappoint.  I had a great stay and will definitely plan to stay here,"again.\"",,,
526970,6741154,2013-08-23,453386,Jacob,Enjoyed staying at Roberts. The room is very eclectic!
526970,6976933,2013-09-01,8084580,Hanna,"Robert was a really nice host. The house is perfectly located, a few minutes from the Back Bay station and 5min from Copley square."
We arrived in the afternoon and Robert was there to welcome us and give us the key of the house,we had the 1st floor room. The room was spacious and clean,the private bathroom was great too.,,,
"I recommend to stay at Robert's place if you're looking for a nice host and a great room in Boston!\"",,,,,
526970,7684729,2013-09-29,9007881,Caroline,I had a great stay in Boston and the location of Robert's house is excellent! You're in the heart of Boston and Back Bay station is only 3 min away by foot! Robert provided me with helpful instructions on how to reach his place from the airport. The room is big and the double bed is spacious and comfy. The only downside of the room is that you have to access the bathroom through the kitchen which is used by the other residents of the house.
526970,7828642,2013-10-05,2593815,Rolf,I had a good stay in Boston. I felt welcomed and the room fitted my needs perfectly. I can recommend this location!
526970,9579124,2014-01-02,496414,John,Loved Robert's house!
Classic South End/Beacon Hill brownstone.,,,,,
I hope this house never condos or changes.,,,,,
The room that we had was perfect and the central location of the house topped it all off.,,,,,
Robert and his helper were very helpful and accomidating on our one night stay.,,,,,
"I highly recommend a stay here if you plan a trip to Boston!\"",,,,,
526970,12043439,2014-04-22,5348047,Greg,"This was my second stay at Robert's place and my first stay in his new, second floor room."
My room was clean and the bed was new as he just readied the room to let airbnb renters stay. I was kept warm with an electric heater in this quiet room. The bathroom was on the first floor but the room itself has a sink for water and to brush your teeth. Wifi worked in the room just fine.,,,,,
The location is prime and everything is within walking distance including the orange subway line.,,,,,
Robert was an excellent host just as last time,he gave me some much needed pointers about getting around town and if you need help with the current festivities and events of the city,he knows about those too. I wish We could have spent more time together on this short visit but as usual I had a lot to do in the city and meeting friends and running the marathon were my top priorities.,,,
"Hopefully next year I'll have more time to sit down and visit with Robert and Jackie as they're absolutely lovely to be around!\"",,,,,
526970,12468326,2014-05-03,5291144,Mary,Very friendly and well educated host. Attractive house filled with books and prints. It didn't feel like a sterile hotel room. The only problem was that the bathroom was on a different floor.
526970,13772757,2014-06-03,14908008,Marisa,"My time at Robert's place was perfect! Location-wise it is in an amazing neighbourhood. Walking distance to back bay station and a ton of cute restaurants in the south end. It was extremely accessible, which was very convenient. The room itself was adequate, but if you are looking for the bells and whistles of an upscale airbnb or a hotel, this may not be the place for you. Robert was very easy to communicate with and was helpful with his tips on where to go and what to do in Boston. He has a wealth of knowledge on the city's history and was able to share some helpful hints. I would most definitely stay there again while in town!"
526970,13863213,2014-06-06,15979821,Ivan,"Robert is a friendly host.  His helper Jacky was very informative too.   This place is located in a great location.  You can get around through the T, which is one block away, and there are some nice restaurants and cafes around the neighborhood.  If you are looking for a convenient, affordable, and safe place to stay, this is it.  Robert has a huge collection of books and beautiful artworks of horses, which is pretty amazing.  I had enjoyed my stay."
526970,13965915,2014-06-09,15027456,Katherine,"My boyfriend and I had an absolutely wonderful time staying as guests in Robert's house when I came back to town for my college reunion. My boyfriend had never been to Boston before, so I wanted to stay somewhere central where I could show him as many sites as possible in our whirlwind two days there. Robert's place turned out to embody the quintessential essence of the best of Boston that I wished to show my SO. A gorgeous, Old World-feel townhouse on a charming street in the South End/Back Bay just steps from Back Bay Station. The proximity to public transit and to Copley, Newbury Street, and other attractions could not be beat, and the rate was *SO* much better than what we could have afforded for a similar experience at a B&B elsewhere in the city."
Robert and Jackie were as gracious hosts as others have previously described. I ended up talking to Robert for half the morning about my family history from China,since he mentioned he has developed a keen interest in twentieth-century Chinese history,and nearly missed my reunion BBQ picnic! His hallways are also filled from floor to ceiling with books of every genre and subject matter--many from the renowned Brattle Book Shop--which made me very nostalgic for my late grandfather who also used to spend hours perusing their used books when he was alive. It was all in all a very wonderful stay,although I have to admit we hardly spent any time sleeping in our room,since we spent the majority of our stay catching up with my old friends out at Tufts!,
In sum,"could not recommend this place any higher for anyone looking for an authentic Boston experience for a relative bargain price. I'll definitely try to book this place again the next time we're back in town!  \"",,,,
526970,14230337,2014-06-15,12370501,Yixin,Robert was a good host.  I had to change my reservation date twice due to my daughter's requests.  I felt bad about them but Robert took the trouble and accommodated our needs.  Thank you Robert.
The townhouse is in a good location.  The room is fine too.  Will book there again in next two months.,,,,,
"Highly recommended.\"",,,,,
526970,14418576,2014-06-18,4308867,Kate,"Very different experience. Place was very artistic decorated with antiques, art and old books. It was more like a guest house. It was a fantastic location and host and helper were amazing so nice and full of knowledge about the location and super nice. The down stairs room was comfortable but there was no where to hang clothes or drawers to put things away. With so many books and furniture the place was a little musty so of you have allergies may not be the place for you. There is a kitchen area to use but it was very cluttered and not the cleanest but if you are eating out then it's no problem."
526970,14567188,2014-06-22,15719945,Jen,"Robert was an enthusiastic host, everything was clean and comfortable.  The neighborhood felt safe, and the location was very very convenient for my needs."
526970,14845134,2014-06-27,10173436,Glenn,Mr. Bonds is a great host....the bedroom was large and comfortable...the bathroom was good. The location was perfect for my purposes. The kitchen was cluttered which my host acknowledged. I would have not qualms about staying here again.
526970,15113355,2014-07-02,648763,Jim,"Excellent location...2 blocks from Back Bay T and rail services, and $5 express bus to Loan...right near Copley Square, Pru Center, etc..."
Quiet leafy street in beautiful old character brick house,more yesteryear than spiffed up. Interior is,thus,characteristically old and dark...and cool downstairs.,,
Robert is professorial and has stacks of books all over that shows it.,,,,,
Shared bath w/ stand-up shower is yesteryear,but just fine and clean. Breakfast not on offer,but had kitchen access available.,,,
My double bed was comfy in very spacious,period room. I took the basement room w/ TV and AirCon.,,,,
"Robert and Jackie were very pleasant and helpful.\"",,,,,
526970,15584712,2014-07-12,7058825,Yemi,"This is my second time staying in the same room. Robert is a great host!! Since I have an idea of what the house/room looks like, I knew what to expect; but Robert, being a great host that he is, still took it upon himself to send me guide from the airport to the house. He figured I may have forgotten how to get to the house or not aware of the recent updates around the city. So I took the Silver Line (that is free from the airport) which was different from the blue line that I took the last time. Getting to the house, we had some nice conversation and I think we are fast becoming friends. If I finds myself in Boston again, even if I am not staying with Robert, I will sure stop by to say HI - That is how fantastic he is!!!"
526970,17213011,2014-08-09,717204,Saumil,"Robert was a wonderful host, and his home is ideally located in the heart of Back Bay. Robert has great recommendations on what to see in Boston, and his hospitality was much appreciated."
526970,18344900,2014-08-25,17496916,Alexa,"This was my second time staying with Robert, and the first time staying there with my husband. Robert is, as before, a wonderful host. The room is on the first floor facing the street, so there was quite a bit of city noise -- cars, people walking by and talking, etc. However, when we turned on the fan, all of the distracting noises were blended out by the white noise generated by the fan. The room is large, bright and pleasantly filled with books. The window curtains did an admirable job of blocking the light until we were ready to face the day. We could easily walk to the MFA and Gardner Museum, and to the Aquarium and the wharf for a sunset cruise. (We're big walkers; others may want to take advantage of the nearby T stops.) 10/10 would absolutely stay again."
526970,18611217,2014-08-28,20395275,Ahmad,"The location is prefect , and the room was good. He's friendly"
526970,18808391,2014-09-01,6683283,Alex,"My host was charming, the ground floor room was adequate, The location was great also.  However, the shared bathroom was sub-par.  You have to walk down a cluttered hallway & kitchen to access the bathroom.  I would not bring a date to this location.  It's fine if you a bachelor.  If you are a Titanic fan, your host is a wealth of knowledge."

526970,19003028,2014-09-04,14422100,Genet,"My second time staying at Robert's house, and it was just as lovely.  Comfortable room and elegantly furnished.  Robert is interesting and easy to talk to.  Wonderful gentleman.  I highly recommend staying at his house."

526970,30444548,2015-04-22,5348047,Greg,This was my third year staying with Robert in April and second stay in his first floor room. He has upgraded the bed since my last visit and the new bed felt good and I slept great. By now it feels more like visiting and old friend than staying at a stranger's place given the warm welcome and the great times we have shared together. His stories never seize to amaze and I greatly enjoyed my stay once again.
Other than the new bed the room looked and felt the same as before which means it's big with plenty of place,the heater kept me warm and the charm of the classic wood paneling and the beautiful fireplace is still there.,,,,
"I'm really looking forward next April already for another stay!\"",,,,,

As soon as I got in, he gave me a map of Boston and told me about good restaurants for food, places to go and see. I had a wonderful experience and Robert was accommodating host. the apartment is at the heart of Boston, 5 minutes to Copley square, 4 minutes to south bay station and 20 minutes walk to Quincy market."
526970,31832561,2015-05-10,21022740,Jean,"This was a great place to stay for my quick overnight trip to Boston. Robert was a wonderful host. Expertly he provided me with directions from the airport to his home where he greeted me promptly and provided me with many suggestions for things to do and see during my stay. I found the room quite comfortable and the area of the house where I stayed exuded a well lived in personality and charm, with stacks of interesting books, paintings, and collectibles."

There is even a cable TV in my own room. The location of the house is perfect, less than 5 mins walking to backbay station and the Copley park. Definitely would stay with them again if I hit the Boston next time!"
526970,44244857,2015-08-24,17553966,Shawn,"The neighborhood is chic and reminded me of Park Slope, Brooklyn due to the brownstones. Everything was close by including train service to/from the downtown/City Hall area where I was working. The room was perfect and very spacious. Thinking about coming back to Boston and this will be my first choice overall."

Recommend for special guests who want to find tranquility in the city, who likes painting, who likes books, you can just immerse yourself in books at night time. Robert's home would be a good choices."

His residence is located in a neighbourhood full of Victorian style homes. The Copley station is just 3-4 blocks away. Robert told me about the Logan Back Bay express bus, which stops across from the Fairmont Hotel, only 3 blocks away from his house. I got to meet Robert for a brief moment but mainly it was his assistant who welcomed me upon my arrival. He was very friendly and provided me with some history background of each attraction sites. I really enjoyed my stay, the room was spacious and as a light sleeper, being in such a prime location I didn't have any issues with noises especially when I was staying on the main floor. However, the only thing that I would like to point out is that the entrance is quite hidden and there's no door bell. I had to message Robert via Air BnB in order to get in."

But it worked out well and I stayed in the same place.  We talked briefly one evening - friendly and interesting host.  I was met by another person living on the premises who showed me in and was also very friendly and helpful."

The apartment is good; entrance is on the lower level (not in the main front entrance,as might be expected).

526970,75617164,2016-05-22,46249643,Isabella,welcomes me on arrival with help about neighborhood and as i had forgotten my cane found a beautiful one he shared with me. Robert is an intelligent delightful host- i felt privileged that the told me about the class he teaches - if i were uinhis school would certainly take! the room was spacious and clean and comfortable- i can recommend this B&B without hesitation

526970,77765622,2016-06-03,16567828,Rosie,"We didn't meet Robert but Jackie welcomed us and took time to show us where we should visit on the Map.  Given Boston's overpriced AirBnB / other accommodation options, Robert's place is a great find. It is very central for Back Bay. Thanks guys!"

The location was perfect for walking downtown Boston,three blocks from Copley Square in the heart of Back Bay. Otherwise I cannot recommend the ground floor room,spooky,cluttered,and musty smelling,no mattress pad
526970,80416125,2016-06-18,65744005,Nick,"Great location for me, and the room was nice and spacious. Internet was good, and at least I loved that there were books everywhere."
526970,80553476,2016-06-18,20185808,Andrea,"Jacky met us at our agreed upon time and was very friendly and helpful.  Jacky and Robert were very responsive when booking.  The room itself was clean, but very cluttered.  You had to navigate to the bathroom down a hall stacked with books and a kitchen that was very cluttered.  I understand that the house is historic, but there could be less clutter.  The bed was also soft and we kept sinking to middle.  Based on hotel prices this is a cheaper place to stay but in this instance you get what you paid for."
526970,81454529,2016-06-23,63677739,Diego,Jacky estuvo siempre cerca para lo que necesitáramos (Robert estaba de viaje). La ubicación es lo mejor. A sólo dos cuadras de la estación de Back Bay.
La habitación es confortable y cómoda.,,,,,
Estaría bueno que además del microondas se pueda utilizar el resto de la cocina,"por más que hay muchos lugares para comer en los alrededores.\"",,,,

Both Robert and Jacky are very nice people, and they give us some very good native advice about our trip. We arrived very early in the morning, but Jacky is very kind and helps us check in. The room is super classic and pretty, with a lot of antique decorations from different places around the world. If you are into classic style and convenient location, this is definitely your best choice!"
526970,84293495,2016-07-06,20787776,Elyse,"Robert is absolutely lovely! And his home is in a perfect location. This was my second time staying with Robert in Boston and I will certainly stay again! The room is large and has its own living space. His home has an original and historical charm, while being clean, tidy and comfortable. Great place to stay!"
526970,87527388,2016-07-20,83725453,Edgardo,"I liked the vibrant the neighborhood, its location, and that I had so many choices to walk to points of interest.  I had a little trouble figuring out where was the main door when I got there - which is down some steps, not up the more visible steps.  Rob's recommendation for parking was superb given my needs and his recommended dinner spot was phenomenal.  You have to feel comfortable sharing a space, which includes a shared bathroom and going through common areas (e.g. kitchen) to get there."
526970,88001075,2016-07-22,8925126,Karina,"Robert was a lovely host. He knows a lot about the city! The room is really comfortable and the bathroom was really clean. If you have heavy luggage, this is the floor to pic :)"
526970,90759821,2016-08-02,3510759,Sarita Kristina,We were in the ground floor suite - very private.
Robert was a wonderful host. His townhouse is in an incredible area,and he was endlessly accommodating. We asked where we might do laundry in the neighborhood and he PROVIDED us not only directions but a CARD to fill with money (we ended up not needing it). He also offered advice on restaurant week,Shakespeare on the Common,"and other local happenings. Robert has a great house and is a top notch host. \"",,
526970,91798879,2016-08-06,26676832,Carolyn,"Robert was a very kind host, he gave us a tourist map and talked to us about the best places to see. The house is in an excellent area for exploring on foot and there are easy public transport links to South Station."
526970,92452182,2016-08-08,84563042,Eric,Robert was an excellent host. Very knowledgable about the city and accommodating to our schedule. Would definitely stay again.
526970,93047037,2016-08-11,27165141,Pierre-Antoine,Robert is a very good host. His welcome and his suggestions for our trip in Boston were really appreciable. The house is authentic and spacious. Many thanks to you Robert.
526970,93738100,2016-08-13,75270188,Jim,"\"1st, Mr. Bonds' directions were \"\"Spot-on\"\" in guiding us through the Boston Subway system from Logan Airport to Back Bay station"
Our room was on the bottom floor of his 4 story brownstone.  Like most all of the homes in the neighborhood,there was an entrance under the main front steps and that was our door.  The neighborhood was quiet even though we were in the city.  The room was spacious with it's own window A/C,TV and the WiFi Internet was nice.  Security was no issue because it's a good neighborhood,the windows had sturdy bars and the door was dead-bolted.  The full size bed was comfortable,the bathroom clean and the room spacious.  By our choice we reused towels and made our own bed.  The trash was emptied when we placed it outside the door.,
As of this review,3 nights at Roberts cost about the same as a night and a half at one of the Back Bay hotels.  Future guests need to be aware that this is not the Hilton.  It is a private home and there are some trade off's that need to be made when staying in an Air BnB like Robert's.   If you are picky and particular about your lodging,it would probably be best for you to look elsewhere.  However,Robert was far more helpful the best concierge in Boston,the location was perfect and the value more than made up for the lack of polished amenities.  This was our first Air BnB reservation and I'm so happy we made this decision.,
It's good to know that if we ever return to Boston,which I hope to do,we have a friend and a place to stay.,,,

8704828,51654428,2015-10-22,40675355,Lydia,"I spent two nights at YuChens place together with my boyfriend. YuChen is a very engaged host: He prepared the room nicely, left a note with the WiFi password and even some sweats. He was very friendly and tried to have at least one chat with us."
Also he was very flexible and offered us to leave our luggage for a later pick-up after Check-out so that we could explore the city until evening.,,,,,
It was warm in the apartment; no luxury but great for a few nights in a private apartment. YuChen doesn't inhabit the same apartment,but the same house. Because he also rents the other room,you need a bit luck with the other roommate.,,,
The neighbourhood was safe and clean,supermarkets and a lot of restaurants nearby. During the night you can hear the train (Green Line) and sometimes people talking while walking on the sidewalk,but it is still possible to sleep.,,,
There is a fridge,a freezer,oven and gas stove to store or cook for youself. It is a great place for a short sightseeing stay in Boston,espacially if you are interested in seeing the Universities,"because they are easy to reach by bus.\"",
8704828,52296965,2015-10-27,39073751,Diana,La habitación es muy buena al igual que el apartamento en general.

8704828,52346732,2015-10-28,42963862,Mehmet,YuChen is a very polite and welcoming person. We have needed a place to spend for only a night to sleep and YuChen's place is an acceptable place for this purpose. Especially for bachelor travellers.
Me and my family has paid 90 USD for the place (50USD for two adults and 40USD for our 1.5 yo and 3yo daughters),which is a little bit expensive for the place,however we had no chance because of late reservation.,,,
The shared bathroom (lacking soap) and shared kitchen was clean.,,,,,
However the sleeping materials (bed,"sheet etc) were not of good quality and cleanness. Some parts were smelly though. We put our own clothes on the sheet and not used the duvet for our babies since we were not sure about the hygiene and cleanness.\"",,,,
8704828,53268348,2015-11-07,45731558,Brooke,YuChen was a wonderful! He answers any questions you have and is very flexible with check in time. Perfect location on Comm Ave. Great stay!
8704828,53505324,2015-11-09,32136508,Lexi,Yu Chen recommended a GREAT place to have my first lobster roll. His apartment had everything we needed for the weekend stay. He provided each of us with a bath towel and spare rolls of toilet paper. The apartment is very clean and the other guest staying in his second bedroom was very friendly. The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of hot water in the shower. Boston University is very close by and there were a ton of shops and restaurants within walking distance.
Parking was a little annoying because we got a ticket for parking overnight on Lawton St (the one parallel to Commonwealth Ave),but we (and another person who also got an overnight parking ticket) did not see any signs with this information. If you're going to bring a car,make sure you check ALL of the signs. After that,we found a spot right in front of the apartment and took an uber around. This,of course,"is out of our host's hands and we enjoyed the apartment regardless.\""

YuChen is very nice and reply always to messages or requests without problems.,,,,,
I really enjoyed staying at this place,probably the best place I've ever found on AirBnb,"I would definitely come back again if I were to visit Boston again and I reccomend it to everyone travelling to Boston.\"",,,

The apartment itself is clean and there's everything you need for a comfortable stay. YuChen was quick to respond and it was a pleasure to deal with him. Highly recommended!

8704828,59422017,2016-01-10,50858060,Tony T,YuChen's place is nice and cozy with a very convenient location for food and transportation. YuChen and his girlfriend are friendly. The only downside is that this place is not suitable for light sleepers as its facing the street with thin windows so it can get noisy with passing cars and the T as well as people walking by and possibly drunk late at night. The decor and amenities were great.
8704828,59670381,2016-01-13,50304064,Joon Hee,This is the best house ever!! He welcomed us so friendly. Yuchen is a very nice host. We had a good stay there. Room was clean and neat. The price was very reasonable. It is close to places you wanna go and the metro or bus station is very close to the house. I would definitely stay again when i visit Boston.
8704828,60150709,2016-01-19,51705234,Allison,"The room was great and warm, came with towels and clean bed linen. I never even saw YuChen once, but he left the key for me and I let myself in and out - we must've just been on opposite schedules. Everything worked wonderfully, and there was one other couple staying in another room that were very nice. Lots of parking close by. Great first AirBNB experience!"
8704828,78568759,2016-06-07,8848188,Corinna,YuChen was a great host! He made sure that we would find the place easily and that everything was ready when we got there. The room is simple but nice! We loved the little decorations everywhere! He messaged back quickly when we had any questions and everything we needed was there :) The Train Station and a Supermarket are Close which was very convenient. I would definitely recommend this place.

La chambre est spacieuse,mais ne vient pas avec literie complète. Il est donc préférable d'apporter soit une couverture supplémentaire ou un sac de couchage lorsque nous sommes deux. Propreté passable,c'était plutôt poussiéreux dans la chambre et la salle de bain... La chambre ne se verrouille pas,alors que l'appartement est partagé avec d'autres voyageurs.,,

Room is as described and was very clean. Expect ceilings to be low and the room is facing the main street. The fresh towels were a nice touch. We had trouble finding street partner because we came in after 11pm, so just be aware of that. Overall, pleasant stay and would recommend."

Others have written about it: noise until 2:30 a.m. out on street came in like there were no windows, neighbor groups sitting out talking. Also the small kitchen has many things, but no microwave. Still an easy place to stay, convenient to T and groceries and restaurants."

There were others staying in the basement apartment but we didn't really encounter them aside from hearing them come and go. It's no frills but if you'd looking for a cheap and convenient place to stay this is a good option.

8704828,93254726,2016-08-12,49671474,William,"Yu-Chen's downstairs room and apartment area was clean, well decorated, and in a great location. Yu-Chen was very accommodating and quick to respond to my texts. Yu-Chen even took care of a special request of mine. He took a very hands-off approach (I never saw him in four nights) which is great for guests seeking more privacy. The location is great, being near a Green Line stop, and Ubers around the area tend to be cheap. You do share the downstairs apartment with another one of Yu-Chen's AirBNB rooms, and the doors do not have locks. All in all a wonderful stay, and I'll be back the next time I'm in Boston."

Richard was fast in responding prior to our arrival and answered his phone immediately when we arrived and had a few questions to ask. The apartment is extremely convenient if you have a conference at the convention center- only a ten minute walk away and the neighborhood felt very safe to walk around. The apartment itself was very clean and modern and came with a great view of the city!

We've rented a few places in Boston over the years and this was by far the cleanest and best value (considering a stay in Boston is pretty expensive no matter what).

A little loud for 6:30AM given it's proximity to a trucking area, but if you are headed out early to a convention, that might not bother you. The host was quite responsive to several small issues that came up, which he fixed the next day."

5952474,49163609,2015-10-01,654513,Michael,"I have mixed feelings on this place.  First, the place is very well appointed.  Lots of space to stretch out, especially if you are not traveling alone, or with a family."
But I have a couple of nagging issues and I honestly can't get past them and it's in regards to having an issue arise.,,,,,
"First is the entire \"\"registration\"\" process.  You'll read other reviewers that wonder why we're forced to sign a 7 page \"\"lease\"\".  I understand this and honestly could care less for the terms and conditions.  My issue is that I need to Print",Sign and Fax/Scan it back to the host.  Waste of TIME and PAPER.  Use electronic signature software (adobe/PDF) and stop killing time and trees.,,,,
"Next is this place wants to (according to the their business card)  \"\"...ensure that everything meets our first class","five star standards.\"\"  It should be my standards",not the hosts,but whatever.  Here is my issue.  I reported the bathroom sink stopper not working.  Not a huge deal,"really.  But the host reply was not what I expected in this \"\"first class","five star standards\"\" rental.  This is a exact reply to my email:"
"\"\"Thank you for your note.  I hope you are enjoying your stay.  If you like",I can stop over and adjust the plunger for the sink.  If you want a quick fix,"just push up the lever from underneath.  I would imagine the link has slipped or come loose.  Just let me know and I can stop by to fix it up.\"\".",,,
"I tried the \"\"fix\"\" it",but it was broken. But,should I even be asked to fix your rental?,,,
A first class,"five star establishment would have replied in the following: \"\"we're sorry for that and would you please tell us a convenient time for our staff to come over and address your issue\"\". They should have insisted on making it right","not asked.  Would The Ritz or any regular hotel have said \"\"here's a tip to fix it\"\"? No",they would have gotten a maintenance man up there ASAP.,,
"My other annoyance.... if you \"\"choose\"\" (I didn't get an option while booking) for the self clean option",prepare to strip the beds bare,gather your towels and place them all in a laundry bag,run the dishwasher and have to remove your own trash. Never had to do this before,so be aware you're not just going to walk out.  Also,it's requested you tip your cleaning staff for this option. Not
So,in the end,it's a nice place,but it appears the hosts are somewhat busy for their guests. I'm speculating that due to the fact that the hosts,are really property managers,not BNB hosts
Summation:  Great place,but fair (certainly not first class,"five star) Customer Service.  And it's this what makes a good place great?\"",,,

5952474,64435193,2016-03-04,37826495,Vanessa,"Really beautiful, spacious, quiet, and very clean place.  Everything is new, clean and comfortable.  Great kitchen, bathroom and towels.  Nothing was lacking and the check-in/check-out process was very easy.  Very close to the red line.  I would most definitely stay here again."
5952474,74131441,2016-05-13,21314607,Mikela,"The Seaport Signal suite was absolutely fantastic! I felt like I was staying at home - if my home was spotlessly clean and far more chic. I was in town for a business trip, and it is right round the corner from my office. The location is fun and hip, with some neat bars nearby and Freshii on the walk to work. I loved the apartment for its spaciousness, decor, and comfy bed. Richard was incredibly attentive and a welcoming host. The only downside is the noise - if you are a light sleeper you may be disturbed by the sound of trucks in the morning. Thankfully, I am not, so it really was an ideal spot."
5952474,81817689,2016-06-25,40723717,Luis,"Great place! A lot of space, well decorated, clean, and near a lot of really cool food spots and bars. Was easy to access for check in and secure safe building. I will be staying there again."
11842312,73289949,2016-05-08,62823702,Joyce,"The unit is clean, comfortable, and well maintained, and the location is really terrific, right across the street from the Boylston T stop and the Boston Commons. The unit is on the 7th floor with a view overlooking some buildings in the back of the unit, and the elevator is small, old, and a bumpy ride that sometimes feels like it's going to get stuck. (though we never actually got stuck in the elevator.)"
Check-in was easy with a lock-box at the entryway. The unit was furnished with towels and small soaps / shampoos. Oddly,though there were pots and glasses,there were no plates.,,,
We had a problem with the TV on arrival,and the Flatbook team was very responsive,"even on a Sunday morning. We were able to fix the TV connection problem with instructions provided via email.\"",,,
11842312,74226946,2016-05-14,6559267,Bekkie,"This apartment is perfectly located just off the common and walking distance from all of Boston. It's really well finished and I felt right at home. The flat book team were very accommodating letting me stay an additional night and quickly fixing the curtains when they came down in the main room. Check in and out was super easy with the key in a lock box by the front door. I would highly recommend this air bnb - just one thing, there was very loud construction work going on outside everyday from 7pm - check with the hosts if this is still going on before booking as it was very loud and inescapable. Overall a great stay and really hopeful hosts."
11842312,75861430,2016-05-23,639769,Stephanie,Best location in the city! Right across from the Boston Common. You can easily walk to different areas of the city.
"The appartment was clean and enjoyable. \"",,,,,
11842312,76454323,2016-05-27,26542279,Sean,Great location directly across the street from the beautiful Boston Common park and only a few hundred feet from a T stop.
Inside was clean and well-appointed.  There was some construction noise in the morning from the building being built next door,"but this is obviously temporary and won't bother early risers.\"",,,,
11842312,77865869,2016-06-04,583467,Yossi,"Nice and clean, very centrally located directly infront of Boston Commons. Quiet rear facing unit, perfect for my business trip, iron and all."
11842312,78409953,2016-06-06,31607589,Brad,"Very well organized, easy to get in and out. Had more than everything we needed."
11842312,81290582,2016-06-22,71561104,Amanda,"This downtown Boston rental was in the heart of it all. We really enjoyed Boston Common right across the street and the T stop gave us easy access to Fenway, The Museum of Science, Quincy Market and many other attractions across Boston. The apartment was very comfortable, clean and well equipped with basic essentials. We didn't spend too much time inside though, their is too much to see and do in Boston!"
"There is some construction going on nearby and the crews got started at 7 a.m. during the week. This only motivated us to get an early start to our day and was not an inconvenience. \"",,,,,
11842312,81764284,2016-06-25,633391,Katrina,"The apartment itself was beautiful, clean, and spacious. It was easy to find the keys and get around town from the building. If you're in town for work, this is a great place to crash for a short time. That being said, there is major construction going on right next door which was VERY noisy from around 7 am. If you're a medium to light sleeper, I'd advise bringing earplugs. Also, I didn't feel comfortable opening the curtains for the main windows because there were workers right across the way."
11842312,87274201,2016-07-19,83832569,Mary,"We were happy to be able to get this reservation on late notice and once arriving the 24 hour call center was helpful with questions we had.  Apartment was clean. Being across from Boston Common and several subways was the best thing because we were able to take public transportation the whole trip.  The central air did not work very well ( it was mid July) but the room a/c  in the bedroom worked well.  My main issue was with the bed.  It was extremely firm.  Also when you get off the small, rickety elevator and the door opens, you are at the small landing of the front door of a tenant. We never ended up bumping into each other which was good. Immediately to the left is a door to an un-air conditioned stairwell in which you'll see the door to the room."
11842312,89564155,2016-07-29,13588464,Kelly,"We loved this place - it was modern, clean and very spacious for two people. The Flatbook Team were very attentive. the AC was really great in the heat!!! Previous reviews mentioned construction noise - this was true but it didn't bother us at all. the construction has advanced beyond the height of the flat so the disturbance is minimal. Highly recommend this flat!!"
11842312,90503470,2016-08-01,13543993,Matt,"It was a great place and a great location!  Construction next door was a bummer, but other than that we really enjoyed our stay."
11842312,91324753,2016-08-04,84340474,Jean,"Great place to stay in Boston. Very well ubicated, near to most places to see in the city. Clean and beautiful. Only problems those days: the buoding in construction next to the apartment."
13960193,86436636,2016-07-16,83243249,Diego,Everything was good as show in the picture and price I really enjoyed my stay.
13960193,87317173,2016-07-19,71010642,Precious,"My experience was rather unpleasant. Yuan was a nice host but the place needed desperate cleaning. There was hair in most of the hallways. Bathrooms and kitchen were very dirty. Also, the room didn't have a fan so it was very hot most of the night. Overall I would have actually preferred sleeping in my car and passing up this house because it was too dirty."
13960193,88387020,2016-07-24,64655632,Mark,"the room is comfortable to live, and the hostess is easy-going and nice!"
13960193,89897950,2016-07-30,83525779,Marcos,"Good place, good people."
13960193,93631929,2016-08-13,21646252,Keith,"This place was small, cramped, and very dirty. The bathroom was so dirty that I went out and bought cleaning supplies to use it. The room itself was covered in cat hair and there was CAT LITTER all over the ground. The bed is extremely unstable and would squeak at the slightest hint of movement. I spoke to one of the people who lived there and they explained to me that roughly nine other people lived there, which included people sleeping on the couches in the living room. The place smelled like pot every single day of the two weeks that I was there, which makes sense as the permanent tenants are all students. The smoke detector had been taken off of the ceiling in my room and put in the drawer of the dresser in the room. The room was off the kitchen, separated by windows with blinds covering them, which they don't show in the picture for obvious reasons. Seriously this place was awful and felt unsafe. Spend the extra $20 a night and stay somewhere else."
13992811,87383499,2016-07-19,32109861,Gemma,Jinchen was very kind and helpful! He did his utmost to ensure that we were comfortable. Communication was great as well. The area was amazing and the apartment was also great! I would highly recommend this place to others.
13992811,88667810,2016-07-25,30371302,Elise,My flight was very delayed and I didn't get in until after 1 AM. The host graciously came outside and showed me everything I needed in the middle of the night! The bed was extremely comfortable and I was even able to check out a bit later so I had time to see the city in the morning. He was very flexible and was also willing to let me leave my suitcase with him if I needed more time the following day.
"Great experience!\"",,,,,
13992811,89217381,2016-07-27,85320495,Haelee,I stayed in Boston for 2 nights and Jinchen's place was so comfortable and nice. The picture and the room look exactly the same and it was very clean. The room owner stays in the other building. Plus there was a Muji diffuser and i was so excited! At first I was worried because i used the airbnb for the first time and i just want to thank Jinchen for the great room and great service! Thank you
13992811,89639738,2016-07-29,70603675,Germinian,"The place in Boston was very conveniently located to the subway. The room was located one floor down, and was clean and cosy. Our host, JC was very friendly and hospitable and provided us with directions and recommendations around the area."
13992811,90581557,2016-08-01,24880618,Aaron And Sarah,"Jinchen was extremely kind and made us feel right at home. He was great at communicating, and they even saw that we liked chocolate on our profile and got us chocolate! The space worked great for us, but do note that the bathroom is upstairs and bedroom down. We had an awesome time overall, and came back worn out each night and watched movies. We are very thankful for our wonderful hosts and do recommend them for a great stay in Boston, in an awesome area."
The only thing I would have liked to know beforehand was that another guest was staying with us in the apartment - she was super nice and we're friendly,so it ended up being great,but good to know beforehand. Also,the room we're in has a bit of a musty smell,and I'm pregnant so it may just be my overactive nose!,
Like I said,awesome couple,"and an awesome experience for our first time in Boston!! Thank you both!!! :)  \"",,,
13992811,91462079,2016-08-05,83430232,Daniel,"I had a great stay at Jinchen's place. The location is fantastic, with much of Boston and Cambridge withing walking distance. The bed was huge and very comfortable, and the apartment was clean and homely. Jinchen was a great host, and even brought me a piece of cheesecake one evening! He was always available if I needed to contact him, and made sure that my stay was as comfortable as possible. I had a great stay here."
13992811,94270272,2016-08-15,89407566,Ivana,"Camera ampia con aria condizionata, un wifi eccellente ed un letto matrimoniale davvero comodo. Il bagno è in comune con gli ospiti che occupano la camera accanto, ma pulito. Jinchen è stato molto gentile e disponibile a fornirci le indicazioni relative alle attrazioni di Boston e dell'alloggio stesso. Consigliato."
13992811,95386188,2016-08-19,89216719,Britt,"My stay in Boston was so enjoyable, and a large part of it was because I stayed here! The walk to the nearest T (or subway) was a little further than I expected, but it was certainly doable. I don't come from a country with reliable public transport and everyone drives, so my estimation of how far the walk was can be off. It was really close to the adorable Newbury street, which is full of cafes and shops, and close to the Boston Public Library and the Prudential Center. The apartment was clean and well kept, and as soon as I got there, both Jinchen and his girlfriend were there to greet me and show me around. The only issue I had with the apartment was that my bedroom door did not lock (or if it did, I didn't figure it out.) Other than that, I really enjoyed staying here and would recommend it to anyone!"

826706,23091470,2014-11-23,17601395,Noëlle,Together with a friend I stayed 3 months with ToRena. The room was big enough for two persons and there is a lot of space in the rest of the apartment. The neighborhood is quiet and the house is close to a park which is great for runners/walkers. Cleaning (bathroom) and breakfast could be better since the breakfast items were often running low or empty. ToRena and Cabral were nice people that responded very quickly to questions or issues.
826706,45402666,2015-09-02,40532576,Erica,"Thank you to Torena and her husband for hosting us. They were kind enough to accommodate our late arrival. Our room was spacious as described and I appreciate being able freely to use their kitchen and living room areas. Not to mention, it was nice to get know the other air bnb travelers staying on the same floor with us."

Met a few guests who were really friendly and from all over the world as far as Australia. Always recommend persons to stay at To-Rena. Would stay there again. thumbs up
826706,48923162,2015-09-29,43568570,Dina,"We  enjoyed  our stay  by ToRena, the room and the facilities were clean, neat and very quiet.  Transportation to the downtown Boston is convenient but pay attention to  the  info ToRena prepared for the guests."

4410765,52470692,2015-10-29,9704805,Phil,"A terrific place and location! Patrick's home was wonderfully convenient for our stay in Boston.  The free parking was great for leaving our car we drove in with, and the close-by public transit saved us from having to drive in the city traffic. We were able to easily visit both Cambridge and Fenway equally easily, and there's fun nightlife walking distance away - check out all the Korean food just a 15 minute walk away in Allston! The home is clean and well-furnished, and we got great use out of both the kitchen (there's a grocery store close by) and the washer/dryer.  We especially, though, loved the gas fireplace on the couple of chilly nights we had. Very cozy. Patrick was a great host, and we will gladly stay again if we ever need to in Boston."
4410765,73854763,2016-05-10,54125361,Janet,"My apartment rental in Brighton, MA was exactly as described by Patrick on the Airbnb site.  There were no unpleasant surprises.  The neighborhood was safe and very conveniently located for my purposes.  Accommodations and price were well-suited to my needs for a month-long Boston visit.  My host was conscientious about keeping in contact with me by email, text, and phone even though he was out of the country.  Everything worked out just as I planned, and I would consider renting this property again sometime in the future."

We had a great time--the house is gorgeous, and it's clear that Brahma is working steadily on improving and renovating it.  We loved the view, the easy access to public transit, and Brahma's friendly and helpful presence.  There were some small areas where we felt improvements could be made, and Brahma was very open and receptive to our comments.  We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if we were fortunate enough to visit Boston again."

118905,11801276,2014-04-15,3596306,Adam,"Brahma was incredibly accommodating and made it easy for us to situate ourselves upon arrival. When our travel plans changed to include more people, we were able to rent the adjoining upstairs unit, which was unbelievably convenient. Both spaces were super clean with great views and we loved the added touches of detail. Chalkboards are always a plus! The neighborhood was super quiet on the weekend; Just be aware that parking around the apartment is definitely a challenge late at night, and the area directly outside temporarily becomes a bit of a madhouse when the high school across the street lets out. All in all though, we highly recommend Brahma’s pad to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Boston at a terrific value compared to hotels nearby."
118905,19651988,2014-09-15,5348456,Jd,"The place was great for the group of colleagues I brought to Boston for our weekend conference. Brahma communicated with us clearly and in advance, and it was a great experience."
118905,30454755,2015-04-22,28185096,Eamonn,We stayed 4 nights at the Lotus Apartment. Brahma made us feel extremely welcome. We were a little bit late arriving due to a delay at the airport but he was still able to meet us. He gave us a full tour of the apartment which was exactly as described and pictured and also gave us plenty of tips and recommendations on the local area. The apartment was very clean and with it being Marathon weekend Brahma left out bottled water for anyone who needed it on the morning of the marathon. It was little things like this that as well as Brahma always being contactable (especially when I locked myself out) that added to the already great weekend we spent there. I would have no hesitation in recommending this place for anyone to stay and I hope to visit again myself. Thanks Brahma :)
118905,32580154,2015-05-19,14348221,Neil,Excellent and kind host. Lovely large flat. Clear information about how to get there and house rules. Brahma also gave us excellent local tips on the area. The balcony is lovely. Would recommend

13450030,92052367,2016-08-07,50009758,Anabel,It was good to stay in Joe's place. We did not see him but the house was really nice.
13450030,92953203,2016-08-10,64808812,Rebecca,It was a very nice space to stay! The house was extremely clean and tidy and the fresh towels was wonderful.
13450030,93623171,2016-08-13,72834885,Jiyoung,I actually didn't see him. But room and living room were very clean. It was also great bus station isn't far from house. Thanks! :)
13450030,94471805,2016-08-15,87626004,Melanie,"We never met Joe personally, but the house was clean and our room was clean and private."
13450030,94733878,2016-08-16,82069768,Siân,Absolutely loved our stay in Joe's place. The bed was the comfiest bed I've ever slept on!
13450030,95986298,2016-08-21,2189707,Iuri,"Clean,  precise,  and helpful!"
13450030,98129719,2016-08-29,85291392,Julia,"Joe´s place is very good to stay at. Communication was perfect and my arrival also was very good.  But I saw a situation in which people didn´t even know which house they were going to stay in. I actually only met Joe once so I don´t know much about him. But he was nice and helpful. Walking on the floor can be very loud and I heard everybody passing by my room. Everything is as Joe describes is, the bus station is close by and the underground is only a 10-15 minutes walk. The bed is very comfortable and you can easily park there if you have a car. The neighborhood is ok but when I walked around late at night or early in the morning I sometimes felt a little uncomfortable. At all I had a good stay at Joe´s and I can recommend it. It´s still an AirBnb and the price is very good! Thank you Joe!"
13450030,98355462,2016-08-30,83184898,Jim,"Didn't meet Joe but the place was neat and clean. there was a wall unit AC which worked nice and the bed was comfortable. Good location and with walking distance to a bus stop for easy access to downtown, Harvard, MIT, etc."
13450030,98738841,2016-09-01,30920474,Yue,The house is easy to find and Joe was very helpful and friendly. the room is clean and tidy :)
1066767,48253551,2015-09-24,41442448,Walter,Ryan and Diego were very helpful and great hosts.
We arrived earlier than planned and Diego met us right away to show us the boat.,,,,,
We had to leave a night earlier and Ryan was very nice and friendly and helped us with everything.,,,,,
One time we couldn't lock the door,he can right away to the boat and fixed the problem.,,,,
The free water taxi from the house boat to the boston aquarium was a nice thing to do.,,,,,
"It was a little to noisy for us. \"",,,,,
1066767,52339506,2015-10-28,269680,Dominique,We had a good time on the house boat. Great way to use the free water taxi. He dropped us at Charlestown from where we started the freedom trail. It was a bit noisy  on the boat because of the bridge nearby but you get used to it quickly. Wifi was not very good. Rest was very good.
1066767,69327749,2016-04-10,989673,Paul,"Ryan was a fantastic host! He was very flexible and accommodating with my somewhat chaotic schedule changes, and very responsive for anything I needed. The boat was very comfortable, and I would happily stay here again!"
1066767,72140216,2016-05-01,55823739,Jeanine,"My husband and I spent the weekend in Boston visiting our 3 kids. Had a great time on the house boat, cocktails on deck and take out food for dinner and games until late! Boat was cozy, bed very comfortable, made a big breakfast in morning. Kitchen supplies were definitely adequate. Loved watching the drawbridge and sunrise and sunset.  Very fun place to stay!"
1066767,74746101,2016-05-16,30011598,Shanshan,A special experience to stay in a boat. Scenes are amazing when you wake up every morning. My family and I really like it.
1066767,75937300,2016-05-23,53056473,Amber,"Our trip was good. Ryan was nice and easy to work with and the house was clean. I enjoyed staying on the house boat and watching the other boats go by. It was a little small for four people but we managed. The neighborhood was a little rough and noisy. I was also disappointed in the wifi quality, but was too busy to try and figure it out before we left."
1066767,77306401,2016-05-31,28773786,Bill And Amy,Ryan was very easy to work with.  The instructions for finding the location and accessing the location were very thorough.  We arrived around 11 PM and he still came by to greet us.
The boat was very clean and provided more room than I thought it would.  Nicely furnished.  Full size frig was helpful.  Can't comment on the kitchen because we only used the sink,toaster,microwave and frig but there looked to be many different size pans and utensils in addition to plates and cups.,,,
This location is near a draw bridge,boats WILL sound their horn and the bridge WILL sound a siren.  These were NOT an issue for us,in fact it was fun to watch the bridge open and close.   If you are hoping for peace and quiet,you may not like it here.  As far as movement of the boat... I have motion sickness and didn't have any issue.  Yes there is very slight movement,sometimes more movement when a vessel goes through.,
If I had to pick any negatives it would be the WiFi connection and TV listings.  But we weren't here to watch tv and have a great data plan so we were fine.,,,,,
"This was a GREAT find and a unique place to stay.  An awesome kid AND dog friendly place.  Will def stay again when in Boston.\"",,,,,
1066767,77789280,2016-06-03,65731836,Mark,I had a nice stay on the boat. Great view of the draw bridge from the front deck. I wish I stayed a couple more nights so I could see the ducklings hatch. She was laying on her eggs right in front of the boat in a planter!
1066767,78453061,2016-06-06,24224426,Marcos,"The boathouse is fantastic and we really enjoyed our stay. Everything was as described, all you need for staying in the boat for several days and very clean and functional. We felt at home. A unique experience highly recommended!!!"
1066767,81204924,2016-06-21,72982312,Diane,Ryan!!! The stay on the boat was the best part of our vacation!
After a very hectic travel schedule,the boat was the perfect place to unwind and relax.,,,,
No worries about seasickness,the gentle swaying was hardly even felt ever... beautiful atmosphere being on the water. We enjoyed seeing jelly fish,crabs and feeding the ducks and babies.  Really liked seeing a huge ship come in and the bridge opening up! Sunset was amazing,we even had a peach moon.,,
Breakfast on the upper deck was fabulous. The kitchen had everything we needed. I can't say enough good about this GEM.,,,,,
Beats a hotel any day in my opinion.,,,,,
We utilized Rowe's water taxi and had a great experience every time!!! They are the only water taxi that goes to the area. They even stored our luggage So we could enjoy Boston before our late flight out. Make reservations ahead of time!,,,,,
Boston was a fabulous city to visit. Absolutely fantastic. We almost didn't go because we didn't want to leave the peace and tranquility of the boat!,,,,,
"Thank you again Ryan. Great memories of A truly wonderful place of heaven on earth!!!!\"",,,,,
1066767,85828858,2016-07-13,71857621,Lezley,"Diego met me and showed me the ropes. Ryan was responsive to any needs or issues that arose. The houseboat was a fun adventure and I would definitely do it again. There is nothing like beginning and ending each day on the water...quite relaxing. While there is passing boat and drawbridge noise as well as some airplane noise, those were all part of the experience for me.  The neighborhood has great ethnic appeal. I didn't want to leave. Rock and roll with Rock On Rentals!"
1066767,87077437,2016-07-18,77420184,Belinda,"Ryan was a good host and the houseboat was lovely. Such a novel way to stay in Boston. It was generally pretty quiet (a few late night noises from nearby houseboat guests - but not excessive). We liked being out of the usual tourist parts of Boston, but able to access the city via 10 minute cab ride or 30 min walk and train. A very relaxing accommodation."
1066767,87696604,2016-07-21,78839969,Katherine,This. Was. Incredible! Very short uber ride to Fenway or Quincy Market/Faneuil Hall. We slept like a rock on this beauty. It didn't feel like we were on a boat in the slightest bit when we were in bed. I blasted this rental information to everyone I know with hopes that they would take a trip to this little hidden gem. Thank you Ryan and Diego!!
1066767,88155597,2016-07-23,2675510,Matt,We had a great experience staying on the Lyra while staying in Boston. Ryan checked in with a couple times to make sure everything was going well and that provided accurate instructions for checking in after hours.
It was very quick and easy trip using Uber/Lyft to get to and from the airport as well as downtown.,,,,,
Overall,"we definitely recommend staying with Ryan while visiting Boston. Staying on a houseboat in the Boston Bay Marina makes for a unique and memorable experience.  \"",,,,
1066767,90179072,2016-07-31,1283811,Pat,We had a wonderful time on Ryan's house boat
"It is in a quiet location and having parking was a real plus\"",,,,,
1066767,90639708,2016-08-01,1560339,Andrea,"I had have a lovely stay, highly recommended if u wanna escape the busy city for a little while!"
"\"",,,,,
1066767,93361003,2016-08-12,27894968,Molly,We like it so much. Hope we could have another day there.
1551467,7144707,2013-09-08,7831086,Jason,"Jonas's apartment was very beautiful and beautifully situated as well...a calm, peaceful oasis in the middle of Jamaica Plain. Jonas was very communicative and helpful throughout, as were the neighbors. It's only 5 minutes to the nearest subway station and maybe 12 minutes to the nearest bus stop. Recommended!"
1551467,16239297,2014-07-23,5784878,Barbara,The reservation was canceled 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1551467,16435804,2014-07-27,3731192,Valérie,Jonas home was very inviting ans confortable. Very nice and safe neighborhod too. Great restaurants and bars at a walking distance and the subway was a block away. Jonas was very prompt and nice to communicate with. I would recommend it without hesitation.
1551467,16865519,2014-08-03,8323245,Rebecca,"We really enjoyed staying at Jonas and Michal's place. It was beautifully kept, really peaceful and very homely. Although we didn't see them during our stay, they made it very comfortable and easy for us. Jonas was great to communicate with, and put us in touch with a (lovely) neighbour who could help in the event that we needed anything urgently during our stay.  There is also a great cafe just down the street that does excellent coffee, pastries, salads etc. Also very easy access to the train into central Boston. Thank you Jonas and Michal for a great stay!"
1551467,19709532,2014-09-16,6585353,Jonathan,Jonas was a perfect host. We cannot meet each other but his neighbors were very helpful and nice.
The apartment is perfectly located near the subway station,in the nice area Jamaica Plain.,,,,
It's exactly the same as the pictures,a nice and cosy apartment.,,,,
If you want to discover the 'country' side of Boston,"go at Jonas' home.\"",,,,
5495547,34706690,2015-06-11,30793248,Matthew,Spacious and charming it is. We are staying here for 3 months after moving from the UK.
The house is not just somewhere to say - it's so obviously a home. There's a wild mix of books and objets d'art; from coding manuals,"to serious literature to a book on manhole covers! The main picture shows a similarly eclectic range of board games. We found a similar story in the \"\"tea\"\" cupboard in the kitchen. More than enough for the English palette.",,,,
The garden is big and there is a lovely raised deck.,,,,,
The location could not be better. I am commuting to South Station each day and I can choose to either walk through the magnificent Arboretum to the station or catch a bus that is 5 minutes walk. My wife and kids head into JP central on a bus and that offers something for everyone.,,,,,
We are renting the car through RelayRides which is super handy.,,,,,
Celia has been helpful and friendly throughout. I raised a couple of questions e.g. getting a key stuck in a lock,andCelia resolved it the same day.,,,,
"The cats appear at 10pm and have disappeared again by morning. Where do they sleep - that's the question?\"",,,,,
5495547,36864985,2015-07-02,30793248,Matthew,"Celia has continued to make us most welcome - being accommodating to our summer schedule. We have had a couple of questions regarding the car and the lawn and both have been resolved, remotely within the day. This responsiveness is fantastic. On a warm evening the deck is a lovely place to enjoy a drink and dinner."
5495547,37971187,2015-07-12,30793248,Matthew,"We continue to extend our stay at celia's place. It's a great house for a family and the garden is kept in lovely condition to allow my two children to run around and burn off a bit of energy. We still haven't tried all the teas in Celia's cupboard. Being so near the Arboretum is a real treat. Given we've stayed so long there have been some questions and issues and Celia is very flexible, accommodating and friendly. Thanks."
5495547,45467519,2015-09-03,30793248,Matthew,"Celia is an excellent host, very responsive to any queries and easy to communicate with. This worked well for us as we rented the house for a long period during the summer. The house is as described (spacious and charming), well stocked with anything you might need for your stay, and boasts a large deck and gardens."
It's a quiet neighbourhood with easy access to green spaces (the arboretum is a 5 min walk),and a bus route into central JP,which offers frequent onward connections to downtown Boston. JP is a vibrant,friendly community with no shortage of amenities.,,
"We have recently moved into a place of our own in the vicinity but I would not hesitate to recommend Celia and her house to visiting family and friends.\"",,,,,
7853079,47223007,2015-09-16,6283404,Shani,We were a group of 6 and stayed at the apartment for 3 nights.
The apartment is big and good for 6 people (though it has only 1 bathroom). The check-in and out was very easy (we basically just let ourself in since there is no use of keys).,,,,,
The location is great,very close to many restaurants and shops.,,,,
On the down side- the apartment wasn't very clean,the bathroom floor and tiles were dirty,the shower curtain pole was very rusty.,,,
The rag in the kitchen was dirty and there were stains on the sofa and rug in the living room and overall it felt like it hasn't been cleaned prior to our arrival.,,,,,
Also we couldn't find a dish drying rack.,,,,,

7853079,47571549,2015-09-20,27611312,Dan,"Brent was a fantastic host, very communicative and helpful.  The place was beautiful, very clean, exactly as advertised.  LOcation was absolutely perfect - Boston's Back Bay is such an amazing neighborhood, everything within a walk away, and September is the best month to visit.  Thank you Brent for making our stay so enjoyable and peaceful."
7853079,48041080,2015-09-22,38561727,Jodie,Brent was very quick and precise in communication and even accommodated for very late check ins as our group had a late night fly into Boston. The place was in an excellent location and the place was as described and was clean. The only negative was we were in Boston when it was very warm and there is only 1 aircon in the lounge room whilst the bedrooms only had ceiling fans but the apt was still quite hot and stuffy in the evening.
7853079,51449432,2015-10-20,3890768,Sarah,"Brent's place was a perfect home base for our group. We were comfortable, able to cook meals on our own, and walking distance to just about everything in Boston. The apartment was well equipped and spacious. I'd definitely stay here again!"
7853079,52836553,2015-11-02,42430462,Bobby,The place was wonderful and the neighborhood was nice with the trees changing colors around the area. The block was festive since it was Halloween.  Couldn't be more please with our time using Airbnb in Boston.
7853079,58416816,2016-01-02,44718370,Andy,"We had a great time at Brent's apartment.  Very easy to find and access.  The location really can't be beat especially for a three bedroom.  Place was in excellent condition and it provided a great way to relax in Boston.  Beds were comfortable, towels and linens were provided.  We had 6 people staying and with the exception of it being a one bathroom there was plenty of room for everyone.  People especially liked the breakfast nook.  Thanks Brent!"
7853079,58958686,2016-01-05,43892539,Jesús,"La situación  de la casa es estupenda, en un barrio muy bonito y tranquilo, al lado de edificios singulares de Boston, con un ambiente muy agradable, cafés, restaurantes  y tiendas con estilo y calidad."
Además está  bastante cerca del centro. En un corto paseo,tranquilo y agradable,llegas en seguida a Common Park.,,,
La casa también está bien,"por fuera es bonita y por dentro es amplia y confortable \"",,,,
7853079,62753186,2016-02-16,1487989,Shannon,"\"Living room and beds were comfortable but apartment was overall kind of \"\"tired\"\" looking. Rugs could definitely use a cleaning. Kitchen was stocked well with all the utensils you could need. Fantastic location overall.\""
7853079,63590259,2016-02-24,59234220,Laura,"Great location.  Apartment was clean and tidy.  It was a bit bare bones, with little in the way of added comforts.  Pretty much as expected for a basic place to stay."
7853079,64603754,2016-03-06,7942550,Claramae,Place was clean and as shown in pictures. Ample space for 5 of us. Great location and easy to get in and out of the apartment.
7853079,65085135,2016-03-10,24167531,Hongtao,"One of the best things is the location, as it is in Back Bay area and you have prudential street just right outside. The description is really accurate. We had a fantastic 4-day trip in Boston."
7853079,65483720,2016-03-14,22375401,Sebastiaan,The host canceled this reservation 88 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

It had everything we needed! The neighborhood was perfect, very close to newbury and the prudential. My family found is very easy to navigate around the area."
7853079,68684788,2016-04-06,26780087,Louise,"The apartment was very comfortable and hads 3 x double bedrooms with good space to put clothes away in.  The kitchen was stocked well enough for a short stay and there was soap, washing up liquid etc. No dishwasher!  The street is very quiet and a 5 minute walk to good range of restauarants. There is a useful grocers a block away and a Trader Joes about 3 blocks away so easy to get supplies in.   Communication on the lead up was great, good suggestion from Brent on local restaurant and check in & out very simple."
7853079,72385792,2016-05-02,32056138,Jason,Perfect area. Took a bus from the airport for like $5 then walked 10 minutes. Super easy getting in the place and its a cool apartment that felt home(y) even though there aren't a ton of decorations.
7853079,74185279,2016-05-13,26413018,Marie Claude,"Premium location and very nice place, very clean. Would need just a little refresh and a dishwasher! For this price, a dishwasher is a must! Otherwise, very nice and perfect spot!"
7853079,74922406,2016-05-17,62601953,Louisa,"Very beautiful unit. Convenient location definitely! The apartment was fully equipped!! Very neat & tidy. Clean towels & sheets.

7853079,91054518,2016-08-03,2395427,Sarah,We tried to contact the host a few times and never heard back. We asked about a sightly later check out and were told we'd need to pay another night's stay. Never happened before in an airbnb. This is more of a hotel rental than the airbnb experience. That being said the place itself is great. Huge rooms lots of space. Walking distance to most attractions. Lots of food and coffee places nearby.
8482847,49860028,2015-10-06,35299337,Enrique,"Lucille was a excelent host no words to describe her, since the first moment you like home with her hospitality. The room was big and confortable, no doubts to come back"

The neighbourhood is very pleasant and quiet but just a ten-minute walk from the lively Brookline district and very convenient for the T metro. Highly recommended and excellent value. Oh, and there are wild turkeys in the garden sometimes!"
8482847,50824364,2015-10-14,24882914,Johannes,"We didn't have much contact to Lucille, but she had prepared everything for us and we were ready to go."
Parking with big vehicles could become a problem,but any regular car should fit.,,,,
The bathroom wasn't the cleanest we have ever been to,"but that's allright. The bedroom itself was big enough for two and the place is comfy.\"",,,,
8482847,51167473,2015-10-18,1248430,Erika,"Lucille was a friendly, welcoming host.  She was flexible with check-in and checkout.  I felt very comfortable in her home, like I was staying with a friend.  The room was spacious and provided everything I needed.  The house is located a short distance from a Whole Foods and some other shops and restaurants.  The location was perfect for my stay during the Head of the Charles."
8482847,51656209,2015-10-22,46329214,Nikki,"Lucille was a perfect host! My friend and I came in kind of late and I had to leave early the next morning. She was extremely accommodating.  She made us both feel welcome.  If I'm ever in Boston again, Lucille's will be the first place I check into to stay."

The room was good. The neighborhood was silent and very good.,,,,,
"5 minute walk to the Green line (Washington street).\"",,,,,
8482847,52869479,2015-11-02,32068985,John,Lucille was really nice. She made me feel welcomed. Easy checkin easy checkout. She had fruits on the table for us the whole stay. About 10-15 walks to the subway. The bathroom is a bit dirty... it needs some cleanup. The pressure for the shower faucet is very weak.
8482847,53274902,2015-11-07,36091823,Zoë,"Lucille was very welcoming and also allowed us our personal space. She left us a bowl of fruits and allowed us to use her kitchen as we pleased. The house is ~10 minutes walk from the green line T, up some hills. The room itself was spacious and bright, though it could've used some cleaning before hand. The bathroom was fine although the shower head had very weak water pressure."

8482847,54988992,2015-11-27,611617,Simone And Roland,Lucille was accommodating in welcoming us. We were able to correspond with her throughout our trip with a delay in air travel and a late night arrival. She was even up late and welcomed us. Lucille is very kind.
8482847,68573758,2016-04-05,831572,Rupert,Lucille was a great host. Super friendly and very relaxed about changes to plans.
"You should definitely stay here \"",,,,,
8482847,70802727,2016-04-20,36565268,Kelsie,"Lucille was very accommodating with arrival and departure times. She was very pleasant and made herself available if needed but otherwise let you be. The location is in a nice area with a couple blocks walk to the green line subway. The room was as described, the place has all the basics you would need. The only issue I had was that upon arrival we were informed a two year old child also shares the space. It ended up not being a problem but I probably wouldn't have booked my vacation stay there had I known that beforehand. Overall Lucille was a very welcoming and nice host."
8482847,71197855,2016-04-24,64565952,Lori,Lucille is a gracious host and a good communicator. She takes extra steps to make sure you are comfortable by providing a dresser that includes plenty of towels and extra bedding. The shelves above have reading material and the Wifi password.  I borrowed an area map of downtown Boston that was helpful while driving . She offered parking in the neighbors driveway next door but it is hard to find at night since the house numbers are small and then there are 12 steps to her front door and another dozen steps to the private room. The room was as pictured and the bed was comfortable. This is a nice place to stay close to Boston.

Its a nice place only to go crash after a long day of tourism. located in quiet suburban Brighton close to train line - easy transport to and from city.

8482847,77591600,2016-06-02,63734495,Robert,Lucille is a very friendly and helpful host. The room was OK and the house has a nice atmosphere. There is a cat in the house and also another family with a young child. They do not always clean up as could be expected when a house is shared with other guests. The neighbourhood is quite nice and  the place is near the green line metro. We enjoyed sitting on the porch and watch the wild turkeys!
8482847,78838018,2016-06-09,45011354,Tyler,Lucille was an extremely welcoming host whose main objective is comfort and privacy. I will definitely stay again next time I'm in Boston.

8482847,93605969,2016-08-13,5233524,Evgeniya,"My partner and I stayed at Lucille's place during our holiday in Boston, and we greatly enjoyed our stay. Lucille was very kind to let us in on a short notice, she was very easy to communicate with along the way and made sure our stay was as comfortable as possible. Our room was bright and spacious, and the entire house has an absolutely lovely rustic style to it. There is a busy street with shops, food places and a train station close nearby. The only thing to note is that the house sits on top of a hill, so if you're planning on walking and biking everywhere, like we did, make sure to pace yourself.

The apartment was clean,and neither my partner nor I had any issues with our allergies acting up.,,,,
The apartment is in a good location,close to public transportation. Also,the neighborhood felt pretty safe (of course,I live in Manhattan,so it might just be me). I rented a car to drive to Boston,and the parking situation around the apartment is a bit of a nightmare

Zostawiła dla nas zestaw mini kosmetyków kąpielowych, co było bardzo przydatne. Niestety, mieszkanie jest brudne, ciemne i nieprzyjemnie pachnie. Dywany były nieodkurzone, a w mieszkaniu unosił się zapach stęchlizny i ulatniającego się z kuchni gazu, co sprawiało, że chcieliśmy skrócić czas przebywania w nim do minimum... Bez kapitalnego sprzątania i remontu mieszkanie nie powinno w ogóle zostać oferowane do wynajmu. Szkoda, bo mieszkanie jest w fajnej lokalizacji, wokół dużo knajpek, przyjemna, bezpieczna okolica.

Oine was available to answer all of our questions,and really made us feel exceptionally comfortable.

I thought it was even nicer than the photos. We used the master bed, which was just right. Like another reviewer mentioned, she was thoughtful to leave toys, books, and a pack n play for our 3 year old. She even put out a scooter my daughter loved, and some J&J baby shampoo in the bathroom. The AC is by two window units which worked well."

We were SO lucky to rent Oine's space for our stay. Due to the fantastic location, we easily used the T (plus a short walk) to get to & from the airport. We were also able to walk to Fenway for a game & walk to the wedding - be careful on cobblestones with heels:)"
Oine's home was wonderful for our family with two bedrooms and 1.5 baths. We had plenty of space to gather & plenty of space to retreat. Having the extra half bath really helped when getting ready for the wedding.,,,,,
As it was my sons' first time in Boston,we all wished we would have been able to stay longer. SO many things within walking distance or the T (subway) we would have loved to explore. At least we were able to eat @ Charlie's Sandwich Shoppe right around the corner (the Cranberry Griddle Cakes were SO yummy!),,,,
If & when we're able to revisit Boston,"we'll most definitely check for availability in Oine's great home!\"",,,,
6677469,85536513,2016-07-11,21092740,Ann,"We stayed at Oine's beautiful apartment for the second time last weekend and it was just as we remembered it. The location, condition of the apartment,  and responsiveness of our host  were all five star! We absolutely love this place and hope to stay there again ! You couldn't ask for a better homebase  from which to explore Boston!"
6677469,86842168,2016-07-17,36290216,Suzanne,Very nice safe neighborhood in a great location. Brownstone was as described and was a lovely home.  We enjoyed our stay. Oine was very easy to communicate with during booking and our stay and very accommodating to our arrival and departure times.
6677469,90288383,2016-07-31,77754119,Chantal,"I went to Boston with my two sons (and the girlfriend of my oldest) to attend the Cold Play concert and visit the city, we had an amazing time!  Oine's place is a really nice cozy place in a quiet neighborhood at walking distance of everything you need.  The apartment is clean  and is perfect for relaxing after a full day of sight seeing.  The host was easy to communicate with and answer all of my questions before and after booking.  Thank you for sharing your home."
6677469,92384930,2016-08-08,31611096,Patrik,"Our stay was great, Oine was very friendly and helpful."
6677469,94312149,2016-08-15,75236610,Jodi,The place was beautiful and cozy. Everything was clean too. I would definitely stay there again! Thank you Oine!!
6677469,97870855,2016-08-28,3228621,Emily,We were in Boston for a wedding with our 2-month-old and mother-in-law. Oine's place was perfect! It was clean and comfortable and the location was great. Oine was responsive and helpful leading up to our trip. We would highly recommend this place to anyone.
14533011,94677373,2016-08-16,86203476,HDTennisShoes,Arrived late and host waited patiently and welcomes us in. Had fresh water waiting as it was warm!
9239190,53921866,2015-11-14,28655189,Priscilla,"Jose was a very welcoming and a friendly host. Once we arrived he greeted us and showed us to the room. The room is just like the picture , bed was very comfy. The apartment is near transportation and in a nice neighborhood.  Jose checked in with us during our stay to make sure everything was good. If I would ever come back to Boston I would stay at Jose's place again."
9239190,55286996,2015-11-29,1207963,Virginie,Jose was nice and welcoming. He showed us the room and took care that we had everything.
It is close to the red line and we could park the car easily,"the location was good.\"",,,,
9239190,70319373,2016-04-17,67094179,Geoff,The host made some enjoyable small talk and made sure we had everything we needed. Overall a good experience.
9239190,70781381,2016-04-20,65621995,Chelsea,Jose was a great host! We had a great time staying at his house and he was very helpful
9239190,71342034,2016-04-24,14270935,Dan,"Here's what you need to know about this listing. The house is almost entirely made up of rooms for short-term rent (4 or 5, I believe). The room itself is fine, and the common kitchen was fine, and everything is generally fairly clean. Towels aren't provided, although bedsheets are. The location's pretty good, with some reasonable places to eat nearby, and there was usually street parking available (although sometimes it was hard to find). All in all, the house and room were fine, although our stay was unnecessarily frustrating because of the host's general indifference."
Jose wasn't very communicative early on,and,in fact,simply ignored my first booking request (although it was back in January). Although he accepted the second request (late March or early April),he didn't respond to my initial questions,and answered some of my follow-up questions with one or two-word responses.
Although I gave him an estimate of when we would be arriving,he wasn't there when we got there,and didn't leave any instructions or even specify which room was ours. Luckily,another guest answered when we knocked and let us in,although he showed us to a room that didn't have any sheets (obviously not his fault).,
When I messaged Jose about the fact that the room didn't have any sheets,he didn't acknowledge or apologize,he simply just told us which room he'd made up for us. To his credit he did message us to check in about halfway through our stay,although that certainly didn't make up for everything else.,,
Again,once we were settled,the experience was fine,"but being ignored and forgotten definitely made everything much more stressful than it needed to be.\"",,
9239190,76525005,2016-05-28,39915353,Misha,"My mom and I stayed with Jose for two nights and had a fantastic experience. The house is located in a quiet residential neighborhood that is nevertheless very well connected to the city center (also, notably, just a few stops along the Red line from South Station)."
Our room was very spacious,tastefully furnished,clean,and cozy. Jose himself was a great host -- responsive to my texts,caring (he kept checking on us to make sure we had everything we needed),and extremely courteous (he made my mom feel welcome even though she didn't speak any English).
All in all,"this place was an excellent value for money; I would recommend it to anyone. \"",,,,
9239190,77597442,2016-06-02,24776347,Ari,"Nice place, Jose was friendly and gave us everything we needed. Highly reccomend. Would stay again."
9239190,78322656,2016-06-06,49832877,Angelina,The host is very nice even when we arrive late in the night. The neighborhood is convenient and close to metro.
9239190,81333704,2016-06-22,70485573,Amina,The listing was accurate. He was a great host.
9239190,81499408,2016-06-23,64317570,Nicole,The host canceled this reservation 25 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
9239190,95387778,2016-08-19,82663837,Juliana,"A estadia na casa de Jose foi tranquila. O quarto era limpo e tudo como mostram as fotos! Ele recebeu a mim e meu marido pessoalmente para entregar as chaves do quarto. Entretanto, o banheiro compartilhado para 6 quartos não seria aconselhável para estadia de casais, o que nos causou um certo desconforto. Porem, sempre foi mantido tudo bem limpo."
9239190,99676924,2016-09-05,7303011,Estelle,"Affordable room in Boston, clean and with all the amenities. Jose is really flexible for check in and out. It is not in downtown but basically 5 minutes to the subway station. Perfect for a week end trip."
13606268,84654453,2016-07-08,16836477,Andrea,Drisana met me at the coffee shop down the street and even rolled my luggage for me. She told me places of interest to visit and nearby stores and restaurants. Later on in the week she brought over a spare Roku and attached it to the tv. Thanks so much for your hospitality!
13606268,85875982,2016-07-13,79910098,Alma,Nick was very helpful in providing us directions and tips on places to eat and visit. The place was clean and well located.
13606268,86411537,2016-07-16,41827646,Bret,"Nick is a really nice guy and a great host. My flight in from Chicago was already going to get me in pretty late and turned out being pretty delayed, forcing me to check in in the middle of the night. Nick was super accommodating and met me around 2:30 AM with the key. I felt bad waking him in the middle of the night, and he was a really good sport about it."
The apartment is in a nice old building in a convenient area. I found everything I needed just by going for a walk. It is right next to a streetcar stop so it is well connected.,,,,,
The unit was clean and was set up nicely with a desk,television,and a Roku,which provided some welcome background distraction while I got some work done.,,
Not related to the unit specifically,but something I learned on my visit: carry your passport if you are not from Massachusetts,"as many places will refuse service to people with out-of-state IDs. This was my first proper trip to Boston and I really enjoyed my stay. I hope to return again soon.\"",,,
13606268,87055253,2016-07-18,80686465,Nick,"\"Be careful staying with Nick. While he was a nice guy, there were several inaccuracies in his posting when I stayed in his place. When I booked, there were misrepresenting stock photos up, not the real apartment. He sent real photos only after my plane landed in Boston. A few days before the trip, he raised the price since my time there was inconvenient for him. The description was also flawed. The space is a run down studio about 15-20 minutes from downtown Boston on public transportation. The building is a mess. There's graffiti on the wall of the elevator that says, \"\"Fix this fucking building"
13606268,87399687,2016-07-19,36391067,Nick,"Nicks place is small but has everything you need. Comfortable bed and clean accommodations, directly across the street from a green line station. Was a bit over priced for what it is but that was my only problem with the listing. Nick was easy to work with too."
13606268,87624940,2016-07-21,7488275,Mike,"Nick's place is in a great area- directly off the T line that takes you right to Kenmore/ Fenway Park. For the price, this cannot be beat. It was exactly as shown, it's a small studio apartment but with a comfortable bed which is all I wanted for my trip of walking around Boston all day."
The AC worked great too!,,,,,
Nick was one of the best hosts I've worked with. He let me check in early before cleaning was even done so I could drop off my bags and start my day. Seriously,he could not have been more accommodating.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
13606268,89831755,2016-07-30,18294031,James,Nick was an outstanding host.  Made special arrangements for my late arrival.  Checked in on everything.  Very very good.
14402688,95087309,2016-08-18,86522890,Juan,"Very convenient location close to train station, new mattress."

7348110,38969989,2015-07-19,36210401,Phil,"Marcos was present at check-in & check-out, and made sure we had everything we needed throughout our stay. The apartment had excellent facilities, including fast Internet, televisions in every room & security. We would stay again if in Boston."
7348110,43188498,2015-08-17,30508331,Jeff,"This was a last minute booking, as another host had cancelled our previous reservation about 20 hours before our trip."
Marcos was a great host and very accommodating.  Check out time was 12:00 on Monday.  Our planes didn't leave until late in the evening and they were able to store our luggage so we didn't have to try and cart it all over town.,,,,,
The unit was very clean and accessible.  He came to meet us upon check-in and gave us notes on everything necessary for the stay.,,,,,
Marcos was actually out of town and gave us his roommate's number in case we had any issues.  We had to contact him once during the stay to ask about the luggage and he picked up the phone immediately - so,both were very easy to connect with,if/when needed.,,,
We would definitely refer the unit and anything hosted by Marcos to others traveling to the area and will hopefully get to book one of their units next time we're in Boston.,,,,,

7348110,47114360,2015-09-15,29384938,David,El apartamento muy bien .. Un poco lejos del centro sobre todo a las horas punta.. Pero merece la pena..
7348110,47423625,2015-09-18,21311997,Simon,Marcos apartment was exactly as described. The location is pretty close to the Institute of Technology and it's a 10 min ride downtown. Marco was there to greet me.
7348110,51476269,2015-10-20,11366438,Sally,Spacious & warm apartment! Good location near Jackson Square station! Marcos friendly & willing to assist! Kitchen/oven could have been a bit cleaner & a basic welcome pack particularly for international travellers would have been very useful! No milk or kettle for a hot drink after a 14 hour journey!
7348110,54692386,2015-11-22,31671271,Mark,"Marcos was very easy to work with, especially nice since this was  a last-minute booking. The apartment was very nice, no complaints.  I know Boston pretty well so this was no surprise to me, but I think it's important for international travelers to understand that this is not a part of Boston you'd want to walk around in at night (nor even in the daytime really).  This is a nice place to sleep, but you'll want to be spend most of your time in other parts of town."
7348110,68219852,2016-04-03,27296502,Koji,Perfect place for family or group trip.
"The host is very responsive and flexible.\"",,,,,
7348110,70757881,2016-04-20,51351770,Claire,"Marcos was a lovely host with great communication before during and after our stay.  The apartment was a lovely, very tidy and clean.  It was easy to get to via 2 T stops on the orange line by walking, and the neighbourhood was lovely - very nice shops locally and Lillys a great pasta place!!!  You could hear the train from the T but we got use to it very quickly.  Thanks Marcos - lovely place."
7348110,73462779,2016-05-08,2080426,Kasandra,"Even though we arrived late at night to check in, Marcos was still very welcoming and gave us a tour of the beautiful apartment. He was a great host and was very quick to respond to any questions I had during our stay. We loved everything about the place and would definitely would stay here the next time I'm in Boston!"
7348110,74551368,2016-05-15,10600973,Mj,"He was greeting me with big smile, the home is clean and beautiful. we stayed very good. but the convenience store and liquor store is quite far(10min walk, yes I am lazy....), you need to buy before getting to the station. he does not show up until we checked out, but he was nice to answer the phone. Since he is not home, guests will be happy if they could manual book including ac operation or other info. train is nearby this place, I was fine to sleep. but for very very sensitive guests need to consider this."
7348110,75701519,2016-05-22,19572813,Casey,Awesome place and an awesome host. Highly recommended.

7348110,78189944,2016-06-05,3967516,Marta,Great place to stay! Clean and spacious loft - more than enough room for 4 people. Stayed here to watch a baseball game and it's only about a 25min walk from Fenway which was awesome!
Marcos was a great host - made sure we were all situated before leaving. Very easy to contact if anything came up as well.,,,,,
"Would definitely stay here again :)\"",,,,,
7348110,80460771,2016-06-18,53568230,Emma,"Marcus was great, prompt in replying to messages the day before & day of our stay.  He was in the apartment waiting for us when we got there, he'd got us a map & some food menus in case we were staying in."
It's a LOVELY apartment!  Spacious,clean & has a really good shower (which is always a bonus for me!).,,,,
Train into downtown Boston is just at the top of the road & we walked down to Samuel Adams Brewery. Wouldn't hesitate to stay there again but definitely for longer next time.,,,,,
Thanks again Marcus,really enjoyed our stay.,,,,

10253899,71399533,2016-04-25,41572475,WIllie,"Megan was an incredibly accommodating host. The minute I first stepped into the house, it felt welcoming. She left a lot of cute notes and goodies around the house. They were very sweet gestures. There was also a note next to a pet fish but I am so pet-stupid that I had no idea what to do. Of course, it was OK to leave it alone as well. She was reliable; she was constantly in contact whenever we needed her. An overall great host!"

The house was as listed, clean and ready for our arrival.

Very please,Mr. James was very prompt in returning my calls.,,,,
"Mr. James and his family made us feel welcome and made us breakfast every morning.    Due to our busy schedule we did not spend much time at his place other than just sleeping at night.   We had our private bathroom which was a plus for both my husband and I.  \"",,,,,

6954861,45971113,2015-09-07,25011365,Karolina,"We had excellent communication with James prior to our arrival and felt confident that we would find his place easily. We arrived in the afternoon, left our luggage and ventured out to have dinner and see some comedy. From the beginning James and his wife whose name I didn't catch but who was very caring, made sure that we had all the information we needed. We had exclusive use of the bathroom, which was really nice and it was very well equipped. The room had a comfortable bed and was very clean but what touched us most was how welcoming, helpful and engaging James and his wife were. We only spend one night at their place but they truly made us feel like part of their family. After a good night's sleep we had been offered breakfast, which we did not expect, but which made the start of our day much easier because we could go straight to the museum after that. James's wife is a wonderful cook and we wish we had more time to hang out together. All in all, if you are looking for a conveniently located place in Boston with a personal approach, this is the one."
6954861,46215071,2015-09-08,42600139,Leiwen,We had a very pleasant stay at James' place. Both Mr. and Mrs. Li are easy going and loving to make friends. It is a place that makes us feel like home. We will be sure to stay longer next time when we visit Boston again.
6954861,46603165,2015-09-12,36802187,Eszter,Definitely recommend!!! ;)
James,Afeng and their children,Victor and Frida are a really,easy-to-love-and-like-them-family! :),,
From the beginning: James was really helpful from the very first contact between us. He offered to give us instructions how to find their house,was interested about us and our plans in the US and in Boston,so his advices were relevant towards our sightseeing plans,and even brought us to J. F. Kennedy's birth home,which was so kind from him.,
Brookline has a charming atmosphere,we liked walking on the streets and near the lake,and could easily reach Boston downtown with the T (there is a direct line). Their beautiful home is on the top floor of a cozy house. The room looks like as it is pictured,and has a really warm atmosphere. Our private bathroom located next to the bedroom was very comfortable. Both was super nice and super clean. And the bed! It was something fantastic,we slept really,really well. :)
About Afeng and James: both of them have a really attentive and open personality. They are a lovely,friendly and helpful couple,was easy to hang out and communicate with them. We had a great time at their home,enjoyed every moment there! We are glad to know them,and the next time when we are coming to Boston,"will definitely choose them again! See U soon! :)\""
6954861,47366679,2015-09-18,35924011,Deirdre,"Before arriving in Boston, James sent easy to follow directions on how to get to his centrally located home. Upon our arrival and throughout our stay, my daughter and I, were greeted with a happy, kind-hearted family. James was particularly helpful in any directions we needed for navigating around the city. Afeng was sweet and lovely. She saw to it that our stay was as comfortable as possible. It was a pleasure learning more about the Chinese culture and we felt comfortable and safe in their home. Thank you so much for making our stay in Boston simply awesome! Please remember to come visit us in California, too!"

We were suppose to arrive around 8 pm, but due to train delays, we didn't get in until about 11:30.  Afeng was a very gracious host and made our stay in Boston pleasant.  The home is very nice and well kept. Unfortunately, we did not have the opportunity to meet James, but he did call to wish us a pleasant stay.  By the time we left we felt more like friends than merely guests. If in the Boston area, don't miss this opportunity for a real family experience."

James helped us to find a parking space, Afeng left us a pitcher of lemon water in our room, and they introduced us to both of their children. They were very friendly and kind. The room itself had a comfortable bed for two, and James and Afeng respected our privacy while we were in the room. James and Afeng responded to our request almost instantly and on very short notice. We were looking for a place to stay that night, and they agreed that we could arrive at 10pm (a mere 3 hours after we contacted them)."

The room was clean and nice and had lots of information on how to get to the sights in Boston. The neighborhood is great and an easy train ride to downtown. It was a lovely stay! Thank again, Afeng!"
6954861,50943551,2015-10-16,21060215,Bob And Betsy,"We were received graciously by a very considerate and attentive host. The accommodation was clean, comfortable and quiet. Brookline location offers a wide array of restaurants and shops. Public trans is a block away. Just perfect. Thank you Afeng!"
6954861,51448358,2015-10-20,12475822,Marvin,"This was my first airbnb experience.  James was out of town so Afeng was my host for this trip.  I was in town to compete for the Head of the Charles with my rowing team and just needed a convenient place to stay that was close to public transportation and the boathouse...this place fit the bill.  Afeng was the most gracious host, along with her two children.  I didn't get to interact much with them since I was in and out of the house early in the morning and back later in the day due to my rowing practices and competition.  The room was lovely and she even had a pitcher of lemon water there for me everyday which was a nice touch.  Having my own private bathroom was a plus.  Waking up early to head to the boat club for both rowing practice or my races was no problem at all.  Afeng was even awake some of the early mornings to make sure I had everything I needed.  She even made me breakfast on the last day before I left to the airport. (She wanted to make me dinner during my stay but I had a busy schedule with my rowing team)  Overall, very pleasant stay and very gracious hosts.  Would definitely stay again.  Thanks again for everything! :-)"
6954861,51587636,2015-10-21,43607193,Ling,The place is very convenient and close to two subway lines. It is in a very safe neighborhood. The room is quite decent and hosts are very friendly and accommodating.
6954861,51773520,2015-10-24,19660800,Laurie,Great location! Easy to get around. Afeng was helpful and kind. Enjoyed our conversations with her.
Room and bathroom very clean. Good information left for us in the room about Boston.,,,,,
Apartment is four flights up - 30 steps in all.  Bed very comfortable. Good room for a solo traveller with not a lot of luggage.,,,,,

We can definitely recommend James' & Afeng's place to everyone! :),,,,,

6954861,52375402,2015-10-28,47214912,Ilaria,"We spent only One night in Boston but Afeng Made our stay really confortable.. There is all you need: Wi-Fi, a clean bedroom with Many informations  about Boston and a big private bathroom reale well equipped!  You can take the train and Get off just in front of the door, walking distance you'll find restaurants, coffee and shops!!! Thank you Afeng from me, Luca and our baby ;)"
6954861,52506158,2015-10-30,45396343,Ruth,"Afeng was a wonderful host making us feel most welcome. The description of the bedroom and bathroom was accurate and both were of a very high standard. We were provided with lots of information to help us enjoy Boston. James was away on business but we enjoyed a conversations with him via (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN), it is obvious the whole family enjoy welcoming people into their home."
6954861,52626666,2015-10-31,26841535,Tyrik,"This was the family I never had; from the first few minutes in the door, Ah Feng was like my long lost mother welcoming her own child home. This would be the first place I would look for whenever I decide to take my next trip back to Boston. The neighborhood was quiet and easily accessible, the train is literally a 2 minute walk. My host family's residence was very cozy and very clean. The only thing I didn't like was that I was not able to stay longer, it is a very sad experience to say goodbye so soon so such great friends that you just met."
6954861,52933560,2015-11-02,25523220,Luke,"Afeng greeted myself and my girlfriend with a enthusiasm to host us in her home and a hug. She showed us around her home and introduced us to her family who were all incredibly kind and welcoming. The room was extremely well kept and organized and we were allowed a private bathroom which was also very well organized and cleaned and included fresh towels. The bed was very comfortable and the overall experience was excellent, especially for our first time using Airbnb.  Afeng was such a great host that she even gave us a small parting gift as a thank you for staying. We would absolutely stay here again and will continuing using Airbnb after such a positive experience. Thank you, Afeng!"
6954861,53003652,2015-11-03,21678729,Guy,everything was perfect : ))
6954861,53161040,2015-11-05,712407,David,"Such an amazing stay! Afeng was a gracious host who offered us slippers, lemon water, and amazing black tea. The bed was extremely comfortable and clean and the shower and toiletries were above expectations. Would recommend to all travelers. We went to Barcelona wine bar which was a short walk from the house."
6954861,53211028,2015-11-06,8985475,Leslie,"Afeng was extremely warm and welcoming. Her home is lovely and in a beautiful neighborhood in Brookline, right next to public transportation so it could not be more convenient. The room is clean, comfortable and peaceful. Overall a great stay!"
6954861,53310953,2015-11-07,39706554,Nilce,"Afeng was an amazing host! She literally walked two blocks with me just to show me where to park my car overnight and then helped me to carry my luggage up the stairs. She is very sweet and attentive! Her condo is beautiful and comfortable-exactly as it is shown in the pictures. The room was beautifully decorated, everything was really impeccable and a perfect place to relax and spend the night. Highly recommended! Thanks Afeng and James!"
6954861,53608163,2015-11-10,8802916,J Anne,"Friendly host, convenient location, spotless room: I would certainly recommend James & Afeng Li's air&b.  They were helpful, providing clear directions on how to get there from the airport as well as Boston guides/booklets in the bedroom.  Afeng was very friendly, providing lemon water on our late arrival (we did not meet her husband). The room was spotless and quiet, the bed very comfortable, and we had a bathroom of our own just next door. The b&b is about 20 minutes by transit from downtown Boston (by that I mean Boston Commons and the start of The Freedom Trail) and close to a bus that took you to Harvard.  A great alternative to the really expensive hotels in downtown Boston!"
6954861,53841681,2015-11-13,47914872,Dave,"The listing was accurate. The location was excellent. The room was safe, clean and comfortable. Unfortunately I had three heavy bags and carrying them up three flights of stairs was a bit difficult."
6954861,54244030,2015-11-17,38829013,Maureen,"Afeng made us feel so welcome. She helped us bring our bags to room and had some lemon water waiting upon arrival. The room was clean, decorated nicely and super comfy bed. The location very convient to train stop and felt very safe walking around the neighborhood at night. There is a Dunkin Donut and Starbucks two blocks away. We were able to come and go as we wanted. This was our first Airbnb experience and didn't know what to expect. Afeng and her family made it a great experience."
6954861,54860075,2015-11-25,33602708,Lisa,I stayed here 5 nights.  Afeng made me feel very welcome.  She made me some wonderful Chinese tea one morning.  The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was clean and private.  The location can't be beat with the C Line just steps from the front door.  Afeng's two teens live here also.  They are quiet and respectful of guest privacy.  Wonderful Brookline location!
6954861,55081976,2015-11-27,47183111,Komal,The Host was extremely welcoming and nice. We felt like we were at home and the room was extremely cosy.
"The listing was accurate and the neighbourhood was quaint and perfect for relaxing after a long day in the city. Also you could take the train from right in-front of the house which made it super convenient.\"",,,,,
6954861,55494858,2015-12-01,48630798,Seoyeoun,"Oh my God, Afeng was so welcoming! She is such a sweeeeeet person. The house is so clean, and guests, you get a private bathroom! Afeng cleans the bathroom and washes the towels, so every day you get clean towels. The room is really clean as well. In the morning, she even brought me a cup of tea. I'm definitely going to stay in their place if I have a chance to go back to Boston :)"
6954861,55612245,2015-12-03,15607372,Stuart And Helene,"This location is so convenient. Even during the morning rush, our drive to the Longwood area took just 20 minutes. The T (surface) is directly across the street in the median. There are several very nice restaurants in walking distance."
"The bedroom and bathroom are spotless. The host family is most friendly  and helpful.\"",,,,,
6954861,56065064,2015-12-08,49489232,Rochelle,"Staying with Afeng and her family was such a great experience for two young travelers! My boyfriend and I were visiting my younger brother, a Senior at Boston College and this cozy room in Brookline was the perfect place to get to and from the BC campus. Afeng was so accommodating and hospitable, it really felt like we were part of the family. The bedroom is the perfect space for 2 people and the private bathroom is spacious enough for 2 people to get ready in."
The apartment is located near Cleveland Circle where there are some cool places to eat and drink as well as the Chestnut Hill Reservoir,a popular runners spot. To get to downtown Boston,it is about a 35 minute T ride or about a $15 Uber ride. Since we were visiting family at BC,we often used Uber to get to and from the BC campus which averaged out to be $6 each way. This apartment is also about a 25 minute walk to the BC campus if you prefer to enjoy the scenery outside.,,
Afeng and James' home is a great spot to get to and from Boston proper as well as the neighboring areas like Brookline and Chestnut Hill.,,,,,
FYI,Afeng is a very hospitable host and loves to have conversations and share meals with their guests and her children. If you book this room,"I would encourage you to have dinner with her and her children. \"",,,
6954861,56873535,2015-12-19,50332435,勤,住李家Airbnb有感:
李家豪宅不多见,四卧两厅不分离;交通方便不偏僻,停车收费不用急;卧室温馨不意外,大床舒适不让人;专属茅房不公用,淋雨热水不必等;阿凤热情不见外,家强督促不放松;几天享受不太短
James and Afeng's home was a rarity,"with excellent layout and easy transportation. Parking was easy and fees low.The guest bedroom was so cozy and the spacious bed especially comfy. The private bathroom was really to our own use and bath facilities top-rate. The hosts were so hospitable that we felt reluctant to leave and eager to come back.\"",,,,
6954861,57975840,2015-12-30,25398653,David,James and Afeng were the kindest and most accommodating hosts one could ask for. Their home is absolutely wonderful and in an ideal location right net to the T in a beautiful neighborhood. Parking is also very convenient! Loved our stay and felt incredibly welcome!
6954861,58315030,2016-01-02,47858341,Narmin,"We liked a lot our stay at James & Afeng's. The hosts were hospitable and welcoming. The room is small, but cosy and clean, the bathroom is comfortable and neat. It was easy to reach the location by using public transport. Overall, we enjoyed our time in Boston and James & Afeng's hospitality played a huge role in it."
6954861,60028359,2016-01-18,48630798,Seoyeoun,This was my second time at James and Afeng's place!! As always they were amazing!! Both the room and the washroom were really clean!
6954861,61794068,2016-02-08,53980658,Richard,Stayed with James and Afeng for three days recently.  Very comfortable lodging and the hosts were very welcoming and helpful.  The location was excellent - very close to the Green Line T.  I would like to stay with them when I return to Boston.
6954861,62306730,2016-02-13,26841535,Tyrik,"I came back a second time in less than 3 months, I think that action says enough there by itself about how great this host is. This is still the first place I would look for when I decide on another trip to Boston."
6954861,66833380,2016-03-25,57700571,Laura,"Afeng is a lovely person and the place is perfect-the room tastefully and comfortably appointed, and it and the private bathroom spotless. The home is charming and full of character, and  the teenaged children are no less exceptional (and one would hardly know they're there.. quiet and considerate).  Great Brookline location. The experience was perfect for my daughter and me--we were visiting some colleges in the area. Many thanks, Afeng!"
6954861,67674745,2016-03-30,51111882,Andrea,The hostess Afeng was attentive to our needs and made sure that we had everything we needed. Room and Bathroom were clean and updated. Convenient location:  is within walking distance of the T.
6954861,68058409,2016-04-02,22081335,Katie,"We arrived in Boston without a place to stay for the night. Afeng was able to accommodate us on very short notice. She was helpful, warm, and incredibly welcoming. She even gave us a little parting gift! The room and bathroom were really clean and the bed was a dream. Would definitely stay here again. Great location as well."
6954861,68217246,2016-04-03,62058378,Samuel,"What a great place! I truly enjoyed my stay here. Afeng is extremely warm and friendly, and her family was very welcoming. Their place is in a quiet part of Brookline and is easily accessible by public transit. The room is clean, and the bed is very comfortable. The bathroom was spotless and very convenient since it was private. I give it the highest recommendation!"
6954861,68409441,2016-04-04,2050783,Annelisa,"Afeng was a tremendous host, making us feel so comfortable and welcome, providing us with helpful information about the area and also being very understanding about our slightly delayed arrival time.  The room and bathroom had everything we needed and more, and the bed was exceptionally comfortable.  We can't recommend the room at James & Afeng's more!"
6954861,68666801,2016-04-06,19691699,Roy,"After staying one night there, my wife and I extended our stay for one week. The place was perfect, an Afeung was an amazing host. We will definitely stay there again."
6954861,69160001,2016-04-09,19691699,Roy,"My wife and I had a wonderful time. The place was perfect, an Afeung was an amazing host. We will definitely stay there again."
6954861,69505401,2016-04-11,21039312,Holly,"Afeng was a gracious hostess and made us feel very welcome. She was accommodating with our early arrival. The Brookline apt is conveniently located to restaurants. Comfortable bed and nice linens, large private bathroom. We loved walking everywhere."
6954861,69856496,2016-04-14,65275420,Catalina,"We entered her house as strangers but left her home as family.  Afeng and her kids are the most generous, warm hearted, loving family.  Her smile lights up her home and welcomes you whole heartedly with a refreshing pitcher of water.  In the evening, her tea comforts and relaxes you making you ready for a good night's rest."
We were treated with love and care you would expect from someone you know your whole life.  Sadly,we won't be back in Boston,however,we have promised to keep in touch and to visit her in Beijing.,,
This is our first time to use AirBnB and for sure,won't be the last time.,,,,
We highly recommended Afeng's place,very clean and welcoming.  The bed is very comfortable,the bathroom spotless.,,,
With regards to transportation,the green line C stops right in front of her place.  There are a bunch of good places to eat such as The Public House and The Abby s.  I can't think of any negative comment to say,except,"we're so sad to leave....\"",,
6954861,70165941,2016-04-16,31182192,Ashley,Nice stay.
6954861,70619213,2016-04-19,46955748,Louise,"Afeng was a warm, friendly and welcoming hostess who greeted us with a smile each time we arrived and asked after all of our needs.  The space was clean, cozy and filled with her daughter's wonderful artwork.  Thank you in every way!"
6954861,71154341,2016-04-24,9234933,Victor,"This is my first time using AirBnb and I was at first worried about how it would go, but Afeng and family but my worries to rest. They had been very friendly and made me felt very much at home. I would highly recommend their home and if I go back to Boston, I would definitely stay here again."
6954861,72205855,2016-05-01,38300108,Christina,This is one of my best airbnb experiences. I stayed one night at their house. James was not at home but I met Afeng and her daughter. Afeng was super nice and generous. There is a private bathroom for me to use. Avenge kept it very clean and all bathroom supplies were available.
When I left their house,"Afeng gave me a bookmark with traditional chinese Jianzhi. Thank you so much!\"",,,,
6954861,73692269,2016-05-09,26678765,Jamie,"My sister and I had a great time exploring Boston and appreciated the kindness and hospitality of our host Afeng! She made us feel very safe and welcomed and the location was great for catching the metro up the street. Afeng was always so considerate to us. Thank you to Afeng and her family for their generosity and a great experience in Boston, even though we were out on the town most of the time!"
6954861,74548243,2016-05-15,19060778,William,"I had a wonderful visit with Afeng and her family. She was very accommodating when I had to change my arrival date, and then stayed up for me when traffic caused me to arrive late in the evening. Afeng welcomed me with warmth and kindness; she even came out to the car to say hello where my daughter was dropping me off."
Once inside,Afeng showed me her lovely house,which is very nicely decorated and has a colorful friendly atmosphere. The guest room is down the corridor,with its own private bath. Afeng is so nice and considerate: she provided me with a pitcher of lemon water each night. The bedroom is a quite cozy with the queen-sized bed; there isn't much room to walk around and there isn't a closet or desk; the room is decorated with nice paintings from her daughter; the room has a nice TV and cable although I didn't have time to try it out. The bed is very comfortable with firm pillows and a nice comforter on top. The private bath is very nice and clean and shiny with new tile. Afeng changed the towels every day.,,
The house is on a beautiful tree-lined street. Beacon St is very nice and super convenient with the T running down to Cleveland Circle.,,,,,
The house is a classy brownstone on a beautiful lovely park three blocks away and the Chestnut Hill Reservoir with a running/walking path. There are shops there as well with a great Deli Restaurant called Eagles. The neighborhood has a upscale suburban secluded kind of feel which is much nicer than Commonwealth Ave for example.  It's a kind of oasis and escape from the noise and bustle of the city.,,,,,
It is a wonderful stay with a very very nice host. The only downside is that there isn't hardly any room in the bedroom with the full-sized bed in there. Really,"it's pretty packed. For a single traveler with a small amount of luggage it's a great intimate space to rest from the excitement of the city.\"",,,,
6954861,75504259,2016-05-21,42774382,Hanzhang,"We stayed at James & Afeng's place for two nights. Afeng is an awesome host! She made us tasty breakfast:) The bedroom was very clean and cozy, even better than she described. We had a great time there. Hope we could visit Boston again in the near future."
6954861,76302996,2016-05-26,57332589,Xiaohui,"I booked Afeng's room for my parents to stay during my graduation week. We felt in love with she and her two kids immediately after we love. She was so nice and patient about our questions. And since we all come from China, we felt like we are family to each other right now. She even cooked us a fabulous dinner to celebrate my graduation. Her house is cozy and has very good location to everything you would need. The room and bathroom were clean and equipped with clean towels and toiletries. Her family is now family in Boston and I will definitely come back to visit her family when I go back to Boston."
6954861,76469684,2016-05-27,36218941,Mary,"First, the location is perfect. Right on a the metro line, near food and services. If you are visiting BU/BC, this is perfectly located."
Second,Afeng is incredibly nice. She's like a second mom. The apt is clean,neat,and quiet. Her paintings and her daughter's art are throughout the place,and it makes it feel colorful and fun. The room is clean,neat
The only thing - this is a family home in a family apt building. This is not a room to drink and party. But if you are looking for a warm,loving home environment for a relaxing stay,"this room is top notch.\"",,,
6954861,76691733,2016-05-29,50153808,Justin,Afeng/James were the best hosts that we could ask for! Afeng was so hospitable and it was as if we had a second mother while in Boston. We've never seen a host as kind as she was. She provided us with everything we needed and the place was great. The house is close to everything and we recommend this place to everyone. We can't wait to come and stay here again!
6954861,77814878,2016-06-03,62497193,Jean,"We really appreciate Afeng's hospitality. Her house and her families are great. The room itself is clean and beautiful, although a little bit small as it's hard for two people to open our luggages at the same time. Location is great, just in front of a stop on the green line, which basically takes us everywhere in the city. Overall a very good experience, and we enjoyed our stay very much. Thanks Afeng:)!"
6954861,78423873,2016-06-06,67334880,Meg,"\""
We were welcomed with lots of hugs and wonderful cold lemon water! The location is wonderful,"very convenient!!\"",,,,
6954861,78957069,2016-06-10,46786826,Avery,We really enjoyed our stay! The hosts were very kind and extremely accommodating. We enjoyed conversations about the Chinese zodiac and loved trying some of their authentic again cuisine! The location was great and ubers down town were fairly inexpensive.
6954861,79817306,2016-06-14,27208866,Ruidong,Convenient location close to public transportation; welcoming and kind host family; cozy & clean bedroom and private bathroom.

6954861,82452877,2016-06-27,27897430,Jacky,"Afeng and James' home was perfect.  Nicely situated, right at the T and walking distance to restaurants and coffee shops.  We had a rather full itinerary so didn't stay at the house except to sleep and for that it was great.  Comfortable bed, bright living space, clean private bathroom.  Our hosts were very thoughtful in that they left Charlie cards for us to use on the transit system and there was fresh lemon water in our bedroom for us to drink.  Thank you for making our visit with our daughter possible."
6954861,83113179,2016-07-01,71241877,Teng,It was a great expierence by James and Afeng. They were very friendly and provided many valuble advices for visiting in Boston. The location was convinient and safe. The room was comfortable especially the bed. It is highly recommended to choice here.
6954861,84430546,2016-07-07,39979069,Kang,"I booked this room for my mom and aunt. After their stay, they spoke highly of Afeng. She is always caring and considerable. Pay great attention to details. For example, she knows that people from Chinese culture would like to have hot water/tea instead of ice cold water. She had hot tea ready for them everyday. It was a great experience."
6954861,85043851,2016-07-10,78367704,Shirley Shijia,"The host is extremely kind and friendly. My friend and I were very impressed by their hosptablity. The location of the house is just beside the metro station so it is very convenient for you to go downtown. The room and restroom are very clean and gave me a sense of longing  and home. On our last day, James and Afeng woke up very early and cooked us a farewell breakfast. We were so touched. It is really the best airbnb experience for me. :)"
6954861,85437743,2016-07-11,60758393,Laura,"My sister and I had a great stay! Since we were only in Boston for 2 days, we didn't have much time to interact with our hosts but the few interactions we had were very pleasant and it would have been awesome to spend more time with them - the entire family is very welcoming. The room was clean, bathroom was great, and we really felt at home. The train station is practically right outside of their house and only a few stops away from some fantastic shopping and eating. This was my first Airbnb experience and I am so happy that it was such a great experience. If you're looking for a place to stay while visiting Boston, this is definitely one of the best."
6954861,86795886,2016-07-17,30459422,Kerry,"Afeng was very welcoming and friendly when we arrived making us feel comfortable. She poured us some lemon water which was appreciated too and left us the pitcher. The private room and bathroom were nice with a comfortable bed. We went to a concert at Fenway so we didn't spend much time there, but when we came back we met James who was also friendly and we spoke to both of them for a little while before going to bed. We would stay there again! Thanks Afeng!"
6954861,87447463,2016-07-20,76014988,Eunah,"She was so welcoming and kind. Afeng made my stay very comfortable and i would recommend. The only complaint would be that parking is difficult if you bring your own car, but Afeng was very helpful to find a parking spot."
6954861,87528669,2016-07-20,21612104,Amanda,Afeng was incredibly welcoming.  We had everything we needed in the bedroom and bath.  The neighborhood was extremely convenient for us as well.

6954861,88965453,2016-07-26,77164912,Scarlett,I had a great stay with Afeng! She and her family were very warm and welcoming. I would highly recommend staying here as it is a lovely home and is very close to the subway that takes you all around town. :)
6954861,89931218,2016-07-30,74225787,Amy,"Great place to stay! Right by public transportation, so it was easy to get to attractions each day. Clean room and bathroom, and Afeng had fresh lemon water waiting for us every evening when we got back from the day's outings."
6954861,91230418,2016-08-04,5940261,Lolita,"My stay was awesome. The room was as represented.  Afeng was the perfect host. I highly her home, and I would stay there again.  An added bonus is there are 2 nearby trains that go into Boston, so for me this was perfect."
6954861,91516561,2016-08-05,51438655,Chen,"非常棒的屋子,床睡的非常舒服,同时各种用品也很齐全,比如洗澡用品."

6954861,94672103,2016-08-16,82696252,Nilce,"My parents were visiting me from out of the country and stayed at Afeng and James’ wonderful place!  I personally stayed at their home last year in November and since I had such an awesome experience I decided to use this Airbnb again for my parents' stay. We couldn’t be happier! The place is super comfortable, clean, and quiet; the room is beautifully decorated, the bathroom is fully equipped with everything that’s needed, and location wise was perfect for us. The least to say, that Afeng and James are very attentive, hospitable, effectively responsive to any inquiries, and a friendly sweet couple. Highly recommended!"
6954861,98720177,2016-09-01,85866613,Yizhou,Really nice place and hospitable family. Treated me like family. Recommend this place to every single traveller!

6954861,99399844,2016-09-04,1155800,Susan,Afeng was a wonderful host. Her son and daughter were very friendly and interesting too.
Afeng went out of her way to make us comfortable,in replacing new towels everyday and even made breakfast for us on the 2nd day before we checked out.,,,,
"Thank you Afeng for your warm hospitality! \"",,,,,

11589644,68448527,2016-04-05,61840584,Libby,"The apartment was in a great location and was clean and tidy. Newbury St has restaurants, bars and shops at your front door. The decor is similar to the photos (not exactly the same) and it was nice that the bed was in a separate room. The only dissapointing room was the bathroom, which was still stuck in the 70's."
We had a few issues with getting locked out on a couple of occasions,but this was solved with flatbook through email,"and they have been quick to respond to all of our queries since.\"",,,
11589644,69532835,2016-04-11,11192318,Andy,"Clean and modern studio in a great location within walking distance to almost everywhere we wanted to go. Customer service was attentive, friendly, and flexible. We definitely felt at home for the week and highly recommend. Thanks!"
11589644,70015103,2016-04-15,795108,Susie,"Although not exact picture of the unit, it was very comparable and I was pleasantly surprised. Unit was nicely decorated,  was clean and the Flatbook team was very responsive. I would highly recommend the unit."
11589644,71561912,2016-04-26,18867198,Jacqueline,This was my first visit to Boston and I couldn't have picked a better apartment or location. I loved Back Bay and found it very central and easy to get around (mainly on foot) to explore the areas of this great city. The apartment itself was really quite spacious and had everything you needed; it was very nicely presented and was very clean. There was a little issue to begin with regarding keys but the local staff member who made her way to me with them was so apologetic and helpful. I did have to wait a short while but thankfully the internal foyer of the building was open so I could wait there. The only suggestion I would make is to have earplugs if you are a light sleeper. The apartment faces a public alley and as this is an area with lots of restaurants and bars you do hear some noise from the alley (delivery vehicles). This didn't bother me at all and is expected for such a central location.
11589644,72367371,2016-05-02,29899188,Angel,"Very modern and clean! It's right on Newbury where all the shopping is happening. There's a Shake Shack next door. The apartment is quite spacious. the kitchen had all the essentials plus more. There where plenty of towels, sheets, pillows, shampoo/soap. The TV is huge! And Internet is great. It's in the back part of the building so not much of a view since it faces the alley but it was very quiet."
I proposed to my girlfriend on this trip and the apartment had a great vibe to it making the happy moment continue on after the proposal at the Public Garden just down the street :D,,,,,
"The only negative is that the sink in the bathroom is very low...didn't bother us but it might those who are tall.\"",,,,,
11589644,74154137,2016-05-13,1750724,Catherine,"Nous avons beaucoup aimé l'appartement loué au Flatbook team. Super emplacement au coeur du quartier bobo de «Back Bay» de Boston. Situé sur la belle rue Newbury, gorgée de beaux restaurants et de chouettes boutiques, l'appartement était parfaitement équipé et il nous a été très facile d'y accéder. Notre seul désagrément fut de constater que les fenêtres du studio donnent sur une ruelle où de très gros camions font de l'entretien et de la maintenance en plein cour de la nuit! Plutôt bruyant...  Vraiment, Boston est une ville unique à découvrir, un coup de coeur garanti!"

11589644,93062202,2016-08-11,36675823,Michael,My first AirBnb and it was fantastic.  The location of this apt is AMAZING!  So many little shops and restaurants just outside the door with the rest of the Boston sites within a couple miles walk.  This company communicated well by email.
The apt is great too.  The window AC does yoeman's work in cooling this place relatively quickly.  The bathroom could use some updating and the bedroom window looks out over an alley and it seemed garbage pick up was every night,but nothing to be done about that.  The bed wasn't to my comfort level,but that's a personal thing.,,,
Overall,"I was very impressed with this place and Flatbook and would happily rent this place again or from Flatbook again!\"",,,,

It was a very clean, comfortable and well located place near Mission Hill with only 1 min. to go to the next tram/subway station (green line). Yosef and his roommate were perfect, very welcoming hosts, providing detail instructions prior to check in. I would go there anytime again."
