If we ever come back to the Boston area, we definitely know where to stay. We can only recommend this place. Nice, comfy and clean room and good breakfast. Thank you Mary and Barney!"
1472520,11938120,2014-04-19,1452576,Camila,"It was a wonderful experience to be at the Carney House. It is son nice to wake up in the morning and find Barney's muffins on the kitchen table with fresh coffee. The room was so nice, with a beautiful view, it is a much nicer experience then being at a hotel. Also the there is a metro station at a 10 min walk which is great to move around Boston."
1472520,12199266,2014-04-26,9499220,Dave,"I could not have asked for better hosts than Mary and Barney Carney in Savin Hill. So welcoming, accommodating and helpful in my short but memorable stay in Boston. Travelling alone to run the Boston Marathon, they made me and other guest 'singles' a part of their Easter and made us feel like family and indeed it felt like that to me by the end of the week. A beautifully presented room and bathroom in a lovely home made this a great experience. The location is superb and I will be telling all about it and I hope to see the Carney's again next year. Thank you, Barney and Mary!"
1472520,12301655,2014-04-28,14097200,Steve,loved Andrea's PRivate Bath T Downtown room! Barney treated us like old friends returning for a visit! The ability to make your own coffee and store food was ideal!
1472520,12555623,2014-05-05,2044423,Jodi,"We had a great time on our little escape weekend to Boston!  Room was great, bed was comfy and hosts were informative.  First Airbnb experience and it was wonderful.  Thanks for sharing your home with us!"
1472520,12753323,2014-05-10,3406853,Kimberly,"This was a fantastic stay!  Mary is a lovely women-kind and gracious and very helpful.  The room was sparkling clean, as was the private bathroom.  The kitchen had all of the appliances and pans that I needed to make my breakfast, lunch and dinner each day.  Morning coffee was a terrific added bonus, one less thing to do each morning!  The neighborhood was great-safe, family oriented, and close to the T.  I hope that every time I need to go to Boston this room is available!"
1472520,13187055,2014-05-21,13981304,Linda,"This was a great stay. The accommodation is lovely, comfortable and quiet and in a fantastic position for exploring Boston. Close to a train station with quick access to the city.  We were grateful for our hosts suggestions about things to see and how to travel to New York. as a result we had an unexpected and delightful ferry trip. Thank you Mary and Barney"

1472520,13336642,2014-05-26,9756751,Gary,"Carney family was very friendly and the home was as advertised with comfortable accommodations. Traffic in and around the home/area was difficult for us to navigate as we were not used to that type of environment. If we return to Boston, we would likely stay out of the city area and use public transportation to visit things we wish to visit."
1472520,13778828,2014-06-04,11699158,Dean,We had a fantastic time in Boston at the Carney's house!  I would highly recommend their accommodations and would stay there again.  We stayed in Andrea's room.  Barney & Mary were very friendly and hospitable.  The breakfasts were nice and the rooms and facilities comfortable and well kept.  We felt at home.  They went above and beyond what I expected.  This was our first experience with Air B&B and the Carney's home and would definitely do both again.

1472520,13849568,2014-06-06,11698625,Synnove And Chris,"Thank you to the CarneyFamily for a very enjoyable stay at your accommodation.  It was very spacious with a very comfortable bed, good bathroom and plenty of storage space, including a security locker."
We also enjoyed the morning breakfast and snacks if required.,,,,,
This place is in a good neighbourhood which is safe to walk around and only 5-6 minutes walk from the metro station.  Trains are frequent and the journey into Boston is quick and easy (only a few stops).,,,,,
The directions to find the place by car were clear but if you miss an exit it is not immediately obvious for a foreign visitor how to easily make an exit off the motorway.  Still,we arrived just fine with a little help.,,,,
"We will certainly book here if visiting the Boston area again.\"",,,,,
1472520,14036324,2014-06-10,15241829,Kyle,The most wonderful experience I could have imagined. I will definitely stay here again when I visit!
1472520,14120004,2014-06-12,1866596,Royce,The Carneys were friendly and had a great place with comfy beds and nice decor. The availability of breakfast items was also a plus. Neighbourhood was beautiful and serene. Would come back here if possible.
1472520,14511451,2014-06-21,14659470,Ceci,"The Carney's home was just what we expected.  Extremely clean. The bed was so comfy!  The location was superb!  We could even walk half block behind their home to Malibu Beach.  Also, their home is located less than 15 minutes from downtown. Their breakfast exceeded our expectations."
1472520,14709963,2014-06-24,16474378,Bob,It was a great place to stay - very peaceful and beautiful house.
1472520,14781045,2014-06-26,14449289,Ana  &  María,"Beautiful house, with a big and confortable room ,nice located in the Boston area. We had a good time there and we will definitely recommend this address to our friends and family."
1472520,14948619,2014-06-30,11557367,Jim,"We thought the listing looked great, and our 2-night experience matched.  Our first Airbnb stay and we couldn't have been more pleased.  Our hosts were welcoming & helpful.  Our room was large & clean.  The entire downstairs, including the lovely back porch, were at our disposal. Coffee & homemade muffins.  Convenient by Metro &/or car to Boston. Parking on premises. And the neighborhood is very beautiful with two great breakfast (brunch) places right next to the Metro station (10 minute walk).  Definitely stay there again."
1472520,15140637,2014-07-03,15642519,(EMAIL HIDDEN),"Many thanks to Mary and Barney for their warm welcome and making us feel at home. Our room was very comfortable and the house location is a great asset. A 5-10 minutes walk takes you to the subway station and another 15 minutes takes you right to the hearth of downtown. There are also a few restaurants close to the subway station, which is very convenient if you want to return to your room after a busy day of visit and have a later dinner. Having access to the kitchen and to all the goodies for the breakfast was also very enjoyable. As resume, we loved Boston and our stay at the Carney's house was certainly for a big part of it. We can only strongly recommend it."
1472520,15785868,2014-07-15,17115981,Stephan,Everything was really great. We had a perfect room in a perfect house. Mary and Barny gave us a warm welcome and were very helpful what to do in Boston. We would stay again!
1472520,15862713,2014-07-17,12444226,Jean Francois,Mary nous a accueilli avec le sourire sous une pluie battante
Le logement est agréable et je confirme les petits gâteaux maisons au petit déjeuner délicieux,,,,,
Cadre très sympathique loin de l'animation,,,,,
On prend le train pour aller down town c'est mieux car le stationnement est coûteux,,,,,
"Bon choix j'y retournerai \"",,,,,
1472520,16021385,2014-07-20,11048024,Marie,"Before we arrived, Mary sent us several emails to check if everything was ok, Mary is a really reliable person and answered really quickly to any questions."
The room was very clean and nice during our stay especially the terrace is just perfect for the breakfast.,,,,,
"Thanks for everything !!!\"",,,,,
1472520,16301361,2014-07-25,10983555,Nicholas,"A perfect place and great quite location from where to explore Boston. The room was big, clean and the common areas as well! We loved staying in this beautiful house and Mary was lovely and available every time giving us great suggestions! We had breakfast every morning under the portico in the back of the house overlooking the garden and the sea! Will definitely come back here for our next Boston trip! - Un posto tranquillo e perfetto per andare alla scoperta di Boston (in 20-25 min si arriva in centro prendendo la metro). La stanza era molto grande, pulita così come le stanze comuni (sala, cucina). Consigliamo a tutti di stare in una casa del genere caratteristica e in stile tipico del New England. Mary la proprietaria era sempre a disposizione e ci ha dato ottimi consigli! La mattina facevamo colazione sotto al porticato nel retro della casa con vista sul giardino e sul lago. Torneremo di sicuro per la nostra prossima visita di Boston!"
1472520,16477593,2014-07-28,451996,Siobhan,"The Carneys are a lovely, friendly couple. Our room was even better then we had anticipated; spacious, comfortable, clean and welcoming! Breakfast facilities were perfect. Overall we were very happy and would definitely recommend this house for anyone to stay there."
1472520,16649908,2014-07-31,11883439,Jenni,"Beautiful house and neighborhood. Carney family sent excellent directions, which made getting there on public transport (with 2 suitcases) easy as pie."
Host Barney made beautiful muffins every day or two,"and there was always a fresh put off coffee to greet you when you woke up. Room was beautifully furnished and comfortable. \"",,,,
1472520,16798140,2014-08-02,18262905,Ryan,"\"We stayed for two nights in this charming 19th century \"\"mansion\"\" home just a few stops South of downtown on the red line. It's located 1/2 mile walk from the Savin Hill stop in a very safe neighborhood.  The home has multiple rooms available through Airbnb"
1472520,16926767,2014-08-04,16995091,Lin Da,"很经典的房子,舒服,贴心,主人很nice"
1472520,17014229,2014-08-05,9977103,Jamie,"They are the nicest host I have ever met. The rooms were cozy, comfy, and very very beautiful. It even made me felt a little bit home sick... I love living in this big house with wonderful host, and greatest blueberry breakfast muffin in the world. My boyfriend and I had very nice experiences here. I'll choose Carney family next time visiting Boston. Thank you Mary!"

1472520,17295710,2014-08-10,7835451,Nate,"Pretty much perfect. Beautiful home, right near the beach and the Red Line. Great room, enough privacy. Everything we wanted."
1472520,17500847,2014-08-13,11020083,Holli,We throughly enjoyed our three night stay with the Carney's. The house is beautiful and wonderfully maintained and very local to a metro station which can take you easily in and out of Boston city centre. The house essentially backs onto the beach and is a short walk from a few very good restaurants if you prefer to stay local. Mary was very communicative before and during our stay and made us feel very welcome. The Carney's provided us with a relaxing space to come back to after a day in the city centre. We had a great stay and couldn't recommend it more
1472520,17931457,2014-08-19,15787476,Jim,"The host provided detailed instructions for arrival.  The room was ready on time.  The neighborhood was beautifully treed, with essentially only local traffic - a nice feeling of community.  Through the backyard there was a walk that led to a small beach and waterside walkway near the Dorchester Yacht Club and a public park."
1472520,18077698,2014-08-21,19070263,Geneviève,"Nous avons bien apprécié notre séjour chez la famille Carney. C’est une très belle maison, spacieuse et bien située. Le quartier était tranquille et nous étions à moins de dix minutes environ d’une station de métro sur la ligne rouge. Nous avons discuté et déjeuné avec d’autres voyageurs, ce qui était intéressant. Des céréales, du yogourt et des muffins faits maison sont fournis le matin. La femme de ménage nous a guidées pour nous rendre au métro à notre arrivée et était bien gentille. Nous n’avons pas vraiment eu l’occasion de discuter avec les hôtes, sauf pour savoir où déplacer notre voiture dans leur stationnement et à notre départ. Nous avons aussi apprécié avoir un coffret de sécurité dans la chambre, ce qui était une sécurité supplémentaire pour nos effets personnels de valeur. Le seul petit détail négatif : on nous a demandé de quitter un peu plus tôt que prévu notre chambre afin d’y faire le ménage pour les prochains invités."
----,,,,,
We enjoyed our stay at Carney’s house. The place was beautiful,and the location was near a T station. We had the chance to discuss with others guests and eat breakfast (and the homemade muffins!) with them. The maid was very kind with us and guided us when we arrived. The room also had a safety locker that was very practical. The only detail: we were asked to check out the room as soon as possible the morning for the cleaning service,"but it was an hour before the check out time.\"",,,
1472520,18410354,2014-08-26,17478410,Tristan,I had a great stay at Carney's family home. Barney and Mary are very warmth and their house is just wonderful !
The room is very cosy and the bed is ultra comfortable. Thanks also to the housekeepers who make a great job !,,,,,
Of course,i don't forget Barney's muffins which are just delicious :-),,,,
A perfect way to discover Boston and... to come back as soon as possible !,,,,,
"Merci beaucoup.\"",,,,,
1472520,18500423,2014-08-27,20091322,Runrun,My first and most satisfied Airbnb experience. Mary and Barney made our trip and stay easy and comfort. The house is only several minutes' walk from the metro station. Pretty inside and out. The room is spacious and most lovely. And we enjoyed the view of the beach just at the back of the house. Definitely worth the price.
1472520,18680813,2014-08-30,4847858,Saranya,"It was wonderful staying here. Loved the neighbourhood and the homey feel of the place. Barney and Mary are helpful with recommendations of things to do in the city and very accommodating when we had to arrive early, leave later than planned in the morning and leave our luggage for a few hours. Very tastefully done up place including the toiletries and really clean. We helped ourselves to freshly brewed coffee in the morning and spent away the morning on the porch with other guests. Stay here! Only thing being it's about 10 min walk from the nearest subway station."
1472520,18940432,2014-09-03,7582881,Cyril,We had a great time at Carney Family's house. We had the Andrea's Private bath room which was very comfortable. The hosts gave us good advices about the city and their sens of hospitality made us feel like at home.
1472520,19030591,2014-09-05,15858786,Janina,"La habitación era exactamente como se describía. La casa es muy acogedora y los anfitriones no se entrometen para nada por lo que uno siente que tiene todo para uno. La conveniencia del desayuno y la lavandería es muy positivo. Además la cercanía al metro. Tener una habitación limpia, una cama cómoda, un baño privado, poder hacerse una taza de té y sentarse en la terraza...definitivamente hacen que podamos recomendar este lugar."
1472520,19596231,2014-09-15,17595497,Marcin,"Byli bardzo mili, okolica jak z filmu dzień za dniem"

We were provided with all of the information needed to check in easily. The Red Line subway stop was within easy walking distance.The room was clean and very convenient. We will definately stay here again."
1472520,19746569,2014-09-17,3430204,Heleen,"The house is in a beautiful neighbourhood and is nicely lit in the dark when I arrived. With a clear description how to arrive by public transport (easy from South Station) it was a short walk. The room was very spacious, bathroom as well as room nice & clean.  Barney joined me and another guest for a fun chat and there was a healthy breakfast provided"
1472520,19770448,2014-09-18,7676622,Martin,Arrived just after 10pm due to flight being delayed and then a passenger falling ill mid-Atlantic and being stretchered off when we got to Logan however got to the house will no problems.
Room was spacious and comfortable - just what was needed to unwind from that flight.,,,,,
At breakfast I could not find anyone around but the kitchen was well organised so I just helped myself.,,,,,
"Enjoyed my brief stay and would recommend them to others.\"",,,,,
1472520,19879940,2014-09-20,19656753,Katelyn,"This place was lovely. Beautiful, old Victorian house. We had a private room with a private bathroom. The too me as clean, and the hosts did a great job to make it like a hotel. The space was very quaint and hospitable. The bed was very comfortable and clean. The neighborhood was quiet and had a rustic, genuine boston feel to it. So nice just to walk around. The family was very nice and helpful. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
1472520,20085338,2014-09-23,2286654,Helen,We felt very much at home at Mary and Barney's place and Mary made us feel very welcome when we arrived. It was very convenient for the T and Mary's instructions made their home easy to find.  Our room was comfortable and the kitchen and living areas made it very homey. Breakfast was appreciated especially Barney's excellent muffins. Both Mary and Barney gave us helpful advice about getting around Boston and also pointed out shortcuts to the JFK Museum which was in walking distance. Thanks Mary and Barney.

Short train ride into the city from station only a few minutes walk away. We didn't try any local restaurants as we had been on the road and eating out for 5 weeks so it was great to feel so comfortable cooking and eating in the shared kitchen/dining area. Supermarket half a mile away was very convenient. Thank you for sharing your beautiful home with us."

We chose the room with the private bath. The entire bottom floor is for guests with a fully stocked kitchen, living room and 2 additional bathrooms.

1472520,21109713,2014-10-11,20738910,Lambert,Though we met Barney for only half an hour he engaged himself in supporting our plans in Boston. The room was as desribed and ideal location for a Boston vistit - strong recommendation.

It was my first time to use Airbnb, and as a young woman, I was a little worried about staying someone else's house a lone. But I had a wonderful stay here! Barney always had good coffee and breakfast (yummy homemade muffin) available for us. If I ever visit Boston again, I would love to stay here."
1472520,22808032,2014-11-15,9657632,Ericka,"The house and the room were beautiful! It's very close to the red line, and the neighborhood is quiet, safe and friendly.

1472520,23259898,2014-11-26,22338750,Anouka,"Andrea's room came as a real surprise to me. It was one of the less expensive accommodations we've used during a 2 week holiday, but it turned out to be the one we've felt most comfortable at in the end. It really grew on us for the few days we were there. Hosts Barney and Mary are so kind as well, you really feel they open up the house to you. We can definitely recommend it!"
1472520,23543734,2014-12-04,645783,Sonia,"It's the best location to stay in if you want to do sight seeing around Boston. Conveniently located near the Subway station. The room was very clean and neat too, instructions were very clear on how to do self check in."

It is always clean, welcoming and very inviting. The great perk for me in snowy weather is off street parking. the Carney's have always been gracious and helpful ."

Mary & Barney were very accommodating and friendly as well. It's always nice to have hosts that are engaging and easy to talk to. They have a ton of knowledge of the surrounding area. Unfortunately I came in the winter weather, but I will definitely be back for the summer to enjoy the water that's just a short walk away! I highly recommend their home to anyone looking for a safe, quaint neighborhood and family feel for their vacation!"

We loved your wonderful home, neighbourhood and felt very comfortable with our accommodations.  As a runner, I particularly enjoyed running along the sea path around the university and beaches.  Boston is a fantastic city to visit with so much to see and experience, we expect to return in the near future.  When we do, we certainly hope to stay with you again."

The little things, like freshly made muffins and a keurig coffee machine in the kitchen, are what I believe made our stay that much better! Barney welcomed us to his home and helped direct us to the T station. The area was very nice and we felt very safe throughout our two days in Boston. Although we didn't spend too much time at the house, it was nice that the Carney family had a no curfew policy, where we could come back to our room without waking the family up to enter their house. We loved our stay and cannot thank the Carney family enough for their hospitality!"
1472520,33434978,2015-05-28,3471580,Stephanie,"This was a heaven in the bustling city of Boston. Just the right place to stay after a long day at the conference. The room is adorable, with a comfortable bed and a private bathroom. And the rest of the apartment is just as nice, especially the porch facing the backyard.

The room was beautiful (the photo here doesn't do it justice), the bed heavenly, the view out the windows lovely, the private bath charming, the back porch and grounds luscious, And. The Carneys thoughtfully provided two easy chairs, a pitcher of water and glasses (really welcome after a long day of traveling), and written instructions for accessing wireless and navigating the area so we could get the most out of our stay. The neighborhood - at the top of Savin Hill - is quiet, safe, friendly and beautifully kept, boasting majestic Victorian homes everywhere you look. We really enjoyed the respectful privacy provided by the Carney Family and will return again, as well as recommend Andrea's Private Bath to our friends. I only regret that our stay wasn't longer! Don't miss Mary's Granola for breakfast! Delicious!!"

Die Gegend ist sehr ruhig,man kann sich sehr gut erholen. Und die n,,,,
Nähe von Boston (10 Minuten zu Fuß bis zur Metro,und dann ca. 10 Minute  Metrofahrt ) macht die Gegend natürlich sehr interessant. Gerade auch wenn man ein Unterkunft mit park Möglichkeiten sucht.,,,,

1472520,35807128,2015-06-22,2997343,Lydie,Un très bon séjour dans une tres belle maison victorienne dans la verdure et dans un quartier très agréable. Le métro pour se rendre à  Boston et Harvard directement est tout prêt de la maison. On ne perd pas de temps pour les visites.  La maison est tres accueillante. La chambre est très agréable avec un lit très confortable. Le breakfast est délicieux avec tout ce qu'il faut à disposition.
Dommage que nous n'ayons pas eu l'occasion de rencontrer nos hotes mais nous étions en visite du matin au soir.  Un inconvénient malgré tout car une voie rapide passe  non loin de la maison et est assez bruyante si les fenetres sont ouvertes,ce qui est le cas en juin.  Et puis  pour notre dernier matin nous avons eu droit au passage de la tondeuse sous nos fenetres a partir de 7h45.,,,,
Difficile que tout soit parfait. En dehors de ces problemes de bruit,c'est un excellent séjour et je recommande cet endroit chaleureusement. Les informations pour arriver jusqu'à la maison et se garer sont tout à fait précises.,,,,

We were able to arrive early and use the amenities while the room was being made ready,and likewise having a late flight out was no issue either as we were able to leave our things and continue to use the house after leaving our room.,,,,
There was a handy list of places to eat with directions and well as food provided for breakfast.,,,,,
We were given great directions from the station to how to arrive at the house which made our journey very smooth. The location of the house was also great for Boston and surrounding areas.,,,,,

Lot of face towels and bath towels were provided and they were clean. Breakfast had good options and I now understand why all other guests wrote so much about their cupcakes- they were delicious! Barney was very helpful and as I was new to the town, he asked what I was looking for and took time to find long term accommodation options for me. He thoroughly explained me rental options at different places in the city. He took care of helping me with the heater operating in my room. As I was there during busy week days, I didn’t get much time to catch up with the family. I had to check out one day before my actual date and I informed the same to Barney. Though I didn’t expect or want them to refund the amount, they did! Very professional and friendly people.  I will definitely choose this home when I need a stay in the surroundings.

Juice, coffee, tea, fruit, milk, cereal and muffins were provided at all hours. It was like staying with friends, but still having my privacy. I will stay here whenever my business takes me to Boston."

I never met the hosts, though.  The only thing that keeps me from giving this a 5-star review is that you cannot lock the door of the room, and the entire house remains unlocked always.  So I didn't feel like I could leave valuables like my computer and personal ID documents inside and had to carry everything during my entire trip in a backpack, which was not comfortable."

The room was very comfortable with plenty of storage, table and chairs, a safe and lovely hot shower with toiletries. Met up with other travellers during our 3 day stay whilst enjoying the tea and coffee and the wonderful granola and muffins. The kitchen, lounge and outside area at the back are all great meeting places and so welcoming. We really cannot think of anything we would add or change in this accommodation. The house is beautiful and clean, in a lovely area a short walk from the T station so very easy to get into Boston. Barney and Mary are lovely friendly hosts who are available during the evenings and weekends and very helpful guides. This was our first Airbnb experience and we would definitely recommend Barney and Mary's home to everyone."

Barney called me before my arrival as I had an early-morning arrival; he gave me instructions on storing my luggages at the place and offered for us to make tea and rest a bit on the back porch before we headed out.  The room is spacious, though the shower space within the private bathroom is a little bit small.  We enjoyed the muffins, and the freedom to use the kitchen space for breakfast.  Thank you for a great stay!"

1472520,82811122,2016-06-29,14773244,Ruth-Ellen,"We loved staying at Mary and Barney's place! Airy, spacious, and with two front porch swings and a back deck, cost living room with mini-office, good sized kitchen and fitted out laundry, it felt just like home."
The room itself was bigger than we expected,with a queen sized and single bed and an ensuite and a cupboard with safe. The room could not be locked,so the safe was a welcome addition. Sets of good linen were provided for the three of us (two sisters and a friend,) and at no time did we feel cramped. The room was a bit warm and there were cooling options I believe,but opening the door just a bit proved to be enough for the balmy summer days. There are I think two other Airbnb rooms rented out in the same house,and it was nice to meet other travelers (who seemed to use a different shared bathroom that we also had access too if needed I guess. We didn't need it.)
Breakfast was included,and fantastic with orange juice,a coffee machine,Barney's muffins and Mary's granola as well as yoghurt,milk,English muffins - the works.
Barney communicated very promptly and comprehensively leading up to our stay,and his directions were easy to follow. It's not hard to get here by public transport on the red Metro line,but with lots of luggage Uber was easier the first time ($35 from Boston Airport.),,,
The house isn't right in the middle of the city - it's a bit south - but if you wander down through the backyard you can take a walk/run also the Harbour by the University of Massachusets,Boston. The path is literally right there. And the street the house is on is simply gorgeous,lined with beautifully decorated old colonial places just as special as the Carneys' home itself. To get to the inner city attractions and restaurants takes less than half an hour (south end) and 30-40 minutes (north end) by public transport and is cheap and easy. If that's what you're looking for (a sense of home,rather than being in the middle of the action,but with easy transport to that action,) then this will be perfect for you.
I finally met Barney and Mary on the final day,after they had very helpfully given us a great restaurant tip (Banyan Bar and Refuge in the city) and extensive medical advice when I injured myself. Mary lent me an ice pack and a wheat pack.,,,,
Overall,we had a wonderful stay and felt that the quality of the home and facilities and friendliness of the owners was top notch. It really was a home away from home,"and I wouldn't stay anywhere else if I came back to Boston.\"",,,

It was very easy to access from downtown Boston and the street that it is on is lovely, it felt like a real all-American family neighbourhood! The house itself was huge, spotlessly clean and beautiful and I loved the room that I stayed in with its own private bathroom. It was nice to meet other guests out on the patio and I absolutely loved Barney's magical breakfast muffins! What a nice touch. I also really appreciated the tips he gave me about visiting the Infinite Corridor at MIT and eating seafood at Legal Sea Foods in Boston, they definitely enhanced my last day.

My flight arrival was earlier than my checkin time, but I was allowed to leave my bags outside my room and use the extra bathroom to change, which was great. I received very clear instructions on how to get from the airport to their home, which was free and simple via the subway system. My room was clean. I received a bottle of water. My room temperature was fine, I didn't need the A/C, the windows open and fan going was perfect. I only stayed 1 night, so my trip was short. But I would recommend this place to anyone. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you again for your hospitality!"

We didn't get a chance to really talk to our hosts, but the few times we ran into them they were very kind and asked if we needed anything. The space itself was exactly as described in a beautiful old home near the beach. We enjoyed the ability to walk down the to the bay area (even though the water was a bit chilly), and the proximity to the T's red line made getting around the city easy."

I've been to Boston many times before and have stayed at both hotels (usually brands like Ramada, Days Inn, and sometimes Wyndham) as well as one previous Air BNB stay in Boston. We stayed in Andrea's room, but there are actually several different rooms listed on AirBNB for the same house. My husband and I were both impressed with the location, cleanliness, and overall good value of our stay. The house is a beautiful large older home in an established neighborhood on a lovely tree-lined street. It's only a 10 minute walk to the red line subway and then an easy subway commute downtown. If travelling, it's also a fairly quick drive to the airport from here. I didn't see the upstairs rooms, but I had a quick peek at Barney's master as well once the guests checked out. We had chosen Andrea's room because it had the en-suite bathroom - but Barney's would have been very nice as well (although it would have involved sharing one large bathroom with another room.)"
The communication I had with John (owner) in advance was great. He gave detailed information about the location,how to get to the room,and wi-fi -- so we were all set. They have a lovely lady working there cleaning the rooms and common areas,and everything was spic and span. Andrea's room is large and comfortable. Really,anything you could want is there - except for a TV and my husband (who is the one who usually wants that) used his iPad and didn't even miss it. There was an air conditioner,safe

Apartment was extremely clean and just as described. Future renters should know that there isn't a door between the bedroom and living area, just a curtain.

627048,5261035,2013-06-21,5888885,Marta,"We stayed at the apartment with my husband and my 6 months old baby. The flat was spacious, comfortable and clean. The location is very convenient. The move-in arrangements easy and efficient. Overall, a great stay."
627048,5352134,2013-06-25,1114656,Roman,"A professional host! Check-in and check-out was easy, although we didn't see them personally. The place was spacious, clean, it had a strong wi-fi, plenty of linen, amenities set and is in a quiet neighborhood, but still a close to everything: short walk to Prudential Center, etc. The kitchen seemed to be well equipped, although we did not use it, as there are a lot of nice restaurants in the city. A great find for a stay in Boston! I would stay here again."
627048,7273971,2013-09-14,5976025,Michael,Very nice building and the smooth entry from the directions received.  The unit itself is clean but there were a couple of things that were broken and needed to be repaired that were not urgently in need of repair. The hanging blinds did not work in the living room and there was a bit of formica missing from the from bathroom vanity.
Other than that,"a very nice unit in a great building and easy access to Back Bay Boston!\"",,,,
627048,7721421,2013-09-30,8921505,Henry,"This was our first time using AirBnB and I think we really lucked out! First, the location of this apartment was extremely convenient, being right next to the Prudential Center, Copley Place, and a supermarket."
Second,there is a large park/walkway where the Orange T Line used to be above surface,allowing nice walks with our two kids.,,,
Third,the unit had everything we needed for a home away from home: utensils,washer & dryer,and cable and internet.,,
Finally,the agent was superb. We were missing a duvet for one of our kids,"and she delivered it the same day.\"",,,

Amplio y confortable,con 2 habitaciones y dos cuartos de baño correctos.,,,,
Aspectos negativos: era imposible regular la calefacción,que estaba continuamente en marcha. Por otro lado,no hay cortinas opacas y a las 5-6am ya entraba mucha luz en las habitaciones.,,,
Agradable el detalle del detergente esponja y trapos en la cocina.,,,,,
Cocina muy bien equipada. Faltaba solo un colador de pasta/arroz,,,,,
Seamless Transition es un agente intermediario de una agencia llamada Churchill,que gestiona otros en el mismo edificio de Garrison Square: por lo tanto,no vimos en ningún momento ni al anfitrión ni a nadie que nos recibiera o nos proporcionara información ni sobre la ciudad ni los alrededores.,,,
Hicimos la reserva con 2 meses de antelación. Seamless nos ofreció la posibilidad de otros dos apartamentos además de éste pero no nos garantizó la disponibilidad del apartamento solicitado hasta 7 días antes de nuestra llegada. Por lo tanto,la transacción se ha efectuado como si se tratara de una agencia inmobiliaria de alquiler habitual,sin ningún trato personal directo con el propietario.,,,

9933886,62599808,2016-02-15,56718864,Neal,"This is the perfect place to stay as a central location to explore Boston. The front desk staff were both helpful and friendly, and we ended up with a lovely sunset view of the city from our room. There is an overnight parking garage agreement that makes it cheap (for Boston) if you need to take your car on your visit.  The room was clean, warm, and comfortable. For this price, you can't beat it!"
9933886,64867561,2016-03-08,45698114,Rundong,"The room is pretty small but does its job, however the shared bathroom is quite clean and spacious. The front desk staff would give you free shampoo and conditioner in case you didn't bring them. It's also close to the Back Bay station and the Silver Line bus station so transportation isn't a problem. The only issue was the slow elevator, but hopefully it will get better with the current renovation. The owner accommodated us despite their busy schedule, and I really appreciated that. Overall it's a nice experience."
9933886,66172250,2016-03-20,376133,Nadine,This was a great place to stay to attend a conference at Copley Place - so much more reasonably priced than the conference hotel!  The location was only a few blocks from Copley Place.  No problem getting there on public transport from the airport.  The room was spacious and clean and had its own en suite bathroom.   The room I stayed in had two double beds.  Great place and great price!
9933886,66823677,2016-03-25,49054887,Marek,"Good.  But, room/ambiance and overall feel of the place is definitely spartan.  Not helped by the ongoing construction throughout the building.  Plus, very thin walls which makes it tough to sleep when your neighbors are feeling frisky!"
9933886,68297321,2016-04-04,33998280,Marco,"Clean, very well located, reasonably priced, wifi included. A good place to stay if you are in Boston for work."
9933886,68729262,2016-04-06,30969371,Emmaline,"The general atmosphere was clean, the lobby was modern and the location central. Unfortunately we experienced an incredibly loud and disruptive floor well into the a.m. both nights. From 9:30 p.m. until after 2:30 a.m. someone consistently slammed their door every 15-20 minutes moving in and out of the building. Despite a request to respect residents in the property brochure (there are quite a few people who call this location a permanent home), we encountered loud noises, slamming doors and loud conversations through paper thin walls long after midnight. There was no enforcement of quiet hours, no warning posted in the rooms and no mention of a noise policy at check-in. Even at a hostel, it's unusual that one needs to employ white noise, headphones AND two pillows in order to get a few hours of sleep at 3 a.m. on a Monday/Tuesday. I will say that the staff did a great job running security during a loud, aggressive argument happening next door around 1:30 a.m. But I don't believe any of the reviews on here truly prepared me for the lack of sleep I got staying here. Perhaps I was on the wrong floor, but I was definitely disappointed (and tired) by the time we checked out."
9933886,69207655,2016-04-10,55755548,Olivia,Big and clean room and an en suite bathroom! Perfect for our trip :) Also there was a tank to refill the water bottle. Thanks!
9933886,71389887,2016-04-25,66058474,Lisl,"For a hostel, 40 Berkeley deserves 5 stars. But because it is on a scale with 5 star hotels... I had to give it 3. The building is pretty much an old renovated dorm with a big lobby, mezzanine, and courtyard area. There are 7 floors with dorm-like rooms. The bathrooms are shared like a dorm, but they are renovated & clean. As a young female traveling alone, I felt safe and accommodated. The location is great too as I was able to walk to Boston Common, multiple restaurants, and go for a 6mile jog around the Charles no problem. I highly recommend this hostel! It was less than $88 dollars total for a 24hr stay and they hold extra luggage at the front for free."

9933886,72156275,2016-05-01,5107849,Amanda,My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights in April 16.
The hostel is centrally located and cheap when compared with Boston hotel prices. There appears to be a shared bathroom on each hallway - on our floor this serviced 6/8 rooms. The hostel was clean and has everything we needed.,,,,,
The only downside was the temperature in our room. It was stifling and there was no thermostat in the room.,,,,,
"I would definitely recommend this hostel to those who like their accomadation cheap and cheerful.\"",,,,,
9933886,73911133,2016-05-11,6555095,Andrea,"Smooth check in, room as described, bathroom as described. Staff friendly and accommodating."
9933886,74511231,2016-05-15,56542128,Stephen,"The hostel was ideal - good value and great location. The room we had wasn't quite as nicely decorated as the one in the image but was nice enough for our short 4 night stay! Friendly staff and nice communal areas make for an ideal base to explore the city (20 minute walk max to the start of the Freedom Trail, 10 minute walk to Back Bay shops/Restaurants)"
9933886,75213731,2016-05-19,19043598,Shen,"Positives: I stayed in a comfortable, spacious full size room. It was the biggest on the floor and had its own ensuite bathroom which was great. The room was clean and amenities were good. Staff were quite helpful and a screen is displayed for flight information as well to find out tourist attractions."
"Negatives: Checkin time is quite late - usually after 3pm. If you arrive too early you have to store luggage in their locker room. The lobby staff and cleaning staff are slower in the mornings. Wifi can be patchy on the higher floors of the hostel. No breakfast or food served for guests - just coffee. If you want quick food in the morning go to seven/eleven across the road.\"",,,,,
9933886,76357822,2016-05-26,19400624,Cian,"Essentially a hostel, nice change from usual airbnbs. There is complementary coffee and tea in the morning, which is handy and free (I think) popcorn in the main area. Cool outdoor patio area, but no real cooking facilities if you want to make your own food."
9933886,79198506,2016-06-11,31043817,Keith,"As a Boston-area native who now lives elsewhere, I highly recommend 40 Berkeley to those trying to see the city on a budget. Somewhere between a dorm and a hostel, everything was clean and well-organized and the super-friendly staff made check-in and check-out easy. And you just can't beat the neighborhood, one of the nicest up and coming parts of town."

The rooms don't have a/c, but mine had both a ceiling fan and a desktop fan to keep me nice and cool in the july heat/humidity."

The hosts contacted us to let us know that there was no A/C before confirming the booking, which I thought was nice. Wifi, common areas, bag storage after check-out and 7-11 across the street for coffee were all great. Only 15 minute walk to Copley Square, where I had a conference, so very convenient."

His home is a very short walk from the red line (less than 5 min). The house itself is kept very clean. I was there for work, so I didn't have much opportunity to interact with Tim. But he was very accommodating, friendly and made sure my stay was comfortable."

Tim's roommate Edan is also very welcoming and helpful, he even leaded us to the subway station. Buddy is such a sweet dog, even my husband (he normally does not like any dogs) loves buddy.

His house is so clean, I felt like I was staying in a five star hotel. The room I stayed in was on the third floor,  had a large comfortable bed, with a desk, dressers, chair, and a thick shade over the window that could be pulled down, which I really appreciated because I wake up easily from any light in the room. I honestly slept like a baby and was able to get rested after my long flights. The bathroom is also just as clean as the rest of the house, which is always appreciated. His home is just a few minutes walk from the T, which was nice as I did not rent a car while in town and could get from his house to the metro in a few minutes.  There is Wi-Fi with a strong signal so I was able to do work in my bedroom with no problem.  I highly recommend Tim and his home, he is friendly, easy-going, and very welcoming."

Her place had everything we needed and was easily walkable to many tourist spots. Fair warning, it is in a nicer area of Boston so it's a little bit pricier for parking, but Quinn was very helpful in finding a garage that could hold our car for the night.

We were in Boston for 2 days and needed to be close to all the history & tourist activities,and boy Quinn's flat is close!! We walked almost everywhere & it is very close to public transport if you need to go out of the center of Boston,it's also ridiculously close to the Boston Common &  the Freedom Trail,as well as shops & restaurants.,,
The apartment is small,but the decor & furnishings are well chosen to make the apartment feel much bigger & get the most out of the space.  While we were there is was super hot & the air conditioning helped a great deal to keep the space nice & cool.  The flat met all of our needs nicely and was very clean & tidy on our arrival.,,,,
If you do have trouble with stairs - just be warned,the stairs up to the flat are no joke,but if you are ok with that,like us,you'll be fine:),
Quinn was amazing! Although she did not meet us personally,she was very prompt & made sure we had everything we needed to get in & out the flat,as well as access to the wi-fi etc,even though there were urgent family matters she was attending too at the time.  She had even left the air-con on for us,as she knew we would be so hot by the time we arrived:),

10426124,61106040,2016-01-31,55156591,Chris,"I had a wonderful time in Boston mostly because the accommodations were outstanding. Plus, the price was right! The host provided a very clean and quiet living area. The bed was surprisingly comfortable and the bathroom was modern.  I was also happy with the diversity of the neighborhood. I had a chose of West Indian, Spanish, Asian, Vegetarian, and American cuisine."
10426124,61927603,2016-02-09,55598255,Dawanna,"Kathy is an exceptional host! We LOVED every minute of our stay. It was hard to leave at the end. Spacious and beautifully appointed apartment, knowledgeable host, comfy bed, great pre-arrival instructions and easy access to transportation. The apartment and arrival details were just as described and better. This was the trip we wanted and more. We've stayed elsewhere on prior trips and paid more for less service, less space and a less appealing host. Everything here exceeded our expectations and we will definitely return again."
10426124,64975985,2016-03-09,10592713,Jason,Kathy was a wonderful host. She was extremely accommodating and the place was pristine. The convenience with regards to the train is top notch and the food down the block is fantastic. Highly recommend staying here!
10426124,65862231,2016-03-17,12867844,Ryan,"Kathy was both generous and thoughtful during our stay, a wonderful host. Whenever we needed some extra cooking utensils she brought them over in no time at all and was very active on the Airbnb chat when we had questions. She even brought us some extra juices to have in the fridge! The house was very spacious , close to the T and a few grocery stores for when we wanted to cook in the kitchen."
10426124,67451314,2016-03-29,21254810,Faiza,"Kathy was available all the time, always responding to our message."
It's very rustic,we had a cleaning problem and Kathy solved it. She is a good host.,,,,
The train is very close but he's passing only one time per hour,you don't have to miss the train!!,,,,
The place is very big,maybe too much for 2 persons for a group it's perfect.,,,,
If you like a place with history,"this is the place to be.\"",,,,
10426124,69688680,2016-04-12,247110,Xander,"We had a really nice stay at Kathy's house. It's huge, if sparsely furnished. It has what we needed, and even some fruit and bagels in the fridge, and coffee/coffee maker. Comfy bed, really nice shower. The best part is the 5 minute (or less) walk to the commuter rail. That train runs once an hour and stops running fairly early, but then it is only a $6, 10 minute Uber ride to the nearest T stop, making a great option for getting home after a late-ish night out. The T week long rail pass is valid for all of it, and highly recommended for getting around town."
We never met Kathy,but she was responsive to the few questions we had,and her directions and access to the house made arrival easy.  The surrounding area is largely residential,so we didn't explore much,and while Dorchester seems to have something of a bad reputation in some areas,I felt perfectly safe on the short walk from the train station

10426124,72075509,2016-04-30,17111075,Sonji,"Kathy's response time for communication was great.  I didn't meet her but she responded via email in a timely matter.  She provided yogurt, water, bagels and fruit upon my arrival, which was nice.  The neighborhood was quiet.  The home is a 7 min. walk to the commuter train station that takes you downtown.  I took that and a subway train and was happy I nixed getting a rental car.  I was in the bedroom pictured on the site and it was comfortable.  The internet service was spotty.  It took forever for one website to come up and wasn't able to watch videos on my laptop.  The home is a nice size and is great for 2 or more people.  Since I was there alone I could hear walking from the attached unit at night (people going up and down the stairs/opening and closing doors).  I am a light sleeper and if you are too, bring ear plugs.  Great place for sleeping and showering if you are going to be out all day."
10426124,73142789,2016-05-07,18437994,Marc,"Kathy is a very kind and helpful host! She communicated with us before the visit and during the visit, she was always spot on answering questions around how to get around, about the house and Boston. She also greated us directly when we got there and even bought us Milk and Coffee!"
It is a very nice house and very spacious and has everything you need! With the commuter train it is easy to get to Downtown Boston and it is very cheap! However keep in mind,the apartment is a bit far away from Boston and at night the commuter train does not travel frequently anymore. However an Uber from Downtown to the apartment is around 13 Dollar!,,,,
Apartment is very nice,just keep in mind it is a bit noisy. The heating system has constant noises and because of the wood structure,you hear people walking around. We got used to it,but it is worth mentioning for people that do not like noise. And the TV only has an antenna with bad reception,but you don't come to Boston for TV :-),
We do not regret that we stayed with Kathy! The apartment was priced right for what we got. If we ever come back to Boston,well based on the bad weather chances are we might not :-),"we would consider staying with Kathy again.\"",,,
10426124,78120695,2016-06-05,18931988,Daniel,Kathy was very helpful and answered all requests immediately via text. She greeted us there at 10:00 on a Friday evening and was very friendly and accommodating.  The house is minimal in decor but most every essential was available. If we were missing something (dish soap)   Kathy brought it down right away as she lives in the upstairs apartment. The house is much larger than I thought it would be and is a very old century home with plenty of character. Only a 15 minute drive to Fenway Park and downtown. 5 minute walk to the Franklin Zoo which I would highly recommend; especially with children. Overall a very pleasant experience.
10426124,79436636,2016-06-12,20493360,Steve,Kathy was a conscientious and friendly host who communicated well and made us feel welcome on arrival and throughout our 5-day stay.
The house (1st floor of an old 3-story Victorian house) was spacious,clean,comfortable,and tastefully decorated. We were not lacking for any amenities. Fair price for Boston lodgings. Wifi was appreciated. There was also DirecTV but we barely used it.,,

It was a comfortable place for the two of us but could accommodate several more. It's an old house and I liked the look of it. I would definitely stay there again.

The place itself was very clean and peaceful. I love the area that Daniel's studio is in; it's a 5 minute walk from the Prudential Center and Back Bay station, so it was very convenient getting to and around the city. It's also within walking distance to a variety of great restaurants and shops. Although I had no issues during my stay, knowing that Daniel was within proximity of the studio  in case anything unexpected came up was comforting."

The area is full of restaurants, is young, and is safe. We were able to walk everywhere, including downtown.

Apartment was absolutely wonderful, but the surrounding area wasn't the most comfortable; the first two floors were a little bit scary to get around, although we didn't have much trouble. Nice area, within walking distance to most places and close enough to multiple subway lines."
4574921,27991341,2015-03-16,24982676,Anthony,"Kimberly was very friendly. She gave me a ton of good information about the city. The flat was better than I expected. The location was great, right in the middle of the city and near a ton of historical sites. There are businesses on the first floor that close early so I never had an issue with them.  There is a Latin Club on the second floor which is open Fridays and Saturdays. I noticed the noise from the club only in the elevator and hallway once in the flat I could not hear a thing. Great place to stay while in Boston."
4574921,28221736,2015-03-20,20361337,Federico,Kimberly was very attentive! The place is incredible and you can't beat the location. Those beds gave me the best sleep i've had in years. Would definitely stay there again!
4574921,28302152,2015-03-22,21902549,Jeff,Listing was accurate and pictures reflect what you are getting.  Right next to Boston Common which was they key feature for us.  Host met us right on time to provide access and show the apartment.  Would rent again when we plan our annual trip to Boston.
Note:  We rented over weekend and host made us aware of nightclub noise.  We did hear the noise faintly while nightclub was operating,but had no problems sleeping through it.  If you are hyper-sensitive to noise,"take this into account for Fri / Sat night stay.\"",,,
4574921,28659712,2015-03-28,7594351,Ryan,Kimberly's apartment is a very nice place to stay and right next to Boston Common.  The living room is nice for hanging out after a long day.  The bed rooms are nice and cozy and having two bathrooms is icing on the cake.
South Station and a T stop are nearby making public transport easy to manage.,,,,,
Communication with Kimberly was smooth.  She went above and beyond to check us in early in the morning after our flight was cancelled and we had to take a bus in overnight.  She's definitely an AirBNB super host.,,,,,
As mentioned in the listing,there is some noise from the night club on the weekend,but for me,"it was not that bad and I was able to sleep with no problems.\"",,

4574921,29729643,2015-04-12,25401411,Erin,"The location was perfect for a great trip to Boston. Very centrally located. The host warned us that there was a night club in the basement, but it wasn't until we got there that we realized we had to walk through the nightclub entrance to get to the apartment. It was clean, but an older apartment.  The host was very responsive and we were able to easily get in and check out."
4574921,29980526,2015-04-15,6255003,Brian,"This place was good, but not great.   On the plus side the location was PERFECT!  right in the middle of everything and a quick 1-15 minute walk to pretty much every attraction in the city.  Seriously, perfect location.  Half a block from all subway lines too.   Also, the apartment was very spacious...surprisingly so for such a good location.   If you are under 25 and looking for a good weekend stay in the city stop reading right now and book this."
On the downside the building the apartment is was pretty run down.  The way you enter it is though a pretty dingy food court and the elevator and entryway were a little old/dirty (not Kim's fault obviously,just mentioning in case you are picky about that).   Apartment was missing some TLC furniture and decoration wise as well.  Just fair warning for anyone looking for high end accommodations,or those staying for an extended period of time.,,,
As far as the nightclub downstairs,"we didn't hear a peep.\"",,,,
4574921,30375408,2015-04-21,24799817,Ron,"The apartment was clean, as appeared in the listing and check in/check out was seamless;but that is not what you are reading this review for..."
The apartment is about 200 feet at most from east side of Boston Commons.  Not sure what you know about Boston,but this is pretty much the best location.  Yes,there was some noise from a night club on a lower floor,but nothing more then you hear at any hotel or standing anywhere in the City.. With a Kitchen,laundry,2 bedrooms and and living room area at an incredible price
4574921,31060443,2015-05-01,1101861,Nicole,"Great location! Check in and out was easy. Apartment had wifi, directTV, and was right above the best falafel place in Boston."
Other reviewers mentioned that there is a dance club in the basement of the building... It wasn't open on Weds night,but I definitely heard it on Thurs night. I was able to use a little white noise to drown it out so my 7 month old and I could sleep peacefully.,,,,

4574921,32671670,2015-05-20,23916384,Ed & Cheryl,"Great stay in Boston. Location is superb. One block from two T stations, grocery store, CVS pharmacy and Starbucks. Across street from Common. Could walk from Back Bay to Little  Italy."
4574921,33108417,2015-05-25,30942045,Jennifer,"Stayed here over the Memorial Day wknd and it was the best location! It was an easy walk from South station & basically across the street from the subway. The entrance itself seemed a little seedy but we felt safe. We never encountered the club on the lower floors but the noise was very minimal (it did not wake our 2 babies). The apt was spacious & the beds were super comfy. It was minimally decorated & fairly clean but probably not ideal for babies to crawl around. The biggest downside for us was the non-functioning elevators. It was tough to climb 5 narrow flights of stairs with 2 babies, 2 strollers & a pregnant lady. We were told it broke right before we arrived & that someone was working on it but we never saw this person."
4574921,33428249,2015-05-28,2038176,Steven,"Location was everything here.  Bordering Tremont and the Boston Common, within a half mile walk in one direction to Newbury St or in the other direction to Quincy Market, you can see everything without a car or cab."
The place was as described. It was great to be able to return and relax,cook dinner or watch TV.  The club that was described to be down below was either closed during our stay or they relocated,it was a non factor.  The beds were comfortable and it was great being able to do our laundry.  The Starbucks was 200 feet away,which was also nice.  There's  also a CVS,small grocery store,Macy's and many other retailers nearby if you need something.  We parked our car at a nearby garage.
Kimberly was out of town but a relative met us and showed us to the apartment.  The elevator was out the entire stay and I will say the 5 flights were a bit tiresome after walking about 6 miles a day throughout the city.  Hopefully it's fixed soon.  Other than that,we'd gladly stay there again.  It's the perfect base of operations for your stay,"and the hosts are very willing to ensure that they make hospitality a number one priority.  \"",,,

4574921,33767128,2015-06-01,12712144,Suzanne,This apartment is in a great location for seeing all of historic Boston. And it's very spacious.  Underground transit was just down the block and good shopping all around. Roche's grocery around the corner. So perfect for just about everything. Kim was easily accessible by phone and all went smoothly. Try the restaurant 49 Social just in  back of apartment at 49 Temple Place. Food is fabulous gourmet.
4574921,34556198,2015-06-09,33296277,Martha,"I lived in Back Bay for several years so when my family and I were coming to Boston, we wanted a place in the heart of the city where we could get anywhere easily.  This apartment is wonderfully located near the T, and within walking distance of most places we wanted to go.  The apartment was neat and clean and provided ample space for the five of us to hang out together but not trip over each other.  Kimberly was flexible about key pickup.  Guests should note that the street is pedestrian-only, so if you are driving in, be aware that your bags should be tote-able from your parking.  We loved our stay here."
4574921,34779490,2015-06-12,14142626,Kat,"Kimberly was a great host. She answered emails promptly, let me know about a potential elevator breakdown early on, and made easy arrangements for getting keys to the apartment. The apartment itself was as advertised. It felt spacious (especially after staying in a New York hotel room for a week) and had basic amenities to make it feel very comfortable. The best feature of the apartment was the location. It was close to public transportation and within walking distance to major sites. It was a little strange to walk through the mostly dead food court on the 1st floor and the elevator was a little shaky, but overall we enjoyed our stay."
4574921,35061431,2015-06-15,15941608,Verónica,"The apartment was as shown in the pictures. It was a little uncomfortable to get in the building at night since the night club people turned off all lights and you must get in line with the other people and then explain you are staying there. Get a lantern because the entrance is really dark. Despite this, the music is not heard from the apartment. The air conditioning almost didn't work (it didn't cool the apartment even being really low) so we had to open the windows. The beds were really confortable and both bathrooms are well equiped. Great location, just a few steps from Boston Common."
El apartamento es como se muestra en las fotos. Era un poco incómodo entrar al edificio en la noche porque la gente del club nocturno apaga todas las luces y debes hacer fila con las otras personas para luego explicar que te estás hospedando allí. Lleven linterna porque la entrada es realmente oscura. A pesar de esto,la música no se escucha desde el apartamento. El aire acondicionado casi no funcionaba (no enfriaba el apartamento incluso poniendolo muy bajo) así que tuvimos que abrir las ventanas. Las camas eran realmente cómodas y ambos baños están bien equipados. Excelente ubicación,"a pasos del Boston Common. \"",,,
4574921,35296598,2015-06-17,15464740,Alexandre,Big apartment and a great location. Would recommend it. Just the A/C was not working.
4574921,38110004,2015-07-13,27252352,Dave,"Kim met us at her apartment at the agreed time. Kim showed us through the apartment and answered any questions. The apartment was as describes and in a great location. The enterance was a bit weird, as you enter via a small empty shopping mall off WInter st and on the Saturday night a night club was running above our apartment and you had to skirt around the bouncers to enter the lifts. The place was clean and tidy plenty of room for two couples, nice bathrooms and comfy beds. The couple in the first room did hear a lot of noise from the nightclub above after midnight on the Saturday, but us in the second bedroom were not effected by the noise. The postion is its highlife as you are right on the Common amongst all the shops, on the edge of the Heritage Trail and about 10 minutes walk to the water."
4574921,38426177,2015-07-15,35552483,王敏,"ocation is very good in downtown commercial street, the room is very clean,"
4574921,38811214,2015-07-19,26431859,Christian,"Thank you to Kimberly and her fiancé for working with our schedule.  Our flight was delayed about and hour and it took us until 230 am to get to the apartment.  But instructions on how to get in were easy.  Neighborhood is a bit bad, but being from New Orleans nothing I haven't seen before.  As usual never walk around a city late at night alone.  Being that close to the heart of the city was amazing though."
4574921,39377300,2015-07-23,29732528,Victoria,"Although I did not meet her as she was out of town, Kimberly is very responsive especially through her fiance, Talal, who took excellent care of us during our stay. When we could not figure out how to work the tv/cable, he came over within minutes to resolve it. He was also kind enough to offer for us to use his printer instead of sending us to a FedEx location when we needed to print a couple of time-sensitive documents. He even sent a maintenance person to replace the dvd in the unit even though it was already late at night when we discovered it was not functioning. Much to the kids' delight they were able to watch the movie as planned! The a/c was in perfect condition. The unit is just as pictured and described. Awesome location! Thanks again to Talal for being an awesome proxy host!!"
4574921,39726320,2015-07-26,8651350,Nancee,We called Kimberly when we arrived at the address and she met us right away.  The apartment is just as it was described.  This is a VERY spacious apartment!  We were warned about the bars below the apartment and if you are in the first room closest to the entrance you can hear the noise but if you are in the bedroom closest to the living area you really don’t hear much.  Our friends that stayed in the noisy room put in ear plugs and said it was fine.  They even stated it was worth it for the location.  Both bathrooms are accessible from the hall not the bedroom/s.  I would recommend this apartment to my friends.
4574921,40078092,2015-07-28,2139619,Karmele,"Kimberly is a nicest AIRBNB host . She helped us in everythying we needed: welcoming us late afternoon by her friend. Her house is so well located in down town that we took part in many touristic activities like freedom trail, duck bus, etct.  I higly recommed this house because you feel like in a home away from home. Hope to welcome back!!! Karmele"
4574921,40555132,2015-08-01,24735722,Paul,"The location is amazing.  The apartment from the entrance of the elevator to the hallway to the apartment had an odor from industrial to marajuana.  The apartment was not properly cleaned.  There were hair in the shower, floors and dishware were dirty.  The kitchen contained one full size glass,barely any cookware and no toaster.  The air-conditioning was was unequally distributed as the first bedroom is super cold and the living room was warm. There was a foul odor thoroughout the apartment as basically the odor came from neglect. In the evening, the neighborhood wasn't safe.  Even in the daytime, there were people shouting outside."
4574921,41920440,2015-08-10,27050686,Phil,"The apartment is very central, it was fairly large, and the beds and bedings were clean and comftable."
However the apartment as a whole was in somewhat rough shape - such as large areas of water damage on the ceiling,and walls badly in need of paint.,,,,
In addition the apartment had been cleaned to a very low standard - with much dirt and grime in the corners,trim,refrigerator,and dishwasher,,
Worst of all the showers apparently had not been cleaned at all since the last guests and still had hair in them.,,,,,
"We ended up buying cleaning suppliies and cleaning up the apartment the first night we were there.\"",,,,,
4574921,42823180,2015-08-16,29409582,Arsh,"Great location and spacious! Walking distance to subway station and many Boston monuments. The apartment itself is simple, modern and pretty clean."
Loud on Fridays and Saturdays because of the club downstairs,we were usually so tired by the end of the day that it didn't bother us.,,,,
Overall,"would recommend this place!\"",,,,
4574921,43918467,2015-08-23,10548205,Shannon,"\"Kimberly's apartment is a great place to stay while enjoying Boston. Although the exterior raises some red flags (we were asked to call 9-1-1 for a man who allegedly overdosed a few storefronts down as we were waiting to be let in), the apartment itself is safe, attractive, spacious,  and overall wonderful. The location is also convenient to a number of downtown attractions (making the \"\"sketchiness\"\" referenced by other guests below somewhat inevitable). Our 3 couples slept comfortably here"
4574921,45233998,2015-09-01,6423560,Mitch,"The night club plays music you can hear on Friday & Saturday(till2am). Don't book on those days then write how you're upset about this. We expected it and bought ear plugs across the street at CVS and it was no problem. Kimberly was kind and prompt to return questions. She also had a lock fixed for us promptly which was nice. The location is great! We had so much fun accessing all parts of Boston from such a central location. DO NOT RENT A CAR!! Download Uber on your smartphone and you will be fine. Even the furthest place we had to travel (Newton) was only $20 versus paying to park for one night in that area was $35min. again, DO NOT RENT A CAR!!!  Both bathrooms were decent, no complaints there. I guess the only gripe we had was the linens in the closet were not folded and some were damp which made them smell mildewy... We made sure to ask Kimberly about the cleanliness of the place based off of recent reviews and she assured she was on top of it. When we arrived the place was very clean, thank you! Oh, on your way into the place and up the elevator it sorta smells and is shady but inside the apartment was nice and homey."
4574921,46577742,2015-09-12,2094772,Martin,I highly recommended this apartment. We visited on a work trip and needed a place that could comfortably accommodate three people in separate sleeping quarters and Kimberly's place fits the bill.
The apartment is in great condition once you're inside. To get to the apartment you have to walk through a small retail space with some eateries on the ground floor. It's not salubrious by any means but once you are in the apartment,it's great. We loved it.,,,,
It's centrally located so you can reach the whole city via the Park Street T-line station which is just across the road. For shopping,you are just down from the main shopping district with macys,gap and the new primark (if you care about retail).,,,
The lift (elevator) did break down on the first weekend we stayed but it was fixed with a couple of days. If you can't climb stairs,"keep this in mind as five floors can be quite a climb if you aren't up to it.\"",,,,
4574921,48160548,2015-09-24,19452291,Mark,Kimberly's apartment was a perfect home base for exploring Boston and the surrounding areas. There were multiple subway stations within 1 block of the apartment. It is literally steps away from Boston Commons on one end and multiple shopping/restaurant options on the other. You definitely don't need a car at this location. The location and inside of the apartment was everything we expected.
Kimberly was very quick in responding (5 minutes) to several messages we left her.,,,,,
Based on other reviews,"we knew the apartment was in an older building. Only real issue that we had with this was the apartment elevator was very rickety. The document in the elevator showed it was multiple months past due for inspection.   Kimberly is urged to push the building owner to get after the elevator inspection.\"",,,,
4574921,48498951,2015-09-27,8905731,Rick,"The location could not have been better. The apartment is comfortable,  has some upgrades and is great for a weekend getaway! The dance club is open until 2, but did not bother us."
4574921,49093656,2015-10-01,30073649,Jane,"Apartment is in a great location with easy walking to Faneuil Hall and lots of places to eat, drink and shop. We loved having all these things so close."
The entrance way is daunting as you have to walk past food outlets and a nightclub entrance to get to the elevator. It is also worth mentioning that the street is a pedestrian mall so taxis can't pull up out front and any luggage has to be carried from either end of the mall - it's not a long distance but helpful to know.,,,,,
We had everything we needed for preparation of basic meals in the kitchen eg. Boiling pasta but there was no toaster or kettle. The dishwasher didn't seem to heat so while it did wash it didn't actually clean the dishes and we had to hand wash everything. The laundry facilities were terrific,easy to use and convenient. Wifi was provided and much appreciated.,,,,
"Kimberly made sure there was someone ready to meet us as planned to collect keys and this went smoothly. Responses to emails were always quick and timely.\"",,,,,
4574921,49878104,2015-10-07,22686204,Paul,"I would not go back. Good location, but premises in poor condition, paint peeling from the ceiling in one bedroom, one shower not working properly & entry way elevator dirty. The host was a space case, texting incomplete information on entry procedures and not being timely in her responses. Fellow travelers...for the money, you can do better elsewhere!"
4574921,50148867,2015-10-09,45857195,Andrew,"The apartment is clean and comfortable, and Talal was great about being flexible to let us in when we arrived. By and large the location is central to everything in Boston, but the entrance to the building definitely left a bit to be desired. All in all, this a nice place that's conveniently close to restaurants, the Commons, and the T!"
4574921,51523138,2015-10-21,25567243,Jeannie,"Kim was out of town during our stay.  Communication was mainly through one phone call and texts with the property manager, Talal.  We arrived early from a red-eye flight.  Kim and Talal advised us to leave our luggage at a local market and we were grateful for the owner allowing us to leave our personal property with him."
Location of the apartment was ideal.  We were across from Boston Common and within a half mile from Quincy Market.  Park Street and Downtown Crossing were the closest train stations and the North End was a fifteen minute walk.  CVS was across the street and a nice market,Roche Bros was a five-minute walk for any necessary groceries.,,,,
The apartment was located in an older building on the fifth floor.  Kim advised two clubs were in the building,one in the basement and the other on the first floor. The music didn't bother us because we were so tired from walking all day.  Entry into the building was confusing because you entered the main doors into a small food court.  Once inside the food court was another keypad door leading to the elevator and stairwell.  One gripe was the unsteady elevator which was overdue for an inspection.  The elevator was broken 90% of the time.  Walking up steep steps to the fifth floor can be a nuisance and cumbersome if you're carrying your luggage or groceries.,,,,
The apartment itself was unkempt.  Paint was peeling off the ceiling in one of the bedrooms and the laundry room was a bit untidy.  We bought a few cleaning supplies to freshen up the place.  Overall,considering the location of the apartment,everything was good.  If I were to come back,"I may stay here again.\"",,
4574921,51947471,2015-10-25,14588306,David,We stated at Kimberly's apartment for 4 days and had a fantastic time. There were 4 of us and there was plenty of space - having two full bathrooms was great. Kitchen was large and seating area was plentiful. Beds are comfortable and plenty of storage. Also the location is central to everything and cannot be beat.
A few things to be aware of: The building entry is weird and at night you'll have to walk past a nightclub line and coat check. The elevator seems pretty dated and wasn't working until our last few hours of our stay so the 4-story stairwell was a bit of a pain. Fortunately we are all healthy but for those with children or difficulty moving,I'd look for somewhere with more reliable access.,,,,
"I would stay here again and will be recommending it to others looking to get out and enjoy Boston.\"",,,,,
4574921,52345744,2015-10-28,2101266,Julian,The apartment was fantastic. Very spacious and confortable. The entrance is kind of hidden but once you found it you´re done.
4574921,52568785,2015-10-31,34432245,Robyn,"The location was amazing for getting around Boston easily!  The apartment was very spacious and easy to find.  The furniture in the kitchen and living room was very modern and almost brand new and the kitchen was nicely updated.  It was great to have WiFi and the TV is nice. We did have a few problems though.  The apt could use a little TLC.  The furnace filter was caked with dust, the fire escape appeared unusable because of a padlock, the paint on the ceilings was peeling, the beds were too soft for two people to sleep in (found ourselves rolling towards the center), the fridge is dirty, the music from the nightclub below kept us awake on Friday night, the shower pan in the larger bathroom had a crack in it so we didn't dare use it, the shower curtain was moldy and the apt in was a little dirty (needed a good vacuuming). I don't know if I would trust using AirBnB again."
4574921,52857272,2015-11-02,36908452,Omar,The keys were handed promptly to us on arrival. The house was clean with plenty of towels and linen. The location was amazing.

Rebecca was super sweet and helpful the entire trip. I would highly recommend Rebecca and her place to anyone visiting the city!
4574921,67152152,2016-03-27,27927201,Farzana,"Rebecca was there to greet us, even though we came later than planned.  She worked around our schedule, and made sure we were comfy.  She also responds very quickly, so I didn't have much trouble getting in touch with her.  The house was very nice.  Everything was available to us, and there were extras of everything we may have needed.  There was a CVS across the street and a really good supermarket down the road.  The surrounding was quaint and we had access to 2 different train stations.  The only complaint I had was that during our stay, the elevator was broken, forcing us to walk up 5 flights of stairs, which was difficult with our bags.  Other than that, the experience was great!"
4574921,68329529,2016-04-04,55657637,Dana,"Rebecca was prompt in getting back to me with all of my questions. Our apartment was exactly what I expected. It was spacious, comfortable, clean. We were able to use the washer and dryer which was great. I would stay there again. It is local to everything. The building itself is odd, lots of activity in the bottom floor with people, food, phone repair, but it didn't matter. It was an excellent price and that was important to us. The nightclub you could hear, but, it was muted and it stopped around 2 and we all slept easily because it wasn't loud at all. The elevator is still out which we knew, and we were able to carry our luggage. Some people might have a challenge with that, but, again, it wasn't a problem for us."

All of the expected comfort items were their and even more so like small bottles of shampoo. The only con was the 5 flights of stairs, but it wasn't a problem for our group, others may need to be wary of this though."
"Overall it's an excellent choice and we'd do it again.\"",,,,,
4574921,71928991,2016-04-29,61570287,Ira,Rebecca was able to meet us out front with keys earlier than originally specified (traveled cross country) which was very convenient. The apartment was located on the fifth floor and the elevator does not work. The place was clean and appropriately furnished. No complaints. The bed I slept in had a comfortable eggshell foam mattress topper. I was able to do all my laundry in the washer/dryer before I left (nothing like returning with clean clothes). The location is amazing. It takes less than a minute to walk from the front door to the subway (Park St. Green Line). I also got a 20% discount at the owners restaurant which is located one street over (still overpriced though). Great experience overall.
4574921,72293395,2016-05-01,66589687,Joshua,Very pleasant experience. Would stay here again.

Con: Elevator does not work and we have to carry our 40 lb luggages up five floors.  Of the 7 days we stayed there,we saw no one working on the elevator.  The beds were not very comfortable,"they sag.  Pots and Pans were dirty so we didn't cook there.\"",,,

Grocery store (Roche Bros) just half block away.  We picked up some basic items for breakfast, etc.  Some great bars/pubs close by.  Only major drawback was the lack of an elevator (out of order).  Apartment is on 5th floor so that was a bit of a pain.  Just had to make sure we had what we needed when we started our day so we didn't have to walk back up.  Some may get \"\"weirded\"\" out by having to get to the apartment ( entering the building and walking by a couple small businesses to get to the stairwell) but that didn't bother us at all.  Apartment was clean and Wifi worked well for us.   Another drawback was the dance club in the basement that was open on Friday/Saturday nights.  The couple we were traveling with were in the bedroom closest to the entry and mentioned they could hear some music"

4574921,80053801,2016-06-15,67834743,Nancy,"We stayed in a nice 2 bed, 2 bath place hosted by Rebecca.  The location was perfect and the space was nice.  Rebecca was there to meet our group.  The main entrance to the building was VERY stinky, dirty and had people hanging out in the front stairwell.  The elevator DOES NOT work and the tight five flights of stairs smelled worse than the entry way.  The condo, however, was clean and smelled fresh :)  It had a lot of room and was ideal for two couples or a family traveling. It was a very good value for the location and would consider booking it again.  The location was so ideal.  We walked the city with ease and saw most of the major sites in Boston.  It was 15 minutes by foot to the North End, 10 Minutes to China Town and across the street from Boston Commons."
4574921,81218559,2016-06-21,4974495,Suzanne,"Great location, easy access.  Must know- 5 story walk up, be prepared. Winter St can be shady, lots of dudes loiter right outside the building.  We persevered, never felt unsafe. Music from the club didn't keep us awake on weekends."

Our family of four stayed here for a three day, whirlwind tour of all things Revolutionary War.  The apartment allowed us to walk or take public transit everywhere, saving us money on parking, not to mention the headache of driving.  The beds were comfortable and the apartment was clean and welcoming.  Despite being a downtown apartment, it is roomy and spacious. Rebecca was both accommodating and helpful, a delight to work with.  We would be happy to stay here again and again!"
4574921,84950113,2016-07-09,71938210,Karie,"We really enjoyed our stay in this apartment in Boston.  The location was perfect ... very central to everything.  It was so nice to come back after a busy day of touring and be able to relax in a more home-like atmosphere of the apartment vs going back to a small hotel room.  And the price is much better too!  Family room, dining area, 2 bedrooms (3 beds), 2 bathrooms, laundry, a full kitchen ... very nice.  The only negative was that the elevator was not working and there were 5 flights of stairs ... not an easy climb after a busy day."
Rebecca was wonderful to work with.  She was running a bit late with cleaning our space on the day of our arrival but still welcomed us to come in.  This turned out to be a good thing as she was able to answer questions we had (and help us figure out the TV).,,,,,

L'appartement est spatieux, propre, et très bien équipé. Mieux pour 4 que pour 6 personnes car on est mieux dans un vrai lit que dans un canapé-lit dans le salon, mais pour quelques nuits, ce n'est pas un problème. 2 critiques: l'ascenseur est en panne depuis des mois, et l'appartement est au 5ème étage, et l'air conditionné fait beaucoup de bruit."

Once found,we had to get our cases up 5 flights of stairs as the elevator is due to be fixed or replaced soon. This was a bit of a struggle and anyone with knee problems should check with Rebecca before booking to see if the elevator has been fixed.,,,,
The apartment itself is really lovely. It had everything we needed from a washing machine and tumble dryer to a hair dryer. It was very well kept and cleaned by Rebecca who was a lovely host and extremely helpful.,,,,,
Rebecca visited the apartment a few times to  help with issues we encountered such as me not finding the sofa bed very comfortable to sleep on. In that instance,she kindly lugged over a giant queen size inflatable mattress which was much better.,,,,
I can't commend her dedication enough.,,,,,
The location of the apartment was also excellent,being right next to Boston Common and on a pedestrian only shopping area.,,,,
It was also within about 10 mins walk of places like Fanuiel Hall and Quincy Market and other attractions like the Cheers bar.,,,,,
Overall,if the lack of elevator doesn't bother you,"this is a really great apartment and I'd happily stay there again.\"",,,
4574921,93395147,2016-08-12,60394038,Angela,The apartment was fine but access was difficult as the lift was out of order ( host advised out from January) It was a good central location in Boston
4574921,94093606,2016-08-14,53741275,Ian,"Ideal location, very helpful owner"
4574921,94777811,2016-08-17,77173276,Martin,Loved the location as it was close to everything we wanted to do.  The apartment was clean and spacious and suited our group so well.  We had all the amenities  we wanted and needed.  Rebecca was so helpful as she was there when we arrived.   She even provided an air mattress which was more comfortable than the pull out sofa.  A great location for a stay in Boston!
4574921,95225060,2016-08-18,19003992,Christina,"We had a very nice stay in Rebecca's place in Boston.  The place is well represented in the pictures and the description, it's very centrally located (yet not loud which is great given its location), and our host was very communicative and responsive. The only downside was that the elevator to the building is not working and a 5th floor walk up is a lot with luggage."
4574921,95514246,2016-08-20,83091805,Renee,This was our first time using AirBnB and we were very happy with our choice.  The location was great with the green line access right outside the apt.  The beds were extremely comfortable and  Rebecca was easily reached and her response was quick to our questions.
4574921,96043041,2016-08-21,64366664,Rachel,"Great location and really nice apartment.  Rebecca was so accommodating with our late arrival, so we really appreciated it. Would definitely stay there again when back in Boston!"

9755993,58958573,2016-01-05,6196044,Jackie,"Julie's studio was a perfect weekend getaway in the heart of Beacon Hill. Julie was very accommodating, providing excellent communication, information and recommendations. Julie provided detailed information on her place including parking, restaurants, public transportation and sights to see. We were able to explore Boston from a comfortable home base and greatly enjoyed our weekend stay. Julie was quick with her responses and a wonderful host. Julie's studio was just the right size for a couple and we felt right at home. We can't recommend her place enough!"
9755993,59383566,2016-01-10,14709650,Anna,"Julie was a great host and her place was in an amazing location. She had absolutely everything we needed in her apartment, and it was adorable to boot - exactly like the photos. It was also one of the cleanest air B&Bs I've ever stayed in! We loved being in Beacon Hill and being so close to the T was also really convenient. It was very easy to communicate with Julie and we would definitely stay at her place again in a heartbeat. Thanks Julie!"
9755993,65586574,2016-03-15,36170693,Christine,"Julie was a wonderful host! She made our stay in Boston so welcoming and easy. The location is close to everything. You can choose to walk or take the transit right next to her apartment. Julie also had clear directions to get to her place, free wifi, and bath towels. It is the perfect place to stay for two people. I would definitely recommend to stay at her place! Thank you, Julie!"

9755993,92887196,2016-08-10,82749133,Amanda,"We really can't say enough good things about Julie and her place! We had such a wonderful time in Boston, and it was mostly because of our stay here."
From the moment I requested the reservation Julie was excellent with responding and communicating. The check in details and house details were all provided and very clear. We got lost looking for the apartment initially,and Julie responded immediately to help! It was easy to find after speaking with her.,,,,
The location was perfect! Right in the heart of Beautiful and historic Beacon Hill. We walked everywhere from her place,everyday. The neighborhood is safe,friendly,immaculate,and has everything you need for daily living. The Commons are only a few blocks walk away,as is the original Cheers!
We found cheap parking in a garage in Cambridge,right over the Charles river (20 min walk) for a couple nights,and then we were lucky enough to find one free parking spot a few blocks from the apartment and just left the car there the rest of our stay!,,,
The apartment itself was exactly how she described! Gorgeously decorated,very clean,and Julie is such an excellent host that she has thought of everything you could possibly need and provided it! We were also able to do laundry,and have our morning coffee on the fabulous rooftop deck looking out at the Charles river.,,
We were here for a long stay for both business and a little vacation,and this place was perfect for both. We could function as if we would normally throughout the day,and then throw in lots of relaxing and sightseeing in Boston. We did it all! I strongly suggest also exploring the history of the area. It is so incredible! So much of our nation was shaped here,and Boston is rich in it's knowledge of that history,and proud of it.,
I highly recommend Julie's place.. It is wonderful,"and she is the ultimate host! 10 stars all the way ;-) Thank you Julie! \"",,,,

6887926,38068027,2015-07-12,15149635,Ernest,The host was very good at communicating with me ahead of my stay. I arrived very late and she had someone waiting for me to open the door and let me and my girlfriend into the room.
The listing or shall I say the picture was very accurate. The room was not. It had a strong odor of some insect repellant. The room is very basic with a desk,bed and small night stand. The bathroom is a shared one with other units. It's not that clean.,,,,
The most disappointing part of the stay is the bed. The blankets were not clean and sheets had hair and lint all over them. The bed made so much noise it was hard to get any sleep. We stayed one night and had to cancel the rest of the 3days.,,,,,
"I am sorry but I would not recommend this place unless everything is fixed. \"",,,,,
6887926,43208212,2015-08-17,36040205,Lucas,The host canceled this reservation 20 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6887926,44167806,2015-08-24,10675869,Stella,"This place is extremely well located. It's really 2 min from the red line, which connects you to many nice places in Boston. So, if you are going to stay here for a short time, and only for sleeping, this should be good. Now the down points.. There's no AC, and if there's a fan available, it's really noisy. The bed is also noisy, when you switch sides you'll hear that. The kitchen has many utilities you can use, but it's kind of dirty. Same works for the bathroom... The shower is okay, but we stayed there for a week and it was never really cleaned. Still, for few days and a short time in the house, it's an okay price with a very good location."
10747524,65290684,2016-03-12,4714181,Goga,"Both, host and hostess are extremely friendly. Children are simply adorable."
They made every effort to accommodate me since the first day.,,,,,

10747524,65411228,2016-03-13,61116369,Tess,"The house and the room look exactly like the pictures, modest and simple. Gaurav and his family are very inviting and helpful with suggestions towards exploring the city. Although he was out of town for a majority of my stay, he was readily available at his cell. Very conveniently located and easy access to the house itself! A nice walk to the Harvard area. An even shorter walk to the Brighton area, very urbanized and includes a diverse array of cuisine and people. There's a lot to do in the immediate vicinity and easy to go elsewhere. Had a great stay!"
10747524,67250482,2016-03-27,62688114,Javier,"Gaurav and their family are great, very friendly, they made us felt like at home. The room is confortable, in a nice area. Perfect."

10747524,72633054,2016-05-04,62632476,Adam,Gaurav and is family were more accommodating hosts than any nice hotel I have ever stayed in. They accommodated a very late arrival and even provided a light snack with water in the room and breakfast in the morning.  I cannot thank them enough for their hospitality and great conversations.
10747524,74128471,2016-05-13,69333766,Manpreet,Gaurav has been a good host. We really felt at home..

10747524,75067996,2016-05-18,51976706,Milind,gaurav and his wife are an excellent host and their house is the perfect place to spend time near the Harvard university area. The hosts unlike others on airbnb make the guests feel welcomed and constantly chat with them everyday. I would most certainly recommend their property to everyone looking for a place in and around this area. all the best gaurav! you're a nice guy! thanks once again!!
10747524,75315326,2016-05-20,50042132,Cash,"Gaurav's home was just like the description. Him and his wife were very kind and welcoming, they're located in a nice area about 10 mins from public transportation! It was clean, checking in was smooth, I have to say I have no complaints"

10747524,79152723,2016-06-11,12836506,Lena,"Guarav has a very friendly and welcoming family. His kids are cute and they do not make too much noise.  The room is located on a separate floor and provides privacy. Very clean and well equipped. The amenities are of high quality and you have a private bathroom!The house is a little bit far from HBS - 20-25 min walking distance, but there is convenient public transport every 20 min.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the place!"
10747524,80412018,2016-06-18,71540003,James,Gaurav and his family were great - and their two children are adorable. Each time I saw their son he was dressed as a different superhero - so cute. They made me feel right at home. My only regret is that I did not have more time to visit - but that was dictated by my meeting schedule. The walk to Boston University was a pleasant 35 minutes - exactly what I wanted to get my day started. The bed was comfortable and I slept like a log. It is always wonderful meeting young families and hearing a bit about their life experiences. I would recommend them to my friends and family.

Highly recommended and I would absolutely stay again if I ever ship up to Boston!"

Also, he has a city guide booklet in the room."

The location is perfect, you don't get stuck in Boston downtown traffic and yet you are a 10-12 minutes drive away from everything. We uber pooled everywhere and it was 10x cheaper than renting a car (which is very expensive when combined with parking fees Boston)."
The room and the bathroom are on the second floor so you pretty much have an entire floor to yourself. It worked really well for us because we had a lot of late nights because of a wedding we were in town for. The bedroom is clean and has a wardrobe. The bathroom is small but clean.,,,,,

Laura checked in ( via email) to make sure everything was ok- a very nice and personal touch. Whilst I did not need any help I got the impression they would have happily sorted out any small problems.,,,,,
I've not done Air B'n'B before but I would describe the experience akin to going to a friends house in a city whilst they were away. Its not a soulless hotel room. The flat had everything I needed (including an Iron) and had character and charm.,,,,,
The use of the computer and the good reliable wifi was fantastic. I was able to Facetime family back at home without any problems.,,,,,

Laura was very accommodating and helpful, giving us good, accurate information about how to access the house and about nearby restaurants and shops in the neighborhood. JP was such a lovely neighborhood to stay in. The arboretum across the street was a great way to spend a morning. I would wholeheartedly recommend Laura's home, and I will be calling her first the next time we plan a trip to Boston.

5405928,85686701,2016-07-12,8996060,Louis,Seems as if since I didn't make the reservation directly it is not letting me do an evaluation. I think you would have to do it if you feel like it. I'd give it a fairly good review as I wasn't really bothered by it being a bit run down and I liked the homey feel and the toys for the kids.
Negatives would be the traffic noise from the main road and the lack of a coffee maker. I respect that they don't make coffee themselves but they might have a cheap one on hand just for their coffee craving guests.,,,,,

Laura was very accomodating as we were travelling with a new born and a 5 year old. She had a parknplay set up for our new born and even a swing! Laura found out just before we got there that some contruction work was to start during our stay. She was straightforward about it and very flexible.

Ted and Jen were quick to respond and very thoughtful. It was also surprisingly quiet most of the time,despite the fact that this is a basement-level apartment. I certainly appreciated the proximity to delicious eateries like Flour Bakery,and the easy walkability of the neighborhood.,,,

Such an amazing place and so much space.  Everything had directions and was very easy to figure out.  I hope to stay here again when I am back in Boston.
10083878,72987416,2016-05-06,66370379,Ed,"Had a great time staying at Ted & Jen's place. The flat is huge and really well-equipped with a good sized kitchen, lounge and gym/fitness area in an open plan layout. We never met Ted or Jen but correspondence was quick and easy, with access really straightforward and we'll explained. Jen's welcome folder gave us loads of good tips on local restaurants to try, and having followed these tips we can vouch for their quality! There was a bit of noise from upstairs, but this is to be expected in a flat set-up and we were given fair warning. All in all, had a great time and would recommend others to stay here."
10083878,73745233,2016-05-09,2851560,Esther,"Ted and Jen were very helpful with our booking and allowed us to book early on our arrival day.  We met Ted for a few minutes when we first arrived and then never saw him and Jen for the balance of the weekend. We had a cell number to contact them for any issues, but we did not need to call them. The SoWa area is great and public transportation was very convenient. The description of the apartment was accurate, except it didn't really let you know how dark the apartment is... and we had no sun during our stay and so that did not help! The kitchen was well equipped. Water pressure in the shower was good. The plumbing waste line is exposed and runs along the wall behind the head of the bed. The apartment is lower than ground level and we could hear the machinery chewing up the waste and the sound of the waste being pumped thru to the sewer. The price of the apartment was quite reasonable for the area. So there were good things about the rental and I think that with a little effort Ted and Jen could improve the rental experience."
10083878,74705326,2016-05-16,65932864,Emily,"Ted and Jen were awesome!  SO hospitable and available if we may have needed ANYTHING - but they also respected our privacy.  It was a perfect balance and we felt very comfortable!  The apartment was just as described, if not better!  It was massive, unique, clean, cool, and also the perfect amount of cozy. The outdoor space was an awesome bonus! It had everything we could have needed (including a treadmill!) and we were very happy there. LOVE the south end of boston.  We used to live there and wanted to be in the area so were SO excited to find this apartment. Some of the best restaurants in the city are LITERALLY next door to this spot. As well as parks, Flour bakery and coffee spot, walgreens, grocery store, and all sorts of amenities within less than 3 blocks.  It is not super close to the T underground, but the silver line bus line is right there, and its definitely walking distance from T access. Plus it is the BEST neighborhood to explore in the city, in my opinion."
10083878,75273525,2016-05-20,25518850,Kayla,"This AirBnB was amazingly beautiful. From the brick walls to the stunning back patio, this place was perfect. The location is very nice, close to a lot of good restaurants and cafes! The place was clean and felt so homey to us, it was like we never left home. Jen was very helpful with getting access to the AirBnB and the instructions on how to achieve the key were very simple. Also loved the information binder they leave out."
10083878,75601594,2016-05-22,14902976,Mary Ann,"Great time in Boston this last weekend.  We were up to help our son move and looked for a place near his apartment where we could walk over to help, and easily go back and forth to take breaks and relax.  Jen and Ted’s very cool (and huge!) condo really fit the bill and is highly recommended!   Fantastic location in the South End, comfortable, roomy space, with thoughtful attention to detail and lots of personal amenities (hairdryer, toiletries, etc.) along with a very functional kitchen with everything you’d need to eat in as much as you’d like.   Weather was great so the outdoor patio was also a bonus.  Such a great space - I’m sorry we didn’t have time to have my son and his girlfriend over for dinner!     Arriving late after bad traffic delays, we especially appreciated the unexpected, thoughtful extras that Jen had left for us, including popcorn, fruit, yogurt, wine and beer.    Jen was a super communicator, texted me frequently and provided a book with suggestions of things-to-do and restaurants in the area.    Follow her suggestions!  We did make it to Flour Bakery — definitely recommended — but missed Toro because of a private party.     Next time!"
10083878,77193098,2016-05-30,485935,David,"Wow!  A gem.  This was a wonderful setting. The hosts were spectacular and all detail was provided so the pictures do justice to the bnb.  We had a very comfortable bed (sleep was great), the kitchen was very nice and we cooked and ate all our breakfasts there.  Coffee pot with thermos was huge.  Bathroom well set up. Things were set up very well with lots of recommendations on what to do, where to go and where to eat. Easy to get places with a great neighborhood.  Walked to Fenway from there.  Went downtown. Went to Cambridge and north end.  Hit some flea markets. I would and do recommend this to anyone wanting to stay in Boston for business or pleasure.  Jen and Ted were excellent hosts."
10083878,77995076,2016-06-05,70985649,Paige,"Jen and Ted's place was great! It was so cute and comfy in the inside. They had a basket of snacks and coffee there when we arrived, plus some cold drinks waiting in the fridge! The condo is located in walking distance of so many great places to eat and fun things to see, plus they leave a binder full of helpful hints and tips! We felt very safe and at home there. The only place I will stay if we visit Boston again!"
10083878,78740180,2016-06-08,42589209,Patti,"As mentioned in previous reviews, Jen and family went above and beyond to make our stay such a positive experience. The property is super clean, spacious, comfortable and just beautiful! I can only hope it is available for our future trips to Boston."
10083878,79100625,2016-06-11,73018841,Jasen,"I can't say enough nice things about our stay here. Jen couldn't of made us feel more at home. She was very attentive, personable, genuine, and informative. The space is nothing short of awesome! Very clean! Great neighborhood and location! If you have an opportunity to book this space, don't hesitate! This was the first trip to Boston for my brother, father, and I. We were all blown away by the hospitality and accommodations. We had a wonderful time here. Great place to come home to at the end of the day. Big thank you to Jen and Ted for accepting our request to stay!"
10083878,79726690,2016-06-13,62047018,John,The apartment was indeed huge and in a nice area with many restaurants to choose from. Jen checked in with me and made sure that everything was in order. Obtaining the key and access to the room was easy. A binder gave clear instructions to all the apartments amenities and directions to favorite restaurants. I would stay at the apartment again next time I'm in Boston.
"\"",,,,,
10083878,80095349,2016-06-16,71324377,Ashley,"Jen's apartment is lovely! It is spacious, comfortable, and inviting!  Jen truly went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and to ensure that we enjoyed every aspect of our time in Boston. The location is very safe and quiet but still within a short walking distance of everything Boston has to offer. If I am ever in Boston again this will be my first choice and I highly recommend it to anyone."
10083878,80822567,2016-06-19,7779339,Robin,"I doubt there is a better space in Boston, factoring space, amenities, location, and cost. The hosts truly go above and beyond to ensure you have what you need. Most of the amenities you might need (and some you don't realize you need until you arrive) are already there. The hosts have clearly gone to a lot of effort to please the guests."
Everything is exactly as the pictures show. You basically have the entire basement to yourself,including full kitchen,dining areas,full desk,living room,bedroom
10083878,83360268,2016-07-02,70039709,Victoria,"We spent seven nights here in June, and we had a terrific time. Jen is a wonderful host who was so accommodating to our family and responsive to our questions, before and during our stay.  You will find that the large, cool space is exactly like it's described and pictured here.  We enjoyed walking to the many good restaurants in this South End neighborhood that Jen recommended, and we opted to use the nearby bus stops for most of our travel around Boston.  The close proximity of the bus stops, Foodie's Market, and drug store were big pluses for us.  As this listing clearly states, it's a basement space, but they have installed plenty of lighting, and there are several big windows with blinds if you want -- or don't want -- more light.  Jen's family lives above this space, so you may hear some movement in the morning, as you might at a hotel.  We especially liked how the large space allowed room for several separate and distinct spaces for eating, sleeping, watching TV -- it should be noted the kitchen/dining space is very spacious by Airbnb standards!  We really enjoyed our stay here, and we appreciated Jen's hard work, hospitality and personal touches that made us feel very welcome."
10083878,84069342,2016-07-05,19843338,Lauren,"Although I did not meet Jen, she was warm and friendly (and highly communicative) via text. Entering the apt was a breeze, location was prime. The space was HUGE as described and her patio was beautiful. The space was clean and comfortable. It was everything we needed and more. Jen even left us a nice array of breakfast basics, snacks and even a couple of beers. Would Highly Recommend!!"
10083878,85879370,2016-07-13,9976473,Maureen,"We had a fantastic stay at Jen and Ted's home in the south end. The space was lovely and extremely clean.  The furnishings were attractive and the exposed brick and windows The beds were very comfortable, linens were new and crisp and there were plenty of fresh plush towels for our family of four. Jen went out of her way to make us feel welcome with wine, beer, coffee, fresh fruit, juices and even home made  granola and snacks. When she learned we were going to the science museum she generously offered us her membership card for our use.  We highly recommend Jen and Ted's."
10083878,86436099,2016-07-16,80145219,Marissa,"We're so glad we found this location! The apartment is huge (seriously, huge), beautiful, and very cozy - plus, it's in a great neighborhood with lots of great food choices. Jen was very kind and accommodating, making sure to check in with us to see that we had everything we needed both before we arrived and while we were there. Absolutely would recommend, and would definitely go again!"
10083878,87557883,2016-07-20,35432564,Arantxa,"Our stay with Jen was wonderful! Their studio space is huge and so comfy. Jen is also so helpful if you have any questions and she has a binder with tons of recommendations for local restaurants and useful businesses. The unit itself is in a great area of the city and right across the street from a bus stop, making it really easy to get around town. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks for everything, Jen!"
10083878,89308145,2016-07-27,67813526,Shannon,"Jen and Ted are gracious hosts.  They offered great recommendations of places to eat and visit.  Jen is readily available to answer questions, and eager to ensure you have all that you need for a fabulous visit.  Our travels had us arriving early and leaving late  -  Jen was very accommodating to our luggage and travel needs.  The silver line bus system conveniently has a stop at the corner of their building.  We mentioned we like to prepare our own breakfast in the morning and she provided us with some incredible Orange Juice.  This is a very nice, comfortable and convenient place to stay!"
10083878,90618511,2016-08-01,3652513,Maram,This is a very charming condo in a great location (South End Boston) with tons of delicious restaurants around. Jen and Ted were extremely hospitable and made our stay very comfortable. The space is massive and has everything you could possibly need. Truly a hidden gem. Will book again next time we're in Boston!
10083878,91457556,2016-08-05,8872986,Justin,Great location and host communication. Listing is exactly as described and was perfect for my business travel. Extra kudos to the lighting designer and Jen's culinary recommendations.
10083878,92135928,2016-08-07,43203085,Gillian,Jen and Ted did such an amazing job making us feel at home.  They were on top of everything and helped tremendously with parking and getting into the unit.  Arriving to snacks and drinks (which were definitely necessary) after 7 hours of driving was a great surprise.  They definitely have one of best spots in all of Boston and the pictures do not do it justice.  We would absolutely book this place again and recommend it to anyone staying in the Boston area.  We were definitely spoiled with this condo and location!
10083878,93389410,2016-08-12,68815050,Jonathan,"Appartement bien situé , très grand."
10083878,95136198,2016-08-18,8031451,Janice,Exactly as described - what an awesome space.  Jen and Ted are great hosts.  Couldn't have asked for a better place to land for a few days!

5706985,45636089,2015-09-04,9607062,Nikki,"The place is a nice setup, the area isn't bad and the process with Juliet was smooth. The area is accessible to the city either by the commuter rail a few minutes from there, where you can park at the station for $4, or you can go a few more minutes to the end of the orange line and also park there."
The neighbors were up late one of the nights but otherwise it's a very quiet neighborhood,almost too quiet.,,,,
This is a basement unit with cement floors,no,,,,
A/c but 2 ceiling fans and a few open windows but it does get stuffy down there so the fans are great for that.,,,,,
It's keypad access so no key,owner has access whenever and I could tell she had been there every day I was there,"however I was the first renter and she was still setting things up like the TV. I never actually met or seen her in person.  \"",,,
5706985,46084775,2015-09-07,25098232,Christine,"The studio is on the ground floor, and it's spacious with a very comfortable king bed."
5706985,46677459,2015-09-12,10877337,Elliott,Great place. Super comfy. Thanks again Juliet !
5706985,47443016,2015-09-18,14861614,Rudy,Juliet's place was as described. It situated in a nice hill overlooking Boston and the neighborhood was nice. I had the chance to live in that area before and it is not too far from
The city center 18-25 from Downton Boston by train,,,,,
Check-in was very easy my communication with the host was brisk and we had our complete privacy.,,,,,
"I definitely recommend a stay there\"",,,,,
5706985,48221251,2015-09-24,40080048,Courtney,"Great place! We were close enough to the city but in a quiet neighborhood. The host had everything we needed and was very communicative. Cute studio, lots of room, very clean. Would recommend!"
5706985,48484858,2015-09-26,15545079,Katy,"Thanks so much to Juliet. Her place is super clean and very comfortable. I was able to park in the street directly in front of her house, which made things really easy. Recommend and I would stay again."
5706985,48578649,2015-09-27,43340552,Tom,The room was exactly as listed.  Very clean.  Very comfortable.  Neighborhood was very quiet.  Easy parking on the street.  TV worked just fine.  Kitchen appliances were just fine.  We will stay here on our next visit.
5706985,49175560,2015-10-01,44952781,Roberta,"For the reasons we needed a place like Juliet's - conveniently located close to our Boston relatives,  comfortable amount of space, and our preference for privacy, this place fit the bill exactly. We found it to be exceptionally clean and comfortable, especially the bed. It is obvious the space has been recently renovated - bathroom and kitchen areas are all new and tasteful. We would not hesitate to stay here again."
5706985,50326977,2015-10-11,43284241,Renee,"The apartment was very cozy and clean and a great place to stay so close to Roslindale Square. It had easy access to the local bus routes and T Station, and was in a quiet, safe neighborhood where I felt very comfortable. I liked that I didn't need a key to get in, so there was no chance of getting locked out! The bed was super comfortable, the apartment was very clean, and overall I it felt very homey. Juliet is a great host and makes sure you get in/out ok and leaves everything you need, including slippers! Very cute! Thanks for a great AirBnb experience!"
5706985,50478969,2015-10-12,14154588,Richard,The host canceled this reservation 43 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

Both the bed and futon were extremely comfortable. Juliet was wonderful in making suggestions for dining out. Great restaurants were walking distance away. I would definitely stay here again."
5706985,63770745,2016-02-26,48896613,Darwin,Juliet's place was great super clean nice quiet area Juliet was a great host a deff recommended place to stay

5706985,67244583,2016-03-27,61573268,Bess,The studio was immaculate. The host's
policies were clearly presented to us in numerous notes. My husband and I thought the location was perfect. Our family lives a very short five minutes away. Parking was very easy. The only criticism we have is regarding the noise level on the upper floors.  When we stayed in the studio there was a family with children renting the house,,,,,
above. There were actually two families staying and the noise level prevented us from having a night's sleep. We had spoken with Juliet about the interruption of our sleep through the entire night and the next night seemed to be much better.,,,,,
The only other criticism I had was the very cold concrete floor. My suggestion would be to have area carpets over the concrete floor.,,,,,
"Juliet was very accommodating as a wonderful host and did everything she could to help with our situation regarding the noise level from the renters in the house above. \"",,,,,
5706985,68607006,2016-04-05,62229651,Jonathan,"Juliet's place was fantastic! It was precisely described and well set up. and The weather over the weekend was terribly cold, however is was nice and toasty in her apartment. She was even kind enough to make accommodations to me stay times. I would stay here again in a heartbeat"
5706985,70241522,2016-04-17,62100848,Heather,"We stayed in the studio and it was very nice. Well appointed, clean, even a washer and dryer if needed! Juliet is a wonderful host, and this is a safe neighborhood and easy (free) on-street parking. Thank you!"

very easy to get into the studio and when I entered,there were clear directions how to use the thermostat,etc.,,,
I loved the quietness and cleanliness of the space.  the bed was very comfortable.  I would stay there again,no question.,,,,
"thanks for the hospitality!\"",,,,,
5706985,71944737,2016-04-30,48896613,Darwin,Second time staying at Juliet's place and it was perfect very comfortable deff recommended to everyone in the boston area
5706985,74007825,2016-05-12,43444144,Stacie,"\"Juliet made sure to contact us the day before to confirm our arrival, provide the security code, and make sure things were in order for our arrival.  She was always quick to respond, ensuring her availability.  We made our way from the Seaport district a little before 3p and it took us 40 mins to get to the airbnb (rush hour traffic).  You definitely get a peek at the residential environment on the drive over.  Upon arrival, you'll see that the space is indeed a basement studio.  The couch seen in the pictures flattens into a bed.  The \"\"3/4 wall\"\" between the bed and couch is really just a large cabinet.  The room is drafty when we first entered"
5706985,74124744,2016-05-13,5568180,Anne,"Nice, well-equipped apartment in a quiet neighborhood. This is a basement apartment, and sound definitely travels from upstairs, so just be aware."
5706985,74384085,2016-05-15,65791981,Hannah,"We had a good experience staying at Juliet's studio. She is very detail-oriented and had lots of information around the place to make sure we had a great time. The place was neat and clean when we entered and parking was plentiful. Our only annoyance was that you could hear everything going on by the people renting out the upstairs, including waking up to a child running around at 7 in the morning. We knew that there would be people upstairs going into it so it wasn't a surprise, but just want anyone renting the studio out to be aware. Overall, Juliet was a great host and I would recommend to a single traveler or couple looking to stay in the area as it is much cheaper than the hotels!"
5706985,75696717,2016-05-22,61119287,Anna,"The apartment was very nice and comfortable, and the area in which it was located was good for walking around/grabbing a drink in the evenings. It is also conveniently located for using public transit to get around the city. As the posting notes, the footsteps upstairs are definitely noticeable at night. All around, a very good experience."
5706985,76233049,2016-05-25,3295465,Cherie,"Despite having a family emergency, Juliet was able to get all the info for me to get into her place. Was pretty exhausted from trekking from the train at South Station to taking the T, then a bus, then walking. Definitely not right by the city if you don't have a car, so keep that in mind. I wanted to pass right out on the bed, but Juliet assured me that she'd have the bed made later on in the day and she did. At least, there was a couch for me to sprawl out on in the meantime. I love the charming Alice and Wonderland door. There are a lot of rules, so if you are forgetful then this isn't the place for you. At first, I didn't understand that the door had to be locked a certain way from the outside, but once I did I got it down pack. Would be nice if just closing the door would automatically lock it though since there's a code and not a key to unlock/lock it. This place is cozy and comfortable, but got a bit chilly at night for me. There is heating, which is great, it just takes a bit to feel it if you are on the couch. My trip was to catch up with an old college roommate and get some much needed rest. I slept in late a couple of times and unfortunately you can definitely hear people walking upstairs, so that kind of became my natural alarm clock. If I'm looking for a place to just hang my hat and relax while in Boston, then this is definitely a good candidate. I didn't feel like renting a car, but if you do then at least there's free parking at the place, which was convenient for my friend who lives in MA. Love everything Juliet did to make this place feel homey with the bathroom, kitchenette and private bedroom area. Just as a note for anyone else like me who has to catch a flight in the middle of the night and not when public transportation is running, it's about a $40 cab ride to the airport. Juliet is a good host, who is very organized, and this is not your average airbnb."
5706985,76460627,2016-05-27,66649423,Kody,"\"The listing was exactly as described!  Nice efficacy that meets basic needs. Juliet had a very nice book to look through with very helpful information for persons not familiar with Boston!  Very easy to get into Boston once you learn the route.  A 7 minute car ride to the train station and then you can take the train \"\"the T\"\"  to downtown.\""
5706985,77162575,2016-05-30,53965997,Courtney,"Juliet's studio was perfect for my and my boyfriend's weekend in Boston. She made the whole process incredibly stress-free, and everything we needed was waiting for us when we arrived. The location is a bit far from the subway, but I'd recommend the 25 walk to the subway through the Harvard Arboretum (just gorgeous!) during the daytime, and note that  the location was very accessible by uber at all hours. The neighborhood was really lovely and we feel for some of the local spots (Fonax bakery and Boston Cheese Cellar in particular!)"
5706985,78176062,2016-06-05,67003850,Margarita,Juliet's place was really nice and fulfilled our needs to the fullest. We have found everything what we needed and enjoyed our stay.
5706985,79986051,2016-06-15,3374501,Jason,The space of the basement apartment was very large and everything that I needed was there. Juliet was very easy to contact and very helpful throughout. The only slight negative was that if anyone stays upstairs it can sound very loud. This didn't detract from my stay personally but anyone who is a light sleeper may have issue.
"The area is nice and surburban and doesn't take very long to walk to a bus stop/subway station. Would definitely stay here again.\"",,,,,
5706985,80447783,2016-06-18,2671636,Jill,"Great space in a great location near bus and train to Boston! Lots of room and comforts of home. Juliet is great with communication. Noise from upstairs didn't bother us, but she provided earplugs just in case. Entrance under deck is a bit short but unit inside is spacious. We walked to many awesome restaurants. Would love to visit Boston and Juliet's place again someday."
5706985,80832050,2016-06-20,64748650,Justin,This was my first time in Boston and this place was exactly what I was looking for. Juliet provided all the information I needed about places in the neighborhood and how to get around. I had no problems getting to downtown Boston and I was even able to catch a Red Sox game. I would definitely stay again.
5706985,81291549,2016-06-22,48896613,Darwin,Juliet's place in roslindale is perfect ive stays a couple times and never a issue I will deff be back
5706985,81496378,2016-06-23,79329341,Kent,Juliet acted fast after I booked the res online.  She made the place extremely comfortable and it was obvious she takes pride in making her guests feel at home.
5706985,83289878,2016-07-02,2317336,David,Very satisfactory experience.
I wrote a few suggestions on Juliet's,,,,,
"Comment sheet.    \"",,,,,
5706985,84794570,2016-07-09,33659651,Meghan,The studio with Juliet was amazing! The locals are so friendly( grab a glass of wine at the Bistro)!  The bed was incredibly comfortable and everything was very clean. Would definitely return here!
5706985,85269673,2016-07-11,16050174,Leigh,"\"Juliet was very organized and the check in process was seamless.  The Roslindale location is fantastic as we could walk to great restaurants and the farmer's market on Saturday morning.  The actual space is in the underground basement of the house.  The space is cleverly converted into a B&B \"\"suite\"\" with all amenities needed.  The bed is comfortable"
5706985,85747110,2016-07-13,83024860,Samantha,"Juliet was super responsive, which was great since my booking was rather last minute. I really appreciated that she checked in with my regarding questions she had about my reservation and was very direct that, at the time, there would be guests upstairs and we'd hear footsteps. I found the room particularly convenient since there is a keypad entry and no need to coordinate (planning can be stressful, especially at the last minute!). The place was clean, cute, nicely setup and had clear instructions about what was expected / how to use various things like the WiFi."
5706985,86210972,2016-07-15,22442614,Sarah,Prompt communication before arrival.
"Apartment clean.\"",,,,,
5706985,87311768,2016-07-19,6533745,Tristan,Julia was fantastic at accommodating our last minute request (6pm for that night).
The basement apartment is beneath a lovely house on a quiet street. The bed was very comfy and the apartment clean. The shower was great too.,,,,,
The noise from the boiler didn't bother us (it didn't wake us). As Julia says you can hear the people walking and talking upstairs. We got in late and they soon went to bed so it didn't disturb us.,,,,,
"Julia left a wealth of information in the apartment and was also very helpful with tips and advice about our visit.\"",,,,,
5706985,87926649,2016-07-22,82380250,Madison,"Great stay! Juliet's apartment was very cozy and clean. It was also the perfect size for my two friends and I. Juliet was very helpful throughout the whole experience, and I would gladly stay at her place again!"
5706985,88329404,2016-07-24,84372541,Donna,"Great space, easy communication with Juliet throughout, quick walk to Rozzi square, and easy access to trains etc. Would definitely stay here again!"
5706985,89573343,2016-07-29,1450097,Elisha And Dan,"Listing was very accurate.  Everything was neat, organized, and spotless.  Juliet was also very prompt in her communication."
5706985,90194393,2016-07-31,78609231,Françoise,It's a spacious and confortable cellar. Very clean and wellcoming. All what you need is there except the necessary to cook. You can just reheat food but not cook. Juliet is pleasant and nice. The sofa is uncomfortable to sleep. We think that the price is really too high for the reallity.
5706985,92024074,2016-08-07,42401308,Victoria,"The unit was very spacious and comfortable.  Great bed, great shower!"
It is a basement and can get warm and humid,but 2 overhead fans make it very comfortable.   Quiet neighborhood - plenty of street parking and only a couple of blocks to Roslindale square - several good restaurants and coffee shops; supermarket; drugstore; etc.  Also many bus routes converge there on way to subway station for quick ride into downtown Boston; you never even have to check a schedule...just walk into the square and there be a bus along within a few minutes.,,,,
I asked for an early check in since I was arriving in Boston mid-morning and Juliet was very accommodating (thank you!),,,,,
She does note in her description that you can hear people upstairs and you definitely can.  But during my stay it was ok - nothing that went on too long or too late.  The t.v. is antenna only and not a lot of channels,so it you're a cable television fan,you'll have to record all your favorite shows for when you get home.,,,
"Overall a good experience - especially for being so convenient to everything.\"",,,,,
5706985,92443373,2016-08-08,37808441,Mary,"Juliet's place was very clean and comfortable. We ended up taking an uber into downtown Boston, which took about 20 minutes but cost less than $10. I would recommend Juliet's place to anyone visiting Boston."
5706985,95378443,2016-08-19,29521982,Brad,"Super clean, great location to get into Boston quickly. Bed and pillows were amazingly comfortable.  Apartment was spacious and all I needed for my trip."
5706985,95969439,2016-08-21,41883833,Dennis,"we loved the amenities and cleanliness, unfortunately it didnt make up for the uninsulated ceiling and the commotion we heard upstairs till 2:30 AM and them 8:45 am.  We checked out asap in the AM due to noise, and never heard from Juliet again despite our comments."
5706985,96477884,2016-08-23,36741158,Jessica,"We really enjoyed our stay at Juliet's! There was plenty of room for two, and it was easy to get there from the airport. We didn't meet in person but Juliet was very friendly and helpful with whatever we needed!"
5706985,98107752,2016-08-29,59921552,Abby,Extremely comfortable bed and apartment.
5706985,98429864,2016-08-31,49366326,Grace,We had a very comfortable stay; Juliet very much respected our privacy but always responded to any communication promptly. A lovely apartment that would also have worked for a much longer stay - we only had two nights.
5706985,98551537,2016-08-31,85347909,Kelly,"Everything is what she said it would be and more! Absolutely love the space, it was nice to have your separate entrance and living space. Everything is clean and nicely labeled. The welcome binder was so helpful and extremely organized. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
5706985,98740547,2016-09-01,89685091,Hannah,Absolutely loved staying here. Very clean and comfortable. So easy to get in with the code even though we were about an hour later than I expected to be. Would recommend to anyone staying in the Boston area.
536865,1750088,2012-07-19,2899546,Amber,"An okay experience. We arrived and the apartment was being cleaned. The people (family) were quite friendly. The location is close to public transit (we took a bus to the T) but it is, however, located in the hood. I was with my boyfriend, but would think twice before staying here alone. That said, the place was decent and definitely worth the privacy. We had minor problems during our stay such as, the bathroom and bedroom light went out. Also the fire/carbon monoxide alarm kept going off. Other than that, it was fine."
536865,1764398,2012-07-21,14844,Kristen,"This  apartment is a great deal for those visiting Boston as it is the entire top floor of a nicely renovated house in a pleasant neighborhood.  The beds were great and there is a fully functional kitchen.   The wifi and TV signal were not super strong, but  they worked well enough for us.  It was great to have air conditioners and usable windows, too."
We found parking on the street right in front of the house,but left the car and took the bus and T into the city.   It was easy and took 20-30 minutes.,,,,
Curtis was easily reachable by cell and email.He had his sister let us in to the apartment,"which was fine. \"",,,,
536865,1830461,2012-07-29,2883523,Akhanda,"We had a great time when we spend a week at Curtis place. He was very flexible with our arrival time and welcomed us into the apartment. The apartment looks as if recently renovated and is very clean. There are two bedrooms full kitchen and large living room. The apartment is very close to downtown boston, you need to take a bus and the T to get to boston which usually takes about 30 mins. The bus stop is 2 min walk from the apartment. There is a small grocery store near the apartment but the bus goes to the nearby mall too."
It was really nice to have the whole apartment to ourselves. Curtis had left us plenty of clean towels and cleaning and daily supplies which really made our stay easier. We highly recommend this place for affordable and pleasant stay at boston.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
536865,2110052,2012-08-27,2464890,Dorothea,"Generally good for the price and space. Easy transportation to the centre. The main problem was the cleanliness which was really poor so we needed to buy a lot of new stuff to clean or use for our stay as we rented the house for 1 month long.The region was a bit dangerous too, but the neighboors were very friendly. If you re going to stay there dont walk alone  after getting dark and  dont be out even with others after 12. The internet and the television didnt work when we arrived and on request  they were repaired after 2 weeks. Moreover, we asked for an air mattress because we were 4 and the air mattress they gave to us was leaking and wasnt replaced. Generally it was an ok experience because even if we had many problems the price was good comparing with the other listings."
536865,2143723,2012-08-30,2889102,Douglas,I am rating Curtis very good. We didnt get to stay because we had to leave Boston before we ever got to stay. Curtis really worked with me. I didnt get to see the the inside of the house so i cant comment on it. If your looking for something that is not right in heart of the city and dont mind taking a bus anywhere this might be the place for you.
536865,2200931,2012-09-04,2325545,Mélanie,We stayed at Curtis' place for the Labor Day week-end. It was a nice experience.
Curtis was thoughtful and we could call,text or email him if we had any questions.,,,,
It was really nice to have the entire apartment,and it was clean.,,,,
The neighborhood seemed quite agitated though and at first we have to admit we didn't feel very comfortable! But our stay worked out just fine and we really enjoyed it. Downtown Boston is reachable by public transportation,"so we didn't use the car.\"",,,,
536865,2249199,2012-09-10,2940080,Hariharan,"My family and I had a wonderful stay at Curtis's home. We got a very warm welcome from Curtis and his Mother, they even helped us moving our baggage to the apartment. They were very courteous and gave us initial directions to nearby malls/shops were we could pick up our daily grocery. The home itself was indeed cozy as he suggest and was well provided for a short stay. All things were working and spotlessly clean when we arrived. We always found parking just outside the apartment in the street during our entire stay. Curtis called us a couple of times during our stay to check if everything was okay and if we needed any help. We travelled all the way from India and we really felt at home while in Curtis's apartment."
536865,2398188,2012-09-24,2364789,Amélie,Curtis has a great condo in Boston that allowed us to have a great time in the city!!
Curtis was very nice and arranged everything for our arrival. He seems really used to having tourists over as his place is filled with pamphlets and maps,which was very useful.,,,,
"I highly recommend Curtis' place if you are going to Boston!!\"",,,,,
536865,2435382,2012-09-28,998959,Mark,"My wife and I stayed in Boston for 3 nights and had a nice time. Curtis was a good host, very friendly and helpful and the apartment had everything we needed for our short stay (cooker, fridge, tv, internet, privacy etc)."
The nearest metro (Savin Hill) is about a 20 minute walk from the apartment and there's ample on street parking at the apartment if you drive. We found some of the walk back home from around the Savin Hill metro to be a little sketchy at night so we'd recommend driving and parking up at the metro and getting the metro downtown if you prefer to take the metro as we did.,,,,,
On the whole,"Curtis' apartment is good value for money and I'd recommend looking at this if you're after a nice clean apartment which is excellent value for your money.\"",,,,
536865,2457563,2012-09-30,170524,Brent,"Very hospitable hosts! Place was fairly convenient if you could figure out the bus schedules. Aside from some visiting kids running up and down the stairs around dinner time, it was cozy, comfortable, quiet, clean and nice. Would definitely find a longer stay to be good, since it was a real apartment. Much better than a hostel or a hotel. Located in Upham's Corner, it's definitely not one of the upscale neighborhoods, but everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful.  Be sure to stop by the Main Street office next to the Strand Theater and say hi to Max."
536865,2570384,2012-10-10,2968557,Guido,"Super Schöne und Moderne Wohnung mit allem was man braucht. Große Küche, Wohnzimmer, 2 Schlafzimmer mit großen Betten. Die Lage ist etwas ausserhalb, der Bus kommt nicht immer Pünktlich. Eventuel Taxi fahren zur/ von U-Bahn einplanen-(ca.8Dollar), dann ist alles super."
536865,2612042,2012-10-15,3120673,Chris-Patti,Very clean and centrally located!  Very accommodating with our early arrival and departure times!  Great stay!
536865,2640973,2012-10-17,3464757,Shan,Stayed for 2 nights.  Curtis was friendly and helpful.  The apartment is nice and clean.  We used the full kitchen to create tasty dishes.  Would stay again.
536865,2659134,2012-10-19,3841385,Elise,"Great place. A big apartment on the top floor of a family occupied building. We were greeted by Curtis' mother, who made us feel at home at once. We had a great stay in Boston, at that had much to do with how comfortable we felt here!"
536865,2698224,2012-10-24,2834022,Polyana,"I spent five days in the apartment with my husband and it was, overall, a good experience. Curtis is very friendly and helped us out whenever we needed. The apartment is very tidy and clean, all the appliances were in perfect conditions and towels and linens were provided by the owner. However, the location is not that great if you intend to use public transportation to go downtown. The nearest metro station (red line) is 20 minutes walking and it may take a while to get the buses (one day, we stayed for over 30 minutes waiting for the bus!)."
536865,2736143,2012-10-28,3400148,Giuseppe,"Very beautifull house, we stay very well in Boston in Curtis's House. In the apartament there was all you need! It's so close to bus e T Line."
536865,2778089,2012-11-01,3635004,Sayaka,Great!
Curtis was very fast responding when I contacted about booking his place for some questions,whereas most of other owners (I probably contacted 4,5 others) never responded or took a few days to get back with me. I very much appreciate that.,,,
Upon our arrival,his aunt helped us checking-in. She was very nice and asked us if there is any questions she could answer.,,,,
During our  4 days of stay,we were very comfortable. I liked the fact that there were so much  free street parking space around the apartment whereas you have to pay quite much money if we stayed closer to the center of the city. Also we liked the spacious rooms and fully equipped kitchen.,,,,
We stayed there during the Hurricane Sandy,thankfully we didn't get hit even though the wind was pretty crazy. The apartment was totally fine and still very cozy.,,,,
There were some minor thing,I wish things were better,but hey,house always need some kind of work all the time. So I can't really complain. And this place is very reasonable.,,
I have to go back to Boston in January and will try to book this place again!,,,,,
Thanks!,,,,,

The apartment itself was very cute and comfortable. The location proved to be very convenient, giving us easy access to public transit as well as being walking distance from several very interesting neighborhoods. The apartment was well stocked and proved very conducive for having meals at home. We tended to return rather late at night, but the neighborhood was absolutely safe.

Curtis' family was helpful with ( the complicated) Boston parking rules and we had no problem getting in and out of Boston. The flat itself is great to sleep 4 we had out blow up mattress and could sleep a fifth person. It is very spacious and the kitchen has everything you need to cook.

The flat is around forty minutes away from the city centre,either by walking 20 minutes to the nearest Red Line subway station or by taking a connecting bus just down the road from the house,but we liked staying outside of the city centre and seeing a local neighbourhood.,,,

We were checked-in by Curtis relative, who helped us with everything we needed. Accommodation was very clean, well equipped and quiet.

As many of the other reviews stated,this place is in a not so great part of town. The first night we stayed there we tried to walk to the bus station but a `huge fight broke out in the street. We took cabs from then on out. It was kind of a bummer because we ended up spending a lot more money on cab fairs. We would have been happier spending more money on a place and being closer to the city.,,,,

Nighttime noise in the neighborhood was a problem.  The location was less than ideal for visiting in and out of downtown Boston without a car.  Markets and shopping were not within walking distance.

Alles ist sauber, die Gegend scheint weitgehend sicher, auch wenn es in beiden Nächten zwischenzeitlich in der Nachbarschaft mal etwas lauter wurde. Allerdings alles noch im Rahmen."
Die Lage ist in Ordnung,aber nicht optimal. Wir hatten zu dem Zeitpunkt noch keinen Mietwagen und sind von der South Station mit dem Taxi zur Wohnung gefahren (ca. 30 Dollar). Mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln wäre das mit unserem Gepäck (wir waren zu dritt) sehr beschwerlich geworden. Zwar gibt es eine Bushaltestelle zwei Gehminuten von der Wohnung entfernt,aber der Bus fährt nur alle 30 bis 40 Minuten (je nach Tageszeit) und ist meist sehr voll. Er benötigt etwa 20 bis 25 Minuten zur U-Bahn-Station Andrew,von wo aus es sehr zügig in Bostons Innenstadt geht.,,
Der Check-in verlief problemlos,Curtis' Tante wartete auf uns und erklärte uns die wesentlichen Dinge. Alles in allem ist Curtis' Wohnung empfehlenswert,wenn es einen nicht stört,längere Busfahrten in Kauf zu nehmen,"bzw. wenn einem ein Auto zur Verfügung steht.\"",

The appartment itself is nice and clean,parking space was plenty and close. The communication,check-in and check-out were easy and Curtis and his relatives very nice and helpful.,,,
We didnt like the area though. It did not feel safe to walk around after sunset or before sunrise,you could hear sirens all night - and after checking with the crime stats of the area we didnt feel better. On the otherhand we did not SEE anything happen or so,it just didnt feel good,esp. with the kids.,,

Wir haben keine öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel benutzt,was aber wohl kein Problem ist. Wir sind immer mit dem eigenen Auto gefahren,parken ist allerdings schwierig und teuer. Von Boston aus haben wir Ausflüge nach Cape Cod,Portsmouth,Cambridge gemacht.,

The apartment was larger than expected, clean, the amenities were complete, we very easily found our way to the city center via public transportation (thanks for the good directions Curtis!). There are a few complaints in the reviews about street noise (welcome to the city) but there are fans in each room to turn on and combat any noise, we slept like babies. Contrary to other prior reviews, we felt very safe and welcomed in the neighborhood and from the neighbors. This is the perfect place to end a very busy day exploring the city centre."
536865,8614654,2013-11-08,6746972,Jackie,"Everything went smoothly with our stay. Curtis's downstairs neighbor let us in to the place, and Curtis let us stay a little bit past our check out time when we requested it, which was very nice. The place was clean and spacious. We had some Bostonian friends over for dinner and it was lovely! The perfect place to crash! Thanks!"
536865,8639237,2013-11-10,9056166,Andrea,"I got this condo for my parents, when they came to visit in Boston. My parents enjoyed their stay. We never got to meet Curtis personally, but the woman that let us in was very nice and helpful. The place had just been cleaned and it was apparent, as the place was spotless. Everything was done very professionally and I think my parents would definitely come back. It's was an easy commute for us, as I live in Southie, so about 10 minutes to pick them up. If you don't drive, it may be a tough commute, although I didn't look into the T stations distance."

Curtis habe ich nicht persönlich getroffen,jedoch klappte die Schlüsselübergabe (durch seine Tante) problemlos.,,,,
Ein Auto hatte ich nicht,somit war ich auf Bus + Bahn angewiesen um nach Downtown Boston zu gelangen - das klappte aber problemlos. Im Schnitt dauerte es ca. 35min um mit Bus (Linie 16,"ca. 2min zu Fuß von der Wohnung) über die \"\"Andrew Station\"\" (dort in die RED Line Subway) bis zur Station \"\"Crossing Downtown\"\" zu kommen.

The communication between us was great and it was very kind of him to allow me to check out at noon instead of 10am.,,,,,
However,I was quite disappointed with the aparment which actually looks better on the pictures than in real... The bathroom needs some renovations.,,,,
Moreover,I think the location is really far away from downtown (URL HIDDEN) least,"for me.  But I guess it is what one's get in the  surroundings of downtown Boston for that price... \"",,,

We had a problem with the knob of the bathroom door and he took care of it right away. Thanks to him, our time in Boston was great. We were driving so I cannot tell how easy it is to take bus from there, but Curtis mentioned that you can do it a couple a blocks away. Driving it takes around 10 minutes to get to Downtown."

It was cozy and fully equipped; there were lots of towels, sheets and blankets—and also a hair-dryer, which made my female friends very happy. We didn't have a car, so whenever we wanted to go to town, we took the bus to the Red Line. (You can look up the bus schedule on the Internet.) There is a little grocery store on Columbia Rd within a five-minute walking distance where we found everything we needed for a nice breakfast. Overall a great experience!"

536865,10005558,2014-01-25,7344480,Brenda,"Our stay at Curtis' apartment was overall a pleasant experience. The kitchen was well equipped with all the necessities for home cooking and the TV had plenty of channels to choose from. Commute to Downtown Boston was relatively easy with multiple bus lines within close distance, but reiterating past reviews, having a car would be an advantage when travel around town. Our only downside to our stay was the draft in the second bedroom. The draft, in addition to the heater resetting at midnight, left the room particularly cold at night especially as the weather was consistently below freezing. Our check in was not the smoothest transition. We were initially given the wrong cell phone number which left us confused but when that issue was sorted, Curtis was relatively easy to get a hold of if in need and was happy to help or organise assistance from a neighbour."
536865,10665656,2014-03-02,3864993,J Racquel,"We actually didn't get a chance to meet Curtis but I believe we met his sister and her son, he had to be no older than 4 and he was an awesome little guy.  His sister was very helpful and friendly."
The place was more than I had expected from the appliances,to the counter tops. All the amenities we could need during our stay and I was less than 4 miles from my fathers place. Very too my beats a tight crowded hotel any time!,,,,

We had a slight hiccup with the check-in process and getting another set of keys, but neither were necessarily Curtis' fault and he was easy to communicate with to get it resolved. It seems like it would be best to have a car to stay here and get to explore Boston; we used Uber and Lyft to get to and from the areas we wanted to be. Overall, we had a nice time."
536865,12927654,2014-05-14,14337093,Jimmy,"Curtis' place was pretty good! We arrived late but he prepared everything we needed.  We never saw Curtis in person so I'd like to think he was a ninja watching out for us in the shadows. The place was quiet clean and comfortable, having 3 bed was awesome. The neighborhood was not the best but since Curtis' sister lives in the apartment below it made everything better."

It has a very homey feel and it makes a good place to go to after a day of traveling. They have a nice kitchen and living room space. The location is a little far from the city center but if you stay closer to the city center, apartments are more expensive smaller. The apartment Curtis has is quite spacious. The only downside is the bus and train services because you got to know what is the exact time and where to catch the bus. Aside from that everything is very lovely."
536865,13405266,2014-05-27,12341749,Matthew,"We had a fine stay at Curtis's apartment. He was very easy to get in contact with. The apartment is very large, although a bit out of town. We had to take a bus and train to get Into the main city"

The neighborhood isn't one to hang out in, but we were safe and had no problems parking on the street. Closer to the city center than I anticipated. Thanks for an excellent stay!"
536865,14437625,2014-06-19,6983684,Richard,We had a large group that stayed for a few days while visiting Boston. Communication with Curtis was excellent (though we didn't meet him). Curtis also seemed accommodating to any changes or issues that came up. He helped us set up an extra air mattress for our group and was also flexible with our check-in time.
The stay itself was okay. For the price,it's definitely a bargain for all the space and rooms you get (plus a full-size kitchen) in the Boston area. Though clean,there does seem to be minor wear in the house that we didn't expect based on the listing. But there weren't any major issues for us.,,,
If you're looking for a good neighborhood scene (ie. jogging,late night,bars,easy access to public transportation,etc.) this might not be the ideal match for you. The neighborhood is near Uphams Corner and might feel worn out and a bit empty for some (I see some reviewers mentioned safety: the area may not look great,depending on where you've traveled before and what your expectations are
536865,14785772,2014-06-26,10159265,Ken,"Curtis did a great job communicating promptly and made check in very easy. The apartment is terrific, stayed cool with the two AC units and we didn't realize there are two single beds in the second bedroom, which was a great bonus (no air bed needed for my son!). The living room is a terrific size and the wi-fi handled our business photo-sending needs quickly."
The kitchen is very complete and there are lots of extra little amenities,like coffee filters,tea,etc. We found the apartment very quiet and pleasant.,,
From a peek on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps,you might not be sure what kind of neighborhood it is,but we found we felt safe,it was easy to park within a block of the apartment,and I think everyone owned nicer cars than our 2008 Town & Country :-) The apartment building has a gate,then the building door locks... before you even get to your apartment
One note is that it's on the 3rd floor,if you have lots to cary or have trouble with stairs,but that also means it's bound to be the quietest spot in the building. And it is a little tricky for unloading near the door (we have piles of photo equipment),so it you have lots of stuff,you might want to ask about how best to do that. I think you could open the gates up full and briefly park near the apartment door. But otherwise,you'll have a little walk with your stuff.
We'd happily stay at Curtis' place for future Boston events,"as it's at least a 50% savings over area hotels and having a full kitchen and 2 separate bedrooms is heaven! \"",,,,
536865,15087764,2014-07-02,2580555,Claude,Curtis always answered very promptly to our questions! A great place to stay if you want to visit Boston very easily. We were 4 adults with two young children and it was perfect for us!

Il est très facile de se rendre au centre-ville via l'autobus #16 ou #17 et le métro. Au début, le quartier nous paraissait moins sûr le soir, mais finalement c'était seulement une fausse impression, car les gens sont très sympathiques et aidants. Pour ceux qui ne sont pas dérangés par le fait de faire 20-30 min pour se rendre au centre-ville, c'est un très bon choix!"
We were very well received by the mother of Curtis,a woman quite charming. The apartment is very clean,well equipped and comfortable. It is very easy to get to downtown via bus # 16 or # 17 and the subway.

I've seen previous comments saying the neighborood is not safe but we felt very safe walking up and down the neighborood even past midnight. You have no worries to have.

No really shops close to the apartment but know that the bus 16 cross through the South Bay commercial center where you can find all you need (and so many more !!!).

The wait for the bus can be a bit long so we took a cab a couple of times, especially coming back to the place at night. The weather was mild during our trip so we were comfortable but if it were hot out I imagine an air conditioner in the second bedroom would be appreciated. Both rooms did have fans though. Overall a decent experience."

536865,21460485,2014-10-18,18945936,Carolin,"Just deeply DISAPPOINTED!!! We had booked the appartment for 5 person (which is more expensive than just booking for 2). Curtis knew that we arrive with 5 adults. The first thing we reconized was the smell in the whole building. It was like a mixture of cat litter and old stuff, which was just spicy in your nose. When we came into the appartment the smell was there too, not that intensive but annoying. So we checked the rooms and had to search for the fifth possibilty to sleep at. An adult person would never fit into the couch, which you can see on the picture but Curtis wrote me that someone can sleep there aswell."
Also there was just 1 towel in the bathroom for 5 person. And we had to sleep with two people (with one sheet and not a blanket) on one of the singlebeds,which was horrible,because they aren´t comfortable even with just one person on it.,,,
For breakfast we had first to clean the plates and cups,because we did not to eat the old crumbs of strangers.,,,,
So I have asked Curtis for what we have paid a daily rate for FIVE person when nothing is prepared for FIVE person. And why we have paid an amount for cleaning,when the apartment is not clean... So I gave him the chance to make me happy with reducing the amount after our stay and not getting this feedback. Just telling me that he is sorry about that and wishing me a good day is very disappointing!,,,,
Another thing is: Do not expect that the bathroom looks like on the picture. The joint between the tiles are brown and ugly and the smell in the bathroom is stronger than in the other rooms.,,,,,
A good advice from my side: Invest your money in a hotel and not into this apartment! If I pay for 5 people I expect that there are 5 possibilities which I can use!,,,,,
Conclusion: Boston is a very nice city,"but book a room in a hotel and not this apartment! \"",,,,

Nous avons cherché un peu partout dans l'appartement et trouvé, roulé, un lit gonflable.

536865,22953537,2014-11-18,11711234,Jan,"The cozy 2 bedroom was just that, cozy! We were able to fit 5 guests comfortably in this residence that was on the top floor of a residential building that was for the most part quiet and quaint. The address was on a slight hill that was a bit hidden for some of our drivers, but clearly marked on the gate in front."
536865,24233332,2014-12-23,17540705,Alain,"We spent a few nice days in this fairly well-equipped apartment. A good size for 4 people, comfortable beds. Unfortunately we never had the opportunity to meet Curtis in person but checking in and out were easy and went as agreed ahead of time.   We did find the neighborhood a bit noisy at night but all in all we are satisfied with this place."

We really appreciated the white towels which made it easy to see they were spotless. Roomy, great value and I'd stay here again in a second."

Everyone we met in the neighborhood was really friendly,and it's an incredibly quiet location given it's the middle of the city.,,,,
As pointed out,if you like elaborate meals,make sure to plan some grocery shopping. The local store does have some basics to get you by,so if you arrive late you'll have breakfast and be able to go shopping the next day.,,

Bostaden motsvarade beskrivningen, inget fancy men rymlig för 4 personer och allting funkade. Kvarteret var lugnt fastän Dorchester som stadsdel inte har det bästa rykte. Fri parkering på gatan var också bra. Som övernattningsplat för 2 nätter var Curtis bostad helt ok."

The apartment was clean, plenty of extra blankets if you get cold easily. Curtis responded super promptly to all questions asked. Overall a wonderful experience. The neighborhood is a bit out of the way from downtown Boston but we used a rental car for a couple of days which was easy to park in the neighborhood. We also used public transportation and there are bus stops near the apartment and the bus system was reliable and easy to use."
536865,30694999,2015-04-26,27793260,Katja,Die Wohnung ist so wie auf den Bildern abgebildet und wirklich sehr geräumig und sauber. Wir wurden sehr nett von Curtis Schwester empfangen. Die Treppen zum Erreichen der Wohnung sind geräumig und kurz. Handtücher und Bettwäsche sind mehr als ausreichend in einem Wandschrank vorhanden.
Da die Wohnung etwas außerhalb der Stadt gelegen ist,ist sie sehr ruhig,sodass man eher durch Vogelgeschwitscher statt durch Verkehrslärm oder laute Nachbarn geweckt wird. Ein großer Vorteil ist das kostenlose Parken an der Straße. Wir hatten das Glück jeden Tag (3) direkt vor dem Haus parken zu können. Mit Bus und Bahn ist man innerhalb von 25 Minuten mitten in der Stadt. Bus-Plan und Stadtplan lagen aus. Für Nachteulen gestaltet sich der Nachhauseweg mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln jedoch etwas schwierig. Ein Taxi kostet aber nur 15$.,,,

Was die Ruhe und Sauberkeit angeht können wir uns den VorschreiberInnen nicht ganz anschließen. Abends war im Viertel,vielleicht aufgrund des schönen Wetters,viel los und auch noch spät Lärm. Die Betten waren - aber das ist wohl Geschmackssache - viel zu weich. Das Badezimmer war nicht so sauber wie erwartet.,,,
Fahrten ins Zentrum mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln sind gut zu managen,nur zu späterer Stunde wird es etwas schwieriger.,,,,

Pro:  Spacious apartment,very clean,comfortable soft bed,although we didn't do any cooking,the kitchen was very well stocked.  There was nothing we needed that was not supplied.  Good location near downtown and Logan airport.  Two air conditioners kept the place nice and cool.  Curtis left very clear instructions for all aspects of our stay.,

Small bathroom, and could use a dresser or some closet space for clothes. It's not in the best neighborhood, and public transportation to downtown was a bus and 2 subways which took almost an hour to only go 7 miles. Other than a quick phone call as I was driving into town to tell me where the keys are, I had no contact with Curtis, although I think he lives in another apartment in the same building."

We were welcomed by Curtis' lovely mom who was really welcoming and showed us around the house and explained everything that had to do with transportation and stuff. The location is great, it's like 20-30 minutes by bus and train to the city center. There is a huge mall only 5 minutes away by bus. And if you're like us and you cook a lot at home, this place is a definite go! The kitchen included literally everything you needed to cook the best meals. It was totally clean and we would definitely recommend this place."

From the cleanness it was OK, indeed, the Apartment is not any more in the cultivated state like in the pictures! The beds had lain very strongly by and heating has not functioned, it was stands very coldly in the Apartment. The tenants in the lower floor are in the evening very much loudly.

I emailed a question last-minute about the availability of an ironing board and iron, which was never replied to, but all was well since they were available when I got to the apartment. It's definitely not a 'walking to everything' location, but if you have a car and are familiar with Boston, it's a very good alternative to expensive hotels closer to downtown."

Bus à 3 min et métro à 20 min (à pied). Le quartier est tout à fait safe.

The apartment was decent, it was clean and spacious with a large kitchen and large master bedroom. The place was also fully equipped with kitchen appliances, utensils, towels, etc."
One problem was that the smaller bedroom did not have an air conditioner,or a fan,which was uncomfortable due to the 90 degree days we had. The larger bedroom has an air conditioner,as well as the kitchen.,,
Overall we enjoyed our stay in the house,"but the neighborhood seems run down. We were not entiely sure how safe it was due to some things we saw while walking. The red line is about a 15 min walk but I would not recommend walking at night.\"",,,,

Grand séjour avec canapé, cuisine spacieuse permettant de déjeuner à 4 aisément, 2 chambres avec literie très confortable pour reprendre des forces. Sdb un peu étroite d'autant plus que les toilettes sont comprises. Wifi très fluide, pour des ado c'est important!"
Pour ceux qui disposent d'une voiture,"de chaque côté des rues adjacentes il y a de la place. Il faut juste prendre précaution des jours de nettoyage des trottoirs.\"",,,,
536865,91310271,2016-08-04,14801241,Lionel,The communication with Curtis has been excellent and he has provided all the information we needed to feel at ease with our stay at his apartment; it is especially interesting with the parking in the street which rules can be a bit complicated compared to the French standards.
From what we have been able to observe (we were walking everyday 15' to the métro station to go to downtown),the neighborhood is very safe and all the people we have comme across friendly and helpful.,,,,
The place is approx. 45' to the Commons and a very good alternative to more expensive central apartments.,,,,,
The house is well equipped,"although the bed a bit soft as far as I am concerned.\"",,,,
536865,91801647,2016-08-06,52595666,Robert,"Very comfortable home away from home in Boston.  Curtis was welcoming and we were able to get settled without difficulty.  The neighborhood is lively and diverse, lots of families and working folks.  We were able to drive to the T and park directly in front of the station for our trip into Boston proper.  The apartment is quiet and comfortable."
536865,93113242,2016-08-11,36493655,Yuhui,"Curtis is a really nice and helpful host, he connected with me before I came, and I got all the useful information from him. So check in was really smooth. His apartment is located in the third floor of a single house, and it's clean and has enough space to 3 person."
But I think it was not a wisdom decision to walk outside at night in the neighborhood according to what I saw and heard.,,,,,
Otherwise,"I recommend Curtis's house.\"",,,,

The house is beautifully appointed with elegant furniture and highly polished wooden floors.  The kitchen is large and very well equipped.,,,,,
We really liked that Louise always responded promptly and fully to all our questions via email and social media.,,,,,
"The house is located conveniently close to a T station (Stony Brook) and is also only a short walk from the Samuel Adams Brewery. We highly recommend the informative and entertaining free tour of the brewery.\"",,,,,
629814,49230724,2015-10-02,6447049,Elizabeth,"Staying at Diamond House 2 was as lovely for me as the previous time. Louis is a very fine host. He even gave me a ride to the airport when my Uber ride fell through! One other thing: the house is just five T stops from Symphony Hall, for any serious music aficionados. Thanks, Louis!"
629814,50469814,2015-10-12,2042109,Jennifer,"The house is exactly as pictured - beautiful, nicely decorated, and clean as a whistle. The house itself is gorgeous, and it is clear the owners put a lot of effort into keeping it up and especially into gardening. The kitchen is well-stocked with housewares, and nice stuff at that: high-quality nonstick pans, really pretty ceramicware, nice matching silverware, Chicago cutlery knives, etc."
The neighborhood is excellent - safe,quirky,pleasant. The T stop is less than 5 minutes' walk away,so getting around is really convenient.  There are some small shops within walking distance; the Stop & Shop is one train stop down and then about a one-block walk.,,
You can expect to hear some noise from the other residents in the house (this unit is on the second floor,with others on the first and third),but it's not bothersome. There is some street noise during the day,but it's very quiet at night.,,
Louis lives on the first floor,so check-in and check-out were a breeze. He gave us a quick tour with all the necessary instructions,and checked in on occasion to see if we needed anything. He had put fresh flowers all over the place in the unit,"which was a lovely touch.\"",,

Lisa was very flexible with our schedule and met us at the apartment when we arrived to town. She was very quick to respond with questions regarding both the apartment and the city.  She made us feel very welcome in her apartment. The entire process went very smoothly! We would recommend anyone traveling in the Boston area to check out Lisa's apartment as a place to  stay for their visit.

My host Lisa was very friendly and communicative throughout the process.  The apartment was very spacious, clean, and bright - located above ground with lots of windows.

The apartment was as described, very clean and even had thoughtful touches to make our stay more enjoyable.   The linens, towels and toiletries made us feel like we were staying at a hotel rather than an AirB&B.  The location of the apartment is amazing, with charming restaurants and parks at every corner.  We were also easily able to get to Newbury St., the Commons, the Esplanade and Charles St. by foot.  I would highly recommend Lisa and her apartment to anyone interested in staying in Boston."

She is great at communicating and making things very easy. She was flexible on my check-in and out timing. Not only present at the check-in, she took the time to provide me information about her district, the good breakfast spots, where to go for a walk, etc."
The apartment is very well located and I have been able to do everything walking,"which was great! It is well equipped and the bed is so comfortable!! With no hesitation I will go back to Lisa's place next time I am in Boston!\"",,,,

The apartment itself is located in a great area,and there's a cafe right across the street that we had a great breakfast at one day and lunch at another. The bed is super comfy,and the water pressure in the shower is fantastic,two things you rarely find at a hotel.,,

The bed was super comfortable and the entire place was very nice, clean and comfortable. It gives you a great feel for what it's like to really live in Boston! The kitchen was well equipped and she even included complimentary toiletries as well. There's a cafe directly across the street and a convenience/market at the end of the street. The TV has full cable too although we didn't watch it much as there was plenty to do around town. We felt right at home. You won't regret staying here for a nice Boston visit!"

They were very generous with the shared spaces; I never felt as though I was intruding.  If you enjoy board games, I imagine they'd be up for a game… but be prepared to lose to Philip!"
The apartment itself is very charming and sunny,and the guest room is right next to a breakfast table in the kitchen that gets great morning sun.  The house is on a quiet street in a very walkable neighborhood,with access to the T through a very nice (and well-lit) park.  The main business district of Jamaica Plain is just a few minutes walk away,"as are the arboretum and pond.\"",,

8067585,61666006,2016-02-07,25573864,Helen,This home is really what airbnb is all about- all the comforts of home and yet the delight of having new friends to guide you gently through the wonders of a new city.
Before I even got to Boston,Philip sent helpful messages regarding transport and his directions were clear and concise. On arrival it was clear that he and Hannah had taken a lot of care to prepare a welcoming and very comfortable room. As travellers themselves,they understand and provide many subtle touches to ensure your stay is just a pleasure. There's lots of natural light,more than enough room for your things- a whole empty cupboard- and plenty of privacy. Fresh bread baked for your breakfast!,,
The apartment is in a very funky and hip neighbourhood,lots of quirky interesting stores and eateries,friendly people and very safe. Its an easy walk from the orange line train which runs straight down town very frequently.,,,
But the best thing about this listing is the people...Hannah and Philip are well read,thoughtful and charming,so interested in the world around them and  all it holds. Their company is full of warmth and openness,and they really are ideal hosts. My stay in Boston will remain a joyful memory for a long time because of this wonderful home.,,

The apartment itself was bright and spacious. The room is in the back of the apartment and affords a lot of privacy, something not all places have.  The neighborhood is on a somewhat secluded street off the main drag in Jamaica Plain, so it was quieter than I expected. Nice two and three family homes with nicely kept yards and gardens. T station a quarter mile walk away. All in all, we felt very safe."

Their home is situated perfectly for anyone who would like to get around Boston using public transportation.  We were within an easy walking distance from either the Green or Forest Hills stop on the Orange line.  They are also very close to a stop for the 39 bus line.,,,,,
Jamaica Plain was a lovely neighborhood to be in and felt very safe even when we used public transportation and were walking home late in the evening.  There were always lots of friendly faces out and about in the neighborhood.,,,,,

8067585,81939010,2016-06-25,76413124,Jason,Very welcoming hosts. Great value. Neighborhood wasnt quite as nice as we hoped. Pro tip: take the bus as opposed to the longish(but certainly doable) walk to the rail stop.

Cynthia was so accommodating; upon my arrival, she provided a tour of the house, a Charlie Card for public transportation and a guidebook for all the green and tech features of the house.  Cynthia also made herself available before my arrival and answered any questions I had to make my stay comfortable."
The place was spotless and like new.  It has an open space design,is very spacious and allows for lots of natural light. The king size bed was perfect for a person of my size and the living wall was a beautiful touch.,,,,

The apartment offered everything you would need for a very peaceful and relaxing stay. We found Cynthia’s home to be beautifully clean and very well equipped.,,,,,
We found the location of the apartment very handy too. Being only a 5 minute walk to the local T,we would find ourselves in downtown Boston in around 20 minutes which was ideal for us.,,,,
We always felt like we could easily get in contact with Cynthia either by phone or email if necessary which was great to know. Although we didn’t meet Cynthia in person we were left with a useful house manual that guided us around very clearly.,,,,,

I'd definitely recommend staying there!

It was just as lovely as the pictures, and I was very comfortable! My co-worker and I stayed there, and it was perfect that the train was so close since we were there for work. The commute to downtown was short-about 15 minutes once on the train, and the train came often, so we were never late because of delays! The kitchen is gorgeous-tons of counter space, nice dishwasher and appliances etc, nice washer/dryer, comfy bed, great TV although we didn't get to watch much with our schedule. Cynthia was so accommodating and responsive any time we had a question about anything and really went above and beyond with making sure we were comfortable. Overall, a wonderful stay!"
4409653,40621361,2015-08-01,2318398,T.J,I got the place because it was convenient and only a walking distance from BIMC.
However; I think it's way over priced I paid 6k for a one month stay and had to pay extra for parking . The whole building smells so bad. It takes forever to get on the elevator and when you do finally get on one you're like a sardine with 8 Indians from India or Arabs.,,,,,
There was a sewage leak in the hallway for like 5 days.,,,,,
For the amount of money I paid you'd think that you would have a washer or dryer but no. Also The bed was extremely uncomfortable. And college kids on the floor were loud most nights!,,,,,
Looking back i should've booked a hotel. It would've cost the same for a much pleasant experience.,,,,,

Upon my arrival, she had a typed up list of everything we needed to know about our stay, like the wifi password, instructions for what to do when we leave, and recommendation on places to eat nearby. She had a beautiful apartment. It was more spacious than the pictures give justice to. She also provided us with towels and amenities. She knew we were on our girl’s trip and even provided us with make-up wipes, which was a nice and thoughtful gesture."
We enjoyed our stay at Christina’s apartment and had no issues. The apartment has its own entrance. It was also in a great location – Beacon Hill.

9845039,58958031,2016-01-05,51455513,Eva,"Ashley war sehr freundlich und hat vor und während unseres Aufenthalts immer wieder gecheckt, ob alles soweit in Ordnung ist. Die Wohnung war für vier Personen fast etwas klein, allerdings war sie wie beschrieben und gemütlich. Die Verbindung zu allen wichtigen Sightseeingpunkten ist einfach und schnell. Auch die Verbindung zum Flughafen ist angenehm. Fenway selbst bietet auch einige Attraktionen und die Wohnung liegt in einer schönen Nachbarschaft. Dadurch, dass sie in einer Seitenstraße gelegen ist, ist es auch sehr ruhig, obwohl man sich in einer Großstadt befindet."
9845039,59531853,2016-01-11,53223116,Jackie,"We had a wonderful time at Ashley's apartment.  The listing was just as depicted, very cozy, and in a great location in Boston.  Ashley made it very easy for us to check in/check out and provided great detailed directions for where to eat, catch the T, and more.  She was flexible with our check in/check out times which was greatly appreciated and the place was clean and tidy upon our arrival.  For anyone who is looking for a nice place to stay in Boston (very close to Fenway ), I would suggest Ashley's place in a heart beat.  We had a wonderful time in the city and cannot wait to return! 5 stars!"
9845039,61684619,2016-02-07,51847037,Nathan,"We came into the city for dinner and a show at the House of Blues. Ashleys place is only about a 10 minute walk to the venue and was also very close a lot of different restaurants and other things to do. I doubt the location can be beat for this price. Getting into the apartment was very easy as Ashley has a key guard so she doesn't have to meet you with the keys so check in can be pretty flexible. The apartment itself is very nice and had everything we needed, Ashelys home guide definitely makes staying there easy to understand as it is very detailed and even has recommendations on notable places in the area. The apartment was clean and everyhing worked as needed, no complaints here. Ashley was a great and very helpful host and responded quickly to me contacting her before, during, and after our stay. We would definitely stay here again in the future."
9845039,61823144,2016-02-08,22579290,Perrine,"We had a comfortable stay at Ashley's apartment! It is conform to the description, and she gave us a lot of informations about the apartment and surrounding which were helpful! I would recommend it!"

It appears that everything is brand new (the beds, furniture, kitchenware, etc).  There's a washer and dryer in the apartment, a large living room that has super comfortable couches and a flat-screen TV, the free wifi worked well, and the area is super convenient to Harvard Square and several restaurants plus a grocery store at the end of the street.  One of the nights we cooked out with a couple of other international guests staying there and had a nice dinner on the back deck!  Overall, just a great experience. Highly recommend to anyone traveling to Harvard Square area or Boston."

Really appreciate. The house is blunt new, my room is big,have big window and great view. The bed is very comfortable. The kitchen and living room are so big and clean with all modern equipments, very good for cook, dinner, meet with few guests. I enjoyed living in Todd's house! Location is great, easy go to Harvard. It was one of best experience in my trvalling! I look forward come back."
7511838,49793097,2015-10-06,42360082,Margarita,The bedroom was immaculate and beautifully decorated. The house is in a very quiet and convenient neighbourhood. The taxi driver didn't know the way to get there and Todd not only gave him instructions but followed up with a call when noticed it was taking too long. I would definitely stay there again and would recommend Todd's place to friends. Todd's assistant was also super helpful and friendly.
7511838,50533955,2015-10-12,14906684,Anna,"Todd's place was great! Check-in was an easy and efficient process. My room was clean and I appreciated the towels, information sheet, and toiletries.

7511838,51034063,2015-10-17,43686110,Betsy,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and it couldn't have been better! The room and house were exactly as advertised. The neighborhood is nice and convenient to Cambridge where I spent most of my time during the stay. Todd is a great host. The first night I was there he had planned a taco and game night at the house for all of the guests. It was a really nice surprise and made the whole experience that much better - I mean, who doesn't like walking into a house with dinner ready and people ready to meet you after arriving from a 6 hour flight? Everyone in the house that I met was respectful and did their part to keep the place clean and tidy, too."
7511838,51702385,2015-10-24,33579531,Frederike,Todd's description of his airbnb was excellent. His house outdid our expectations. This host knows how to make a guest comfortable. The house is situated in a quiet and friendly neighborhood in which lots of properties have been currently renovated. It has a supermarket within walking distance and we used Uber to get around.
"We especially liked the fact that we met both european and American guests during our stay and would definitely recommend this property to our friends.\"",,,,,

7511838,60327628,2016-01-22,50599179,Tazen,I stayed in the house for one month. I feel very happy. I met a lot of friends and the owner is a very good guy.
7511838,66928109,2016-03-25,36481942,Robin Lynne,Todd is just a wonderful thoughtful host. I was very pleased with the accommodations and the location and was very happy with the experience overall. Super highly recommend!
7511838,73700017,2016-05-09,2501950,J David,I had a very pleasant stay in  Todd's house. I didn't have the chance to meet him as all the process is automatized. Instructions were clear and  the house was clean. The house is well furnished and decorated. I will look it up again for my next stay. Thanks Todd!
7511838,75022847,2016-05-18,40779631,Maciej,"Todd was a great host and the house was absolutely lovely - spacious, very clean, in a quiet neighbourhood, with great transport links to downtown Boston."

7511838,76957166,2016-05-30,38253303,Andreas,"I had an absolutely fantastic stay at Todd's place. The house was well-decorated, clean, and had excellent air con (which was essential during the heat wave in Boston). All practical arrangements went smoothly. I highly recommend this place:)"
7511838,77744960,2016-06-03,70028344,Phil,"Everything was as advertised.  Great location, good price, secure...required some minor help and host was very attentive and responsive."
7511838,77963487,2016-06-04,73642751,Claire,"I went to Boston due to a family emergency, and I feel very fortunate to stay at Todd's place. The check-in was very smooth. The room was ready when I arrived, with clean and fluffy towels on the bed. The linens were clean and smelled fresh, too. The kitchen is also fully-equipped and spacious, and you could make coffee or tea in the morning. Another plus is that you can lock your room with the key, which offers you extra secure and privacy. Altogether, I had great experience for staying at Todd's place, which definitely helped me rest and relax after being out busy for the whole day."
7511838,78642159,2016-06-08,47278588,Yating,"The place is clean and nice. I love large windows and the painting on the wall. It's a little bit difficult to reach by public transportation though, so we mainly used Uber."
7511838,79919204,2016-06-15,14564571,Leslie,"Though I did not meet Todd in person, he provided a good place to stay. Given the proximity to Harvard, most of the other guests had some connection to the university (or other universities), which made for some very good conversations. Every one was respectful of the shared spaces (kitchen, living room and bathroom), and respectful of quiet hours (10pm), which made for an easy stay. I would recommend a stay here if you'd like to meet some interesting people!"

Als wir ein kleines Problem mit dem Schließen des Fensters hatten, hat Todd auf Anfrage sofort jemanden vorbei geschickt, um das Problem zu beheben. Todd war immer per Mail zu erreichen und hat schnell geantwortet. Der Zugang zum Haus verlief reibungslos. Das Haus ist auch mit öffentlichem Nahverkehr gut zu erreichen, wenn man raus hat welche Bus-und Bahnlinien wo fahren."
7511838,95133982,2016-08-18,37357252,Lisa,"This place is beautifully decorated and comfortable. When I come back this way, I will stay here again. Todd always answer all my questions"
7511838,95977714,2016-08-21,29955145,Elizabeth,It was easy to access the place and check in. The unit is clean and very nice. It has a wonderful backyard terrace and backyard for your use. The shower and bathrooms are very nice too. No complaints - however know that you are renting a room in an apt so there is minimal privacy and a lot of noise
11563716,67246918,2016-03-27,8812997,Jude,The unit was as described.  The check in and check out process was easy.  The parking was not as easy but the front desk helped to clarify what we should do.
11563716,68454955,2016-04-05,9677721,Irina,"The apartment were awesome, very clean, comfy, stylish and cozy. Location is also great. The host was extremely helpful, operative and fast with all the requests. I definitely can recommend this flat! It was the place we've stayed during our 2 weeks trip."
11563716,69783053,2016-04-13,64017377,Angela,I booked Mike's apartment on behalf of four colleagues of mine visiting from the Netherlands. I heard they had a wonderful stay and very much enjoyed their time in Boston and were very happy with Mike's apartment. Communication with Mike was easy and we had no issues arranging this stay.
11563716,74015102,2016-05-12,7586477,Jack,Very new luxury complex. Apartment was very modern and comfortable. Neighbourhood still under construction - will be vibrant in a few months. Really enjoyed my stay.
11653496,70758620,2016-04-20,39731520,Susan,"Jonathan was very responsive to questions both before we arrived and to needs after we arrived.  The place was very clean and as pictured.  It had great access to public transportation, and the neighborhood was nice.  The pizza place on the corner doesn't look like much, but makes very good food, and there is a nice sports bar near the train station.  We were expecting to be able to do breakfast in, but there is not a toaster or coffee pot in the apartment.  Luckily there is a Duncan Donut nearby, but both these small appliances would be good additions, as would some sharp knives, for those who want to cook in.   We stayed there with 6 adults and an infant.  Both beds are comfy, the 2 bathrooms are nice, the couch pull out a little uncomfortable.  Given the cost of rooms in Boston, this apt is worth the money and we would easily book this location again."

5659866,70632539,2016-04-19,19000466,Eli,"This Beacon Hill apartment exceeded our expectations (which were high!). The location is perfect. The apartment is spacious, clean and comfortable. It served as a great home base during my first Boston Marathon. I highly recommend!  Five stars all the way!"
1332786,5818249,2013-07-17,7357265,Kristie,"The Carneys were a dream! They are very warm and caring and I felt as though I was staying with family. They made my room very comfortable, helped me find my way around, and the house was beautiful and cozy. I'd never stayed in Boston before, and they made my travel very stress-free. I definitely would stay there again, and the place is also very close to the red line, which is convenient to everything in Boston."
1332786,6180202,2013-08-02,4996312,Marina,"My boyfriend stayed in carney's house last month for 15 days. Everything was perfect. Barney and his family are really good hosts, they're friendly and they are always around if you need something. The location is pretty good, in 10 minutes you can get to the subway station and 10 minutes by train you'll be in downtown."
I would recomend this room and also recomend the other room,my friends stayed there too and it was perfect.,,,,
the neighborhood is really nice,"the beach is 2 min walking from Carney's home and everyone is friendly there.\"",,,,
1332786,6434900,2013-08-12,5951410,Cristiano,"AWESOME! The Carney's are the best hosts in the world! I'm not kidding! After 26 hours of airports and flights from Brazil to Boston I arrived at Savin Hill Avenue around 8pm and Mary was waiting for me  on the street. After this reception Mary made me a delicious omelet (the omelet was not included on my bill). Barney made me a blended coffee every mornig. When I was leaving, Barney gave me a ride to the airport! This is better than a hotel. I´m serious, once in Boston stay here!"
1332786,6501292,2013-08-14,2853640,Ed,Stunning home.  Sweet and lovely hosts.  Do not miss!
1332786,6522182,2013-08-15,7364410,Nora-Laure,"I only stayed at the Carney's for 1 night (quick layover in Boston) but I enjoyed it very much. First, location is great its about 20 minutes to downtown (5-10 min walk to transit+10-15 min on red line to south station). It's also in a quiet neighborhood and seconds from a beach (seriously, the beach is like in their backyard...), a little cozy one in some sort of bay, with a boardwalk and little marina.  The house is also at a walking distance from JFK University of Massachusetts (5 min walk) and its long boardwalk to castle island (great for running)."
Amenities - this small cozy single bed room was adorable. I can't remember when I last slept in a single bed but all I can say is this one was very comfortable and the room had everything you need. A dresser,a desk and chair,a safe that fits a small computer and fresh towels,AC. The living space is shared with another room (of up to 2 people) and as I understand another room will soon be available.  You have access to a fully equipped kitchen,large bathroom,living room and porch.
Finally,the host: although  I didn't get to meet Barney,Mary was lovely and made sure I had everything I needed.,,,
:),,,,,
Ps: The only thing I would have change is to choose the red + silver line to get to the airport...I do not recommend it at rush hour. It's highly unreliable (silver line bus not arriving on schedule and getting stock 1h30 in traffic) it's better to take red,"then orange then blue line....\"",,,,
1332786,6551444,2013-08-16,1351104,Eric,"Première fois que je loue une chambre via airbnb. Habituellement je suis plutôt sur de la location d'appartement.

1332786,7136031,2013-09-08,1918039,Irving,I had a great time at the Carney's family house. I stayed there for 3 weeks and enjoyed every minute of it. The house was easy to find and close to the airport and T line. I worked at LMA and there is a free shuttle from JFK/UMass that takes you all the way.
The place was clean and they provided clean linens! The washing machine was also freely available for laundry.,,,,,
Internet was great. They also have free coffee every morning!,,,,,

1332786,12411978,2014-05-01,14399490,Sherry,Cute little room. Very clean. It's about 7 minutes away from the T which takes you straight to downtown Boston. I only went there at night to sleep and didn't see the hosts much but when they were there they were super nice. I would definitely stay here again.
1332786,12438831,2014-05-02,1748066,Una,"All I needed was a clean place to rest my head between meetings, but Barney's place offered so much more. Great location between the airport and downtown, a lovely view of the water, tasty coffee and muffins...even a bathrobe and slippers. I will definitely be back and hope to stay longer and explore the neighbourhood and boardwalk."
1332786,18644181,2014-08-30,12482509,Martin,"I am radiologist and came to Boston to do a training with Harvard and MEEI. I was living in this house four months and was an amazing experience. Barney, Mary and their sons are extremely friendly and very educated people...and a good family of musicians! They have a piano on the second floor and they allowed me to play it almost every day. The house is beautiful, comfortable and located in a lovely neighborhood. I totally recommend Carney Family. They are excellent hosts."

I spoke only briefly with Mary and Barney, but they were extremely affable and gave me all the direction I needed.

1332786,19061626,2014-09-05,18607361,Frank (And Meridith),"Great location in a quiet neighborhood right by the shore, but also a short walk to the Red Line and an even shorter walk to a couple of Zip Cars, if you're inclined to use them."
I appreciated the laundry,fruit,and most especially the fresh-made muffins every morning.,,,
Spikey's Sunporch is probably the smallest of their rooms; a narrow space with a single bed,"but the price cannot be beat.\"",,,,

The house is conveniently located about 5-6 minute walk from the Savin Hill T stop,which is only a few stops from the central downtown T stop.,,,,
Barney,my host,was gracious and offered advice on local tourist spots.  Most helpfully,he allowed me to drop my bags off early,and to leave them after checkout,so I didn't have to lug a suitcase around town all day.
Overall,"it was a pleasure to stay there and I highly recommend for a single person who needs a room in the Boston area!\"",,,,
1332786,19420076,2014-09-12,5665501,Nadja,"A great place to stay! Mary and Barney are really nice and eager to help you with any question or need you might have. The room is small but that's what makes it so cozy. If you need more space, you can use the living room, the kitchen (where you can find coffee, tea, orange juice, muffins, cereals, yogurts, fruit and much more for breakfast each morning!) or the porch. Or you can just walk through the backyard and go to the beach :) The neighborhoud is really safe, lots of beautiful old houses. It's just a short walk to the subway station which makes it easy to access all the sights downtown as well as the airport. It was also great that they allowed me to store my baggage in the living room for the whole day after checking out because my flight left in the evening - made things a lot easier for me! If I come back to Boston I will definitely stay there again!"
1332786,19484498,2014-09-13,20578112,Kimberly,"I felt welcome the moment I walked in the door. The Carney household is warm and inviting. I thoroughly enjoyed my rest and I felt safe and secure back on the sunporch. The room was clean and well thought out, there was a water pitcher and a robe, a nice writing dest desk and a small wardrobe. The shared space was a living room, a kitchen and a bathroom. There was coffee/ tea at all times, a fruit bowl for a quick banana grab as I was out the door.  I couldn't have asked for more. Highly recommended!"
1332786,19744885,2014-09-17,20665610,Kym,This was an excellent stay. It was a little sun porch that had been converted but that was all the space I needed. Both the hosts and other guests were very friendly. It was easy to get to and they let me drop my car off before my room was ready and would have let me keep the car there longer if I had wanted to. I would happily stay here again.

The muffins baked fresh each morning were delicious! There's a house keeper that cleans daily who is very nice. Barney and Mary were sweet and made my experience  smooth from great directions to the house to communications via emails and phone calls.  They were always available when I needed them! People who stayed with Mary and Barney while I was there were all kind, trusting, and fun to be around. I would highly recommend the place. I'm looking forward to returning soon!!"
"Mary and Barney are such wonderful people with good hearts. I'm very thankful to have had them as hosts. \"",,,,,
1332786,20096917,2014-09-23,20027048,Sanford,Mary and Barney provided excellent directions in advance and had no trouble finding it and checking in.  The room is small and comfortable and was perfect for my quick trip in and out to Boston. The subway is a short walk and saved me $25 in downtown parking fees.
1332786,20239629,2014-09-26,8975054,Amy,"A really lovely house in a fantastic location, with the beach just outside the back door.  So easy to get into town too on the subway.  Although I did not see them much, the Carneys were helpful and friendly.  Barney helped me to find accommodation as I wanted to stay one more night and they were fully booked, which was really appreciated.  The house was very clean, and the sunporch, cozy but cute!  Would definitely stay if ever in Boston again."
1332786,20308279,2014-09-27,21331664,Mary,"My stay at the carney house was completely lovely. The house is absolutely gorgeous, and the room was perfect for what I needed on my last day in boston, which was a lot of sleep. There was chilled water waiting for me in the room upon arrival which was a nice touch, and lots of food is provided for breakfast which was great. Barney and I chatted before leaving and he was pleasant and warm. Great value and great stay."
1332786,20512242,2014-09-30,14010861,Greg,"My host realized that I had never been in a situation with out a car, never been on public transportation and was unfamiliar with Boston. So he hand wrote two pages of instructions, walked me down to the station, (1/2 mile?) personally saw to my buying the rail tickets, and wished me luck. Lucky me what a great experience. Barney completely made the trip. Thanks"
1332786,20842550,2014-10-06,6867104,Candy,"I had a wonderful stay at Carney's! Everything is 5-star standard, but much more of a cozy home touch! They provide high quality beddings, towels and other necessities and of course very good breakfast! The house is beautifully decorated, clean and Carney's are welcoming and warm. I enjoyed reading the book Historical Walk in Boston on the table, which gave me better and different ideas of how to see the city. It's also very close to the beach, and I had good walks on the beach. Easily accessible to the downtown and Harvard too! Everything is perfect at Carney's. I feel so relaxed and inspired. And Boston is a very lovely city too!"
1332786,20911094,2014-10-07,2144465,Daniel And Juliann,"Impeccable hospitality: room better than description, robe and slippers for the bath, spotless space, tasteful and comfortable furnishings, quiet, coffee, fruit and oatmeal for breaky."
1332786,20969923,2014-10-08,21706940,Shengwei,"I arrived about 10pm and stayed for one night; the community was pretty quite and safe. I met Mary briefly but didn't get a chance to talk with her. The house locates at the end of Savin Hill Avenue (turn right after exiting the metro station). The walls seem to have been re-modeled (without paintings for now). Curtains has been replaced with blinders. The sofa and standing light have been moved out, while you can always sit by the desk or rest on the couch outside. The muffin and coffee was pretty good for a fresh  start in the morning. Thanks!"
1332786,21295995,2014-10-14,6064281,Steven,The cozy sun porch was spotless and very comfortable. Definitely enjoyed my stay there!
1332786,21423190,2014-10-17,7130393,Laurel,"I had an incredible experience with the Carney family! Their home is very lovely and clean, and I was lucky enough to meet Mary, who was helpful and informative on the area. The room was perfect as well."
1332786,21656619,2014-10-21,18963669,Kyra,"What a wonderful place! I spent 3 days in Boston, exploring the city. Staying with the Carney's was very comfortable. The sunporch is cosy, like advertised it's small, but it has plenty of space. The shared bathroom (share with 1 other room) is large and clean, like the rest of the house."
It's walking distance from the T,yet very close to the beach and in a very safe neighbourhood.,,,,
Both Mary and Barney were very kind and helpful,the muffins are great.,,,,
I got to meet some other people that were also staying at the house,"making this trip even better.\"",,,,
1332786,21749917,2014-10-23,12096536,Marie,"Thanks to the Carneys for making my 3 night stay welcoming and easy to maneuver. Pre visit and directions were great. The space met my needs. Working in Boston and a long commute always has me looking for alternatives that fit my budget. Spikey's Sunporch was the right size. Even though the bathroom was a share, one would never know. I never had issues with use or waits. The kitchen was a great addition although I didn't need it this visit. I did appreciate the muffins and fruit in the morning. The neighborhood is a hidden Boston gem. I parked and walked one evening to a great restaurant to meet friends. I will surely be back."
1332786,21904430,2014-10-26,22285671,Jieun,"It was nice and cozy place, very clean and quite. It works really good for me."
1332786,22109470,2014-10-30,21011440,Caitlin,"This was a wonderful AirBnB experience!  The neighborhood is lovely and safe.  The house is beautiful and well maintained.  Very easy walk to the T.  Mary and Barney both contacted me before my arrival to be sure I knew how to get to the house.  I arrived just before Mary went to bed for the night and she was very kind and told me about the place and offered her assistance with any questions that may come up.  I stayed in the Cozy Sunporch room.  It was clean and just what I needed - a place to sleep.  They even have water in your room for you upon arrival.  A variety of breakfast items are available in the morning including fresh fruit, yogurt, and homemade muffins which were delicious.  It had a very homey feel and Mary and Barney were very kind and welcoming, though I did not see them much.  I would definitely stay here again! Thank you Mary and Barney!"
1332786,22233651,2014-11-02,20926243,Krystin,This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was fantastic. My host went to every effort to make my stay comfortable and easy. The room was as described but with the added bonus of being individually heat-controlled and having a nice robe and slippers. It was only a 15 minute walk from UMass Boston and was situated in a beautiful old neighborhood with a park. I would certainly stay here again.
1332786,22329611,2014-11-03,22736510,Charles,I was only here for one night but it was very enjoyable. I arrived late and it was like an oasis in the night. Barney and I communicated by text and he was very responsive. I found the house to be very open and inviting. My room was everything I could have hoped for. Comfortable and clean! In fact the whole house was spotless! There were also a lot of amenities such as a robe and slippers. I slept well through a wind storm in a VERY warm bed. Wish I could have stayed longer...I'll be back!
1332786,22456006,2014-11-07,4688108,Marta,"A perfect place to rest when you are in Boston. The house is super cozy, nice and comfortable. As a plus: they provide you with homemade muffins as a breakfast! :)"
"I 100% recommend this place.\"",,,,,
1332786,22766620,2014-11-14,22550665,Phillip,"Accurate description, great room for the price. About an 8 minute walk to the T. The sun room does not have an attached bathroom, you have to walk through kitchen to get to one, but this was never an issue. Would stay here again."
1332786,22960909,2014-11-18,20737357,Katy,A beautiful house with warm and welcoming hosts.  I had a wonderful stay. Thank you.
1332786,23009968,2014-11-20,20532552,Glenda,"This location is warm and inviting. The communication was impeccable. The doors to the rooms are well marked. The room was perfect, (I needed a quiet place to study for the night). The atmosphere is quiet and cordial among those sharing the house."
1332786,23087548,2014-11-22,1723313,Brad,"My stay with the Carney Family in their sunporch was overall a good value. I will be honest and say that the setup was different than any other AirBnB I've been to in the past. This room is basically an added-on small room separated from the living room by a thinner wall with windows. They provided very specific directions about where to park and how to enter when I arrived, which I appreciated! From what I could tell, the setup was basically a very large house with a separated upstairs/downstairs plan. I'm still not positive, but it seemed like they rent out several rooms on the bottom floor and stay on the top floor themselves? When I arrived there were a few girls sitting in the living room, who I think I surprised a little so it felt somewhat uncomfortable at first. Barney came in after a few minutes and apologized for the coldness of the room and noted that there was a bit of a misunderstanding about my arrival time and that he hadn't yet turned on the heater. The room itself was furnished well for a small space and the bed was as pictures-- a single/twin bed. They had towels all prepped for use in the room and a laminated sheet with house rules and wifi info."
The rest of the stay was a little iffy for me. I needed to sleep earlyish (~10pm) and the noise and light from the common area outside made it a little difficult. I have to be honest about the temperature in the room-- it was cold... like,really cold (I would guess 60F max). I felt the floor heaters on and I tried to turn them up,but they put out minimal heat from start to finish of my stay. It was exceptionally cold outside so I can understand,but I wish there was a larger heater or instructions on how to make it warmer. I could have asked so I have to take some blame,but I didn't really know who to ask so I felt uncomfortable roaming around.,
The off street parking was fantastic! The neighborhood is nice and quiet and seemed very safe.,,,,,
The airport for me was a 14 minute drive at 4am in the morning.,,,,,
Also-- like others mentioned,you have to walk through the kitchen to the bathroom. I thought for sure this shared bathroom would be a problem,but I was able to use it without waiting the 2 times I had to!,,,
Overall: This was a very quick 9 hour stay for me and,despite the aforementioned issues,I still felt like it was a good value. I wish I would have been more forward about asking for help warming up the room,"but live and learn. I can see that on warmer days this would be a great affordable stay!\"",,
1332786,23411323,2014-11-30,15934938,Kun,"The only word for this place and people is AMAZING! This is my first time to use airbnb, I didn't expect everything would be perfect, but it is! The cozy bedroom and living room, super clean bathroom, well furnished kitchen.... and most importantly, the host family is so nice and friendly! I forgot to bring my adapter then Barney lent me one. He helps me a lot, I don't know how to thank him..."
1332786,23746402,2014-12-09,20628398,辉,The  Carney Family can`t not be better! They`re super nice. The room I book before was wrong with heater and they changed a bigger room for us. Everything is perfect and just fantastic as description. It is a great experience and we will definitely would like to be Carney`s guest when we come here next time. Strongly recommend.
1332786,27524359,2015-03-06,12096536,Marie,I can't express enough gratitude to the Carney's for the availability of Spikey's Sunporch at the last minute. Weather conditions affected my plans and they were able to assist.
It is the smallest room in their house but it was my second time staying in it. It is actually very lovely and comfortable.,,,,,

1332786,29911926,2015-04-14,25880652,Marco,Great and comfortable room in a typical american house. The quartier is very quiet and you are near the JFK library and UMass campus. The host and his family are very nice people that welcome you with a lot of information and news about the city life. It's near the Saving Hill T station of red line and in a few minutes you can arrive in the city center at Boston Common. It was very good to stay there.

1332786,63956149,2016-02-28,58835684,Lisa,Yes-  door was open and soft lights on made it very welcoming after a long day and night of working.  Room was small but it worked for me-  they have bigger rooms available!
1332786,64447187,2016-03-04,28018161,Julie,The Carney's are incredible hosts. The house is spotless and care is taken to little details. Fresh cold water awaits you along with thick terry bathrobe and slippers. The muffins are awesome. Over the past few weeks I have felt like I am coming home despite being far from my real home.
1332786,64582916,2016-03-05,38912062,Charles,"A wonderful place to stay. Warm, cozy, gorgeous Victorian-type home, spotless & impeccably maintained.

Looking forward to staying here again someday. 5 stars."

Barney and Mary thought of everything, down to the specific house rules that were conveniently posted in the rooms and the delicious breakfast muffins and fruit that popped up in the kitchen.  I was excitedly pleased with the Carney hospitality as well as friendliness of the others staying at this b & b.  For sure, I hope to return here!"

1332786,66051418,2016-03-19,22416335,Parisa,"My stay was awesome! It was close to subway (red line) and the neighborhood was safe! It was close to Savin hill cove, really close! You could enjoy drinking coffee and having a delicious muffin on the balcony while looking at bay! When I stayed here the weather was so cold, but I think in summer it will be more enjoyable! The home was clean and I have done self check in which was so convenient and it was the most possible flexible way. The hosts were so nice, although we had a small conversation. The only problem was that the room was cold, and I could not find the controlling temperature box. Overall, I liked the place and I will definitely go back."

The Savin Hill neighborhood is lovely and safe, located just outside of Boston but easily and quickly accessible by the red T train. The house is beautiful, well maintained and very clean. Barney provided excellent directions in advance. The room is located on the ground floor and perfect for a single person. A living room, a kitchen and a bathroom are shared with other guests (which were very nice). Highly recommended!"

Barney emailed me ahead of time to inform me how to travel to and from his place, and also arranged a stress-free self check-in/ check-out process. There is ample natural lighting in the sunporch. A bathrobe, slippers, water, safe and pens (inside the desk drawer) are provided in the room :) The room isn't furnished exactly as in the picture, but the necessities were still kept in the room. I stayed around for one of the afternoons and was able to enjoy listening to a band practice going on in the basement. As my plans did not allow me to stay around the house for too long, I did not have the honour of interacting much with the Carney family. However, it was still a very warm and homey place in a safe and quiet neighbourhood to stay in Boston/ Dorchester."

1332786,79199351,2016-06-11,29661934,Connie,"Very kind hosts and a nice value for a place to stay not too far from downtown Boston. The room was very small but adequate for my needs. I very much enjoyed the muffins and granola that were provided in the mornings. The walk to the T was convenient, only 7 minutes. Others considering staying here should note that this room shares a bathroom with another Air BnB room -- but I believe there were 3 or 4 people staying in that room while I was there, so working around each other's bathroom schedules was at times tricky. (Note: there are 2 other bathrooms that can be used if they are free, but they are up 2 flights of stairs, and it was hard for me at 7 months pregnant to make that trek with a full bladder ;) Also, the bed was on the harder side (but again, take my opinion with a grain of salt, as I was sleeping on the bed as a very pregnant woman). Overall, a great experience with this host and rental."
1332786,79565669,2016-06-13,17357929,Joy,I had a wonderful visit to this home. There were so many friendly people staying here & the home was beautiful. It's a bit of a hike up the hill so if you have a lot of luggage I recommend getting a taxi. It's well worth it.

1332786,82615878,2016-06-28,12096536,Marie,"I am a regular at the Carney's. Because of work, I stay with them at least 3 x a month..more if they had available rooms. Wouldn't think of staying anywhere else."
1332786,82880658,2016-06-30,13360797,Jonathan,"I did not meet John during my stay at the CarneyFamily house, but he provided helpful detailed information (directions to the house and Wi-Fi). He was also responsive to all the questions I had. The room was as described, a lovely, clean and cozy room. The shared bathroom was good, did not even feel like I was sharing it. It was about a 10-15 min. walk from the Savin Hill station. Overall, I felt it was a great place to stay."
1332786,83377458,2016-07-02,63715207,Elliot,Quiet and safe neighborhood. Typical American neighborhood you would see from the movies
1332786,83840272,2016-07-04,68579800,Josephine,Staying at the Carney's was a very pleasant and 100% comfortable. The neighborhood is close to the Red Line and feels safe. The blueberry muffins and coffee in the morning were great touches. I recommend walking up the stairs to take a peek around the house; it's truly lovely and grandiose. I definitely will stay here again in the future!
1332786,84875148,2016-07-09,60282176,Michael,"They were super nice people. The house is beautiful, and everything was clean, neat.  I got there late, and wanted to eat, they took me in their car and found something to eat for me.  It's close to the subway, and the neighborhood was quite and friendly.  I would recommend this place to anyone."
1332786,88201161,2016-07-23,60559747,Jordan,"Mary and Barney were both very friendly and helpful! I loved the muffins, it was cool to meet other guests, and it was affordable too."
1332786,92190573,2016-08-07,44091191,Emily,Before my trip I emailed asking about the best way to get to the house from the airport and was provided with a really detailed response within a few hours.  This was followed up by what to do when arriving at the house and how to find the room.  I found this to be really helpful and the directions were very clear to follow.
The location is brilliant - the beach is just a short walk through the garden and the T station was a 10 minute walk away and made getting into Boston very easy.  The area was quiet and seemed very family-friendly.  The house itself is absolutely beautiful and was clean and well cared for.  For breakfast there was fruit,English muffins,homemade muffins and homemade granola on offer,as well as tea,coffee and orange juice.  The muffins and granola were amazing and were the perfect start to my day!,
The kitchen was well equipped and was great for preparing your own food.  The bathroom was a decent size and kept very clean,as was the lounge area.  The layout of the house and the sharing of spaces also enabled me to meet some of the other guests and this ranged from a quick hello to full conversations,which as someone travelling alone I found really nice!,,,
Mary and Barney were excellent hosts.  I didn't see them all of the time but they were always friendly when I did and I know that if I'd had any questions or problems I would have been able to approach them.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the house and I know that that played a big part in how much I enjoyed my trip to Boston.  I hope to visit again in the future and would definitely stay at Mary and Barney's,and would recommend them to anyone looking into visiting the area!  Beautiful house,brilliant hosts,fantastic breakfast,"great location and really reasonable rates - I couldn't have asked for more!\"",
1332786,92717334,2016-08-09,47776846,Sunga,"Mary and John were very great host. They let me to leave my luggage and stay at home even after the check out time. Thanks to their consideration, I could have more safe trip. They are also good communicators. When I have a problem or just ask something, they answer me right away by the message. The room was very neat and clean. Entire house was clean enough and comfortable. The best place and the best host I have ever met! I want to recommend to anyone who travel around Boston. Thank you!"
1332786,93514759,2016-08-13,8764751,Gertrud,"Hands down one of the best Air BnB stays I've had. The Carneys know exactly what it means to be excellent hosts and how to provide comfort and care for weary travellers. The gorgeous home, being a family homestead, also has a lot of 'heart' - it was one of the first things that struck me when I arrived - and the location, with it's stone throw coastal access, is a great respite from downtown Boston yet only a few subway stops away. Highly recommended."
1332786,93626659,2016-08-13,85894545,Matthew,Thank you! My first Abnb and they have set the bar very high. Cozy sunroom. Beach in the backyard. Very hospitable. I will be back

1332786,98732222,2016-09-01,24677901,Caitlin,"Great place. I only stayed for a night. Room is exactly as described, with host giving clear and concise directions/instructions. This made the arrival easy. For those visiting Boston and unfamiliar with the area, it's a bit far from the conventional tourist sites. But it's a quiet place to stay if you'd like to be away from all of that."
7634365,42809047,2015-08-15,28409343,Yi,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.

7634365,47388597,2015-09-18,14713366,Office,"In short: awesome place in an awesome location! The Ink Block is a hip new location and the apartment comes with all the luxury you would expect from such location; full kitchen, multiple bed and bathrooms, airconditioning and even a swimming pool. Did I mention you’re on the same block as the biggest and best WholeFoods Market in Boston? Or that you can get great and cheap sushi from Irashai in Chinatown (Washington and Kneeland) only a couple of blocks away? The location is a 15 minutes walk away from South Station, or you could take the Hubway bike from the Ink Block and take the bike into town. Thumbs up from me, I would certainly recommend this location to anyone."
7634365,52800142,2015-11-01,36107747,Grant,"Lovely place, good value and couldnt have been easier to arrive...perfect"
7634365,56336214,2015-12-12,2706189,Christy,The communication with Flatbook was extensive.  They had a number of different customer service representatives check in with us.  The place was very modern and clean and it is in an up and coming neighborhood.  We loved having the Peet's and Whole Foods right below us.  The one drawback was the highway was a bit noisy at night but not terrible.
7634365,56953208,2015-12-20,43093926,Ken,"A spotless, contemporary apartment...easy check-in and a quick walk to food shopping, Southie, and the South End...building is right next to the highway so expect that traffic hum...would definitely stay here again."
7634365,57311468,2015-12-24,49285764,Shahiza,"It was my first airbnb experience and it was amazing. The place was exactly how the picture shows and if not, better! My family and I were very impressed. It was very comfortable and getting around the city wasn't hard at all. It was also extremely convenient to have Whole Foods Market downstairs and Chinatown not too far away. Wished we had stayed there longer. Overall experience was incredible! Definitely recommend staying here and would definitely come back in the future!"
7634365,59219671,2016-01-08,6365935,Annie,Great apartment two beds two baths . Perfect for two couples. Fantastic whole food market in the building. Good concierge service. Would recommend if visiting Boston!

7634365,61301794,2016-02-02,8171056,Matthew,"The unit and facilities were top notch, all the comforts of home and the convenience of a hotel. The location was about a 8 min walk to the train station. I would stay here again."
7634365,63352221,2016-02-22,1312914,Diana,"The apartment is great. Very clean and spacious. It's located right above Whole Foods, and has Peet's Coffee right downstairs. It's also about a 10min walk to restaurants, bars, etc. Highly recommend it."
7634365,63799201,2016-02-27,55625452,Sarah,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay - the flat was very bright and well equipped, and everything was much more spacious than you might expect for a short stay apartment. The lobby area of the block was very hip, with some great spaces to relax. We traveled with our kids, so the Whole Foods right downstairs was really useful to us. The location of the place was great, with transport links not far away, some parts of the city walkable, and everything else just a short taxi ride away."
7634365,64458767,2016-03-04,31219644,Akriti,"Great place and great views. Flatbook was very accommodating with dates too, since I'd extended my stay close to the end of the trip. Everything is as described. Would recommend!"
7634365,66553874,2016-03-23,61944239,Stephen,"We had a great experience renting this property.  The apartment in in a modern building with excellent, helpful receptionist services, and easy 24-hour access.  The apartment itself is as pictured--modern, clean and well-appointed.  We all agreed this was one of the nicest apart-hotel experiences we have ever had, owing to the features (e.g. water/dryer, dishwasher, cable, internet, etc.) and the modernity of the property."
Flatbook,the corporate owners of the property,left a nice little booklet with information on the Wifi,restaurants and sites in the area which we found helpful.  We had absolutely no negative experiences with getting in and out of the property--it was exactly as advertised.,,
This property is on the edge of Chinatown,about a 15 minute walk from Boston Common.  I would say it is convenient,but not really central to anything we wanted to see,so we did a lot of walking during our weekend there (not necessarily a bad thing).,,
One important thing to know--there is a Whole Foods literally downstairs from he apartment,which was great for stocking up on supplies very conveniently.,,,,
"You will be very pleased if you rent this property.  \"",,,,,
7634365,67064439,2016-03-26,28278390,Frances,"Lovely place, brand new and modern, in a great part of town. Conveniently located above a whole foods, peet's coffee, and walking distance to many restaurants and bars."
7634365,68977568,2016-04-08,60613474,Kay,Apartment is exactly as listed and was spotlessly clean. Very comfortable and a great place to relax in. The only slight downside was the constant background noise of the traffic.
7634365,69693407,2016-04-12,42427565,Greg,"Easy check in. Space was just as advertised. Nice, clean and convenient to many areas of the city. Onsite staff were friendly, helpful. Flatbook was also good about checking in to see if we needed anything. Nice experience in Boston"
7634365,69851085,2016-04-14,45917320,Tim,Great location easy to Uber/Taxi to Convention Center. Whole Foods downstairs is perfect. Next to highway but soothing sounds versus real noise. Bright and modern. Great security and comfortable beds and amenities.
7634365,73415282,2016-05-08,36855358,Corey,This was a great listing. Everything was as promised. The location was very handy to the centre of the city and getting around was easy. The Whole Foods downstairs was a bonus.
The apartment was extremely clean and well equiped. The team were very well organised and made sure that we were happy at all times. The communication was excellent. The handbook was a great guide to the apartment and the city in general.,,,,,
If you stay there you must try Myers + Chang just down the road. Fantastic food,"but I would advise to book a table as it is is very popular. \"",,,,
7634365,74537014,2016-05-15,28352952,Jon,"Apartment was prepared to an excellent standard, check in was very easy. We found a well equipped kitchen and everything else in working order. The whole building had a good save feel about it, and we were able to use the outside shared areas, although the swimming pool was not open at the time went. We understand that it will be soon. It was a good 15 minute walk to the theatre district, South Station or Boston Common. It was close to major freeways and there was always a general traffic hum but sleep was not disturbed. We would definitely recommend it."
7634365,76975354,2016-05-30,32435238,David,"This is a terrific, modern, cool apartment. Loved everything about it.  It's right next to a Whole Foods so you can buy stuff without any hassle.  Starbucks is a short walk away too.  The apartment was clean, stylish and the gym was terrific.  The staff was super helpful.  I highly recommend it!"
7634365,77575245,2016-06-01,39830403,Denis,"Very nice appartment within walking distance of everything. Grocery store close by is very convenient. We recommend putting more dishes and dishtowels in the appartment. Recommend trying to re-directe air from air conditionning in master bedroom away from bed. Overall, we enjoyed our trip and appartment was a contributing factor."
7634365,77978416,2016-06-04,36285311,Chong-U,Words cannot begin to describe how happy my family and I were with this apartment by Flatbook. What immediately struck us before we even arrived was Flatbook's amazing team who responded so quickly and responsively to any questions and requests we had.
Next,the apartment was BEAUTIFUL. We were totally blown away by how clean,modern,and immaculate the place was. People,what you see in the pictures is exactly what you get! My entire family of four were so comfortable in the apartment. Whatever you may need or require is right there in the apartment - whether it's washing pods,cups and plates
The flat is large and the living room such a nice and cozy place to gather together to have breakfast together in the morning,or have dinner together at night. The rooms are gorgeous,and the amenities downstairs are so good.,,,
"Flatbook: you have done an amazing job; We are thinking of modeling our own dream house after this flat. Thank you so much!\"",,,,,

We loved the location in the lively south end and it was close enough to walk to the key tourist spots (or take the T if feeling tired!). The pool and fitness centre were a big plus. Wholefoods downstairs made healthy & delicious eating convenient and easy. First experience of Airbnb and will certainly be booking again."
7634365,88277411,2016-07-23,53782807,Diana,"Great communication, great accommodation, great location. All was as expected and facility was modern, clean and comfortable. Great stay!"
7634365,92929195,2016-08-10,32639746,Boris,Excellent location! We loved the apartment from the first moment. The Whole Foods in the same block is a great plus! All in all a fantastic stay in Boston.
7634365,94985434,2016-08-17,61796722,Kathy,"The Flatbook staff was truly amazing. They responded to questions quickly and accurately, even on a Sunday. Great customer service. The modern condo was perfect in every way: laundry, pool, security, air mattress (a happy surprise), two bathrooms, private master, view of the city and pool.  My husband and I stayed with our two college-age kids who loved it as well. Would also be perfect for two couples traveling together. Having a pool to come back to after sightseeing was another huge plus. The other advantage is having a Whole Food below. On day one, we stocked up on some breakfast food and found the kitchen well-equiped to handle light cooking. We loved being a few blocks from Chinatown and took advantage of some fantastic restaurants. We are in fairly good shape so we parked (a garage on Beach Street between Harrison and Washington) and walked/Uber'ed everywhere. We didn't use the fitness center but it looked decent. Highly recommend the Go Boston card (we scored a deal through Groupon). Only downside: no longterm parking super close."

Everything was in walking distance. There is a huge range of excellent cafes/restaurants within very close range and the tourist sites and shipping very close. Anne's place is spacious, clean and bright. Anne was easily contactable - checking in and out so no problem and we were able to leave our suitcases with the concierge on our day of check out as our plane home was later in the day.

12890156,81732174,2016-06-24,540125,James,Great place in South End. Lots of space inside and a nice back deck. Location was near transportation and lots of good restaurants.
12890156,82392187,2016-06-27,72571889,Matthew,Daniel's apartment was in a beautiful area only 15 min walk to Boston Commons and other downtown goodies. He was very accommodating and the stay was fantastic.  Back porch was a nice and relaxing touch.

12890156,92351060,2016-08-08,74916159,Douglas,"Location, location, location. Great apartment, on a really nice street, in a really nice neighborhood. 1 block from a 10 block section of SW Corridor Park, 5-10 minute walk from Copley Square, Back Bay Station, Mass Ave T. Restaurants, bars, cafes, a local market and a wine/beer store all either right around the corner or a few blocks away. Convenient check in/out. What more can you ask for."

10266397,72178435,2016-05-01,68438491,Darcy,The apartment is fine.  The pictures look better than in person. Don't expect any personal touches or even the normal amenities you would receive in a hotel.  There will not be any ice and the bedroom is very sunny So be prepared to be up bright and early.  The location is good but we would have had a much better experience staying in a hotel nearby for the Same price but with a lot more convenience.  Even Being two young and fit adults... The 5 story flight of stairs was a pain and we were unable to check our luggage in early which put a huge problem

10266397,73399577,2016-05-08,26583751,Johanna,"This first experience that I had with AirBNB was a pleasant one. The space was exactly how it looked and it was spacious for the two of us. There could have been enough space if you wanted to have 3/4, by adding a air mattress along side the bed."
I however,didn't expect the 3 floor walk up. But if I wasn't doing a walking tour of the sights or the neighborhood I would have frowned upon that little note that was no mentioned in the review.,,,,
All in all the place was perfect and I was happy that I had this opportunity,if I plan on going back to Boston,I will definitely be looking at this group when I look at the neighborhoods.,,,
"Thanks for making it a great one. \"",,,,,
10266397,78422284,2016-06-06,48360918,Eric,"Access to the apartment was quite easy. Unfortunately, it was a fourth floor walk up with very narrow stairs. The apartment was quite small but clean. The kitchen was extremely small. The building is quite old and many parts of the apartment had been renovated. The Internet was extremely slow and I wasn't able to stream video. I called the helpline with some questions and problems and they were very helpful."
I was aware that Boston is a very expensive rental market,and most hotel rooms are about $300 a night. This cost over $200 a night,but frankly I should have stayed in a hotel,"which would've been more accessible and more user friendly.\"",,
11662212,79276710,2016-06-12,61533362,Aura Angelica,"without a doubt my best airbnb was all I had in united states, knowing that Erika and Liam would be so great hosts my stay in Boston would have been more days."
His attentions from that book the room,were immediate,starting with communication,welcomed me and indications of how to get to his house (metro and bus). The day of my departure from new york to boston were very attentive to know my arrival time,I even waited at the bus stop to take me to his house.,
I was welcomed with a glass of water,like my boyfriend who accompanied me,equally,with some bread with butter cute Erika had prepared to greet us. His house is divine and fabulous fourth,much more than wait for me,the bed is to rest spectacularly and the bathroom is very spacious
The next morning gave us a delicious breakfast with breads made by herself and her husband Liam cooked us a coffee. They let us directions on how to go to Boston and back,(SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps though everything is easy to learn to move in any city.,,,,
Erika is a wonderful and charming woman,an excellent host,is very concerned about the welfare to stay at home,it is attentive and especially their way to resolve any issues or concerns that are within reach.,,

They offered suggestions, they showed an interest in getting to know us as well as provided us our space. She is an amazing baker and made us breakfast the next morning and offered us cookies and other goodies that were delicious. Their place was about a 30min bus and Train ride but it felt less than that, it was farther outside of Boston, but their hospitality, helpfulness, and price made it so very worth it. My husband and I would stay here again in a heartbeat! PS. That bed was the best 3 nights sleep we have had on our cross country road trip so far! :)"

The house and room were clean, the bed (king size!) was comfortable, and Erika (who showed us around the house when we arrived) was very friendly and accomodating. She invited us to dinner with them, although we already had dinner plans, and she also had a plate of homemade baked goodies that were great the next morning for breakfast. There was on-street overnight parking where we felt safe leaving our car, and check-out and check-in times were flexible. I would definitely stay here again."

11662212,84151677,2016-07-05,76547313,Donna,"They made us feel very welcomed by having their phone numbers in case of an emergency and also being able to describe how to get around Boston - using the mass transit and buses. They also provided a comfortable room, coffee maker, and Erika is a lovely cook and makes freshly baked bread for breakfast- with homemade jams."

Unfortunately, I did not have much interaction with the hosts but would like to!  Comfortable space.  Nice neighborhood. They did have a grown man who was a tenant in the room next to mine.  So, solo female travelers, I'm just letting you know.  Everything was fine, though, especially since there was no lock on the door. I was fine. Enjoyed my stay and going back three days at the end of my trip!!!!!! Yea!  Another good Airbnb experience."

Erika proves to be a very nice and friendly host, who would go to lengths to make you feel welcome and at home. The contact beforehand was great and during our stay as well. She give us enough information about the thing to do around Boston. She even gave us a Charlie Card in order to get to the nearest Subway Station by bus. Her home backed brownies as a farewell treat were delicious. The room was spacious and the bed slept fine. The bathroom was clean. There are even necessities for guest in case you forgot to bring your own. We really loved our stay."
11662212,87031622,2016-07-18,79142376,Beverly,"The house was just as described and very comfortable. Uber prices to the local subway station were extremely low which made getting in and out of the main city quite easy for us.

She was extremely friendly but also gave us our privacy.  She make us an amazing upside down strawberry cake that I'm still dreaming about. Her house was very homey and had a warm inviting atmosphere.  The bedroom was extremely clean and her house is located in a great area to explore Boston.  I absolutely would recommend her house to any of my friends and family.  I encourage anyone planing a weekend get away to book with her.  I definitely will be booking with her again the the future.

11662212,92324009,2016-08-08,80713849,Maria,"My friend Matt and I stayed with Erika and Liam Friday night and Saturday night. The drive Friday was a little hectic, but it was nice to check into such a welcoming house after being on the road for 8 1/2 hours. Erika and I had been in constant contact through email and some text messages. They left the key in the mail box and we put our stuff down. We were visiting my sister who is currently interning in Boston. So we didn't get back to the room until about 12 midnight. We met Liam right before we left and he was very nice. Even though we didn't actually meet Erika, through the messages we sent back and forth, she was very friendly and wanted to accommodate us in any way possible. They left two water bottles in our room, along with maps of Boston, the internet information, and their contact numbers. They made our stay very comfortable, even though we didn't really see them. I would recommend this Airbnb to friends and family and I would stay again in a heartbeat if I am every in Boston for a second time. Thank you so much!!"

In their fantastic house ,closer to a huge mansion actually, they received my wife and I with warmth and generosity. The room is spacious and features an extra hammock space plus interesting personal stuff. The three bathrooms are shared. What we really enjoyed was that we could participate in the day to day life of the household that also included some truly sympathetic post doc students. But at the same time it was very private if we needed it. The subway is a few minutes walk from the house and therefore an excellent base to explore the city. Last but not least we were lucky to experience that Bruce really is an excellent chef indeed! We know where to return to when in Boston. Tot ziens!"

Both men are amazing hosts, offering us excellent tips about local restos and attractions, and inviting us to participate in their daily household life such as sharing brunch and going to the ballet. Their home is beautifully decorated. Our room was on the top floor - cozy and warm. The bathroom is like a spa, and even though it was shared, this was not an issue at all. Great  location and safe neighbourhood, just 7-10 min walk to the convenient red T line, which links very well to downtown and Cambridge. There were other guests as well, all post-secondary students, which created a very enjoyable social atmosphere. Overall, we hope to return!"

Most people living in the house are professional/grad students temporarily doing the Boston education thing.  They are up out and very early it seems.  The house is surprisingly quiet for the amount of rooms/people and proximity to the freeway along the shore.  Also, 2.5 baths in the house are completely adequate even though there are quite a few people using them; Bruce has given everyone a caddy to allow for flexibility - dorm style except with very well appointed quarters."
Bruce is friendly and kind and went out of his way to make sure I met/knew about everyone.  Breakfast included a lot of options but was of the continental breakfast genre.  I didn't spend much time there - was in town for a conference - but all my needs were addressed.,,,,,

1454258,8677526,2013-11-11,9814371,Emily,"Had an incredible visit at Bruce's home. The photos don't give the house justice. This was one of the more unique places I have stayed but also one of the more memorable. Bruce is a fantastic host and felt more like an old friend then a stranger whose home I was staying in. Both Bruce and Barry were very helpful in giving directions (and even a ride) to the nearby T Station. I would recommend this home to anyone looking to stay in Boston. Also felt very safe, as two females traveling alone it can be a bit intimidating staying in a new city but never once did either of us worry. Felt very safe and taken care of. Thanks Bruce and Barry!"
1454258,8742775,2013-11-15,9422023,Carole,"Nous avons passé 4 nuits chez Bruce et Gary. La maison est accueillante, très bien située, à quelques minutes de la ligne rouge du métro, et nos hôtes sont charmants et attentionnés. Nous avons beaucoup apprécié notre séjour."
1454258,8856363,2013-11-22,9209654,Richard And Kathy,"This is a wonderful place to stay. Bruce and Barry are generous hosts and the accommodation is very comfortable indeed. The house is a short walk to the train which takes you downtown in a few minutes. Bruce let us park our car off the street which was kind of him. I would strongly recommend this B&B. If you're coming to Boston, this is the place to stay."
1454258,8919243,2013-11-25,10097759,Corinna Und Till,"I stayed for a weekend at Bruces and Barrys House. It was wonderful. Both of them are extremly helpful. They had a lot of suggestions  for me to go and they invited me to join dinner with them. It was delicious. Bruce is a wonderful cook. On Saturday Bruce invited me to go with him and two other guests to the Christmastree Lightning. Although I was travelling alone I feel never lonly at these beautiful place. My room was really nice, I enjoyed the view over the see. I will come back. Warmly recommended!"
1454258,12108405,2014-04-23,9140399,Sesselja,"Me and my husband stayed with Bruce and Barry for four nights over the Easter, during the Boston marathon."
They made us feel just like home and did everything they could to make our stay with them memorable. The house is lovely and the room we got was very nice. The house is just a walking distance from the T line so you are just few minutes to go down town.,,,,,
I give Bruce and Barry my highest recomendation,they are very lovely and warm persons and I want stay with anyone else when I visit Boston again :-),,,,

1454258,14570419,2014-06-22,1187680,Annabelle,Charming house in a charming neighborhood. Bruce and Barry are the most hospitable hosts. My brother and I had a wonderful stay even though it was a very short stay just overnight. Bruce was thoughtful enough to set up an extra air bed for him in the room since there was only one bed. Would like to stay again in the future and maybe stay for longer.
1454258,14673860,2014-06-23,16550413,Julie,"\"My boyfriend and I stayed at Bruce and Barry's house for 2 nights back in June, and it was amazing! They are the best hosts we've met - they know the area and can direct us to very cool places that \"\"regular\"\" tourists wouldn't even hear about. They are extremely friendly and accommodating"
1454258,14871149,2014-06-28,15440885,Alex,"We had a great stay with Bruce!  The house was beautiful and in a great location, easy to walk to the T station and there were several restaurants within walking distance as well.  Bruce and Barry were very gracious hosts and I would highly recommend them to anyone!"
1454258,15110795,2014-07-02,9763810,Timo,"Well, what can I say.. The stay at Bruce' and Berry's house was just wonderfull. I have never felt more at home at another place :) They try very hard to make your stay an experience. The breakfast is always plentyful und diverse. They even prepared an amazing dinnerparty! They have always nice people around and the chance you meet other travellers is very high. The only lease a handful of rooms. The house is very clean but well decorated. The house is located in a quiete but good neighborhood. You can reach the subway in 8 min by food. The train runs every 10 min to the city and it takes you only 10 min to get to downtown."
1454258,15286490,2014-07-06,17267772,Cherrie,"Bruce and Berry were very nice hosts. We did not get to spend too much time with them since our schedule was packed during our two-night stay in Boston. The  house is artsy and well-maintained, and our room was cosy. Breakfast was good, with a lot of choices. On the Fourth of July they made a special dinner for all their guests from all over the world and we wined, dined, and had a great time. They also let us leave our bags for a day AND take a copy of the housekey (to let ourselves in) after we had checked out in the morning since we wanted to catch a few more sights before we left. I only wish the bathrooms had locks, but to be fair, they did mention the lack of locks in the listing."
1454258,16117358,2014-07-22,17156024,Amber,"Had a great stay! 10 minute walk to the T, or a 15 minute taxi ride to downtown ($15-17 + tip). Room was more than I expected, with a very comfortable bed and a separate area with a couch and hammock. Neighborhood was quiet and my fiance and I felt comfortable walking back to the house at midnight. Would definitely return!"
1454258,16311071,2014-07-25,17515343,Sadie,We stayed one night in Bruce's beautiful victorian home this past week while visiting Boston.  The house was an easy 8 minute walk from the Savin Hill T stop on the red line in a beautiful and walkable area of Dorchester.  We were greeted warmly upon our early arrival and taken directly to our delightful eclectically decorated room. Not a corner of the house goes without careful attention or a splash of fun color.  The air conditioned room was a welcome relief and the complimentary breakfast got us on our way in the morning.  It goes without saying that we recommend staying here to anyone in search of a place where the accommodations are not only comfortable but also add to the vacation's overall enjoyment.
1454258,16569095,2014-07-29,17565382,Carly,Bruce was amazing and the pictures looked exactly like the room and house. The room was very spacious and came with an extra sun room with a hammock to relax in. He let you set the AC at a comfortable level and provided a top notch breakfast and yummy desserts in the evening. He was very welcoming and we would definitely recommend this place to anyone. We will definitely be back!!!
1454258,17149314,2014-08-08,15871862,Della,"Enjoyed our stay at Bruce and Berry's house.  Just got back from our trip and we have already thinking about going back to Boston to visit again.  Bruce and Berry made us feel like family when we arrived.  They are always so attentive to our needs.  We stayed at the orange room on third floor, and the room is always kept very tidy and clean.  Every morning before we headed out to explore Boston via subway, breakfast is always ready on the table."
Bruce and Berry have such a beautiful house.  It's only 10 minutes walk to the Savin Hill subway station.  Very convenient.  Also they gave us the key to the house so that we can go in and out of the house easily.  Love the decorations and beautiful items Bruce purchased around the house.,,,,,
They both are very social able,and we just love talking to them.  It's my boyfriends birthday and we both really enjoyed Boston very much! Thanks to Bruce for dropping us at the airport early yesterday morning.  We really appreciated.,,,,
Overall our experience staying with B&B is wonderful~thanks again for your hospitality.  Hopefully we will see you both very soon~,,,,,
Sincerely,,,,,
"D & K\"",,,,,
1454258,17458090,2014-08-12,5530473,Johanne/Josh,The location is great - right on the subway line heading to downtown in no
time; close to uMass was nice - hanging out at the harbour at night was,,,,,
fun. Barry and Bruce were friendly. Our hosts gave us great tips on what to,,,,,
do locally - including seeing a free performance of Shakespeare in the,,,,,
Boston Common.,,,,,
We found that the space needed to be de-cluttered and de-personalized. Our,,,,,
host informed us that we will be sleeping in his bedroom - which felt,,,,,
unprofessional (as this was advertised as a proper B&B); We found that,,,,,
there was a lot of sexually explicit decor chosen for the home (and our,,,,,
bedroom space we were staying in especially). We found it awkward that,,,,,
there were no locks on the bedroom doors,nor the bathroom doors. This made,,,,
us feel uncomfortable and unable to leave valuables in the room (as there,,,,,
were other guests staying in the home at the same time as us) and,,,,,
"uncomfortable when showering or using the washroom.\"",,,,,
1454258,17575558,2014-08-14,16999754,Alexander,Really cool building. The room and house was as promised. The hosts were really caring and also providing a breakfast. We were positively impressed. I can just recommend the place.

The house was gorgeous, clean, and the breakfast was just what we needed to get started with the day.  The house is an easy 8 minute walk from the Savin Hill T station.  We would certainly recommend Barry and Bruce to anyone else going to Boston."
1454258,18011194,2014-08-20,11331854,Stephanie,"Bruce's place was exactly as described.  Breakfast was wonderful  He and Barry were absolutely superb hosts!  They were very kind and gracious as they gave us tips on places to go and see.  Every travel recommendation was spot on!  We loved sitting and chatting with them over breakfast and at night when we arrived back in....would liked to have had more time to do this!  They were a such a pleasure to get to know! I would recommend, without reservation, this listing to anyone wanting to visit this area!"

1454258,20204842,2014-09-25,12927498,Renee,"It was our first time booking through AirBnB, and it was such a great experience!  The home was gorgeous, and was located in a wonderful neighborhood just a 5 minute walk from the T.  Our room was on the 3rd floor, just next to the shared bathroom.  Barry was very welcoming and informative, and was even willing to share  his wine with us!  The house was well kept and we were provided with everything we could've needed.  Barry was even kind enough to make us coffee, tea, and breakfast in the morning.  Our only regret was that we stayed only one night!"
1454258,20348058,2014-09-28,20080431,Jesus,"Our brief 2-day vacation to Boston was fabulous thanks to Barry and his beautiful home. The 3-story Victorian style home is so beautifully decorated and maintained that we would choose to stay here again in the future without hesitation. It is conveniently located very close to the Boston transit system so traveling about the city is very quick and easy. The neighborhood is overall pretty nice and upscale with friendly neighbors and beautiful, well-kept homes. Restaurants and pubs are a short distance away, as is access to the rest of South Boston."
Barry hosts a few other guests (mainly students and visiting scholars) aside from airbnb guests,however everyone is very courteous and respectful of the household and each other. There are two bathrooms with showers available for the guests,both of which are very clean and spacious. Barry and Bruce have two dogs that pretty much keep to themselves,but are very gentle and playful if you like to pet them.,,
"Overall I highly recommend staying in this lovely home hosted by Bruce and Barry. This was our first airbnb experience and I must say that it was a memorable one. When we decide to visit Boston again we will definitely be checking with Bruce and Barry first. \"",,,,,

The house is amazing, very elegantly furnished, the room is huge (it even has a hammock inside!) and clean. The location is extremely convenient: the area is nice and safe, we were able to get there by car with no problems (a parking spot was provided) and from there, one can easily reach the train that takes downtown in a few stops. Bruce and Berry are very friendly and generous people, helping us to find an accommodation for the following night since we decided to stay longer in Boston. We had a huge and delicious breakfast and we were even invited to join a dinner that was taking place while we were there...speechless! I could barely imagine a better place to stay."

1454258,21075329,2014-10-11,4697671,J,Bruce & Barry are the perfect hosts in a lovely home filled with antiques and treasures. Short walk from the T red line makes this an excellent choice for day trips to Boston.

Transportation to and from downtown Boston was quick and easy. The red line is just a few blocks from the house.,,,,,
The house has a lost of character. The house was very quiet. While in our room,we never heard a sound.,,,,
Towel racks are heated which makes the towels feel like they're fresh out of the dryer.,,,,,

They were friendly and accommodating, very helpful with directions on how to get around, and even gave me a ride somewhere I needed to go! The house is about a 7 or 8 minute walk  (for me) from the T- stop, which will get you pretty much anywhere you might want to go. They offer breakfast items in the morning and also have some exchange students and two tiny poodles whom you might encounter for interesting conversations over breakfast. Lovely experience!

1454258,22915166,2014-11-17,1311543,Amanda,We actually stayed with Barry (Bruce's partner) as Bruce was in Europe visiting family. This experience was wonderful! The home is located close to the T so it was very easy to get downtown. The neighborhood is tucked away in what looks like a historic district that is by the water....just beautiful. Barry was thoughtful and a warm welcoming host. He had the cutest mini poodles that welcomed us as well. My boyfriend and I look forward to staying here again!

The rooms are well-appointed and the bathroom is fully updated with beautiful fixtures. There was a space heater to use in my room which was much appreciated as the weather had turned in Boston. The hosts even provided a plastic carry-all to hold my toiletries while going back and forth to the bathroom. They thought of every detail!
I was allowed to leave my car in a shared driveway behind the house. It was nice to have it off the street. Overall the neighborhood feels safe and the house is a quick walk to the Savin Hill red line stop.,,,,,
There were several others staying in the house,most of whom were there for an extended period of time. Even with the other guests,there was no trouble with the shared bathroom or other shared spaces.,,,

The house itself is adorable,well-kept,quiet,and very convenient to public transit. The room Bruce provided for me was perfect - clean and homey.

It was especially nice that the room had its own thermostat. The rest of the house had everything else you could possibly ask for. I was most appreciative of the company of Bruce and Barry and the other people staying in the house. I was often invited to dinner and wine in the evening, which always resulted in a few hours of lively conversation. I had the opportunity to speak with people staying at other airbnb properties in the area at my workshop, and none compared to the experience I had at Bruce and Barry`s. Definitely stay there if its available!"

Our hosts were attentive and concerned about our comfort. They were also very knowledgeable about the area and happy to give us directions and suggestions. There were plenty of bathrooms in the house and even though they had other guests, we never felt crowded or disrupted. The house was clean and the 10-minute walk to the nearest subway station took us through a pleasant neighborhood. We would stay again."

We were given a room upgrade, handed a glass of wine when Barry realized what stress we were under.  We loved having the young students in the house, and one shared her Brazilian dinner with us.  Could not have been more thoughtful.  Also the house is filled with unique and interesting objects, we so enjoyed just looking around."

Our host welcomed us warmly even though we didn't arrive until 9pm, and he made sure we had breakfast before needing to leave at 8am for an interview. The location is very convenient to the UMass campus, which is exactly what we needed!"

1454258,36792392,2015-07-01,34117309,Pennie,We really enjoyed our stay at the Chateau B. Bruce & Barry have made the place very nice and inviting. It is in an excellent location to sightsee in and around Boston. It's just a short (1/2 mile) walk to the T station and an even shorter walk to the beach.
If you are leery,as I was,about staying in a house with a shared bathroom with no locks on the door,"have no fear. The bathrooms do have sliding locks on the doors! :)\"",,
1454258,37094101,2015-07-04,178167,Mike,"B&B is adorable. Lovely house with a nice porch to sit and drink coffee. Hosts were very accommodating. Our flight arrived early, and hosts allowed us to check in early. Place is also definitely within walking distance of the T-Line"
1454258,37339682,2015-07-06,2960572,Shravya,"Bruce was not available, so we were hosted by Barry who was incredibly welcoming and warm. The house is simply gorgeous and very cleanly maintained. The house is about 0.5 miles from the MBTA train station, so very convenient. There was complimentary breakfast available and Barry came down during breakfast time and made sure we were comfortable."
All in all,"Bruce and Barry made sure that our first trip to Boston was memorable. I would definitely recommend their listing to anyone planning on visiting Boston.\"",,,,
1454258,37586703,2015-07-08,33957907,Nicolas,"Barry and Bruce were absolutly awesome during our stay : Barry took a walk with us the first night to show us the area & access (great neighborhood & close to subway), and he made sure that we have everything we needed.  The room was lovely, super clean, silent at anytime and the bed very confortable. The bathroom was clean too. The roomates are really quiet and respectfull. The breakfast was gl(PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN)rious (toast, fruits, tea, marmelade, cheese, cereal, ...), we felt like king."
But what really touch us was Barry and Bruce's hospitality and generosity,they were really nice,and they've shared a lot with us,from stories to wine & cheese. :),,
"Highly recommend !\"",,,,,
1454258,37989768,2015-07-12,34686798,Henry,Our hosts Bruce and Barry were excellent hosts. They made us feel comfortable the moment we arrived at their lovely bed and breakfast home. The description of their home was correct in that they have painstakingly restored their lovely Victorian home filled with unique treasures. The home is located in a very safe and inviting neighborhood.
1454258,38416077,2015-07-15,5639316,Cory,"What a great experience!! Bruce and Barry were gracious hosts, and their house is beautiful and immaculately kept. When I stayed, there was other guests from Turkey, Spain and Alaska at the house. Bruce fed us, and we had  great evening eating and talking on the front porch on a beautiful summer evening. Even with other people, the huge house never felt crowded, and my room was spacious and comfortable. Definitely at the top of my Airbnb experiences, and the top of my places to stay in Boston."
1454258,38565509,2015-07-16,38258030,Lyndsey,"Thank you for a great overnight in Boston!! Bruce runs a fantastic place and we really enjoyed our stay. The neighborhood is beautiful, full of old lovely homes and nice for a walk.  It was so relaxing to sit on the deck and have wine and cheese. The property is historical and immaculately kept. We really enjoyed the neighborhood experience of Boston. We also liked the proximity to the train which was convenient for dinner at North End  and sightseeing. This isn't a place that is in the center of the hustle and bustle. It's a quaint place for a relaxing or romantic stay in Boston. It was perfect for the end to my girl's getaway weekend!"
1454258,39267984,2015-07-22,30172295,Elizabeth,"We had a great time staying with Barry and Bruce. The house itself was lovely and our room was quirky and inviting. If anything, we would have loved to have had more time to chat with the hosts; we had a very full schedule, but whenever they were around, both Barry and Bruce made us feel welcome. Both of them had suggestions for places to visit while we were in Boston, and we were glad that we took that advice and got out into the city beyond the plans that brought us to the city."
The neighborhood is an interesting mix of houses,"with shops just on the other side of the T station and a small beach within walking distance. We found it very easy to take T into downtown Boston and to get to and from the house itself. \"",,,,

1454258,40537377,2015-07-31,1172818,Maggie,The home and experience were very true to the listing - a charming Victorian in a neighborhood convenient to downtown Boston via subway or car.  It gave us a much more personal and homey experience in Boston than staying at a chain hotel.  It was very quiet at night and we slept like we were in our own bed!
1454258,40998005,2015-08-03,39179213,Maribeth,"Bruce's home is an absolutely stunning place to stay in Boston. Just a few minutes from the T, making travel around the city is easy, this place was a perfect spot to spend the night in Boston. Bruce made sure everything was situated for us on arrival, and checked in with us through our stay. He offered to drive us to the bus station, as well. Very welcoming and excited we were there."
"It was wonderful to come home to snacks sitting up. Breakfast on the front porch was a wonderful way to start our morning. The room we were given was incredible; the living space beautiful and fun and inviting. If I were coming back through Boston I would definitely go back to this beautiful home!\"",,,,,
1454258,42325672,2015-08-12,16726611,Meredith,"Our stay with Bruce was above and beyond all expectations. Mom and I came into town one night before I left the country to do some quick wedding dress shopping. (Something that shouldn't usually be done quickly, but I know what I like and found it in one morning.)"
Anyway - we got in late because we were out to dinner w/ an old friend,and we were welcomed in. The room was spotless and the house is absolutely gorgeous. We had lemon water brought to our room for the evening.,,,,
In the morning we got a spread of juice,tea,"and coffee to start the dress-shopping day. Then a good healthy US American breakfast (bacon and eggs...and pluots?) with Bruce over really nice conversation. I only wish we didn't have to leave so soon to make an appointment! I would recommend this location to anyone. \"",,,

Even though we can't speak english fluent we had greats conversations with Bruce about Paris, Boston and many other things. Barry always makes sure you have everything you need. The room is very clean and comfortable."

We were met, given a key and a tour and were on our way. The house is in a quiet neighborhood but not far from downtown. We took a 5 min Uber downtown the first day. The house has a wonderful wrap around porch, perfect for sitting outside and drinking wine (which we did Saturday night). They were perfect hosts! The next day they directed us to a small beach area behind the house. Gave us towels and a beach blanket. They had fresh fruit in the morning and coffee. When I return I will be staying with them!"

We loved the easy access to the Metro as we spent 1 day in downtown Boston walking the Freedom Trail , touring and dining.  It was also within walking distance (15 minutes) to the JFK Library and Museum next to the UMASS campus.  Wonderful spot for a B&B in a very quiet neighborhood."
I must mention that we came into Boston on Amtrak and when our train was late I called Bruce to let him know. Barry stayed up and waited for us to arrive. It was very appreciated.,,,,,

What we loved most, however, was the fact that Bruce and Barry made us feel we had a home away from home, offering us delicious beef stew after a long day of meetings. Indeed, Bruce and Barry make sure that all their guests feel well cared for; as airbnb hosts ourselves, we especially appreciate the care and effort they put into hosting. Finally, we loved the Savin Hill neighborhood - close to the T and downtown, it feels like a real neighborhood with historic houses and the Boston Harbor nearby. We look forward to returning the next time we're in Boston!"

Our room happened to be available when we arrived and were able to check in sooner, which was a nice surprise. We would have been happy with dropping off our luggage, which Bruce offered us, and had a quick lunch. The house is right near public transit and really it was about a 15-20 min to the heart of Boston. A few nights we had dinner with Bruce and Barry, which was delightful.

During our time there, they provided a lot of good information to a couple of unfamiliar tourists - on things to see, do, and eat. Staying here felt more like staying with friends as opposed to a faceless hotel. Many opportunities came up during the week where Bruce and Barry offered more than what you would expect from a host."
I STRONGLY recommend staying if you are looking for a place to be your home away from home while visiting Boston. You will be close to public transit and right by the water in a beautiful old house filled with a lot of character.,,,,,

The home was breathtaking and our room was one of a kind, with a cool sunporch off the main bedroom, beautiful color choices, and expertly combined decor. The hosts were wonderful and even during our short stay we felt well taken care of. We wish we would have had more time there and will absolutely go back on our next adventure to Boston."

Bruce was in touch with us beforehand and we knew exactly where we were going (note that you can get FROM the airport on the T totally free of charge - silver line bus to South station then red line to Savin Hill).,,,,,
Barry met us and showed us around the house and to our beautifully quirky and totally gorgeous room.,,,,,
Everything about the house is fun,quirky and really clean and comfortable. It's a lovely Victorian building with original features. There is no noise from other guests and the bathrooms are spotless and showers great :-),,,,
Breakfast is help-yourself in the lovely kitchen - muffins,fresh fruit,etc. Just perfect. Lovely to meet some other guests and get some great advice from Bruce and Barry about places to go in Boston before we headed off...,,,
Tank and Jasmine are the resident poodles - very polite and definitely not in your way. I wish we'd seen more of them! Jasmine will be your best friend if you give her a cuddle :-),,,,,
We bought a nice bottle of wine and sat out on the porch in the evening sun - absolutely lovely. The neighbourhood is very nice and everyone says hi. Great walks around the Harbour Park too...,,,,,
We went out for a great brunch with Bruce and Barry and learned so much from our chats with them. We would not hesitate to go back. We hope that they may visit us in England (think of those antique shops,"Bruce!!) and would recommend Chateau B wholeheartedly. \"",,,,
1454258,78853934,2016-06-09,56475154,Nancy,We had a wonderful stay in Boston! The house is beautiful and although Bruce was out of town during out overnight stay Barry made sure that we felt welcomed and that we had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. The Dorchester area is beautiful and we enjoyed walking along the lovely beach/park area that was visible from our room. We parked our car and walked and/or rode the train to see a little bit of Boston. This is our first experience with airbnb and I am sure it won't be our last!
1454258,79287044,2016-06-12,20866297,Noah,He is a very nice host.
1454258,79482490,2016-06-13,32423927,Nicole,This is a beautiful large house in a quiet neighborhood. Comfortable and clean. Close to the T and a couple of restaurant choices. Gracious host. Recommended!
1454258,79950516,2016-06-15,66019696,Helen,Beautiful accommodations in a lovely and tranquil area of Boston. Close to the T. Hosts including the two pups are kind in spirit and gracious to offer tips for navigating around the city. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a clean and elegant and peaceful place to stay which so close to town and the water!
1454258,80000899,2016-06-15,44965190,Noemi,"Awesome stay! Berry was super nice and kind, unluckily we only stayed one night... The room was comfy and clean, the subway is close and the beach is 4 minutes away on foot. Perfect spot!"
1454258,81241122,2016-06-21,67898393,Maria,"We highly recommend staying with Barry and Bruce in their lovely Victorian home. This was our first time using Airbnb and we couldn't have asked for a better host than Barry (unforuntately, we didn't get to meet Bruce as he was away during our visit).  Our flight got in at 5:30am and Barry let us leave our suitcases in the downstairs hallway so we didn't have to drag them around Boston with us. As this was our first visit to Boston,  he gave us lots of great information about where to eat as well as things to see and do while  in Boston. The home is absolutely lovely, clean and in a quiet victorian neighborhood. Savin Hill is just 15 minutes from downtown Boston on the T subway - which was super easy to navigate (MUCH easier than NYC)!  We both agreed, that if we ever come back to Boston again, and I hope we do, we will most definitely stay at Barry and Bruce's lovely home again. Thank you so much for helping to make our trip and memorable one.  Best wishes, Rick and Maria U"
1454258,82181299,2016-06-26,56763462,Bethany,We had a great time staying with Bruce and Barry. They were very friendly and accommodating and even upgraded us to an amazing room in their beautiful home. Both gave us great recommendations for things to do in the city and we got the most out of our trip. Staying in a Boston neighborhood that was still close to everything we wanted to do added to our experience. The 2 sweet pups were an added bonus!
1454258,84713256,2016-07-08,76485143,Hyun Woo,"It was very comfortable, and Bruce really welcomed us."
Though unlike with what I expected,house was quite far away from the station,and the station it is located-Savin Hill T-is not that much close to the downtown. (in very my own perspective.),,,
House was full of lovely decoratives which I really loved,"and 2 poodles are really lovely too.\"",,,,
1454258,85973844,2016-07-14,37988229,Bo,"While in Boston, hospitality of landlord Mr. Barry has given to me and my wife, for this we are grateful. Barry's House is very tasteful, room very nice, rich Oriental flavor, of course, also very clean. Here, I think is recommended by the most worthy location, very close to the Metro station, city very convenient. I think that next time I come to Boston, hoping to live in Barry's home."

1454258,96328026,2016-08-22,81499916,Nelson,"The pictures don't really do justice to this home, it's historic and really makes you feel as you're truly a part of Boston/New England history.  The home itself was spotless, and could easily pass any military inspection. I would be more than happy to go back as a guest in the very near future."
1454258,97983932,2016-08-29,87339594,Hedra,"Bruce was a wonderful host, with two adorable poodles. The house was bustling with other guests but surprisingly quiet at night!  The house was ornately decorated, as was our room. There were many personal touches to the decor that made it unique and quirky. The bathrooms are shared, but they are very clean. The host made us feel extremely welcome and even invited us to partake in a party night hosted for another long-term guest.  If we return to Boston, we will hope to stay at Bruce's home again."

4178790,30212117,2015-04-19,28879263,Luke,"Our group was very pleased and enjoyed our stay last week in Boston.  Will was very accommodating as it was hard to find a place last minute during the Boston Marathon.  The place was perfectly cozy and suited our needs.  We had a larger group of (3) couples that made the space a little tight, but we spent most of our time exploring the city.  The place was nice, well-kept and with extra towels & sheets.  We enjoyed walking to Fenway, but I could see how some might use Uber (honestly, it’s an easy walk).  Overall, I would recommend booking through Will again."
4178790,31767580,2015-05-10,27018412,Krupa,Description was accurate and neighborhood was nice!
4178790,33786377,2015-06-01,11418269,Allen,Will was a great host.  The apartment was clean and perfect for our family.  It was also in a great neighborhood that was convenient to everything.

4178790,36085636,2015-06-25,27869834,Brian,"The apartment was sufficient for our family of 6 during our recent stay in Boston.  The location is close enough for a longer walk to most of the major sites and Mass Ave. line is 10 min walk away.  We chose mostly to walk direct given the beautiful weather we had.  The property has 3 combination gates you have to make your way thru, which gives a feeling of better security.  1 AC in the main area seemed to cool the apartment but it wasn't really hot when we were there.  Rooms size is a little tight but that seems to be the nature of these buildings.  Other than not having enough towels ready for our 6 people, the apartment lived up to its billing.  The area is full of great breakfast spots, and fair dinner opportunities."
4178790,36503513,2015-06-29,4032557,Stephen,"Our party arrived at different times on Thursday, June June 25th, and Friday, June 26th.  And because of this, we all were very happy that you did not need a physical key for anything in the apartment/building.  All was done through keyless entry points - a code you type in to access each door.  Made everything much more easy and fast.  The apartment was clean, and the neighborhood was beautiful.  We might have made a mistake of taking the T to Mass Avenue and walking, with our luggage, but after finding out that Uber is plentiful in Boston, we never took the T again - :) - The bedroom were a bit small, but we only used them to sleep, so it was not an issue at all.  And, the bathrooms were appropriate - even though the shower curtain was not exactly long enough, for the bathroom was continuously wet.  We LOVE the neighborhood and ate all our meals and drank all our drinks within walking distance to the apartment.  I highly recommend Toro, which is literally less than a block away from the apartment - I am from NYC and have never been to the Manhattan outpost, so I was excited to dine in the original.  Again, this apartment is everything that we could have asked for, and more.  A great place."
4178790,37841787,2015-07-11,25693395,Tawnya,This apartment was perfect for our girls' trip to Boston.  Great location in the South End - easy to walk to restaurants (loved Blunch - cozy little spot to pick up a breakfast sandwich and coffee right down the street!)
Our only complaint was that the description says it sleeps 6 people (our reservation was for 5 people) and only 4 towels were left for us.,,,,,

4178790,39294305,2015-07-22,958697,Gloria,"This is not your usual airbnb where someone welcomes you into their home. This runs like a corporation. That said, our apartment was as expected, clean and comfortable. Small as to be expected for South End Boston. Instructions and keyless entry perfect. We only needed it as a place to sleep but it seemed quite equipped. Transport into Boston was not a hassle either."
4178790,41931905,2015-08-10,6928486,Michelle,The apartment was a great place to stay while visiting Boston.  The apartment was a perfect size for 4 adults.  The location is nice and there is a great diner down the street where we had breakfast each morning.  The subway station was a bit of a hike but there is a bus station close by that takes you downtown easily.  There were a couple of items that needed attention when we first checked in - the agency was quick to responded and provide the repairs.  I was a little disappointed that this apartment is rented out through an agency instead of private homeowner.  As such I felt it lacked a personal touch.  Upon checking out we discovered that some medications were left in the apartment and there was little helped offered to assist us in recovering them.  When I contacted the agency they replied that the housekeeping service is instructed to throw everything out.  I feel that if I was dealing with a homeowner instead of an agency that I would have had better luck in recovering the medications.
4178790,42430974,2015-08-13,20443083,Jessica,"The apartment, check-in etc. was super easy and exactly as described. Great location, clean and no fuss. Only words of warning (no fault of the owner) was that there was overnight construction happening on the street, which 100% audible in the bedrooms.  Not the owners fault, but it is a city, so pro tip: pack a pair of ear plugs just in case!"
4178790,43222303,2015-08-18,32299781,Seph,"This place was perfect. It was spacious and immaculate. Close to good food, the bus, and the Mass Ave. T orange line.  The beds were comfortable which was great after a long day of exploring. I noticed comments about there being a shortage of towels in a few previous reviews. Looks like that problem was solved as we had six towels when we arrived. Way to be attentive!  Everything from arrival to departure was outlined in detail and made the stay extremely easy. I definitely recommend staying here."
4178790,44096019,2015-08-24,29801924,Paul,"We stayed in this apartment with my family of 5 for three days. This is not your usual airbnb, it's more of a hotel apartment. That being said, the place was very nice and well-equipped. The two bedrooms had a king size bed each, and the living sofa could fit 2 more people. The keyless system, a little confusing on paper was actually quite convenient and ingenious. The neighborhood was quiet and very pleasant. Overall we recommend this place if you're fine with checking yourself in and out on your own"

On the first evening we could not find the beddings, I made a call after 5pm and within 10 min had a call back which I was very impressed with, great service."

The place is literally minutes walk away from the Silver Line and its bus stops, providing very convenient and frequent transport into the centre of Boston.  the 7-Eleven just on the corner of Mass Ave and Washington Street also sells the weekly passes that you'll need to make the Silver Line and the rest of the T work for you."
Plenty to do in the local area,including great restaurants at Toro,Stellas and groceries at Foodies.  I was originally concerned about being so far away from the city centre,but in reality this location was just about perfect!  If the Silver Line into town isn't what you need,"then the number 1 bus will take you right up Mass Ave to the west end of Newbury Street!\"",
4178790,49970863,2015-10-08,33754798,Rachel,The listing was accurate and the property was clean and welcoming. We received helpful information about access and using the property from an agency acting for Will. This gave us everything we needed.

Commute was not exactly easy to downtown since the T did not stop there, just buses. But the walk to Prudential was an easy 15 minute walk past some beautiful scenic houses in the neighborhood. Our hosts, which turned out to be a company, gave us all the information in a timely manner. We were very happy with the help and flexibility we had from one of the employees of the company with regard to special requests, while another employee was not helpful at all.

The apartment itself is nice but feels more like a hotel than the typical Airbnb feel. The kitchen is stocked with kitchenware, but if you plan to do any cooking, you need to purchase all your supplies. If you plan on doing anything in the kitchen at all, this isn't the place for you. It's a great place to stay but definitely lacks the home feel that most Airbnb places have."

4178790,68352870,2016-04-04,57423403,Mary,"This apartment was nice and clean, the beds were comfortable and the neighborhood was safe.  However the Airbnb description of this place is NOT accurate in several areas."
First no where does it mention that you have to climb 2 sets of stairs to get to the apartment.  This place is supposed to be kid friendly but with a 1.5 year old,it was difficult and dangerous carrying a stroller and baby up the stairs.  The outside stairs are metal (like a fire escape) and in the rain and snow were a bit treacherous with a baby.,,,,
The next misrepresentation is that the bathroom has a beautiful tiled tub and shower.  NO TUB and nothing special about the shower or bathroom at all.,,,,,
The last complaint I have is about the neighbors.  They partied until late on both Friday and Saturday nights with loud music and marijuana smell invading our apartment,especially the bedrooms.,,,,
I would consider renting again from Airbnb but not this place.  It would be best for people without children.  I noticed that another person complained about the stairs back in January 2016.  Either I had not seen this review or it was posted after I booked this place.  Either way,the description of this unit needs revised.  It still does not mention that you have to go through a side alley,past the trash,"up a metal flight of stairs and then up a steep set of interior stairs in order to reach the front door.   PLEASE REVISE THIS LISTING!\"",,

Neza was so nice and patient that she not only pre-approved my request, but also kept the status until I got declined by the other owner. When I moved in, I found the apartment clean and tidy, and my room was prepared just the way shown the pictures. Neza is thoughtful and provided me with what I needed during the stay, while she tried to interfere least with me. Actually she did, I found it very comfortable living in the apartment."
The location of the apartment cannot be better: downtown Boston,easy public transportation,food and grocery stores. Neza offered a rather good price for what she provided. The room I lived in has heat and air conditioning,"so it is not a problem even in the hot days of summer Boston.\"",,

5862806,47217332,2015-09-16,20115904,Natalie,Isa is a very friendly and helpful Host. She recommended places to see in Boston as well as shops and restaurants in the area. Everything concerning my stay at her house was very well organized. The room was really very spacious and sunny. The location is near the Boston T so the city center is easy to reach. I can absolutely recommend this place.
5862806,47843425,2015-09-21,27818477,Jessie,"Isa was a very nice and kindly host. She helps me a lot not only in live but also to help me know much about Boston. It was a pity I just stay in Boston for five days. I hope to have another chance to come back again to stay with isa. The house was so clean and cosy. If you are consider about it now, I would recommend you not hesitate to choose it!"
5862806,48227791,2015-09-24,21105890,Lucrecia,Isa is a very welcoming host. I had a wonderful experience in Boston. Thanks for your hospitality!
5862806,49131163,2015-10-01,42566143,Théo,"Isa was very friendly and helpful ! There were maps of the neigbhourhood and boston available which helped me getting started. The room was clean, spacious and very sunny ! Also the house is in a nice neighbourhood and close to the red T line (10 min) wich is very convenient when you want to visit Boston. I was staying at Isa's place to look for a collocation in Boston and she helped me a great deal in this. I could not have found a better place to stay."
5862806,49547818,2015-10-04,20086323,David,"Clean, organized, and friendly. Big room, nice common area, and kitchen with all the amenities. The host provided maps and information about the neighborhood which helped me find a cool Polish grocery store that had cheap pastries only a 5 minute walk away. The subway is about a 7min walk through nice little neighborhood and from there your only 4 stops to central Boston. Great place, great location, great price. I would definitely stay again."
5862806,50101281,2015-10-09,2870237,David,"Isa is a friendly and accommodating host. The rooms are spacious and the house is well-equipped. It's in a very nice neighborhood, close to the T stop making it easy to get downtown (~20 mins door to door) and also very convenient to get to UMass."
On the downside the rooms and house are not very clean - more understandable for high-traffic common areas but disappointing to see in my bedroom when I arrived and in the bathroom.,,,,,

5862806,50875753,2015-10-15,41931358,Lara,"Isa has been a lovely host. She really helped me to have a smooth start in Boston and gave me useful tips for housing etc. She introduced me to some of her friends, scanned documents for me, got me a birthday present etc. It wasn't a problem that I arrived late evening on Sunday. My room and the rest of her house was really cozy and spacious. You can chat with her when she's home and at the same time you have enough privacy. I can strongly recommend Isa and her place."
5862806,51482560,2015-10-20,6234245,Wilco,It was a real pleasure staying at Isa's; the room was very spacious and I had everything I needed! She was available when I needed and responded to messages very promptly. The bed was comfy and it was a short walk to the T. Would be great to stay here again! Thanks Isa!
5862806,51949194,2015-10-25,14519388,Ishva,"I highly recommend staying at Isa's place when visiting Boston. Isa was very communicative before my arrival and during my trip. Even with her busy schedule, she accommodated my early arrival. I truly appreciated Isa checking on me to see how things were going as I traveled around Boston. The listing is just as described and the room is very spacious. You will love staying here!"

5862806,56072836,2015-12-08,32733523,Tomas,Isa has been a great host and helpful beyond general expectations. We also liked well described house rules and recommendations which made everything very straightforward. The room is nicely spacious as described and fairly reachable via public transportation.
General comment to travellers,be aware of Boston rush hours if relying on Uber/taxis,"we nearly missed our connection to New York due to that.\"",,,
5862806,66267979,2016-03-20,62417375,Jillian,"I am so glad I picked to stay with Isa during my weekend trip to Boston. The room was huge with beautiful windows. I felt very comfortable the entire time I was there. Also, Isa was very sweet and checked in with me the evening I arrived to make sure that I navigated MBTA okay. If you're looking for a quiet, cozy place to stay in a cute neighborhood, this is definitely the pick for you!"
5862806,68552890,2016-04-05,10910518,Harleen,Isa is very friendly and helpful. She left nice and detailed maps in the room to help me get around the city. She's also very warm and welcoming. It was an absolute pleasure staying at her place.
5862806,70478023,2016-04-18,15971676,Galin,Isa was a great host. The room came exactly as advertised and made a great spot for us to rest our head while we were visiting Boston. We were in town for the marathon (my fiancé was running in it) and she even put out extra energy treats for her to help prep her for race day. She is a very considerate and good host who takes making sure your stay goes smoothly seriously.
5862806,70904146,2016-04-21,4933852,Betty,"It's really good time to live in Isa's apartment, my friend and I were very happy, thanks a lot for Isa's help, she is very thoughtful, prepared everything in advance. The apartment is very close to subway station and there are supermarket and restaurants nearby, very convenient! Thanks again, Isa!"
5862806,71870159,2016-04-29,67330995,Chelsea,"This room was exactly as she decribed. It was nice and very spacious which was definitely good for me. Isa was a great host who made sure that you were ok and that everything was going well. Although we didn't always see each other throughout the day, we were still able to keep in touch. What I liked the most was how flexible she was with me when I arrived. She also tells you everything that you need to know, which made staying with her a little easier."
5862806,74496024,2016-05-15,69490165,Amina,"I loved Isa’s room, it had so much sunlight! Her neighborhood is quiet and it was a relaxing stay. The room was clean and neat, the apartment very organized, and Isa provided a lot of information about the area. She was also very easy to get in touch with, responding quickly to messages, texts and calls and providing help if necessary. Although I didn't run into Isa much, when I spoke to her she was very friendly and engaging. I certainly enjoyed my stay with her. A few things did concern me—the blanket was not washed between guests because “there is no direct contact” i.e there is a sheet under the blanket. I still found this a little off-putting, especially because many people (myself included) would toss and turn at night or sit on the bed; I understand not washing comforters if there’s a cover, but I feel the blankets should be washed! Additionally, Isa has many house rules, as mentioned above on her page, including quiet hours, trash/recycling, and little notes everywhere dictating what items should be used for what purpose; none of these rules are really that imposing, they're very easy to follow, and the notes were helpful and easy to follow as well. However I found it a little frustrating that a lot was expected of the guests when Isa was unwilling to accommodate a few packages delivered from Amazon for me. I had to go out of my way to arrange alternate deliveries, a costly inconvenience that could have been avoided if the packages were simply taken inside and left by the door for me to pick up! And the lock of the door to my room was broken—while the door did shut and lock, there was clearly a lot of damage to the lock and door frame, which made me feel less secure, and I feel it would be more professional to have the lock repaired or replaced. Again, however, I want to emphasize that all of these things probably won’t matter to most travelers. For me, they didn’t change the fact that Isa is an accessible and helpful host and that her apartment is a wonderful, cozy place to stay!"
5862806,75356368,2016-05-20,70351487,Jon,"Room was great, and the apartment was very nice. Isa was really accommodating and made me feel welcomed. She was also a great tour guide, I would definitely stay with her again."
5862806,79811314,2016-06-14,15475542,Maeva,Isa made me feel very comfortable in her home. The house is spacious with plenty of sunlight and private space. Good location.
5862806,80318141,2016-06-17,70617295,Iryna,"Isa's house is located great in terms of public transit connection, I could easily find it without Internet and being a lone traveler from other country. Despite my pre-arranged late check-in which might have not been acceptable for many reasons, she was very welcoming and provided me with every possible help and comments I needed. Her sweet apartment had all the comprehensive instructions for any case I might be unsure about."
Isa's house is cozy,light,quiet and clean. The room had every described asset and beyond. It was secure enough and locked from both sides. I liked her as a host very much,"especially because of her perfect balance of personal and considerate attitude. I would love to stay with her again if I visit Boston.\"",,
5862806,81691612,2016-06-24,17909365,Nick,"Great room in a quiet neighborhood. Room is exactly how it's described, it is huge and gets lots of sunlight. Location is great only a 5-10 minute walk to the subway and cheap bars and restaurants. Isa helped with ideas on what to do and see and provided us with everything we could need."
5862806,85913216,2016-07-14,71694955,Yu,The room is quite big. It is convenient since there is a subway nearby within 10 minutes walk. You can use a fan in the room when it gets hot. She also allowed me to use a water filter so that I do not need to buy water all the time and lend me an umbrella for rain. Overall she is helpful.
I suggest you bring your own towel and put everything back at the same place when you check out. If you would like to eat some fruits,"you'd better buy it ahead since  the convenient store nearby has only bananas. \"",,,,
5862806,87066086,2016-07-18,49950670,Connie,"I didn't get to spend much time in the unit since I had a full schedule during my trip, but everything was great while I was there. Isa was very nice and responsive. Would stay there again!"
5862806,88409347,2016-07-24,34160934,Sandrine,"Isa's bedroom is huge, clean and the bed is very comfy. The flat is spacious and located in a nice neighbourhood. Isa is an amazing host, always available to help, very patient, she took me out one evening and recommended things to do in Boston. It's very easy to get to downtown Boston from her place, just hop in the red line and it's only few stops away. Would go back to her place!"
5862806,90486995,2016-08-01,43428921,Béatrice,Gorgeous bright room. Quite conveniently located (though I took Ubers to most places). Overall great experience!

5676025,47801698,2015-09-21,1570033,Jose,"Jillian is a great host, her house is located in a very quiet zone. The inside is very clean. Take in account to bring some Entertainment because there is no tv or radio, next time they should have a microwave available. Also se should say that its in the third level."
5676025,50460774,2015-10-12,41814399,Augustine,"The apartment is spacious, I really do wish the listing stated the apartment was on the 3rd floor. Traveling with kids makes details like that pertinent. Additionally, we found the area rugs covered in dog fur, which inevitably got on the kids' clothes. Jillian responded to questions quickly, and was concerned for our well being while in her apartment."
5676025,52773585,2015-11-01,8875477,Janet,"The host was pleasant and prompt in her responses. The apartment is spacious and tidy, however there is an unpleasant odor and the rugs, floor and furniture are full of dog hair. It ended up getting on our clothes. Also, the stairs leading up to the apt have dirt and dog hair and are cluttered.  The location is great if you are doing things in Jamaica Plain. There is an awesome place called The Frogmore a block away as well as a pizza place (that only takes cash) and Whole Foods is very close by."
5676025,55103702,2015-11-28,5405754,Sam,"My girlfriends and I had a great time at Jillian's. We stayed at her place over Thanksgiving weekend. Her kitchen was great for cooking. The apartment is decorated nicely and slept our group comfortably. The location was nice, too. We were able to walk to some bars and restaurants. I would definitely recommend Jillian's place. Great price, too!"

The itinerary that she gives in her little binder was great as it had cool little nooks about each neighborhood. It was pleasant to look into their lives as well,"and I hope them the best!\"",,,,

Once at the location, he walked me thorough the apartment that I shared with two young professionals. The place is comfortable, clean and must be even nicer on a warm day. The back yard is charming and the kitchen door opens up to the back as well. It is a lower level apartment so the view from the living room is a bit from \"\"a basement\"\" perspective"
8200839,50001372,2015-10-08,43416655,Oliver,"The places is very nice and Javier and his little cute daughter are very hospitable. There's great food around, and A Walgreen not far. Recommended Highly. Driving in Boston is quite difficult with the traffic, and parking is so hard and expensive."
8200839,50310154,2015-10-11,42946024,Heather,"This was my first time staying in an Airbnb and I was not disappointed. My roommates were helpful and respectful. Javier was a wonderful host: taking time to show me around the place, being available later at night for me to check in, checking in on me throughout my stay. The room was spacious and well worth the money. It's a steal! The area is beautiful and walkable with many good restaurants to eat at. When I come back to Boston, I will want to stay here again."

The location is also great since the bus stop is straight in front of the door (10 min bus ride to downtown), and the next T station is only a nice 15 min walk. Javier is also a great host and he was very accommodating with my check in times after I missed a flight. Moreover, he could be contacted at all times of the day and was always ready to give you a hand. Definitely a good starting point to visit Boston!"
8200839,73498407,2016-05-08,68597828,Chris,"The room I rented was great, and Javier made me feel really welcome. He gave me a really good orientation to the area, and he later checked in to make sure everything was going well. The place was all really comfortable (the bathrooms even had heated floors!), South End is a great neighborhood with everything I needed within walking distance, and it'll probably be a long time before I get to live in such a nice place again. The specific room I was staying in got drafty, but when I mentioned it to Javier, he brought out a portable heater and it was exactly what I needed. I really have nothing but good things to say about this place!"

His attention to detail and constant interest to help the guest to improve his experience is commendable. He was always available in case of any query or help. On the place itself it is very cosy and feels like home. I was almost cooking daily without any problem. You have mbta buses and all grocery shops and restaurants in walkable distance. Excellent place to stay in Boston, period."

I arrived late at night on Saturday, while he was hosting a small gathering on his patio, and he immediately invited me to join for some delicious drinks and food. The apartment is perfectly situated in the lovely South End, close to the famous Flour bakery and their dangerous sticky buns. Walgreens and amazing huge Whole Foods are also nearby. You can get to Back Bay or Downtown on foot or use the bike share system (really easy). I never had any issues sharing the place with 2 other guests. I loved the marble master bathroom and cozy living room. Private washer and dryer were also handy. Javier was very communicative and made sure I had everything I needed throughout my stay. Check out was simple, and I could store my luggage until my flight later in the evening. I will definitely stay with Javier next time I'm in Boston!"
8200839,81331136,2016-06-22,9754443,Oliver,"I can only agree with the previous positive reviews! Javier was very helpful both with my late arrival into Boston, and my late evening departure. I stayed here for a conference at BCEC, it took about 40 minutes to get there by silver line bus (outside front door) and then walking from South station. I definitely recommend spending some time wandering around the South End area, and a nice walk is to head towards the Boston Public Library (about 25 minutes)."

6268082,86568055,2016-07-17,9760197,Tyler,Loved the location of the apartment. The place was very well appointed and nicely updated. The hosts were very responsive and we found the whole process very smooth. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
6268082,88136558,2016-07-23,20024642,Barbara,"I had some silly trouble getting into the condo, and Shelby was right there in minutes, by text and email, to help me figure it out. In the meantime, two neighbors happened by, asked me if I was staying at Shelby's airbnb, and made it clear that they didn't mind the air&b situation and that they like and have great respect for Shelby. So far so good!"
The condo isn't large,but it's cute,neat,and comfortable. Good air-conditioning,which is crucial at this time of year. And even though we live in Boston (but needed to be out of our place for a few days),I hadn't quite realized this neighborhood exists
6268082,89260083,2016-07-27,5255607,Fabienne,A beautiful hideaway in Boston! You would not think you are in the middle of such a vibrant city. There was enough space for us four. The place was very clean and it felt like being home! Shelby was accessible when we had questions. We would go back next time!
6268082,90892007,2016-08-02,68905983,Manohar,The host was great and made every effort to make the stay comfortable. The property was somewhat smaller than expected but I guess that is the case with apartments in the cities opposed to houses in the suburbs.
Parking was a real issue. You have to walk some distance from and to a parking lot and spend over $40 per night in addition to the daily rent.,,,,,
"The property was clean and well kept. \"",,,,,
6268082,92654661,2016-08-09,75375869,Martha,"My host Shelby was amazing.  Always prompt getting back to me with any of my queries, and checking in with me to make sure everything was A-Okay at appropriate times during me stay.  She was excited for me to stay in Boston and at her home, that was very apparent, and made me excited to be there.  Two thumbs up!!"
6268082,95717774,2016-08-20,42526217,Jordan,Listing was as described and completely accurate. Couldn't have asked for a better location or apartment.

9698226,68371356,2016-04-04,58791813,Alicia,Both Emilia & Pablo made my sister and I feel very welcome.  They greeted us when we arrived and gave us a tour and allowed us access to everything we needed!  The location was perfect for connecting back and forth with downtown and the airport.  This gave us a real sense of experiencing living in Boston :)
9698226,69172449,2016-04-09,10061,Steve,Pablo and Emilia were the perfect hosts. Sharing a spacey apartment with them in a nice quiet house in a great characteristic area. Easy to find and close to the airport and downtown. I had fun socialising with them in a local pub too.  Hopefully they will come visit me in Brighton UK
9698226,69266457,2016-04-10,62813881,Matthew,Pablo and Emily were fantastic hosts! I would definitely recommend booking with them. They will go out of their way to make sure you have a great stay with them. Room was very clean and has everything you would need. Definitely better then paying for a hotel.

All of them are very welcoming, friendly and they are open people and helped us (EMAIL HIDDEN)munication with them is clear and easy.

9698226,72786281,2016-05-04,682694,Eric,"The space is exactly as pictured with nice touches to make you feel a home. The location was perfect for my needs with proximity to the airport, train station, and local eateries. But the best part was the genuine hospitality of Pablo and Emilia! I will definitely book with them again when my business brings me back to Boston."

The room is cozzy. I like the patio,especially when the brazilan neighbor was having their weekend party. The smell of BBQ and sea wind make you feel you are in heaven.,,,,

Again,Pablo and Emilia,"tks for everything. Really enjoy our stay with you.\"",,,

9698226,75507459,2016-05-21,55296562,Rachel,"The room was beautiful and it was a perfect place to spend a relaxing night after a long trip. Hospitality was a 10/10! They made me feel very welcome in their home, they gave guests information on things to do in the area, and the amenities in the room made me feel like I could have been in a hotel."
9698226,75944185,2016-05-23,49835267,Cheukshing,"The house comes with the nice sunshine. And Pablo is a nice guy. He decorates his apartment with a lot of wonderful photos around the world. The bed is comfortable and I like the pillow. It is nice and new. I love the Apple TV in the room. Everything is fine and clean. What you see in the picture is what you get in the real.The location is ok. I'm a uber person so I didn't take the bus to the downtown, but it's not expensive to take a uber to the popular areas. Thanks Pablo."
9698226,76310334,2016-05-26,9948903,Sai,We had spent two great days at Pablo's apartment. The place is 5min walk from metro and 15min away from downtown Boston. Pablo always replies to our requests immediately and he is very helpful. I recommend Pablo's place!
9698226,77253132,2016-05-31,6352807,Malvika,Fantastic stay on Memorial Day Weekend. We didn't meet Pablo and Emilia but were in touch on email all the time. Warm hosts! Here is what we liked -
- Well ventilated house. Windows,sunlight,balcony at the back. This is SO important.,,,
- TV in bedroom :),,,,,
- Very close to the T line (uncomplicated station - Orient Heights). You can pop into the train and back to the house and back in as frequently as you like. The main tourist spot - Aquarium is just a few stops away and you do not have to change trains to get to it.,,,,,
- Spacious kitchen to use.,,,,,
- Lots of info and brochures on Boston all around you; lots of magazines. There are also many books to read.,,,,,
- Pretty house,makes one happy to live in it.,,,,
- Towels,small toiletries provided.,,,,
- Medium size plant in room. Ok.. I liked this :D Air,plants,. much needed.,,,
- Very clean bedding.,,,,,
- Grocery store close by if you are like me and like to cook clean fresh food.,,,,,
- Breakfast place close by if you don't want to cook.,,,,,
And by close by I mean you can stumble to it if you are a rockstar with dark glasses and a hangover :),,,,,
On the whole compared to other listings that I considered I would say - I liked being in a roomy house and not being squished in a tiny apartment with things all other the place like shoe racks,laundry bags etc.,,,,
"I am now in Crowne Plaza hotel (biz conf venue) and clawing at the windows. And grateful for the pool of hot water their little machine drips for my tea. Arghh\"",,,,,
9698226,78128789,2016-06-05,64459512,Richard,"A great stay in Boston in this spacious, modern and very welcoming apartment! Pablo was an excellent host providing everything we could need for our trip. Highly recommend!"
9698226,78496726,2016-06-07,12578395,Margaret,"When we arrived it was raining, so I informed Pablo that it was not, in fact, a sunny room as advertised. He scowled and called me an ingrate. Just kidding! He laughed which let me know we had a cool host."
The room is as pleasant as could be. You have your own mini fridge and coffee maker,plus access to the back deck and a coin-operated laundry downstairs.,,,,
Tired from a long trip,we didn't avail ourselves of downtown Boston so I can't speak to sight-seeing convenience. However there's a Vietnamese place a few blocks away with the absolute best hot and sour soup I've ever had and might fine dumplings too. Our morning rush hour trip to the airport? 10 minutes! Awesome.,,,,
"Thanks Pablo!\"",,,,,
9698226,79436120,2016-06-12,75905215,Ľuboš,"Ubytovanie u Pabla bolo skvelé! Poskytli nám všetky potrebné informácie, nemali sme problém so získaním ani odovzdaním kľúčov. Byt je krásny. Všetko čisté. Príjemná domáca atmosféra. Popis hostiteľa neklame. Boli sme veľmi spokojní, vrelo odporúčam :-)"
9698226,79778352,2016-06-14,43547558,Ashley,"Our stay with Pablo was short, but great! We had a quick overnight stay after a long day of traveling from Europe and Pablo had a comfortable bed, clean towels, and amenities waiting for us. We weren't able to visit boston during our stay but I noticed he had information regarding the city in the room, which was a nice touch. We would definitely recommend the room!"
9698226,80361034,2016-06-17,68326226,Lauren,"Pablo and Emilia were so great to stay with. It was super easy to find the place. They were great with communication, directions on how to get the keys, info on bus schedules and which ones to take. The bed is super comfy! I am not normally pleased with anything that is not my bed. Everything was super clean. Magazines and other info about Boston was laid out to help us navigate. Emilia was sweet enough to drive us to a game at Fenway since we were going in the same direction and told us some of the best places to go for food, food ect. The T was also super close to them, just like a few blocks away. We didn't take it often but it was convenient when we did."
9698226,80638368,2016-06-19,35173863,Maria Alejandra,Room exactly as described. They have everything you possible need covered. Great communication and quick responses at all times. I can't wait to go back! Thanks :)

9698226,81719815,2016-06-24,48340337,Wish,Fabulous place! Nice sea view! Detailed introduction. Nice person. And near the subway station.
9698226,81873922,2016-06-25,65011092,Anastasiia,"It was my first experience with airbnb and I loved it. Although I stayed only one night, it was enough to see that hosts are really friendly people. The place was exactly as on photo, very clean, comfortably reachable from Logan airport and not far from Downtown. Pablo send very detailed guidance where to find key in case they were not home at the time of my arrival. All in all, I liked the hosts and the place very much and would definitely recommend to everybody."
9698226,82529273,2016-06-28,9809128,Shaunessy,"We were in need of a quick overnight stay before flying home, and Pablo's place was perfect! He sent us easy to follow instructions well in advance and we had no problem parking or getting in. The room is nice and spacious with lots of little extras, and the bathroom was nice and clean. The bed is so comfy! We didn't use the kitchen or living room but they were clean and inviting."

9698226,83342606,2016-07-02,51176764,Alex,"Pablo's place is wonderful. There were a few inconveniences, but they were easily solved. I just want to emphasize how easy it was to access the property, the welcoming attitude, communication, and cooperation of Pablo and Emilia, and the proximity to downtown. The stay, although merely one night, was great. The abundance of windows allowed for great ambient light and the entire modern bedroom is  spacious and inviting. But, with Pablo's place the key was in the small things. They had water for us knowing it was beginning to become hot outside, they had Apple TV which was a life save, and had extra linens, towels, and shampoo for us. If you're looking to stay here for a night or a week, I would definitely recommend - especially given how accommodating and gracious our hosts were."
9698226,84332338,2016-07-06,76299620,Benedikte,"Our stay at Pablo and Emilie was great. The room was nice and clean, towls and coffee provided and a lovely balcony.

We had everything we needed, including snacks and coffee, for a very enjoyable stay.

We were able to meet him when we arrived and he provided us a nice tour of the apartment and where to find everything. The listing was even better than we imagined, the pictures do not do justice (#apartmentgoals)! We were in the best location as far as shopping, restaurants, and across the road from the entrance of the train. Our trip was for business but because of the location of the apartment, it really enabled us to see what Boston had to offer in the evenings. This was my first trip to Boston and it was made even better by where we stayed. Thank you Jeff and Katie!"

A rug would've helped warm up the floor in the early dark of the morning, but it was quite cozy regardless.  I arrived late and left early and as a result never got to meet Cindy the host, but she was accommodating with just a day or two's notice and very friendly and helpful over text/email.  I did not make use of the kitchen or laundry, but it was very accessible and well-appointed.  The location was incredibly convenient to St. Elizabeth's Medical Center, which was my destination.  I'd happily return again.  Thanks, Cindy!"
3419711,56216809,2015-12-10,26439977,Ned,"Cindy was very helpful and responded quickly to my questions.  The listing was as advertised, very comfortable and located within walking distance to some great restaurants on Cambridge Street.  Would definitely stay there again."
3419711,56709186,2015-12-16,37662589,Alden,My second time with Cindy. Another good stay!
3419711,61041788,2016-01-31,43227382,Ricardo,"Everything was very organized. The room is very comfortable, spacious and the closet space is great. Everything was very clean and the house, rooms and sharing space gets cleaned multiple times a week. Cindy was very approachable and easy to talk. She provides with coffee, tea, cereal, laundry detergent, and more. Never had any problems or complains of any of the roommates. Cindy was great with addresses and recommendations for transportation. Location is great and the neighborhood is safe."
3419711,61369455,2016-02-03,112741,Pia,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Cindy's.  Her house is cozy and comfy. The room is exactly as pictured. There is an inviting communal living space and kitchen.
"The location in Allston is in proximity to the bus and T (green line) that you can use to get around Allston and everywhere else in Boston.  \"",,,,,
3419711,61922262,2016-02-09,53767856,Arshaq,Cindy was a great host. She was able to answer all my questions before and during my stay. She outlined everything clearly in the house and was welcoming.
There was heavy snow during my snow; however,all the paths leading out of the house were promptly cleared and salted (I would leave at 7 A.M.). Overall,"this was a great place to stay for anyone!\"",,,
3419711,62972623,2016-02-19,16026646,Douglas,"Cindy's place was great for me, as I was visiting Boston College and it was just a few stops away on the T. My room was a good size, had plenty of storage, a very comfortable bed and a desk to work at - as such, it was ideally suited to me. What's more, it was delightfully warm given the freezing temperatures outside."
I was also really pleased that I could do washing and drying (and ironing!),as well as use the kitchen for meals,which I did most days. The shared bathroom was clean and there was a plentiful supply of hot water!,,,
Thanks,Cindy - I had a great time in Boston thanks to your warm welcome,"and will definitely come back again if my travels bring me to Boston.\"",,,
3419711,64734479,2016-03-06,57054426,Schumann,It was very nice place to stay! Like it very much! Cindy is a very considerate person! Thanks again! Cindy
3419711,64942910,2016-03-09,48710150,Virginia,"Cindy was very nice! When I finally met her she was friendly and welcoming. She helped me so much as well throughout the whole booking process, and she was very understanding about my check-out etc. She was awesome! The room was even better than the photo. It was a very charming and cozy room in the house. Absolutely adore it. The area was also very close to transportation systems. Good food was everywhere. Most things were in walkable distance (CVS, Walgreens, restaurants, transportations, etc)"
3419711,65196465,2016-03-11,14769683,Dayana,"Essa é minha 2 vez com Cindy e eu amo estar na casa dela. Tudo muito organizado,limpo e silencioso. O quarto e super confortável. Quando vier novamente a Boston voltarei."

"The accommodations were as described.  This was an affordable alternative to hotels  if you are interested in a home atmosphere.   I would not hesitate to stay at Cindy's again.\"",,,,,
3419711,66478516,2016-03-22,7240746,Lisette,"The list was accurate and Cindy made everything to make my stay very comfortable. Everything was nice, clean and organized. The room was beautiful, spacious, and very nice. There was a walk-in closet to put my clothes and suitcase, a very comfortable full bed, a desk and chair, two mirrors and a chest of drawers. The bathroom was pretty clean and spacious. Cindy provides you with complimentary coffee, tea, cereal, and condiments. The kitchen is large and you can cook your meals there, but I didn't use it. There was a washing and drying machine, as well, which I didn't get to use either, but it makes this list more attractive and complete. The location is perfect, it's a 8-10 minute walk to the T (B-Green Line) and a less than 5-minute walk to the bus (#57). Transportation takes you quickly to downtown Boston, Boston University, Boston College and Harvard. I drove but parking wasn't an issue because you can park for free on Cambridge St. which is right around the corner where Cindy lives. All in all, a great place that I would definitely recommend."

3419711,69548881,2016-04-11,40446318,Sammie,"This was quite possibly the best stay I have ever had. This being my first time using AirBNB, I feel like I will never have such a graceful experience again. Cindy was by far the most wonderful, trusting host. We did not even get a chance to cross paths in the 3 days I was in town, but any time I had a question or concern she was easily reached and extremely helpful. My room was beautiful, private, and quiet and was equipped with a ceiling fan and also a personal space heater so that any guest would be comfortable. Even after checking out, Cindy allowed me to wait until my shuttle arrival later in the day and was willing to reimburse me after my flight got pushed back."
Thank you so much Cindy,"and I hope I get the opportunity to stay with you again!\"",,,,
3419711,70547233,2016-04-18,49751925,Karen,Cindy was a fantastic host. She was so warm and welcoming. She answered any questions I had before I arrived so I wasn't stressed at all about coming to a new city on my own. I stayed at Cindy's for the marathon and was so happy to meet other runners and spectators there. We had a great weekend and I am so happy to have met everyone there. Cindy's home brought people from all over the world together. Cindy was also kind enough to provide us with coffee and some breakfast food (and a good luck card!) for marathon morning. These are the personal touches that make me so happy to stay somewhere through Airbnb rather than a hotel. Great experience!

3419711,75650822,2016-05-22,6015940,Matthew,"As described, it was a room in a house on a quiet street, set back and up some stairs along a ridge. You enter through the back door.

She offers a parking space for the car, but there was no privat parking, just a public parking space a few blocks away. She offers further cereals for breakfast, but ran out of them before we had arrived and it was impossible to refill them until next morning."

Convenient location, with easy access by public transport to downtown Boston, Cambridge and the Boston medical area. As advertised, this is a good choice for somebody who is going to be busy during day, and just needs a place to stay at night. Hardly saw Christine as she was working shifts, and left early and came back late."
1428355,8341811,2013-10-26,9546398,Stephen,This was my first experience booking a stay through AirBnB and it was great.  Christine was incredibly accommodating without being overbearing. South End is really cool little neighborhood with several cool shops and restaurants. Felt completely safe walking from Back Bay after hours.  If you're in late Franklin Cafe is a cool little bar down the street open late with great food. Recommended by Christine and perfect for a late night meal and a glass of wine. Most of the homes look to be historic brick buildings so the area has Boston's classic old world charm.  Christine keeps her home literally spotless which made the experience that much more pleasant and professional.
Highly recommend staying here.,,,,,

The picture online might look like a pullout couch (which maybe it is), but it's a solid bed and REALLY comfortable. I highly recommend staying here if you have things to do in Boston. Christine was away during the weekend, so we didn't get to meet, but she was so gracious with sharing anything!"

It's close to a lot, and on a nice evening, you can walk from there to many other places. I took a cab mostly, because I had a lot of stuff, but the rids were short. Christine was super friendly and very helpful. I would definitely recommend this location to someone."

We walked everywhere!  Beautiful part of the city.  Christine's place is very clean and secure.  Fresh towels and linens.  Christine mentioned that she might likely pop in a time or two over the weekend however, we never saw her - except during check-in.  We exchanged a few text messages throughout the weekend. Christine was very accommodating and we plan to check back in with her for next year's marathon! Highly recommend her place for one or 2 persons."

Her apartment is comfortable and in a great location. It is only a short walk to the nearest T line, and that takes you directly downtown. Despite being a futon bed, it was very comfortable.

1428355,19450137,2014-09-12,19961214,Tim,My wife and I spent one night at Christine's beautiful apartment in Boston's South End. The neighborhood is one of the nicest in Boston--lovely old brick homes and brick sidewalks. There's a great Italian restaurant--Coppa's--just a block away from Christine's apartment. The theater district is a ten-minute walk; Boston Common maybe a 15-minute walk. We found some good breakfast spots just a few minutes walk from the apartment.
FYI,"Christine's apartment is a third-floor walkup. It wasn't a problem for us but I imagine it could be for some people. All in all it was a great experience. Christine responded quickly to our questions and her apartment (and the location) is even better than the airbnb description suggests. I would definitely stay there again. HIghly recommended.\"",,,,

The apartment was very comfortable and clean located on such a charming Boston street.  The living space is in the dining/living room area so I could see it being a bit small for two people on an extended stay (more than a weekend) but it's definitely the right size for a single traveler.  I had no problems with the pullout sofa mattress for sleeping- it was comfortable!  The neighborhood has a lot of great restaurants and bars within walking distance.  You always will have options!  It was also a huge \"\"plus!\"\" for me that her street is very quiet in the night.  I was at a conference most of the week and Christine's place was the perfect oasis to unwind and relax in.  I would definitely stay here again!  Thanks"

The place itself is just like described and since Christine wasn't home for the time of my stay I had the place for my one. Still Christine was reachable by email and text all the time and would have been around in about 15min wich wasn't necessary since I found everything right in place and perfectly as described.

It was located within a 30 minute walk to major tourist locations. And the access to a washer and dryer made it possible to pack light. And having a kitchen and fridge made it possible to eat relatively well and healthy."
Christine was out during my stay,so I had complete access to the whole apartment. But she was easy to get in contact with when I had any questions.,,,,
Compared to what hotels where charging in the area,Christine's was very reasonably priced and included 10x the amenities. You just can't go wrong.,,,,
Given the opportunity,"I will would stay at Christine's again.\"",,,,
1428355,45168310,2015-08-31,41668053,Mara,"My stay at Christine's apartment was great! The apartment is in a great building, in a great area, and is very clean and comfortable. While Christine was not in the apartment during my stay, she always responded very promptly to my messages if I had any questions. Overall I had a wonderful experience!"
1428355,46534162,2015-09-11,9942256,Eric,Great location and Christine made it an easy experience.
1428355,47837146,2015-09-21,39223667,Emily,"Christine's apartment was clean, cosy and very well located! It is on a beautiful street in the South end and close to so many delicious places to grab a bite! Christine was a great host and answered all our questions. Even though it was a fold out bed - we had a great sleep every night."
We would definitely recommend Christine's apartment for any one/couple who wants to explore Boston for a few days!,,,,,

1428355,49661371,2015-10-05,17384380,Stephen,"Great Great Great Great Spot! If you are reading this, you should stop reading this and book the space. Probably the best deal on Airbnb in regards to location. Close to everything. Clean, Safe, & Quiet."
Some things to note:,,,,,
We didn't actually meet Christine (she was away when we were in Boston). She was quick and helpful every time we needed a recommendation or had a question. She even left flowers/wine for us on our stay (we were celebrating an anniversary). It was awesome.,,,,,
Some things to note:,,,,,
The space is small and cozy. You sleep on a pull-out sofa in the living room (Christine wasn't there,so it didnt bother us). It isn't the most comfortable thing,but we just needed a place to crash at night.,,,
We hope to stay here again next time we are in boston!,,,,,

1428355,54641137,2015-11-22,48535467,Molly,Christine's place is perfect! The apartment itself is beautiful and the pull out bed was spacious and comfortable. The neighborhood is cute with lots of restaurants and shops and was perfect for me because it was walking distance from BU!

Although we didn't meet Johan, his roommate Yoni kindly hosted us before his leave. The apartment is clean, tide, warm and fully equipped for everything.

We also had a meal in Metropolis that Johan recommended on the Airbnb webpage, it was really tasty."

She is very knowledgeable with excellent communication before and after my arrival; I wished I had more time to have conversations with her. Her house is quaint, artistic, organized and clean. It is filled with art, music, book and beautiful plants. There are nice little details in every part of the house. It is also in a very good neighborhood and this metro station is not that far from the tourist attractions. I would stay here again."

The room was really nice and the bed was actually really comfy too. I was only there for a short time and spent all of my time sight seeing, but Cynthia made sure I had breakfast every morning and knew how to get around. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
12855343,76422858,2016-05-27,39177076,Hugh,"I had a really nice, relaxing stay in Cynthia's comfortable home in Jamaica Plain.

It's a peaceful neighborhood just a very short walk from the Green Street station on the orange line, which takes you into the city center in 10-15 minutes. Cynthia is a lovely host and always makes sure you feel welcome. I fell a bit in love with Boston in just three days and can't wait to come back!"

I didn't actually meet Cynthia because of schedule mis-matches, but the other household member who let me in and showed me around was very nice and welcoming. It's only about a block from the T, too, so unbeatable for location."
12855343,80433913,2016-06-18,6506832,Janet,Highly recommend staying here. The location is very close to an orange line T stop and convenient for getting around easily. The room is comfortable and as described in the listing.

I loved the area that had charm like the New England I grew up in ( born and raised in Back Bay ). My room was clean, comfortable, and had a window over looking the yard."

I felt welcomed before I even stepped foot into the house. Communication was great weeks before my arrival for I had many questions. She made sure someone was there to welcome me and help with anything I needed throughout my stay if she was not able to do so. It was satisfying to stay in a quiet, peaceful neighborhood very close to public transportation. The room was clean and comfortable. I only hope other hosts are as friendly and accommodating. Thank you for a great experience!"

Enchantingly constructed in hard wood floor with a canonical centerpiece painting and spellbinding posters on the wall, the guest room underscores the achingly natural charm of her house.  Cynthia responds admirably and courteously with a cheerful spirit and caring interests.  This place tiptoes toward the finest of what airbnb can provide for gratifying stays with a fascinating stroke of serendipity."

I live in Bay Village but i leased the apt for my parents and my brother who both attended my graduation.  Both of my parents were surprised how comfortable the beds were and the ease of accessing the apt.  The apt was well stocked with toiletries and essentials; such as a dryer, washer/dryer, iron and towels. I truly have to say, the apt is in a prime location and best of all Whole Foods was less than 50 feet away."

I had an issue with the bathroom faucet and air conditioner - unfortunately things were not addressed immediately and there was some confusion - however, the Manager got back to me and we were able to work out a solution. Hoping that Flatbook continues to strive to offer their patrons the best amenities and facilities and improve on communication with their guests. They need to do maintenance checks on the unit regularly to ensure things are operating properly. The pictures are exactly how the unit looks - clean, sleek, fully equipped kitchen, plentiful towels, Kleenex, and toiletries. Beds and pillows were comfy. No issues with noise (even though close to highway). Would be nice to have some bottled waters stocked. Enjoyed the umbrellas for use. There is a huge Whole Foods downstairs which is super convenient. Taking Fasten/Uber was extremely easy. There's also a gym/pool but I did not use it. Overall, the place was very comfortable and beautiful - I would stay with Flatbook again."

2657905,15570554,2014-07-12,3043128,James,What Aton amazing location. Exactly halfway down the Freedom Trail.  Steps away from all of the best Italian restaurants. 8 minute walk to the harbor front area.  It is just past the last amazing Italian restaurant on the street so it is still quite quiet out the windows that look down into the quintessential North End. The furniture is all brand new. I felt very safe I the area. Key pickup is just 3 steps from the door. This was better than any hotel you could find in Boston.
The closet organizer in the bedroom and the shelving system in the living room are genius. It was the perfect size for the two of us and our teenage son.,,,,,

2657905,21389876,2014-10-16,21272261,Shuxian,"Apt is centrally located. There are many good restaurants right along the street. Apt was clean and basic amenities provided. However, it was very noisy. We could hear neighbours walking up and down the building, and every cars driving on the street."
2657905,22295689,2014-11-03,8724902,Erin,"We booked this rental 100% based on the location and it was perfect in that aspect. The rental is on a main street with a ton of Italian restaurants and bakeries (Bova's, Modern Pastry, and Mike's Pastry are all nearby), and was basically a 10-15 minute walk from  downtown; we were able to hit up Neptune Osyters with a quick 10 minute walk- first in line! The rental is also right by the Old North Church, so if you were interested in doing the Freedom Trail Walk you are at a great starting point; start at the church and work your way south. We also loved that the rental was a 10 minute walk from the Aquarium T stop and allowed for us to get to and from the airport pretty easily."
This was my first Airbnb booked where we went through a rental company and not through the owner. The rental company was easy to deal with and the key pick-up went smoothly.,,,,,
Having lived in several cities,I did not really stress about previous reviews regarding noise and suggestions for earplugs- I thought my fiance and I would be able to sleep through it all. If you are a light to moderate sleeper,you will definitely want to bring earplugs. We are pretty sound sleepers,but the walls are thin and you can hear everything going on outside and inside.,,
"Overall I would say that this is a great rental if you are planning to explore Boston on foot and are not too concerned with noise at night. The location is truly what makes this place worth it and I would definitely stay here again- with earplugs.\"",,,,,

It was very simple and straight forward getting Into the apartment. Before hand the hotline was very helpful answering all my questions. Upon entering the apartment I already had a smile on my face, the place was authentic and stylish, not to mention tidy. It was small and cozy, two floors and all we needed to feel like a couple of local Italians in the north end. They say location is everything, and that's exactly what this is...I highly recommend this place to anyone considering. We went for New Years, it was about 10 degrees outside but with the space heaters provided, I never wanted to leave the warmth! Also a great price, I would stay here again."
2657905,27497683,2015-03-06,4962856,Cassandra,"Dror was a fantastic host - very quick to respond and available for contact. The place is cute, and ideal for a night or two in Boston. The surrounding area is also perfect for tourists, with lovely restaurants right around the corner. Price wise, I'm not entirely convinced that it is excellent value for money. It seemed a little expensive for what we got and we would have liked the apartment to be slightly cleaner on arrival. Our bed also broke when we arrived, but both are minor problems."
2657905,28468053,2015-03-24,26390119,Carey,The location for this apartment is near many terrific restaurants and historic landmarks in the North End.
The apartment is small,but our three enjoyed a week's stay nonetheless. If you need to stay longer and you intend to buy groceries the refrigerator is a bit small. Also,if you need to hang out in the apartment during the day there is a scarcity of space for sitting and working. There was an extra heater,blankets,and pillows provided. The noise of the city can take a little getting used to at night (we're suburban dwellers normally),but you definitely get a true urban experience where you instantly feel like a local. If you are a light sleeper
Our check-in and check-out were seamless,straightforward,and without complication. We were not in need of any guidance from our host,but we always believed that help was just a phone call away. A nice benefit is is luggage storage for needs that don't match the check-in and check-out times.,,
I would definitely stay here again.,,,,,

2657905,31289673,2015-05-04,26324510,Mariya,"This apartment could not have been more perfect! It was right in the north end and close to everything we could possibly think of. The apartment was just as described and fit our needs perfect, Dror was even nice enough to offer us a place to put our luggage before we could check. We had a wonderful time and will definitely be back! I hope to stay here again!"
2657905,31935959,2015-05-12,27442783,Sara,"This was a nice apartment, amazing for the price and great location. The only negative is the walls are very thin and you can hear what's going on outside. It was a perfect size and location for what we needed it for."
2657905,32822156,2015-05-22,19262265,Sarah,The location was the best part. The apartment furnishings were as described and shown in photos. Overall it's a compact space that is best suited for one or two people.
This was less of a true Airbnb experience and more of a real-estate rental company experience.  There were a few fumbles from the rental company that took away from the personal touches AirBnB renters typically provide (keys were left with the wrong name on the envelope when it was supposed to list my name). That noted,"the rental company was very attentive. \"",,,,
2657905,33352325,2015-05-27,8199579,Fabien,"The apartment is ideally located: at walkable distance to main attractions and in a lively area. Hanover street itself hosts some of the best restaurants of the city. The flat is exactly as shown on the pictures, convenient and big enough for 2 people (very comfortable bed!). The processes to book, get the keys to check in and check out are very smooth. The communication with Dror has been very clear. So if you want to stay in Boston don't think twice, go ahead for this listing, you will have a great time."
2657905,33897095,2015-06-02,16443424,Michelle,"Loved the apartment! It is compact, but has everything you need. The upstairs in particular is very nice. Bathroom was super clean. The bed upstairs was very comfortable. We also used the pull out bed downstairs which was very comfortable. I also found the luggage storage really useful since I arrived way before the check-in time."
The location is just perfect. Its right on the main drag of the North End but away from the loud parts of the street. There's history,great food,and the waterfront all within a short walk.,,,
Parking is a bit difficult/expensive in the area,"but there is a T stop at Haymarket about a 10-15 minute walk from the apartment. \"",,,,

2657905,34943387,2015-06-14,29675913,Jan,"Really happy with our experience. Firstly, brilliant communication when booking and then prior to our arrival. Also good communication during our stay although no luck when phoning the office but did get reply to email so that was fine."
Secondly,it was easy to pick up the keys with the code provided and we could store our bags after we checked out of the apartment on our last day.,,,,
The apartment was a great price and perfectly located and we could step right outside and onto a bustling friendly street full of places to eat,small shops etc. and there was a seven eleven a block away. An easy walk to the harbour and to the Quincy Market area and about 30 min walk to Boston Common. The apartment itself was all we needed with everything provided. It was small but clean and comfortable and big enough for us. My only negative (and it's not a biggie for us but would be for anyone with mobility problems or small children) is that the stairs in the apartment are steep and narrow.,,,,
The street is very busy which suited us. There is a fire station almost over the road so be warned sirens could go at any time. Again no problem for us,I like noise at night and it doesn't disturb me.,,,,

2657905,35337969,2015-06-17,8071892,Matthew,This was an amazing space and I loved the location. You are feet away from amazing restaurants and historical landmarks. I would highly recommend it to anyone. It is perfect for 2 people and well appointed for your needs. Thanks Dror!
2657905,36375812,2015-06-28,16277683,Craig,Everything was very easy.  Great base of operations for exploring the North End of Boston.  Will definitely look them up again when I'm back in town.
2657905,38041587,2015-07-12,37144957,Becky,"Great location, great place! It's ideal for two people. It was very nice to store our bags before and after check in/out times."
Nice kitchen if you want to prepare food here. But there's so much great food in the neighborhood - why bother lol. The listing is as described. Steep stairs and small bathroom were not an issue for us.,,,,,
The check in time is exactly 2 p.m. so don't expect to get in early. When I inquired about getting in early via a phone call to the management company,they didn't have an answer for me. Also,it would be nice to have curtains that completely block out the light (and don't cover window ac unit upstairs with the longer curtain).,,,
Overall,we enjoyed our short stay here and would come back.,,,,

2657905,38541578,2015-07-16,19592852,Barbara,Neat and tidy place in the north end with plenty of restaurants and shops to enjoy. Parking can be a problem especially if there is a big event at TD Garden. Otherwise a very enjoyable stay.
2657905,39565111,2015-07-24,38710581,Bill,"Both the owner and the apt manager were VERY responsive. Quick, thorough replies and very proactive. They were welcome to deal with as a business traveler."
I used this apt as an alternative to the crazy hotel room prices downtown...and the horrible bed bug problem Boston hotels are NOT dealing with. The getting of the keys and instructions on using the apt are very well thought out.,,,,,
The North End,"and Hanover St is the heart of it!  It's busy day and night. Do not take this apt if you are seeking peace and tranquility. It's acurately described as a \"\"lively\"\" area. You have immediate access to great restaurants.",,,,
The apt is cooled by two window units. Thankfully,both were going when I arrived. They did a good job of cooling the rooms. The second floor,which houses the bed and bathroom is as described. If you want soft sheets,I recommend you bring your own. I'm fanatical about having all-cotton bedding which this apt does not have. The towels and bathroom supplies are all clean and as expected. Nothing fancy,but perfectly functional.,
The kitchen is small,but complete. I barely used it except for glassware.  I noticed a tumbler had a small crack in it and then stupidly used it. When washing the glasses the next morning,it shattered. I'm not sure its something the cleaning crew would normally catch,but there it was.  I cleaned up the glass and my cut and left a larger than normal tip for the cleaners and note that there was broken glass in the garbage.,,
Overall,"this was a positive experience which I would reuse.\"",,,,

The North End is an easy (and safe) walking distance from the waterfront, public transportation and, of course, amazing Italian  food. We had enough room for two in this comfortable, cozy and clean apartment. The city was hot and humid during our stay and we were grateful for air conditioning in the unit. In addition, we appreciated being able to store our luggage before and after our check in/out times so that we could make the most of our time in the city."
2657905,42655782,2015-08-15,29398477,Kat,"This was a lovely apartment in a lovely part of Boston. Really enjoyed the surroundings...  the area is fun and bustling and an easy walk to downtown. It was incredibly easy to get the keys and return them, and the possibility of luggage storage space after checkout time is very useful! The kitchen was well-equipped and the air conditioning was great. The only slight improvement could've been with cleanliness... for example plates and cups in the cupboards weren't very clean and we had to clean them before use. But that was a very small issue, overall a very very good experience!"
2657905,44636747,2015-08-28,12559526,Anna,We stayed in Boston for 5 days and it was amazing! This apartment even better in real life than on photos! The best place to stay ever! It was easy to go around and see sightseeing! We didn't have any problems with this apartment. Everything was perfect!

Great place to stay as a home base if you aren't going to spend much time there anyway. Easy communication.  It is close to a fire station so there is some road noise but nothing unexpected being that close to the action."

On one of the most lively streets in the north end. Our check in/out was smooth, we used the storage room for both times and everything went well. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed. The steps were quite steep- fine with us but something to keep in mind. We really enjoyed our Boston getaway!"

2657905,51423634,2015-10-20,12205932,Sarah,Duplex was warm and comfortable in a great position in North End right in the Italian quarter. Although it was small it had everything we needed. the large bed was very comfortable and the kitchen was well equipped.
2657905,52040428,2015-10-26,34283510,Lisa,"This was a lovely quaint apartment in a great location for a really good price. Some things to be aware of when selecting this home.  It is a very small loft apartment with incredibly steep stairs inside.  Nothing wrong with that but just a note to know if you have back problems, it's difficult to get heavy luggage upstairs.  It's also one flight up to the apartment from the street. I would question that it is a queen size bed, at best a full size. Definitely my biggest issue with the place was that I was unable to get property management to return several calls with questions/requests on the apartment once we arrived, like where is the controls for the heater for example. Because it is a 100 year old apartment there is minimal soundproofing within, throughout and from street level, as well it is across the street from a fire station, I recommend bringing earplugs.  I also question the cleaning cost as renters are required to take trash out to street if your stay is over trash day and required to clean up kitchen, empty fridge, etc.  We found really dirty dishes in the cabinets, probably from lazy previous renters who didn't take the time like we did to thoroughly wash our dishes.  We were also required to strip the sheets from the bed.  Not a huge deal but what are you paying the cleaning fee for? Finally, we stayed there 4 nites and were provided 2 bath towels and 2 wash clothes for the entire stay.  We placed a call to the property management company to request more but never received a call back.  Again, a nice place for the price, but be aware of size, soundproofing, cleaning requirements and property management issues."
2657905,53169423,2015-11-06,7365924,Joanna,"Check in was simple and easy. The apartment was clean and had everything that we needed, although a bit dated. The best part of this duplex was its location. Everything was within walking distance and is a great base to explore the Boston from. The apartment was kept consistently warm."
The main issue we had was around noise. As it is situated in a 'lively' neighbourhood,it tends to still be quite noisy late at night and was exacerbated by the air conditioning unit installed in the windows to the point where we could hear conversations on the street. The walls are also very thin and you could hear the neighbours walking up and down the stairs and music from our neighbours. We understand that the host can not do much about this but it made our stay less comfortable. As a note,"we also tried to contact the host directly about this issue but he could not be reached and we never got any reply.\"",,,
2657905,54698070,2015-11-23,38911274,Steve,"Everything was as advertised when I arrived.   The duplex was just what I expected and was enough room for 2 people.  Great location, right in the middle of the North End and very close to TD Garden and Faneuil Hall.   Thanks for a great experience."

2657905,72938961,2016-05-05,26266653,Julia,"\"This apartment is in a great location. The Freedom Trail is mere yards from the front door and much of the city is easily walkable. There are wonderful Italian restaurants everywhere, and plenty of convenience stores for picking up items you might need. I found the process for getting keys and such quite easy. A few things to be aware of: This isn't a classic AirBnB. It's run by a realty company with an office next door so you're not really staying in someone's apartment. That's not a drawback necessarily, but does take away the personal touch. I'm not sure why they call it a duplex. It's an apartment building with four units on the same floor as this one and others upstairs. Dror owns several of them I believe (I also stayed in the one next door). The building is quite old which gives it some charm but also causes it to feel worn. All of the floors throughout are creaky hardwood so you can hear every footstep all night long. The walls are not insulated so I could hear word-for-word conversations from people upstairs and on the street. Fortunately I had ear plugs so was able to sleep fine. Also, the apartment is tiny. At 5'6\"\" I think I could lie down and have my feet and head touch the walls. It was fine for me alone but you'd better like anyone else you have with you a whole lot"
2657905,75695465,2016-05-22,31121969,Erin,"Dror's place is in a great location and place was as described. Communication in the lead up and during our stay was prompt and easy.  Only downside was the wifi dropped in and out occasionally. However,  we loved our stay in Boston and would definitely recommend Dror's place!"

Great Italian eateries are near by as you are located on Hanover St and the streets here are well lit so you can walk anywhere and feel safe."
We met Dror one day and he is a lovely person,very friendly.  He actually owns the whole building so the apartments are not all the same.  We stayed in a 1 bedroom duplex and thought it could comfortably fit 3 people with the bedroom upstairs and I assumed a fold out couch as it came up on Air bnb for 3 people and stated 'sofa bed'.,,,,
We stayed in #2C and it just was a couch (couldn't fold it out) so our friend had to curl up on it and and it just fit her (she is 5'6) while I stayed with another friend upstairs in the double bed.  She wasn't very comfortable but was a champ and put up with it for 3 days.  However,we all agreed the location was too good that a few days being uncomfortable was worth it.  Any longer and I think it would have been an issue.,,,,
Also,the rental management company you deal with was very responsive when the storage locker had been locked and the pin provided wasn't working.  Within  minutes,someone from maintenance was helping us get our luggage so we could leave to go to the airport.  The service and response time was impeccable.,,,
I would definitely recommend this place to any friend who was going to Boston,"but only if 2 people were travelling. \"",,,,

Several days prior to arriving, he provided me with a helpful explanation of the apartment and its quirks, the available amenities, and some suggestions for my stay. Check-in and check-out times were very flexible as several of Tuomas's friends made themselves available to accommodate my schedule."
"The space itself was very clean and welcoming. There is plenty of space for five people to sleep and live comfortably (though we were only three). The many books lining the kitchen and stacked in the bedrooms and the various artwork create a \"\"modern intellectual\"\" vibe that was very enjoyable to stay in. The neighborhood and building were quiet",despite staying on a Saturday night,while still in a prime location for visiting the city.,,,

The location is great, within walking distance of the main attractions and also close to public transportation and to a whole foods. Check in was easy, as a friend of Tuomas met us with a key at the door at our arrival, check out was also easy as we just left the key inside."
The apartment is typical of Boston (old building,small space and lots of stairs to get there -  we lived in Boston before so we knew what to expect). It's probably not ideal for families with toddlers as there are stairs inside the apartment that could be a hazard. We had a 1 year old with us and used our luggage to close the stairs,so its manageable but not ideal. On the good side,there is a nice playground up the street and it is also within walking distance of the esplanade,the Boston Common and the Public Garden.,

Tuomas's roommate moved out 10 days before out visit with the couch and one of the beds.  Replacing a bed with two single air mattresses and no couch completely changes the dynamic and we would have not rented under those circumstances.

The building is old, and the electrical and AC systems have rough edges, but the kitchen and bathroom are modern and the place is comfortable and clean.  There are very steep and narrow stairs to get to the place: not an issue for us at all, but if you have accessibility issues look elsewhere.  It also gets a lot of street/alley noise.  But, it is in a  perfect location in one of the nation's most walkable cities.  Just try getting two hotel rooms anywhere near here for even double the price!  Would stay here again."

2998554,51165903,2015-10-18,8667164,Susnata,"Apartment was in a great location, and has good space. Place was a little old, and does get a lot of street and neighbour noise, but that's to be expected in older places. Getting in was little bit of a challenge as I didn't receive he instructions ip until after I had arrived to pick up the key, but Tuomas was very responsive once I contacted him."
2998554,51452571,2015-10-20,1891711,David,We had a great stay. The house was very nice and Tuomas was very communicative. Recommended.

The flat offers everything you need,including a roof deck,great wifi,fully equipped kitchen and more.,,
The area is charming,and you can easily walk to the North end or Back Bay.,,,,

4075898,20256096,2014-09-26,886979,Darrell Walker,"Not the ambiance of a back bay brownstone, but a very nice apartment in the very center of Boston - a few feet from the Crossing station and a half block fro Park station, and a block from Boston Common and the start of the Freedom trail.  On the eighth floor, so I did not notice the noise at night.  My wife said she did, but not enough to ever resort to earplugs which we usually use in city apartments.  The place looks exactly as pictured.  Very clean.  Comfy for two.  Very comfortable bed.  Adequate equipment in the kitchen.    A two day supply of a remarkably good Starbucks coffee."
The toaster,set on medium,burned a bagel in about 30 seconds.  The smoke alarm works well.  The ceilings are 9 or 10 feet,beyond reaching the smoke the alarm to reset,so you stop the alarm by turning on the microwave fan. which is quite strong.,
The neighborhood is central city - very busy with some homeless and some panhandlers,but none aggressive.  The street is pedestrian only.,,,,
Check-in instructions looked complicated,but once you get there,they make perfect sense.,,,
I think there is some disconnect between Compass,the landlord,and the building management - e.g.,the supplied toilet paper and tissues were painful  and the laundry card,although it worked quite well,had a very high minimum if you needed to add money to it.  However
The CVS pharmacy across the street has essential groceries - be sure to get one of their discount cards BEFORE you scan any items at the check out.  There is whole foods within easy,without groceries,walking distance and only one subway stop away.,,,
We would go back again.,,,,,

4075898,20618527,2014-10-02,16462211,Camille,The apartment was great. It's located in the center of Boston and closed to subway stations and all the nicest Boston's neighborhood.
Check in and check out are easy and the host was easily reachable throug email.,,,,,
"The only negative point is the street is a bit noisy. \"",,,,,
4075898,21148843,2014-10-12,20974257,Ed,Location! Location! Location! This wonderful apartment is centrally located so just about anything you want to do or dicover in Boston is right at your finger tips. The hussle and bussle of the city is right out the front door. The quiet comforts of a clean and cozy apartment is what you'll find inside that front door. The furnishings were well done and the mattress and bed were a dream come true every evening after long walks in the city. Adam is truly a great host that takes the worry out of renting a place in Boston.
4075898,21428540,2014-10-17,3915974,Jo,"\"My husband, I, and our two cats had to relocate for a week while our apartment in Somerville was renovated. The apartment in Hamilton Crossing was perfect for our needs. It was centrally located, walking distance to my husband's work and just a couple more stops on the Red Line for mine. We were so happy they welcomed our cats, as the last thing we wanted to do was board them for a week. They seemed to take to the new place nicely, and they loved looking out the windows. It was also nice that the kitchen was stocked with all the essential cookware so we could make dinner at \"\"home\"\" and keep to our normal routine. It was like a mini vacation that for once included our pets! \""

4075898,22990839,2014-11-19,20399160,César,"This review is for the apartment at Downtown Crossing in Boston, MA. I had a great experience. The apartment was immaculate, extremely clean, everything was new and tidy and there was even a welcome package with water bottle and chips which were very much appreciated! All the appliances were brand new and everything worked perfectly. The building was safe and clean and the move in /move out process was extremely easy. Adam took care to send all the instructions promptly via email, and communication was great. The neighborhood is very central in Boston and it's easy to get around town from the apartment, the only thing I would give a heads up is that the immediate surrounding area can feel a little unsafe later at night, but otherwise it was a fantastic experience. Would definitely recommend and would visit again if I am ever back in Boston."
4075898,27166928,2015-02-27,6869368,Dita,"Move in was exactly as described, easy to follow instructions and get into the unit. Unit was perfect, right in Downtown Crossing. Bed was great, plenty of space to spread out. Kitchen was well supplied. Will definitely stay again."
4075898,27612593,2015-03-08,24942028,Arthur,"The apartment was great! Located in the heart middle of everything (Chinatown 5 minutes walk, North End 15 minutes, Boston Common Park 3 minutes, TD Garden 20 minutes), it is very convenient. Lots of store around the building as well as a food court inside the Corner Mall."
The apartment itself was clean,with a hotel feeling to it,it is very nice.,,,
"Would definitely book this place again.\"",,,,,
4075898,28210380,2015-03-20,27439147,Arslan,"The Luxury 1 Bed in Downtown Crossing apartment was in an excellent and clean condition and provided all of the amenities exactly as described (those photos don't lie). Its location in the heart of downtown Boston was convenient; very close to Boston Commons park, the Freedom Trail, and many other attractions. Also, Adam and the Compass team were very responsive and helpful from the beginning! For example, they answered my questions promptly and accommodated my  requests for an early check-in and late check-out. As this was my first experience with Airbnb, I was quite satisfied. In the future, I'd much rather prefer an apartment over a small, limited hotel room if my budget and plans allow it."
4075898,29124997,2015-04-04,29215021,William,"Great Place! Have already stayed there twice for work. Super close to everything, recommended 100%!"
4075898,31827755,2015-05-10,2158989,Kurt & Kate,"Listing and photos are super accurate! These are executive rentals, so different than most airbnb listings, as no one lives there full time. We rented a 1bdr for a week and ended up with a 2brd/2 bath on the top floor, unit 1PH. The layout is rooms on opposite sides of the apt, so that would be nice if you need it. I would not recommend our exact unit as it's near the elevator and some noise, but the others don't seem to be. The location is very central in Boston, and right off the park."
Keys are easy to pickup,lockbox on site which means you can arrive and leave at your own schedule which is great. It's 15 min walk to the South Street Amtrack station. 1 block to Boston Commons and easy to get a cab there,however a cab can not pull up directly to this building,it's on a pedestrian street.,,
The only issue we had was we were told we could get an air mattress for our toddler,but it didn't show up. But with two beds worth of stuff we figured it out. Adam was generally quick to get back on the lead up to the renal.,,,,
There were nice touches like a few snacks and coffee on arrival,lots of info,wifi,"and very professional.\"",,
4075898,32265934,2015-05-16,31745112,Stephen,This was an amazing place. I was in town for a convention and it was just the perfect place to unwind after a long day of meetings. This is definitely a one bedroom apartment with all the amenities anyone could ask for that you can't often get in a hotel room. Will be sure to book this place again when I return to Boston.

4075898,35494144,2015-06-19,20237227,Justin,Getting into the place was easy with extremely detailed instructions.  It's really centrally located and an easy walk to lots of great downtown Boston destinations.
4075898,36231587,2015-06-26,32941882,Haley,I enjoyed my stay form check in to check out. I was comfortable and everything I needed was available in the apartment. My dog enjoyed being to close to Boston Common. There's also a great gourmet grocery store in walking distance with everything you need in the kitchen.

4075898,44006579,2015-08-23,6968643,Katie,"The apartment was beautiful and just as described. Getting into the building and obtaining the keys was a seamless process. Loved the Downtown Crossing location. It was a little strange to receive a request to fully clean the apartment before leaving, as I have not experienced that with prior Airbnbs."
4075898,46513010,2015-09-11,30736414,Paul,"This was actually my first time using an AirBnB, and wow, what an experience. The instructions via email were crystal clear—and the responses were fast too. Finding the location, getting the keys, and walking into the apartment was a joy. The place was gorgeous, clean, and exactly as I imagined. Actually, no, it was better. Big TV, comfortable bed, modern bathroom, silverware, and great WiFi made my stay at Adam's place pleasant. I work right around the corner too, so I will be visiting and staying here often."
4075898,48411714,2015-09-26,2756247,Catalina,"The apartment is very well situated but being in the middle of Boston also means that things get loud. It is not a quiet neighborhood but it has everything you could ever possibly want. It is also within walking distance of all the major sights in Boston, which is wonderful."
The apartment is exactly as described. Very comfortable,lots of light,and with plenty of room for one person (or two people,"but I was staying alone).\"",,
4075898,49248380,2015-10-02,43506623,Luise,"We first contacted Adam on a holiday weekend. Due to the expiration of inquiries after 24 hours there was some confusion about the availability of the apartment. Adam cleared things right up and we got the apartment of our dreams. The detailed check-in email made the process hassle free. Kris, the concierge, was terrific! The location of the apartment couldn't have been better- right at Downtown Crossing. We could jump on the T and be anywhere in Boston in no time. The new Roche Brothers market was next door over the Redline-Orange line T station. We could get fresh or delicious prepared foods until 10 PM every night. Our apartment had every thing you could need for a comfortable stay plus a great location. Planning to tell all our friends about this experience."
4075898,50541047,2015-10-12,37093865,Paige,My stay in Downtown Crossing was amazing! We arrived a few hours before check-in and the concierge was kind enough to hold our luggage as we toured the city. He even brought our bags up to the room for us! The apartment was clean and the location is unbeatable. I will definitely be staying here during my next trip to Boston.
4075898,51340124,2015-10-19,25582198,Henning,The check-in experience was very easy and the apartment was wonderful. The location could not be better: It is right in the middle of Downtown Crossing and it takes about a minute to walk to the park. Highly recommended.
4075898,52506591,2015-10-30,6642216,Michael,"Very nice, newly remodeled apartment right in the heart of Boston. Walking distance to pretty much everything downtown. This was great for my week stay I had for a business trip. Co-workers of mine paid 2-3x more for much less! Very comfortable, clean, has a nice kitchen and access to paid laundry which was convenient. The bedroom was a little bit noisy but all in all it was a great stay and I would definitely stay there again."

The host was very communicative, the check in process was clear and easy, the apartment was newly remodeled and super clean, and the location was absolutely unbeatable. My girlfriend and I had a spectacular time in Boston, due in large part to this Air BnB. It was stocked with snacks and coffee, the bed was crazy comfy and perfect after a long day walking around the city. Most notably, it was extremely clean (which I'm picky about) and the location was outstanding. Literally easy walking to everything you want to see in the city. Thank you so much for topping off our wonderful vacation!"

La localización es perfecta (en Park street) pudiendo llegar andando a todos los puntos de interés, pero con acceso al metro en menos de 5 minutos para explorar otras zonas más alejadas de la ciudad. El apartamento es amplio y cómodo y muy limpio y provisto de una cocina completa y baño, la cama es cómoda y además había varios snacks (nos gustó mucho este detalle). Televisión por cable y wifi. Sin duda repetiríamos."

4075898,72037532,2016-04-30,43117264,Chuck,"The communication was very responsive and accommodating. There were only a few issues that I addressed: request for late check out, adjusting the thermostat and wifi. In each instance they responded immediately with a solution or their physical presence.  The apt. was clean, comfortable and enjoyable. Very nice, I was very happy with it."
The location is unique in the fact that it is not obvious but the instructions I received were very detailed and organized. I had no issues with entrance. Location in this instance is the key,you are in the heart of most everything.,,,,
"Keep in mind that the street the building entrance is on does not allow vehicles so you get dropped off on the corner. I will mention that late at night you need to be a bit careful. Ubers are not allowed past a certain time up Washington and the T is close so there are people \"\"hanging\"\" out in the area. \"",,,,,
4075898,73244426,2016-05-07,65712665,Kenneth,"Our 4 nights in Boston were most enjoyable.  Downtown Crossing proved to be a very central location.  The apartment was very clean and comfortable, and was just as depicted in the photographs.  Instruction for check-in was very precise, and therefore very easy.  Our only negative comment is that the Welcome Pack with instructions on how and where to leave the key, as had been mentioned, was not in the apartment.   We emailed twice with no response, and finally a phone call brought the required response."

4075898,88647807,2016-07-25,69593018,Hilary,"A fabulous apartment in a great location. The apartment is in a building of furnished apartments run by a management company.  I was given an apartment that was different than that shown in the photo, but it was larger and equally as nice."
The apartment was modern,clean,fresh,and well maintained with all the expected amenities. The bed was very comfortable. The wifi was a good speed. Adam was away during my stay but I had very quick communication from his colleague Tricia.,,
The Downtown Crossing location is fantastic and I highly recommend it.  It is above the red and orange T line,a block from the green T line,and a couple of blocks from the blue T line.  It was an easy walk over to Faneuil Hall,Quincy Market and the Aquarium.  So convenient!  It is near lots of shopping and is across from Macy's and a Roche Bros supermarket.,,
I note that like another reviewer,I received a move out email asking me to do a full clean or pay for a cleaning service. However,when I queried it I was advised it did not apply and just the usual tidy up was request.,,,
Whilst there is a convenient and clean laundry on each floor,the minimum spend to buy a laundry card is $20,so might not suit a guest just doing one or two loads.,,,
I would highly recommend the apartments at Downtown Crossing to friends (and indeed,"already have) and would not hesitate to stay again.\"",,,,

The building and unit were easy to find and very centrally located. Very easy to use the train to arrive at the Downtown Crossing location. The flat was fantastic. Quite spacious for the location, clean, and well appointed. The small kitchenette is large enough to cook meals in for longer stays. In all, highly recommended."

It was clean, beautifully appointed, spacious - a real find in the heart of Boston.  And, of course, location, location, location.  Need coffee and muffins in the morning?  Right around the corner.  Need a bottle of wine?  Right around the corner.  Need a cool bar to have a drink after a day of sightseeing?  Right around the corner.  This place was incredibly convenient to everything and sits on one of those postcard-worthy streets.  I definitely can't say enough about how happy I was with both Michael and his loft.  Go. Stay.

I have nothing but good things to say about my experience booking this property.  The transaction with Mike was very smooth from start to finish.  He was very responsive and provided good information about the check in, check out, surrounding area, etc.  He also left a bottle of wine for me as a welcome treat. It was a very nice touch.  The apartment is very clean. It has wood floor, marble bathroom, rain type shower, stainless appliances, very comfy bed, etc. etc.  I could go on and on, but you get the point.

It is wonderful, with all the amenities one could want. Michael was there when I arrived and his friendly greeting and suggestions for navigating the neighborhood made my work-related trip to Boston more productive and less stressful. I would stay here again in a second!"

A smoker lives downstairs unfortunately but Damon has an air purifier in every room, and you don't notice a smell at all. My boyfriend and I shared the bunk bed room. The full-size mattress on the bottom was very comfortable."
Didn't get to meet Damon in person but he was very easy to contact and we exchanged a few emails in advance.,,,,,

I highly recommend this apt and this area if you want to visit Boston, but not be caught up in the hustle and bustle of downtown."

849408,21326346,2014-10-14,4112202,Tian,"Damon's house is awesome, and is perfect for my family. Very clean and fully furnished."
Damon is really nice. although there's some trouble  of the heater Damon soon got us extra blanket and small heater,even refunded us half day rent.,,,,
I though somebody said Damon could not have been a better host,I 100% agree with that. I strongly recommend Damon's house.,,,,
"Ps. I really like his kitchen which full of everything.\"",,,,,
849408,21521770,2014-10-19,21063748,Mary,"A fun stay at a great place! We were a group of 6 (3 couples) who were in Boston for the Head of the Charles regatta. We found Damon's flat spacious and comfortable, especially the squashy leather furniture perfect for all of us to watch football on the big screen at the end of a long day. The couple who drew the short end of the straw took the room with the bunk beds -- but found them perfectly comfortable! Because our group was unfamiliar with Boston, we'd worried that the location ( Roslindale) might be inconvenient,  inaccessible, or otherwise undesirable. In fact, the neighborhood  is very nice -- a leafy suburb of big, beautiful old houses,  of which Damon's is one -- and is  easily accessible by public transportation. Damon's flat is also easy walking distance to a great, inexpensive  breakfast place (Harry's All American Breakfast) and a good bar (Kellehers)."
849408,21881011,2014-10-26,20952241,Marty,"Damon's home was just perfect for our family get-together over 4 days and 3 nights. Staying there were my son, wife, and 16-month-old (Seattle) as well as us grandparents (Vermont). Visiting every day was my daughter and her family, with husband, a 5-year-old and a 1-month-old  (10 minutes away). There was ample space for 6 adults at the dining room table and in the living room. The open floor space and comfortable seating made for easy conversation flow, while the 3 bedrooms were separated and quiet. The kitchen was more than well-supplied with pots, pans, cooking and eating utensils - We did quite a bit of cooking. Take-out was also an easy option. The neighborhood is residential with a playground 2 blocks and the Arnold Arboretum a short drive away. Damon was in touch by text and email  several days ahead, as well as during our stay to see if we needed anything."

Thanks Damon.  The location is great too.  It is within walking distance to the Roslindale Square which is a delightful shopping are with good restaurants and a great feel."

Good sized rooms, warm, everything was very clean. Damon made us feel very welcome and was extremely friendly, generous and helpful when my whole family came down with the flu! I would definitely recommend this property and would stay here again if we come back to fabulous Boston.we also took Damons advice and booked uber taxis to get to and from the city. They were very efficient and approx the same price as it would have been for our group of 4 to take the train. Thank you for you great hospitality Damon."
849408,30489888,2015-04-23,22675741,Keena,Damon was an awesome host! His home was just as he described it...beautiful with lots of space!

849408,32493539,2015-05-19,26275127,Leo,"Our family, 5 adults, had an enjoyable stay at Damon's place.  The apartment was clean and bright; had a very comfortable living room where we relaxed after busy days; and the kitchen had whatever we needed to have some of our meals."
Our main purpose was to attend our daughter's graduation at Boston College.  BC was conveniently only a short drive from Damon's.  However,we drove to many of Boston's attractions in different parts of the city.  On a few occasions we used the MBTA or Uber.  Damon's home is in a nice residential area and parking is free and available on the street.,,,,
"We all agree that we would return to Damon's place in the future and would recommend it to friends.  It was a huge improvement on 3 hotel rooms.  It was a comfortable home away from home.\"",,,,,

The kitchen was great as well as the great appliances. We felt safe and enjoyed our stay.,,,,,
Our host is really helpful and we will definitely use this apartment again if we have the opportunity to visit Boston. No hotel can match to staying here.,,,,,

849408,41316817,2015-08-07,29386709,Tony,"This was a great place to stay on our vacation, from the pre-arrival information that Damon shared with us through to the way he interacted whilst we were there."
This is a great apartment and exactly like the pics.  It has all the amenities that you would expect and then some.  It is perfectly located,whether you are visiting locally or heading into downtown Boston.,,,,
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this apartment to anyone else who is looking for a great relaxing stay in the Boston area.  We will certainly look to stay here again on our next visit to the area.,,,,,
"Thanks so much.\"",,,,,
849408,43046686,2015-08-17,34738840,Rachel,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it really could not have been better.  The apartment itself was fantastic - comfortable, well-equipped, convenient, spacious.  We really enjoyed staying there.  I was travelling with my husband and our two young children, and this apartment was just the perfect place to bring toddlers also.  Damon was nothing short of amazing.  I asked a lot of questions and he was always very responsive, both before and during our stay.  He also went above and beyond to help find some “toddler equipment” to lend to us for the kids (training potty, pack ‘n play, stroller, etc.).  I had asked if he happened to have a guard rail for the bed for my nervous toddler and when we arrived he had actually procured a separate toddler bed with guard rails!  My son was so excited when he saw that bed, he immediately said it was “his” and slept happily in it every night!  Thanks very much for a lovely stay and for all your outstanding efforts in accommodating us."
849408,44769403,2015-08-29,25557654,Kim,Damon's place is cozy and in a great location! It's very close to downtown Boston and within walking distance to several restaurants and stores. The added bonus is that my girls loved staying in the bunk bed and all of the kid's toys. Damon was also very responsive with all of my questions. We would definitely stay here again!
849408,45932245,2015-09-07,9020550,Damien,"This trip was made so much more relaxing because of this beautiful home. We especially enjoy the coziness and homeliness, a few traits that we place high priority on. Overall it was an amazing stay, one that absorbs all the exhaustion away from our intense schedule. We highly recommend this choice."
849408,46778306,2015-09-13,39955212,Kyan,"We had a great time staying at Damon's place. The house was clean and well stocked, neighborhood was quiet and easy to find, parking was never a problem, and there are plenty of restaurants, pubs, etc nearby :)"
"Highly recommended!\"",,,,,
849408,47895684,2015-09-21,14253923,Alicia,This was my first Airbnb experience and it was awesome thanks to Damon! My coworkers and I were traveling to cover the FSU/BC football game and we needed a last minute place to stay because hotel plans fell through. Damon was super quick to respond and I was able to book 2 days before! The place really did feel like home and it made our first trip to Boston even more enjoyable. The neighborhood was great with stores & restaurants within walking distance. We ate at Yucatan Tacos one night and at Harry's All American for breakfast a few times.. both places were great!
Damon is super quick to respond with any questions or concerns.. For example,I stupidly plugged in a hair dryer to an extension cord with other things plugged in rather than into the wall directly. When I had the hair dryer going,the power went off in a section of the house. I texted Damon about the incident and he literally responded within 4 minutes giving detailed instructions for where to find the breaker. I was able to fix it right away and he apologized that he wasn't in town to fix it himself.. he couldn't be any nicer!,,,
Overall,this was such a great experience and there's no question that Damon's place beats any hotel (price-wise and comfort-wise).,,,,
"I recommend staying here if you're ever visiting Boston!!\"",,,,,
849408,49125840,2015-10-01,41932287,Suzanne,"We had a wonderful time staying in Damien's place. It was very convent to the T and an easy walk to the village for food & groceries. The place was very comfortable & relaxing to me back to after sightseeing & walking all over Boston all day. Our 2yr old daughter loved his little girls room so we never had a problem putting her to bed in there. The only down side was all the stairs our little girl wanted to walk up by herself without any help, but that's a 2yr old!"
849408,51010026,2015-10-17,3453511,Michael,This felt more like house sitting than staying in someone's spare home/room. Home is 2nd floor of a 3 floor unit (we didn't hear much from 3rd floor but we did need to be a bit mindful of the noise our kids were making -- no late night dance parties). The home is nicely furnished and is fantastic for a family with kids (we were traveling with 3 kids under age 6). There were books and toys to keep everyone entertained. TV and everything else was easy to use. Washer/dryer was super helpful mid way through the week.
Damon gave clear instructions and was generous with fully stocked kitchen (use what you need to... if you use a lot,please replace or leave cash so he can). We stayed here b/c it was close to my sister. But it also turned out to be a nice location with a nice grocery store down the road and an easy 25 min drive into town. There is a driveway but we always parked on the street (never a problem). All in all,"highly recommend. Would stay here again.\"",,,
849408,55099184,2015-11-28,22568424,Howard,"The house is well-kept, roomy, and comfortable.  Damon is responsive and does everything he can to make you feel comfortable.  The location is great - near the square in Roslindale.  Thanks Damon."
849408,55731066,2015-12-05,38666981,Tinamarie,Damon was a great host and super communicative. He was open to helping with any issues we may have run into. His home was lovely and my daughters absolutely loved playing in the kid room. It was great to have toys there and not have to worry about traveling up with them.

It's as beautiful as the photos and my family of 5 found it quite easy to share the space for 4 days. The only challenge we had was that the internet stopped working for a couple hours, but Damon was very responsive and immediately got on the phone with the provider until it was functional again. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants access to the city with a more quiet, residential place to stay."

She was attentive to our needs and made sure that her house was well-equipped and ready for our arrival. Her home is fit to accommodate several people, which makes this listing unique for the Boston area in this price range. The house is comfortable, cozy, and kid-friendly. The neighborhood is a quiet enclave the city, and it is still easy to access key locations in Boston by car or the T.

The apartment was lovely, and the experimental moving unit was both clever and eacy to use, and it made the studio a lot bigger. We wish, however, that the bed was queen width rather than double. It would have made sleeping much more comfortable. Great location."

The building amenities are phenomenal, with a concierge, outstanding fitness center, yoga room, public/hang-out/party room; with big TV, kitchen etc."

10850420,69019334,2016-04-08,29448937,Mark,Adriana was an excellent host and available before and during my stay.  She made it easy to find and get access to where I was staying and was flexible regarding my arrival and departure.  The studio was very clean and in an excellent location with access to the Seaport Conference Center.

10850420,70545696,2016-04-18,19960665,Anthony,"My girlfriend and I had a great stay.  Adriana met us on arrival and showed us everything we needed to know about the unit, including how to operate the robotic component (during our stay, it was just a moving wall with built-in bed/couch/closet.)  She kept the place stocked with all the needed amenities for a comfortable stay - clean linens, towels, even some basic toiletries."
The unit itself is in a new neighborhood - Seaport Square,which used to be mostly a parking lot when I lived in Boston a few years ago.  The building was beautiful,and the apartment was very bright and clean.  Central air was a great plus - there's a Nest controlling the temperature.  You will wake up early,even with the blinds down - a ton of sun gets into the apartment.  There is a concierge downstairs,and it's a short 5 minute walk over the bridge to Downtown Boston.  We walked everywhere and never felt far from home.,
It wasn't too loud at night,and I found it much quieter than NYC.  The bed was serviceable - it seemed to be a hybrid memory foam mattress,though since the frame slid from under the moving wall,it may have had less support than a dedicated bed.  Still,much comfier than many hotel beds I've slept in.,
All-in-all,we didn't spend a ton of time in the unit during our stay,but it was always a great experience.  For individuals,I'd highly recommend this,"and couples should find it reasonably comfortable as well.\"",

It was a super convenient location for all of the Seaport area.  Parking in the basement of the building also made things very easy.

The building was new and equipped with extremely friendly and helpful staff- the apartment itself exceeded my expectations in terms of quality. The Seaport area is a great place to spend time in Boston right now, as there is a ton of new development in a clean harbor-village setting. It is also a relatively short Uber to older enclaves such as Beacon Hill and Back Bay."

Solo was very responsive and accommodating when we were arranging for the place online. He wasn't there during our visit,so sadly we never met him. We did meet Jackie though. She was very sweet and flexible.,,,,
Also,the apartment is in a nice area where fabulous coffee is only a few minute walk away. Overall,"a great experience!\"",,,
11220522,68161152,2016-04-02,61142344,Dalane,"Solo was a great host, making every effort to make sure we had what we needed. He was very accommodating and considerate and made us feel very welcome and comfortable in his home. It is fairly close to the city and he provided passes for the bus service and mass transit. He also has free parking, which is virtually unheard of and a huge help as we had a car. It is a very nice neighborhood with downtown close enough to walk to."

11220522,68781772,2016-04-06,63656600,Christoph,Solo is a great host and had always the time for good conversations. He gave interesting recommendations for different activities. The room is warm and comfortable. The coffee tastes well. ;-)
11220522,69648853,2016-04-12,56365681,Aaron,"My girlfriend and I spent 4 nights in Boston and were ecstatic to find such affordable accommodations in the quaint neighborhood of Brighton.  Solo is a jovial, gracious host and offered us coffee upon our early Friday morning arrival and at the morning of our departure.  Boston is an expansive city, so don't expect everything to be super close.  With public transportation, the peripheral districts are all within 20-40 minute rides with public transportation.  Downtown is approx. a 20-25 minute cab ride, but about 45 minutes or so from bus-train.  We were .3 miles walking distance from some great lunch and breakfast spots as well, which became our daily routine.  Cafe Nation offers great coffee/tea and pastries, while Jim's across the street is the busy Greek-owned, diner-style cafeteria/deli that has excellent breakfast/lunch/dinner options.  It gets busy during the weekend, but highly worth it!  All-in-all, we would recommend this place to anyone who doesn't want to break the bank; it's one of the best deals you'll find!"
11220522,70754290,2016-04-20,40563906,Tobias,The apartment was good for sleeping there and spending the time out in Boston. Solo was very friendly and always keen to help.

11220522,75108198,2016-05-19,7855516,Pamela,Solo's apartment was in a very good location. He is a very nice. The room is very comfortable and big. The Common areas were not as clean and organized as in the pictures but if you just plan to be in the room and then go out then It is a good place.
11220522,75810402,2016-05-23,72000971,Anurag Reddy,The host provided all the things mentioned in the description. It was spacious and good for 4 people.

Wasn't exactly as it looks in pictures, with a pile of duvet covers/laundry lying in the corner of the room and not particularly clean also. However, it was fine for what we needed. Able to catch a bus into Boston from house after 10 minute walk to bus stop."
11220522,77130364,2016-05-30,7066755,Manoëlla&Pierre,Solo had to cancel our booking because of family emergency.
Although we had to find another place at the last minute,we enjoyed our week-end in Boston my friends an I.,,,,
We had'nt the pleasure to meet him,and taste his coffee. We hope that all is fixed for the best for Solo.,,,,

En effet, nous avions réservé pour 3 adultes et donc payé le supplément mais nous avons dû dormir à 3 dans un lit car il n'y avait qu'un lit double. Nous avons aussi trouvé que la propreté des parties communes laissait à désirer."

Trees always make a cool wind and shadow. People and cars just are quite. It is perfect to have a rest time for backpacker. Also it is located near the downtown of Boston,so I took just 30 minutes by bus and train.,,,,
Coffee shop and Japanese restaurant are a best place for a gourmet.,,,,,

We were running 2 1/2 hours late due to traffic, but Vivian was so accomodating and she welcomed us with real warmth and graciousness.  The apartment is even nicer than the photos, and the neighborhood is an A+.  An easy stroll to Boston Commons, past some lovely shops, restaurants, and beautiful architecture.  Quiet, residential neighborhood, with access to convenience shops, Starbucks, take-out and fancy restaurants alike.  We were only there for one night, but the well-appointed kitchen was perfect for whipping up a nice breakfast before heading out for the day.  COMFY queensized bed and sleeper sofa.  Thank you, Glenn... we'll be back!!"
6426364,54720176,2015-11-23,45821949,Nelda,We arrived after 8PM and Vivianne was waiting for us.  She was pleasant and showed us in.  Kevin gave me directions from the airport to the apartment using the train which was very easy to do.  The apartment was neat and clean and I liked the artwork.  It was nice to have information about local restaurants and directions to train lines/bus lines.  We were there for an interview/audition at Berklee and the walk was easy and a perfect distance to work off a little before audition stress.  Thanks for hosting us.  The place was in a nice neighborhood and it was very quiet. Nelda Murphy

Very reactive to get the keys as I was not sure about the exact time I could be at the apartment (I was on a business trip). So it makes my life a lot easier. Thank you!

The place was super clean and had a wonderful AC unit in the living room which provided a nice cool place to escape the very hot days while we were in Boston.

The pictures shown are accurate, the place was very clean, comfortable and cozy, it can easily accommodate 4 people  Glenn provides  all the necessary  equipment to  have a lovelly shower/bad, have a quite evening, enjoy the view and (even) prepare a fancy dinner (not that we did it).  The host was available and easy to reach, the only min point is the lack of parking possibilities (nothing  unusual when staying in any city center of the world)"

12309083,70853710,2016-04-21,2951312,Carman,"Gabe was very quick to accept our reservation and answered all our questions promptly. The condo unit was beautiful, its location was good, and the price is an excellent value for two bedroom ($265 CAD/night when we booked). Staying at this unit was like staying at a hotel but without room service."
Our group liked to walk a lot so we were fine with walking to downtown and uber/taxi (which is super cheap) to further places like Back Bay (Prudential Tower) or Cambridge (Harvard).,,,,,
Check in/out was suppose to be flexible but the concierge told us there were set times. We had to wait a little bit for our rooms but luckily they finished cleaning/preparing the unit shortly after our arrival. Otherwise,check in procedure was really professional and flawless. I enjoy having a building concierge and there were extremely friendly and helpful staff.,,,,
Because the unit didn't have a water view,I was hoping to check out the building's roof deck which looked amazing in the picture,but I was told that it was under construction during our stay.,,,
Overall,"we definitely recommend Gabe's unit to anyone visiting Boston (5/5). We will check this unit's availability first thing if we visit Boston again!\"",,,,

Los encargados del edificio muy amables,  solucionaron todos nuestras inquietudes. La limpieza excelente. El único inconveniente es que  éramos 4 adultos y sólo había dos sillas para  sentarnos a almorzar   o cenar. No había luz en uno de los dormitorios( llevamos una lámpara del living), y no tenía jabón para el lavavajillas ni una fuente de horno suficientemente grande como para poner una pizza. Faltan algunos elementos como una jarra  eléctrica etc, pero son detalles sin demasiada importancia, el departamento es un lujo y el edificio inmejorable.

The building itself is incredibly nice and modern and I was surprised at the deal we got. The views from the apartment are amazing! We were out in the city mostly but actually wish we had time to stay in and take more advantage of everything else like the outdoor deck, rooftop, gym and common areas. It is in a really nice, new looking area of Boston. Getting anywhere was easy to walk or a quick uber/lyft ride. Would definitely stay here again if I'm back."

Definitely a winner. Impeccably clean and all linens are new.
"The view of the city is inspiring. One detail is that the windows open widely from top to almost 36\"\" from the floor and the knob is accessible to young toddlers and is a risk for falls (this is a 9th floor). We kept the kids with us at the room and kept a close eye.\"",,,,,

12309083,91738222,2016-08-06,13566189,Christy,Great place with beautiful rooftop views! COncierge was friendly and the place was clean. Probably more appropriate for four rather than 6.
12309083,92731190,2016-08-09,616965,M.H.,"This was beautiful new luxury apartment in a safe new Seaport location which was very clean.  It was nicer than staying in a 5 star hotel.  It was just steps from a Silver Line bus station which is free from the Airport.   You can walk to the convention center and all the restaurants around the new Seaport area.  We arrived early so we were able to leave our luggage with the 24 hour concierge.  The beds were comfortable and the linens were new and fresh.  We used the new washer and dryer which allowed us to travel light (bring your own powder detergent).   This building had a rooftop lounge which is awesome.  Since check out is 10 AM, we were also able to leave our luggage with the very nice folks on the concierge desk.   We hope to stay here again during our next visit to Boston.  Thank you Gabe!"

His apartment was comfortable and in an ideal location--only a short walk to the convention center and to the MBTA Red Line with access to the rest of the city. However, South Boston is worth checking out. It has come a long way in recent years and is now home to many popular bars and eateries.

4947526,69037938,2016-04-08,65531590,Noah,"The first thing I should mention is how accommodating Chris was to my travel circumstances. My plane was canceled, then my new plane was delayed twice - I ended up not getting to his residence until 2-2:30 am. Throughout all of this Chris was incredibly understanding and just awesome about how flexible he was dealing with all the changes in my travel plans and when I was arriving. Throughout the ordeal I never heard anything from him except 'no problem' or 'don't worry about it.'"
The room itself is exactly as described: the bed was warm and comfy,the closet spacious,the shower hot,the towels fluffy,and the WiFi up.,
I had a conference at The Westin Boston Waterfront,and this room is just down the street. It was a nice 5-10 minute walk in the morning,and there was a Dunkin Donuts on the way.,,,

That included the beach by the Pleasure Bay, which is only 1.8 miles from his flat. Since I was there for a conference, visiting the beach became the destination of my Running time early mornings. The bedroom is exactly how you see on the picture, with enough space to store my suitcase and a desk for my laptop. The bed is very comfortable too. Recommended!"

From the beginning he was fantastic with communicating with me and answering promptly any questions or concerns I had.  he also was very accommodating.  He allowed my friend and I to check in early in the morning of our reservation and left out for  us both individual keys. He also told us that he had another room available next door to the room we rented and was willing to set the bed for us free of charge! So instead of sharing a room we were able to have our own individual comfortable rooms! The place was very spacious (2 floors, 3 bedrooms), clean, and comfortable.  He provided us with everything we needed and the beds were very comfortable.  He even left out granola bars and water for us! Although Chris lives there he was never around during our visit.   The area was very cute and close to the T train or walking distance to the seaport. I would stay there again in a heartbeat!"

The neighborhood is quite and it's easy to get to the subway (short time by walking). And of course, free subway passes it's great and very useful for exploring the Boston without worrying about subway transportation costs. The room was nice, cozy and comfortable. Unfortunately we were staying there just for 1 night, and if only we will go to Boston again we will be glad to use Lisa's housing and to stay there more. Thank you, Lisa! :)"

4025194,19982931,2014-09-21,15528659,Nic,Lisa was such a good host! My girlfriend and I were shocked at how accommodating she was. I would honestly say that this bnb was better than a hotel and by far one of the best AirBNB reservations I have made (we have used the site a number of times). Thanks so much for the chocolates and complimentary breakfast! I hope to stay with Lisa again in the future and recommend friends and family to stay there as well. The bed in the nautical room was huge and spacious and quite comfy.
4025194,20174737,2014-09-24,21596557,David,"Lisa was incredible to communicate with. We booked our room the night before on a last minute whim and Lisa was quick to respond and communicate anything we needed to know. She also suggested a ton of things to check out when we were in Boston. Driving through the suburbs of Boston can be a bit confusing but once we got there Lisa greeted us at the door and showed us around the apartment. Everything was very clean and we definitely loved having cookies and chocolate ready for us! The location was perfect for using the transit system, the bus stop is right in front of the apartment and the subway station is very close by too. To top it all off Lisa provided us with two transit passes to get around during our stay, we definitely got our use out of them."
The apartment was great,Lisa was great,and Boston blew me away. If we are ever back,"the Boston House is where I will look to book first.\"",,
4025194,20375704,2014-09-28,15155602,Elin,"Lisa was an amazing host. When we arrived, she welcomed us with homemade cookies! The place was adorable and very comfortable.

It was very helpful. As described, there is a bus stop across the street to the nearest station and it is less than 10 mins walk as well.  I have met other guests from other countries and enojoyed conversation with them and Lisa as well. It was great experience for me."
4025194,20786102,2014-10-05,10111843,Natalie,"My boyfriend and I had a short but great stay at Lisa's and Brian's place. We only met Lisa. She is a really nice and friendly person. The room, kitchen and even the bathroom we've shared were very clean. We got snacks in our room and breakfast in the morning which was really good. I liked the different kind of coffees. We felt very comfortable and welcomed. I recommend Lisa's and Brian's place highly. Thank you!"
4025194,21090018,2014-10-11,3451098,Christine,We recently stayed in the Nautical Room.  Lisa was very friendly and welcoming and gave us advice on how to get to the various places we wanted to visit.  The bed was really comfortable in this budget accommodation. The house is not far from the subway. The subway passes and breakfast were a bonus.
4025194,21476816,2014-10-18,9841056,Maria,"Lisa is such a great host: very well organized, friendly, and helpful.  I really appreciated the little details (snacks, water, coffee).

4025194,22205081,2014-11-01,6919158,Matthew And Laura,Excellent place and amazing host! We had a great stay with Lisa in the Nautical room.  Bus passes were a nice bonus as was the breakfast. Well worth it!
4025194,22376942,2014-11-04,21951038,Larissa,We stayed 3 nights in Lisa's house and it was really nice. Lisa is a great great host and made us feel welcome right away - we had little chocolates and cookies waiting for us. There are four rooms that are rented out but we never had problems waiting (there are two bathrooms). Breakfast was good!
"I even had a parcel delivered to Lisa which she kindly received and let me pick up even after check out. \"",,,,,
4025194,22589584,2014-11-10,21782968,Solange,"Lisa was a great host, everything she describes about the apartment and neighborhood is true. I really enjoyed staying here and would do it again for sure."

4025194,23173492,2014-11-24,11951076,Corrie,My friend and I stayed in the Nautical room for 3 nights. The room was really cute and we both felt that both Lisa and Brian were very accomadating. We didn't see each other much due to our scheduales but when we did they were great. Brian let us in and went gave us the room tour and Lisa gave us some recommendation on what to do in Boston. Overall it was a great stay and would come back if I'm ever in Boston again.
4025194,23294405,2014-11-28,8170040,Rachel,"We had a really great stay with Lisa and Brian and would definitely recommend their accommodation to other travellers.  Transport links to/from central Boston couldn't be handier - there is a bus stop literally outside their front door or, if you fancy a walk, the nearest T station is less than 10 mins away.  Plus, having the cards giving us unlimited free travel on the T and buses was fantastic.  Lisa and Brian were superb hosts - our inbound flight was delayed and LIsa waited up till after 2300hrs to welcome us and get us settled.  As guests we had full access to a separate kitchen, dining room and living room area on our level of the accommodation and Lisa and Brian provided plenty of food for breakfast every morning, which we weren't expecting and which was most welcome!!  Our room itself was really comfortable and homely and, although we shared a bathroom with other guests, we never had to wait to use it.  We really couldn't fault this airbnb stay - Lisa and Brian go the extra mile in providing things like towels and toiletries, snacks in the rooms, a wide variety of books and brochures on the local area and a HUGE selection of delicious coffees in the kitchen - it really does feel like a home from home!  They also very kindly included us, and other guests, in their Thanksgiving celebrations with their friends, and we had such a fun day.  So, to sum up, a fantastic stay with lovely hosts and excellent value for money.  Thank you so much!"
4025194,23503920,2014-12-02,21462885,Valentina,"The bnb was just like claimed in the advertising. We had a great variety of food for breakfast: cereals, milk, coffee, fruits, bread, cheese, cupcakes and so on. We loved the welcome snacks at our bedroom as well! Also the metro cards were very useful to move around the city. The orange line takes you to each point of interest. The neighborhood is nice and peaceful."
The nautical room was very roomy and comfortable,where we spent 4 nights. One of them,we made some popcorn with Lisa's machine and enjoyed the TV cable in our room.,,,
Lisa was very nice and helpful with us. If we return to Boston some day,"we will definitely consider to stay at Lisa's.\"",,,,

There are so many restaurants offer delivery to her house, bus stop located right front of her house, the train station is 5 min walking distance, also free unlimited bus and train card. Lisa and Brian also had movie room with projector! This place was one of best place to stay if anyone going Boston and if Lisa have room available."

4025194,27788924,2015-03-11,29068349,Henrik,"Very cosy room in an authentic neighbourhood. Lisa and Brian are awesome hosts, while Lisa responded to messages in lighning speed, Brian welcomed us very friendly that we instantly felt at home. The subway tickets were very useful given the station in close range with direct service to the centre of Boston. We strongly recommend this to any future travelers looking for a nice place to stay in Boston."
4025194,27950724,2015-03-15,18304438,Lynda,"All of the raving reviews are true - it was such a pleasure to stay with Lisa and Brian. They were both very warm and inviting hosts who made us feel at home during our first trip to Boston. All of the extra amenities (I.e. Breakfast, movie room, tons of board games, unlimited bus passes, and basic toiletries like shampoo and body wash) were a nice plus that made our stay even more convenient and enjoyable. The room and overall apartment were clean and tidy. Lisa was quick to respond to all of my messages, and they were both very accommodating to help us with any needs we had. Would definitely stay again and highly recommend to others! :)"

The unlimited Charlie Cards were extremely useful and the house was right across from the bus stop and about a ten-minute walk from the T station. Having coffee and breakfast provided was a wonderful way to start the morning at a leisurely pace, and the room was very comfortable. The neighborhood seemed very safe, and it was easy to access other parts of the city. Be sure to check out Simpli Bar&Bites right down the street for inexpensive and great food! Overall, it was a wonderful stay and I would highly recommend it to anyone!"

Le logement est situé à 5 minutes à pied du métro qui met environ 20 minutes à rejoindre le centre ville de Boston et il y a même une multitude de bus si vous êtes fatigué. Si vous restez plusieurs jours,vous aurez même une carte de transport à votre disposition.,,,,

The accommodations were very comfortable and the breakfast options were great.  Lisa even took the time one morning to give me all kinds of helpful information for my daughter and son-in-law who are new to the area and have a new baby. Lisa and Brian are just really nice people who really go the extra mile to make this a really nice place to stay.

Room location is also great, bus is just in front door and metro is just two stops from your rooms. Lisa was very very kind. She drove us for the whole process for getting our car back when my car was towed in Boston. By the way, their kaiju is also lovely. It's a very warm place in cold Boston. Strongly recommend it!!!!!"

The space was very comfy, and convenient to get to from transit. Everything was just as described. I would definitely recommend this place, and can only hope that all Airbnb experiences can be as good as this one. We even got homemade cookies that helped us get through our last day of sight-seeing and travelling; and the fact we could leave our belongings a little longer after check out made the last day so much easier."
4025194,30728862,2015-04-26,23003298,Ken,Lisa was there to greet me and gave great advice to navigate the immediate neighborhood. The room was as presented and plenty comfortable for my single night stay. T pass is handy and the Forest Park station a quick walk down the street.

The room was comfortable and clean.  We had use of a full kitchen, and there were plenty of choices for a hearty breakfast.  A bonus was the free Bus and train passes for each of us.

The moment we got to the house everything felt perfect, with lovely cookies, just right temperature, incredibly comfortable and clean bed, full fridge for breakfast... And I could keep on but there is a reason why 5 stars are a regular in the other reviews. The house is just a 2 min bus ride from the metro station and the free passes they kindly give you help with that. It was so hard to actually go out of all that comfortableness and visit the city.. Thankyou Lisa!"
4025194,33973063,2015-06-02,16142247,Ines,Lisa was a very accommodating host. I arrived very late after helping my daughter move into an apartment and needed to get clarification as to which floor my unit was in.  Lisa was extremely kind and assisted me without any issues. Lisa provides a very warm communal atmosphere where you may meet other guests and share experiences. Located on a somewhat busy street ...however this does offer easy access to public transportation.  Lisa provides a wealth of information to make one's stay completely event filled.
4025194,34086270,2015-06-04,33765454,Roselle,Lisa made my trip to Boston very welcoming. She was very accommodating to allow me to drop my bags before check-in and leave them after check-out.

You find all the things you need for a perfect breakfast in the kitchen, a lot of information on Boston and what to do there and both are very willing to help you with all your questions. The free tickets for public transportation are great and it is really easy to get to the city center in less than half an hour. Perfect place to stay for a visit in Bosoton."
4025194,35426498,2015-06-18,35549433,Julie,"Lisa was a perfect and super chill host. She let us check in at 10 am since we arrived on an overnight bus from Ottawa. This has permitted us to take a quick shower and a nap, so we could fully enjoy our stay in Boston. She also lets you hang out with her bearded dragon, the magnificient Kaiju. The only thing I regret was not staying longer!!! Thanks for everything, enjoy the Sortilège ;)"

4025194,35841277,2015-06-22,29892191,Kim,"Lisa thinks of everything that you would need for your stay! We arrived and got a full tour of the house, clean towels were awaiting on our bed with a small candy, travelling extras were available (such as hair dryer, ear plugs, bottled water, snacks, sound machine, room fan, etc). It was a HUGE bonus to have an unlimited Charlie Card to use on the days the weather didn't cooperate for us to bike around Boston. The location is a little rough around the edges but we never felt unsafe. Plus it's only a 5-10 min walk from the station.  It was also nice to have access to a kitchen and a daily provided breakfast! Lisa is a wonderful host and opens her house up to several guests at a time, so be sure you are open to sharing kitchen/bathroom/living space with other guests! Overall, a great Boston experience with convenient access to the best of the city!"

4025194,37207352,2015-07-05,33225149,Jessee,This trip was absolutely amazing! Lisa was a great host. She greeted us at the door and gave us a tour of the place and also recommended some places to see/eat. She also provided transit passes and breakfast. The house had a very pleasant and friendly atmosphere and it was right across the street from the bus. I definitely recommend her to anyone that wants to take a trip to Boston!
4025194,37437721,2015-07-06,5096478,Hussein,"Unexpectedly we had to instant book this room because we missed our bus home. Within minutes Lisa called to confirm everything and provide us with a all the details we needed. The room was incredible, with every possible convenience prepared, including fresh baked cookies. Lisa and Brian are really warm and welcoming, and have created a special enclave that is perhaps the best AirBnB room that we have ever stayed in."
4025194,37861393,2015-07-11,34144423,Tina,"This listing was very accurate, and we couldn't have had a better first experience with airbnb!!  We weren't around the house a lot, as there is so much to do in Boston.  However, Brian and Lisa were incredibly welcoming and always there if we needed anything. The neighborhood was safe, and the home was clean and neat. Breakfast was great, and the transportation passes were incredibly helpful.  It would be tough for anyone else to top this experience, and we will definitely book with them again if we are back in Boston!"
4025194,38159356,2015-07-13,35812583,Michelle,"Lisa and Brian we're welcoming. They seemed happy to have us there and answered our questions when we had any.The room was just the way it was described :) the neighborhood was ok, the bus stops are across from their house and right in front of their house. The train station was a 10 minute walk. The room was clean and comfortable they even had a sleep easy. The kitchen was stocked with breakfast necessities as mentioned."
4025194,38609961,2015-07-17,34699674,Jessica,"Staying with Lisa was truly an amazing experienece. She was very helpful whenever I asked for directions and she always had suggestions for places to visit. The transit passes were a plus!! The apartment was cozy and very clean and safe. Lisa keeps the home clean and with everything you could need during your visit, if I ever visit Boston again I would look into this bnb again without a doubt."
4025194,38806832,2015-07-18,38775629,Thomas,"This is more than your regular airbnb listing - this is a full on bed and breakfast. The amenities are cool; movie theater, popcorn, board games, terrace, free breakfast etc. We had a great stay, Lisa was very welcoming and it was obvious she enjoyed meeting travelers. We booked very last minute, so she was really flexible with her time and getting the room ready. So nice of her! We loved the snacks in our room and the free public transportation is just so generous, really. In general a nice stay. Don't expect luxury, but really good value for money."
4025194,38959260,2015-07-19,11520534,Cian,"Pros: friendly and relaxed, but diligent hosts, very convenient location, tons of help with logistics of getting around and seeing things in Boston, very comfortable room with all necessary amenities, tasty breakfast, perfectly clean and tidy."
Cons: none.,,,,,

4025194,39766260,2015-07-26,34186782,Jacqueline,"We had a wonderful experience staying at this home. Lisa was very welcoming and provided guidance when we asked for places to visit in town. The house was clean and we were thankful for the comfortable bedroom (with air conditioning & TV), clean bathroom, and use of the kitchen. The Charlie Card passes were very helpful too! Lisa is a great host and we highly recommend this home!"
4025194,40445906,2015-07-31,17166187,Jan,Lisa is a wonderful host who really cares about her guests. My girlfriend and I stayed in Boston for 4 nights in the Nautic room. Even if we checked-in late at night it was no problem at all. Her hosting was very professional and the fact that the metro cards and a little breakfast were included made it the best choice for us. We would definitely recommend to stay at Lisa's house.
4025194,40901590,2015-08-03,32363517,Lydia,"I had a great time at Boston! Lisa and Brian were very accommodating. The Charlie passes were very helpful, we got around the city with no problem. I definitely recommend staying with Lisa and Brian they are great people :)"
4025194,41473647,2015-08-07,39235395,Corinna,"The room was excatly what it looked like on the picture - friendly and spacious, theres even a closet in the wall to hang on clothes! Lisa wellcomed us like we were friends for years, so we felt very comfortable and really like at home! I had panties to fix and asked her for a tailor and cause she didnt know one, gave my panties to brian. He did a great job!!"
4025194,41698347,2015-08-08,39076887,Em,"Lisa sets the bar for every host out there. She met us, offered a tour & had chocolates, water & snacks waiting in our room. She lent us the unlimited T cards which were amazing! It was a short walk to the T station & a cab back was only about $20. Although we didn't eat breakfast, it was adorable that she had so many options, should we have wanted to eat. Definitely stay with Lisa for a great AirBnB experience in Boston!"
4025194,42701254,2015-08-15,32610932,Heiko,We had a wonderful time in Boston. Lisa was a great host! The breakfast and the included metro cards really make this a good package.
4025194,42900403,2015-08-16,32054440,Jessica,"Lisa and Brian were very hospitable.  We stayed for one night, my husband and I in the double bed and our 9-yr old son in a cot right next to us.  It was very comfortable, with easy access to the restroom, to the kitchen and to all of the food provided made things extremely comfortable, just like home. They have a pet bearded-dragon (lizard),  which I am not terribly fond of, but was fine with it staying in its cage. However, Lisa wanted to make sure we had the most pleasant stay, and moved the animal elsewhere.  Having the subway passes included was very helpful.  Lastly, I am lactose intolerant and Lisa made sure to buy a lactose-free milk for me in advance.  It was so kind of her and saved me a trip to the store!  We would certainly stay here again if we return to the Boston area."
4025194,43516017,2015-08-20,38366741,Kinsey,"This was our first time using Airbnb and it was a great experience.  Lisa was a great host and we would definitely stay here again if ever in the Boston area.  The bus/train  cards she provided made it very easy to get around and enjoy the city.  The rooms were clean, comfortable and accommodating.  Thank you, Lisa for being such a great host!"
4025194,43950216,2015-08-23,36500315,Kimberly,"Lisa was an amazing host, very efficient with communications, very knowledgeable of the area, accommodations were exactly as described. The bed was super comfortable and air conditioner in our room fantastic, I live in Arizona and I thoroughly enjoy my air conditioner. Such a lovely stay. The location was great, easy access to all the railways, and a bus stop right in front of the house, so convenient. Thanks for such a wonderful stay."

4025194,45272185,2015-09-01,38150960,Evelyn,Lisa is so nice and offer whatever we need. Her house is very close to the T within walking distance. We had very busy schedule in those two days. She allowed us to leave our luggages there and pick up later even after check-out. It was fantastic staying in Lisa's house.
4025194,45545305,2015-09-03,43134673,Michelle,"Lisa made me feel so welcome, even at 2am! it was my first and best air bnb experience so far. The room is nicer than the pictures, and there's even snacks and water in the room which is excellent especially after travelling all day, its the little things like this that made my experience thoroughly enjoyable and I wish I had more time there it was ideal and conveniently located to downtown with a bus right outside that brings you straight to the subway!! bottom line couldn't recommend it more nicer than some hotels I have stayed in!"
4025194,45970051,2015-09-07,39524868,Amy,"Lisa was an excellent host! She gives very clear, detailed directions, which, if you're a details person like I am,  is so convenient for touring Boston; makes your stay much less stressful. The complimentary bus/train passes are such an added benefit (saved us about $25 a day). Lisa & Brian have made every accommodation to meet any & every need you may have. Delightful couple; cozy home. If we are ever in town again, we will definitely be returning to their home."
4025194,46492992,2015-09-11,21129146,Tracy,"Lisa & Bryan were great host! Lisa made us so comfortable that it felt like we were staying with family. Yes the listing was exactly as stated. Having use of the Charlie cards was so helpful to get around Boston. We were new to Boston and Lisa was so knowledgeable. Her expertise  of the area gave us a great advantage so that we were able to see everything we had come to see. Next time we come to Boston, we would love to stay at Lisa & Brian's again."
4025194,47182546,2015-09-16,34192253,璇,A really good stay in Boston. Lisa is very nice. And it is so considerate of them providing the transportation card. Thank you so much!
4025194,47493371,2015-09-19,41248266,Rebekah,"Listing was completely accurate. Lisa and Brian were so welcoming and it was like entering a friend's house! This was our first Airbnb and we hope they all match up to this experience. Thank you for providing a  clean, safe, quiet him away from home."
4025194,48008771,2015-09-22,19444362,Brenda,"\"This was our first experience staying in a \"\"private room\"\" Airbnb; and it was a great place to start!  The room is as pictured; the house is close to the T - easy to walk from station to Lisa's house.  Lisa provides a multitude of helpful items in the room regarding the house"
"Lisa is very reachable by text which was helpful.  She was flexible on our arrival and departure which was very helpful.  Another nice touch was when I told Lisa we were going to be tourists she sent a list of fun activities.  There are lots of travel books available in the public area.  \"",,,,,
4025194,48288230,2015-09-25,40744204,Dom,"Lisa was awesome! The room was perfect for what we needed, and she was more than helpful with anything we needed."
4025194,48533723,2015-09-27,40440520,Katie,Lisa's place was my first experience using airbnb and I'm very happy to say it will keep me coming back! She was very kind in answering questions and accommodating our arrival needs. She pays attention to detail and went the extra mile to make me and my friend feel at ease and at home. The use of the subway passes was amazing! Would absolutely recommend.
4025194,48816842,2015-09-28,20954235,Kristin,"Lisa and Brian were very responsive prior to my stay and very hospitable. Clean quiet room with thoughtful touches like chocolate, snacks, bottled water and breakfast in the morning. Would stay again."
4025194,49079935,2015-09-30,20430881,Rikke,"Lisa og hendea mand var meget gæstfrie og meget hjælpsomme. Med til lejemålet var et tog og buskort som man frit kunne bruge for at komme ind til Boston, hvilket gør beliggenheden ideel."
"Kan varmt anbefales\"",,,,,
4025194,49142499,2015-10-01,42165061,Melissa,"Lisa is a great host. She is very organised and generous. As first time visitors to Boston she was very helpful with hints about where to visit and how to get there. Lisa's accomodation is comfortable, clean and well located (there is even a bus stop located right out the front door!)."
4025194,49338895,2015-10-03,36004579,Pam,"\"What a wonderful experience! Our room and the place was as described. There were clean linens, fresh towels and washcloths for us. The bed was comfortable. The breakfast items offered are very nice, there are snacks in the room, and the unlimited bus and subway cards for my husband and I to use were much appreciated! We shared the common areas with other Airbnb guests, which was a blast! We met and chatted with several lovely travelers from China, and enjoyed chatting with Lisa and her husband some as well. It is extremely apparent that Lisa and her husband enjoy hosting travelers, as their home is warm and welcoming with various helpful traveling books, maps, many games, a theater room, and a US and World Map on the wall, where travelers can leave a pin representing where they are from. We had an AC unit in our bedroom, a fan, and the bedroom door locks from the inside and the outside. There is a sliding lock on the inside, if you prefer using that for extra security (which we did not feel we needed). There is a guest book by the bed, which I wrote in and enjoyed perusing and giggled at some witty comments by previous guests. Although my husband and I drove there, we parked our rental car (on the street with no issues) and used public transportation while in the Boston area. The house is very convenient to public transportation, which was awesome. Lisa and Brian have a bearded dragon lizard, who is very cool (no, he doesn't roam the house, but if he did, I wouldn't mind!) and a beta fish in the bathroom on the wall in a cool half fish bowl (URL HIDDEN) no pet allergies to worry with! The last night we were there, we walked in to find chocolate chip cookies made from scratch on the dining room table with a cover over it and a note to \"\"Enjoy!\"\" They were delicious! I would stay here again in a heartbeat! Great place to stay--warm"
4025194,49733137,2015-10-05,9307718,Martin,"Lisa and Brian were very welcoming from the beginning when I first reserved our room, and were excellent hosts the whole way through. Their home is clean and in a part of Boston where parking is easily found, which is a great plus. From the moment my girlfriend and I walked in we felt like we were in good hands. Even if you just go for the complimentary chocolate chip cookies baked by Lisa, I promise you it is worth it. I would not hesitate to come stay again."
4025194,49854139,2015-10-06,45435914,Luis,"Phenomenal Host. I went to a Tri-state Experience, and Lisa was the best Host ever. I cannot complain about anything. Very clean, great Location, nice room, and affordable. I will definitely come back to Lisa's paradise when ever i travel back to Boston and i will only recommend my best friends to book her . 10A service!"
4025194,50111274,2015-10-09,37398765,Lisa,"Lisa is a great host who knows how to bake delicious cookies :-) the Charliecards are definitely a plus! Location is easy to get to, not to far from the center,but located near a quite noisy road (but as a great host Lisa forsees earplugs to counter this). Everything is forseen to make yourself a nice breakfast. We had a good 3 nights stay here."
4025194,50295459,2015-10-11,41951384,Wei Han,We had great experience here
Provided plentiful food like we were at home,,,,,

"If u visit boston here is the best choice\"",,,,,
4025194,50847263,2015-10-15,4801286,Luke,"Lisa and Brian's home was great! Forrest hills station is no more than 5 minutes walk which takes you to downtown Boston just 15/20 minutes on the Subway, the free travel cards came in really handy! The room was clean, comfortable and had lots of cool freebies, hand made cookies, water and snacks. Lisa also puts together a great breakfast table which we enjoyed. The house also is stones throw away form a beautiful country park which we walk through, make sure you go up peters hill as it has amazing views of downtown Boston."
4025194,51535535,2015-10-21,42205139,Patrick,"Lisa was an excellent host and the room was exactly as pictured. The provided breakfast was even more than we expected. Lisa was both friendly and professional. My wife and I haven't ever traveled around a big city and Lisa went out of her way to explain the subway (the T) and she provided directions for all of the attractions we wanted to see. The access cards for the subway and buses were a HUGE perk. We used them everyday and were able to get within a couple blocks of everything we wanted to see and do. This was my first experience with AirBnB, and I'll admit it was even a little out of my comfort zone, but Lisa did a great job of making us feel welcome. When we return to Boston, we will be booking our stay with Lisa."
She will be highly recommended to my traveling friends and family.,,,,,

Lisa did everything to make me feel home at her and her husband's place: she was very communicative, responded to my messages quickly, had a lot of great tips on things to do, and helped whenever she could. I would definitely recommend staying at her place. The neighborhood is calm and offers quite a number of places to go and things to do. Definitely visit the Arnold Arboretum when staying at Lisa's place. The place is easily reached via public transportation which stops right in front of the door. Thank you for having me, Lisa!"

They made our stay extremely memorable and there was nothing they could've done to make it better! Lisa was extremely helpful in giving us suggestions as to what we could do and she tried to assist us in any way! She leaves little snacks in your room (like homemade chocolate chip cookies) to make your stay feel more like home! The neighborhood was quiet and safe! My friend and I had a wonderful experience in Boston and Lisa's home made it that much better!"
4025194,56648471,2015-12-15,45138469,Oliver,"\"Lisa made us feel at home as soon as we got there. The Nautical (the room's name) was comfortable and she had snacks for when we went out to venture. Lisa also provided a lot of information for places to visit, from cultural, historical, food, etc. We were a 10 minute walk from the train station and Lisa provided us with \"\"Charlie Tickets\"\" to enter and ride the subway and bus. My fiancée and I had a wonderful experience and definitely recommend this place. \""

4025194,59017341,2016-01-05,42940100,Fanlu,"I was shocked by the first day I entered this room, it looks even warmer than my own apartment and became a reason I want to spend one more day in Boston. Boston is quiet cold these days and apparently not preferable for outdoor sightseeing, so we spend many time just in the house. That was a very interesting experience since Lisa's house is full of fun. There are a lot of attractive board games, and even a big movie screen is provided. We love this place!!"
4025194,59261805,2016-01-08,12191007,Cheshire,Lisa was awesome!  The space and the hosts were inviting and welcoming.  We will definitely keep an eye on Lisa's spaces for future visits.

4025194,59907373,2016-01-17,19472956,Erik,"This was our second time staying with Lisa and we loved it again. Just like last time (sept 2014) I have nothing bad to say about staying here. Lisa and Brian are more than helpful with anything you may need. This house is far enough away from downtown Boston that its quiet for sleeping and relaxing, but yet its only a short T ride away. I am already looking forward to my next trip to Boston. The house is always clean and it feels like I am staying right at home."
4025194,60554097,2016-01-24,48155217,Bethany,Great Hosts! Made my trip enjoyable and stress free! They were very accommodating when I needed to extend my stay because of a storm!

She was a delightful and welcoming host and did a great job showing us all the amenities of the lodging. The room, bathroom, and kitchen were well equipped for our stay. We took advantage of the \"\"movie room\"\" and Lisa even baked cookies for us for movie time."
Lisa and Brian were so pleasant when we encountered them during our stay and always offered suggestions on what we could do while we were in town. It was a bonus to have Charlie Cards available  and maps of the subway and nearby arboretum to use. Lisa is a great ambassador for Boston and provided us with lots of up-to-date information about what to do during our stay.,,,,,
The building is on a main street in Roslindale which makes grabbing a bus and getting to the subway very easy. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance and Lisa has compiled a book of menus for carryout options. (Our room was on the second floor of the building so you do need to be able to climb the stairs if you're going to stay here.),,,,,
It was fun to see the big map in the dining room with pins in it from all their visitors from around the world. Lisa has designed the set up of the apartment in a very thoughtful way for her guests. It was the perfect set up for our needs for our week-long visit to Boston.,,,,,

4025194,65171005,2016-03-11,59188471,Rebecca,"Lisa was fantastic to have as our first AirBNB host! I worry that other hosts will not compare from here. She immediately made us feel totally at home and showed us what we options we had at the house. Before arriving, she had already given us a detailed list of what there was to do around the area and how to get around the area. They really have thought of everything! And the cookies were fantastic! :)"

I could list everything that was great about staying with them but the list would be too long, so here are a few of the high points: proximity to the T (and the free Charlie Cards!), comfortable room and bed, complimentary breakfast foods, and easy parking. They are both also very easy to reach by text and have many suggestions for things to do. I would definitely stay there again if in the Boston area."
4025194,66209290,2016-03-20,59527604,Chilanay,"Lisa and her husband were very friendly to me and my friend.

They have amazing dragon which is definitely worth to see,especially with its cute clothes."

The room we stayed in was clean, neat and quiet.  The snacks in the room were nice to take with us on our outings.  She even supplies a hairdryer!  The kitchen was large and everything was labeled for our convenience.  Breakfast was delicious!  We even got bus/subway tickets to use while we were staying with Lisa.

4025194,69599505,2016-04-11,30307187,Nilsa,Lisa and Brian were amazing. It felt like a home away from home.

She also is great with helping you get around town if your new to Boston.

The neighborhood was great on A main street of Boston right near A major subway station which is always nice.

4025194,73381239,2016-05-08,70479298,Breen,They were awesome. Their pet was cool. Had fun talking with Lisa. They gave us free beer that they didn't want in the fridge which was nice.  There was a party upstairs of rhinos but didn't matter much I just played card games and drank beer.
4025194,74806822,2016-05-16,35775335,Lyndsie,"This was my first airbnb stay, and I was nervous because I'd never tried it before. Lisa made us feel comfortable and welcome, her home was super convenient to the T station, the room was clean and private. Lisa provided us with breakfast every day and the use of their kitchen and fridge. I loved everything about staying with them."
4025194,75063968,2016-05-18,68060817,Alwin,"Aardige behulpzame Lisa. Uitgebreid en goed ontbijt. De accommodatie is slecht onderhouden, en erg vies: smerige koelkast en afval en veel stof onder het bed. Verder ligt de accommodatie in een matige buurt."
4025194,75426705,2016-05-21,47183111,Komal,"Lisa was super helpful, she was accommodating enough to let us check in and check out late. Her house is extremely guest friendly and the facilities such as the passes for the T and the breakfast were definitely one of the best I have come across at an airbnb."

4025194,84168851,2016-07-05,78068661,芸,"I booked the room in Lisa's house for my brother. According to his description, staying at Lisa's made him feel back home again and he liked it very much: The warm hospitality from Lisa and his husband, the cozy and clean room, the privacy he enjoyed in the house, the convenience of its location...everything was just perfect! Actually when I'm writing this piece of feedback, my brother is still at Lisa's because he decided to spend the rest of his nights staying in Boston and extended his reservation. In a word, Lisa is a fantastic  host and her house is highly recommended!"
4025194,86210022,2016-07-15,81555807,Tracy,"It's a wonderful experience of staying at Lisa and Brian's place, the breakfast, the transportation card, even some coupons to the museums, all beyond my expectations.

4025194,87269945,2016-07-19,22166205,Moritz,"Great all around! This is the cheap-skate option given Boston prices, and yet it offers all one could desire from an affordable airbnb and more. Aside from well-organized information, a well-kept house, well-equipped kitchen, nicely prepared room and the offered groceries for breakfast Lisa was very responsive to our last-minute booking, helped us out with specific requests and just an enjoyable person to be around! Thank you!"
4025194,88597055,2016-07-24,36894411,Ginger,"\"This was our second time staying with Lisa and Brian. We enjoyed visiting with them again and meeting the other guests. The location is convenient and the included Charlie Cards makes using mass transit a breeze. We like cooking our own breakfast in the kitchen. Their pet \"\"bearded dragon\"\" is fun to watch. We're already looking forward to our next Boston visit so we can stay with Lisa and Brian again!"

4025194,91036942,2016-08-03,80079089,Michael,"Das Zimmer entsprach in vollem Umfang der Beschreibung. Die Ausstattung der Küche, die kostenlose Monatskarte für den öffentlichen Nahverkehr und die große Hilfsbereitschaft der Gastgeberin machten den Aufenthalt unkompliziert."

Voici un airbnb très organisé !,,,,,
+Il y a tout ce qu'il fait pour rester quelques jours dans la chambre qui est spacieuse et dont l'emplacement est réellement très pratique pour visiter Boston.,,,,,
-Les 2 lits sont de très mauvais qualité (le premier à ressort et le second était gonflable) ce qui nous a fait mal au dos.,,,,,
-La salle de bain n'était pas propre,,,,,
It's an organised airbnb !,,,,,
+They have all you need in the room who is big and is a real good situation for visit Boston.,,,,,
-Bed are really bad... (one with old spring and other with air) we do'nt have a good night,,,,,
"-Bathroom was not clean\"",,,,,
13767907,84090474,2016-07-05,71391443,Eva,Room was cozy and welcoming. The location was very convenient for our weekend travels.
13767907,84293587,2016-07-06,81004170,Jim,"This place was a nice gated college neighborhood with town homes and a tennis court. It was a 3 minute walk to the harbor.  11 minute walk to the red line where I connected to down town Boston and a connection to the green line where I would exit Kenmore stop for Fenway park. I only used this place for sleep and to leave my luggage while I was exploring Boston. If you don't mind sleeping on air mattres,  then this place is good for your purposes of exploring."
13767907,84647373,2016-07-08,19850403,Marella,Yizuo was really nice and available for all our questions. And she always responded very quuckly. We did not meet her in person but she left notices in her bedroom so that we could get along with everything. Unfortunately the beds were really bed so that we both had to sleep in one of the better bed. It is also pretty loud during the night because of the air conditioner.the rest of the appartment was not really clean or tidy....the location is not so practical to go to the center of boston.with our luggage it took us a 15min walk to the nearest metro station and ca 45min to the center...but there was the sea very close to the appartment.
13767907,85646971,2016-07-12,10575896,Arkadz,My first negative review on AirBnB...
Start with good stuff: nice and quiet neighborhood,very close to a beautiful boardwalk,not far from UMass/JFK station. Host left clean towels,shampoos and stuff,"and nice little notes with \"\"here's this","here's that\"\"..."
Now the bad: the mattress on the floor was uncomfortable enough that I would prefer the air mattress... But the air mattress was not fully inflated and no compatible inflator. The bathroom did not look clean (but that may be because it's old). The neighbor downstairs was watching TV loudly half the night and full throat SINGING?! (I guess singing along to his headphones) the other half. (The singing started around 4:30 am),,,,,
Altogether,"I left with an unpleasant feeling...\"",,,,
13767907,87137969,2016-07-18,78582256,Petra,"It was really nice to stay in Yizuo s room. Everything is clean and nice smells. Communication it was so good! We have to recommend it! Thank you, Yizuo."

13767907,93166354,2016-08-11,20538042,Kyle,"Great value and the specific room we stayed in was clean and in nice condition. However, the bathroom was not very clean and a roommate would periodically sing loudly & chain smoke."
13767907,94366752,2016-08-15,14465922,Onrie,Yizou was very kind and cordial! I appreciated everything she did for me! Great host!
13767907,95525500,2016-08-20,13552757,Nizar,The room is clean. Instructions helpful. Good price to quality. Near the inbound redline to city center. If ur passing through and like a quiet spot but also near the city then it is good. Matrices are inflated and could be improved. All in all it was a pleasant experience.
395975,17606628,2014-08-14,1941654,Ann,"Mike accepted a last minute request for a stay in a very responsive and timely manner.  Mike is very personable and his space was perfect for our needs.  We wanted a place that had easy access to the airport for a very early morning flight.  His 3rd floor apartment is clean and welcoming and the beds were comfortable.  He is knowledgeable and enthusiastic and was very helpful in answering many questions about the area! We did not have time to enjoy all the amenities close by (beach, bars and downtown), but plan to next time we are in Boston.  I would highly recommend Mike and his apartment."
395975,18926157,2014-09-02,20631829,Samantha,"I needed a place to stay last minute and Mike was very accommodating. I had a pleasant three night stay at this South Boston apartment. The place is a couple blocks from the beach and you have easy access to the airport. It is in a nice, quiet neighborhood. I had a lovely stay at Mike's apartment. Great location, great host!"
395975,46635939,2015-09-12,25906290,John,Mike and Tim were great hosts. Extremely friendly and knowledgable about the area. Their place is great if you want to be able to easily get around the city.
"The place was kept nice and clean and I definitely felt welcome and at home while I was there.\"",,,,,
395975,49039175,2015-09-30,11445731,Miriam,Die Unterkunft bei Mike war eine gute Entscheidung. Beide Jungs sind sehr nett und aufgeschlossen und wir haben uns direkt wohl gefühlt. Über das übliche Hallo hinaus haben wir uns gut unterhalten und den Abend gemeinsam mit Mike verbracht.
Die Lage der Unterkunft ist sehr ruhig und in einem schönen Wohnviertel gelegen. Von der Dachterrasse aus kann man abends die Gebäude am Hafen und einen Teil der Skyline sehen. Mike war im Vorfeld sehr hilfsbereit und hat uns die Anreise und auch die Ankunft sehr leicht gemacht. Das Zimmer ist zwar relativ klein für 2 Personen mit 4 Gepäckstücken,aber für eine Nacht war es total ausreichend. Auch das Twinbett war für 2 Erwachsene sehr schmal,aber gemütlich. Zu Fuß kann man in kurzer Zeit das Wasser,den Strand,"Pizzerien und einen Supermarkt erreichen. Die Anreise ohne eigenes Auto ist empehlenswert. Wir hatten wirklich einen sehr angenehmen Aufenthalt und würden jeder Zeit wieder bei Mike und Tim übernachten.\"",
395975,49802585,2015-10-06,14848654,Andrew,"Mike made us feel welcome from the minute we got there. He is very knowledgeable on the city and a great host. He is laid back, always willing to help, and strives to ensure you have a great experience. We would love to stay with Mike again"
395975,51490439,2015-10-20,45548497,Ping,Mike is an excellent AirBnB host!  The check in process was seamless and very easy.  He provided several gems that only a local would know - including transportation advice that saved me a money and time!  Definitely a solid guy to stay with if you are ever in Boston!
395975,51762345,2015-10-24,36918215,Larisa,"We spent two nights at Mike's. Absolutely positive experience. He and his housemate, Tim were really nice& open. Mike also gave us lots of useful recommendations and constantly offered to help :) truly appreciated !"
We would recommend staying with the guys!,,,,,

395975,70642573,2016-04-19,17417650,Brittany,"Mike was a perfect host! After arriving very late Sunday night, Mike stayed up and even assisted when we could not find parking. Though Mike was not around much, he went above and beyond providing information on the best stops to visit in Boston, as well as the fun exciting events taking place. I would highly recommend Mike to anyone!"
395975,78023876,2016-06-05,15940651,Eugene,"Mike is a really chill guy. He was very accommodating, and knowledgeable about Boston. I had a great time, and would stay with him again."

395975,87817301,2016-07-22,76311014,Elliott,"Experience was simple. Liked that the lockbox was there so I could come and go whenever I pleased, regardless of Mike being there or not. Wi-Fi was fast, bed comfortable, and location was quaint and chill. Great way to save money over Bostons outrageous prices in the summer. I'd stay here again."
395975,89438337,2016-07-28,85650339,Chris,"Great stay overnight. Easy access to get in with the lock box and Mike is super easy to get a hold of and get a response back. Room served its purpose, nice night's sleep and convenient checking out. Just far enough to escape downtown but still within walking distance! Didn't get to the beach, maybe next time! Thanks Mike."
395975,97787281,2016-08-28,25714620,Douglas,Great stay at Mike's place! It's quite close to downtown as well as the beach and Mike is a very helpful host who provide an exhaustive list over things to do while in Boston. Recommended!
10034183,59793531,2016-01-15,50284982,Brenna,Wonderful experience. This was my first airbnb stay. I will definitely use it again. Neils' place was clean and well kept. A quiet neighborhood with easy access to the sights. Neil's checked in to make sure we had arrived and that we were comfortable with the accommodations. Highly recommended.

This space was the most homey space I've booked through airbnb. The pictures dont give justice to how beautiful the apartment was. With the sun roofs that let the sun shine for natural light through the apartment, the windows that let the cool breeze in, and the quiet neighborhood. He greeted us with a note, a bottle of wine, and a fridge full of more than just the basic things we needed to whip up something to eat. He answered all my inquiries quickly and made sure my stay was in Boston was a pleasant one. I will definitely try to book this place again for my next trip to Boston!"
13377097,82042574,2016-06-26,73610312,James,"The hosts were great. They contacted me in advance by text to make sure I was able to check in easily. Kathe greeted me and was very kind and welcoming. This is a nice apartment; pictures are accurate, clean and historic looking. Private bathroom. The apartment is in a very desirable location in the south end. I was able to walk from Boston Common one evening."
In a fluke,the gas company had to make some emergency repairs one late afternoon/evening that required them to excavate right in front of the apartment and do some work inside. Kathe informed me by text. The work was very noisy and lasted past midnight. Graciously,Kathe offered to refund the cost of my staff that night.,,,
"I would definitely stay here again.\"",,,,,
13377097,82738956,2016-06-29,16781648,Jordan,"We had no trouble finding the place and Kathe gave us great instructions on where to park.

The host is very kind,polite and helpful. Her apartment looks just like the description on airbnb,very clean quite and tidy.,,,

Although she was not there during my daughter & my stay, she went above & beyond to make certain we had all the info & items necessary for our 1st AirBNB experience!

9757412,59141889,2016-01-07,27805509,Eric,Cynthia est une hote charmante. L endroit est bien plac sans etre central toutefois. La chambre est par contr toute petite et le matelas correct. Un bon endroit malgre tout!
9757412,59267988,2016-01-08,4433923,Nicholas,"Amazing apartment. I was very jealous that she lives in such a lovely place. Cynthia was a great host, kept everything very easy to operate and understand and also had amazing coffee. If I'm back in Boston soon I'd easily stay at her place again. A+"

9757412,59583449,2016-01-12,886425,Kristin,"Our plane was later than we anticipated but Cynthia made sure we had directions and access to the apartment far ahead of time. It was easy to find and we had no difficulties getting in (although it was nearly 1am). We were out most of the time we stayed but she made us feel very welcome, even left some cookies in the kitchen so when we came back from sightseeing we both got a treat before bedtime."
9757412,59721333,2016-01-14,53282730,Devon,This location is very convenient. I had never visited Boston before. It's about a 12-15 minute Uber/Taxi ride from South Station. Same time if you use the local bus.
My Airbnb host was very gracious. She gave me maps of things in the area and a delicious cookie when I arrived. The apartment is immaculately kept just like the room I was in. No exaggeration,that had to be one of the most comfortable beds that I have ever slept on. The room itself has a place to hang clothes and even a desk and chair to sit at in addition to the bed.,,,,
"My only complaint would be I thought the steps were steep but that would be me nit picking as I had no issue with them. I'd highly recommend this place for a visit.\"",,,,,
9757412,64746645,2016-03-07,57150516,Pim,Cynthia was a great host! Her apartment was very clean and nice. She gave us a selfmade guide for sightseeing Boston what was very good. The apartment was easy to find and we were also able to park our car in her private parking spot.
9757412,66095936,2016-03-19,24421673,Jarrett,"Everything was as described in this charming little apartment. The bed was very cozy and although I wasn't there very much (I was in town to sight-see and get to know the city), there were zero problems with Cynthia's place."

"Highly recommended!!\"",,,,,
9757412,68420591,2016-04-04,48652575,Sanna,A South End Gem indeed!
Excellent access to public transport,or even a walk to the city area if the weather is nice. Cynthia was really prompt to reply when needed,the room was absolutely lovely and very quiet at night. Full marks from me,"I'd definitely recommend if you need a place to sleep in Boston.\"",,
9757412,70366274,2016-04-17,61847497,John,"I did not have an opportunity to meet Cynthia during my stay, but I could not have asked for better accommodations.  Cynthia's Airbnb was only a minute or two walk from the Silver T line in Boston allowing for easy access to the city and short walk if you are coming home late."
Cynthia's photos do the Airbnb justice as the home looks exactly as shown.  The room is perfect for a one person brief visit to the city.  As one of my early  Airbnb experiences,I could only hope that future accommodations are as nice as this listing.,,,,
At first entering the Airbnb,Cynthia left a wonderful and helpful guide towards local shops and restaurants.   Additionally,I had the opportunity to meet Cynthia's roommate who was exceedingly friendly and mentioned some local areas to hit during my visit.,,,
The only note I would make regarding the listing is that the airbnb is located a up a few flights of stairs.  If you are more than fine with stairs,"this would be a tough reservation to pass up.\"",,,,
9757412,88775439,2016-07-25,57186004,Miguel,"Cynthia was a fantastic host! My parents were coming to visit and there was not enough room in my one-bedroom and Cynthia's apartment was a perfect solution for them in the gorgeous South End. My parents would NOT stop raving about how much the loved the location or apartment and, after running into Cynthia herself, what a kind and generous host she was. If her apartment is available next time they are in town I know exactly where they will be requesting to stay!"
9757412,95993378,2016-08-21,7299720,John,Cynthia was fantastic!   Incredibly accessible and available if I needed.  The apartment is convenient and spacious. I would definitely stay again.
"Thanks for everything Cynthia!  \"",,,,,

8442314,49694751,2015-10-05,44613978,Alex,"I had a great time with the hosts who were very friendly and professional and provided suggestions and information on the areas to check out around the city. The accommodations were clean, safe and perfect for what I was looking for. The bed was very comfortable, the sheets were cleaned every day as well as complimentary towels and water provided. All in all, it was over and above what I expected and I would not hesitate to stay again."
8442314,49950842,2015-10-07,10216975,Stephanie,"Convenient lodging for interviews at the Longwood medical industrial complex -- literally a 5-minute walk from Harvard Medical School, Beth Israel, and the Brigham. The host is extremely friendly, easygoing and responsive by text or telephone. The room is well-appointed and thoughtfully outfitted with towels, clean sheets, Wifi, and hardwood floors. Although the hardwood floors make soundproofing difficult, you can be serenaded by amazing live classical piano music from one of the apartment mates. The host was also very kind and flexible with check-in and check-out times since we had airplane flights at early and late hours."
8442314,50673951,2015-10-13,44610027,Susan,"Brett and his roommates were friendly and welcoming. His place is conveniently located, close to public transportation. The simply furnished room met our needs. We slept well on the brand new mattress and fresh sheets. Since we had planned on doing lots of sightseeing, it was a pleasant surprise to find a map and tourist information on the desk. We really enjoyed our first visit to Boston."
8442314,51182863,2015-10-18,14941346,Michele,Brett and household were great!! I would not hesitate to stay there again. He was extremely knowledgeable about the area. It was a perfect location and we had a wonderful time.

The bathrooms were a bit messy but okay. Brett and his roommate helped us out whenever needed and were easy to deal with. Good place to spend some days sight seeing in Boston"
8442314,53890031,2015-11-14,26616937,Anne,"Jeg hadde et flott opphold, ble godt mottatt og møtt med vennlighet. Brett var i møtekommende - tusen takk for meg !"
8442314,54541909,2015-11-21,36647552,Ankit,The listing was exactly how the pictures depict it. The room and bathrooms were clean. Brett was incredibly accommodating allowing for an early check in and late check out. He was always looking out for my needs as a guest.

8442314,58481524,2016-01-02,52445501,Hunter,"My room was clean and simply furnished, the bed was very comfortable and the host was accommodating. He had a number of maps of the area in the desk in my room. He made sure I knew where to find the two closest subway stations to the residence, and there was always some small snack to be had on the kitchen island. He did everything to made sure I was comfortable, and was ready to field any and all questions i had to ask concerning the local area, his recommendation for eateries in the vicinity, and so on. I had an exceedingly positive experience and will most likely be coming back in the future."
8442314,63468703,2016-02-23,51058928,Hengyi,"Staying in Brett's house it is a wonderful experience! I have booked both of the rooms. and they are all clean and comfortable. All the people there are friendly, making us feel welcome. They even let me play their piano which is high-quality. And the dog, Eva, is so cute and well-behaved. We miss her so much! All in all, I highly recommend this apartment and will choose to stay there again!"
8442314,70058003,2016-04-15,49174880,Chantal,"C'était notre première expérience Airbnb et nous en avons été satisfaits. Nous sommes restés six nuits. Que ce soit lors de la réservation ou lors de l'accueil dans l'appartement, Brett s'est montré disponible,  réactif et serviable. L'appartement est agréable et propre. La chambre correspond à la photo. Pour nous c'était idéalement placé car nous rendions visite à notre fils qui habitait à un block de là. Le métro permet de se rendre rapidement dans le centre de Boston mais nous avons fait pratiquement tous nos trajets à pied. C'est un quartier populaire, avec un supermarché stop and shop proche, où résident pas mal d'étudiants."
8442314,70578120,2016-04-18,66893089,乐,"Brett is very nice and kind. I arrived at a much later time than we said before, but Brett was still waiting for me and guided me inside. The house is a three-storied building. Although it's old, it's very comfortable and clean actually. I visited two my friends working in BWH, and the house located just nearby. Great thanks for Brett's kind arrangements."
8442314,71187744,2016-04-24,62336156,Eldonna,"Room was good sized.  Bed comfortable.  Plenty of hangars for clothing and a desk and chair. Check in was easy.  Close to shops, grocery, restaurants.  15 min walk to Harvard Medical school.  Close access to public transportation.  House was clean.  WIFI was great. Didn't see the other occupants much at all.  Occupants were friendly and helpful."

Very easy to get to with public transportation. Cost me $2.65 to get from the airport to the apartment.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
8442314,86279818,2016-07-15,31080577,Ryan,Brett and his roommates were awesome hosts that made me feel very comfortable during my month long stay.  He accommodated my early arrival and hooked me up with another great room in the apartment.  The place was kept clean and is situated close to a lot of restaurants/bars.  Cool neighborhood right on mission hill with tons to do.  Also right near the longwood medical center.  Everyone was very respectful of the space and its guests.  The room itself was spacious and well lit.
8442314,86902992,2016-07-18,71705885,April,The room itself was clean and locked from the inside. The closet was emptied for our belongings. There was a kettle with a Keurig on a small island in the kitchen; and there was granola and such.
"My biggest issue was with there being no towels for us and the bathrooms (there were two) were disgusting! The sink handles were falling off. Another issue was there were no \"\"quiet hours\"\" observed by the others who reside there.",,,,,
I believe whoever is running this may not have their people organized to do their part of the work. I say this because the guy that seemed to be the caretaker was nowhere to be found most of the time. Even when the smoke alarm went off at 4 am! I know it's beyond his control,but his response was that his neighbors burn their Ramen.,,,,
If Airbnb suggests that we're staying at a friend then treat your friends better. Your treatment of these friends was not what,I believe,"your company is trying to sell.\"",,,
8442314,87576459,2016-07-20,22135671,Mark,We found Brett to be an extremely accommodating and flexible host who helped us with a difficult situation. We both recommend Brett for anybody travelling to Boston.
8442314,87930211,2016-07-22,11657481,Marisha,Brett was very friendly and welcomed me to his apartment. I was in Boston for a course and had two very busy days. His apartment was a quiet place to come back to and I slept great.

8442314,91722593,2016-08-06,42893627,Yan,I could not get in touch with the host in hours. Phone and text messages were not returned. There was no direction on how to get keys when the host was not available. My first experience with Airbnb was very unsatisfied.
8442314,93238630,2016-08-12,33349925,Thierry,"La chambre respecte parfaitement les photos et est spacieuse. L'appartement se situe dans un joli quartier mais tout de même excentré. Ceci étant, le métro est proche. Brett a été très arrangeant sur l'horaire d'arrivée et les règles de vie dans l'appartement sont très simples."

8982616,53164395,2015-11-05,1544776,Joyce,"Tom is an enjoyable host- hospitable and wants to help each person find good parts of his town. He was great to help me get my bags up the stairs to his floor on 3rd level ( its 2 flights of rather steep stairs).  House:  Tom makes his open kitchen totally available to you; offers a small lving room space.   However, the limitation is the bathroom -- just 1 small bathroom for 4 rooms (it was 6 people the night I was there).    And, be sure to ask before you come about best/cheapest transit to take (or how to walk) to get there."
8982616,53225827,2015-11-06,47935789,William,The location was excellent  and he was extremely flexible. Tom is great!

The apartment is a close walk to the harbour and easy subway ride into the city centre. Would stay there again. Thanks Tom"
8982616,53707402,2015-11-11,20334166,Phil,"The listing description was very accurate. Tom was very clear in the instructions needed to get up to the room. I only stayed one night, but the bed was very comfortable; the room was simple but had all the needed amenities for a short stay. Also, it was a very short trip to the airport, indeed. All around a very positive experience!"
8982616,53833075,2015-11-13,32304694,Madeleine,"Tom was wonderful to us, and the spot is perfect for a quick trip to Boston. The location is extremely convenient, just a short walk from either the Maverick Station or Airport Station on the blue line. You can be downtown in two stops. Eastie is vibrant.. full of culture, nice people, and great food."
Bedroom #3 is great. Didn't get too loud on the street while we were there. Bed is comfortable,everything is clean,and towels and laid out for you upon arrival.,,,

The bed was super comfortable and the blanket extra soft. The appartment is only a few metro stops away from Boston's main tourist attractions which makes it a great place to discover the city. Just be aware that there is only one bathroom for up to 6 guests if all three rooms are occupied. We would definitely recommend Tom's room and would be glad to return there on our next trip."
8982616,54425302,2015-11-19,47653338,Lucy,"Tom was a very warm and kind host, and helped me figure out some transit logistics. Your tip worked, Tom! :)"
The room was as advertised.  It was spacious,clean,and the bed was very comfortable. So comfortable,in fact,that I had trouble waking up on time!  Conveniently located minutes away from the airport,which was great for my am flight.
Small tip (both for myself and Tom): If there are several guests staying over at the same time,it would be helpful to connect with them the night prior to figure out bathroom/shower use logistics,"especially if there are early flights and there might be some schedule overlapping.\"",,,

The room is clean and cozy, Tom also prepared towels for us. Moreover, we messed up our travel date so we lost booking one night, but Tom let us use his couch which can turn into a queen size bed. Also, the neighbor is quiet and convenient, which is about 5-7 minutes walk to subway station, one stop to the airport, and two stop to shopping district. It's a really great staying experience in Boston, thanks Tom!"

There are some restaurants and markets in walking distance from Tom's house, which is convenient for a short stay without a car. I was tired when arrived, don't have much talking with Tom.

You can also use water, microwave and all other kitchen stuff,  and store your food in the refrigerator. There is totally 3 bedroom for rental in Tom's house."
The location is really close to the airport. The shortest path from airport should be taking the airport shuttle to the rental car facility and then go across the rental car parking lot. There is an access point which is not shown on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) map,so the (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) map will not provide you the shortest path (8 min walk between Tom's home and shuttle bus in rental car),but a safer and legal path (12 - 16 min walk) using a surrounding trail (either north or south side of the rental car parking lot). If you have many heavy luggage,the shorter path through rental car facility will be much helpful.,,
Boston is a city which is perfect without car,"so I think provide detail for walk between Tom's home and airport should be helpful for most of the travellers. \"",,,,
8982616,61473145,2016-02-04,40246762,Emilee,"Warm, welcoming and inviting host! Readily communicative and accommodating.  Place was very clean and cozy, comfortable bed, close to Maverick station on the blue line. Highly recommend for a Boston layover."
8982616,61694448,2016-02-07,50297998,Tyler,Tom was a great host. Everything was comfortable and as described.
8982616,61874016,2016-02-08,25240169,Gary,"Really pleased. ..basic room but spotless. ..Tom is super nice, a few good restaurants close by. Very, very close to the airport and easy to get to."
8982616,61891069,2016-02-09,51072198,Darcie,Tom was so kind when we got in at 1am and had trouble with the key due to operator error! Would stay here again :)
8982616,62097872,2016-02-11,55697845,Kazuhito,It was so nice to stay at Tom's place.  I enjoyed talk about Cinema.
When I will have a chance to visit Boston again,"I'll stay at Tom's place again.  Thank you\"",,,,
8982616,62350390,2016-02-14,51678382,Katie,Tom is a hospitable and all-around friendly guy willing to answer questions about the city. He even leant us a jacket for the negative temps when my boyfriend's coat ripped mid-trip (too many layers!). The room was very clean and comfortable. We really benefited from the location being so close to the T and would for sure stay here again on our next visit.
8982616,62546690,2016-02-15,54092185,Mario,"Yes, it was fine."
8982616,62782042,2016-02-16,1307551,Michael,"It was kind of hectic. I booked the place 2 weeks in advance and was never sent details on how to get into the house. I messaged the owner a few times on Airbnb and didn't get a response. I eventually called the owner for details, on the day of around 8pm. He picked up and told me a bunch of details but I couldn't write them down so I asked him to text it to me. 30 mins later, I had no response, so I tried calling again since I finally was able to take down notes. No answer. I called again an hour later, it was 9:30pm. I had a 6am flight so I was dying to get in and sleep. No pick up. I text him, no reply. I call again 10 mins later and leave a voice mail, no response. I then had a friend call him on a different number and he picked up immediately, as if he was ignoring my text's and calls. When we got the details to get into the home. we made it in and got setup for tomorrows flight. Not once, did I ever meet the owner. There were no introductions or welcoming. In a lot of ways, this experience was so annoying that I won't recommend this place. Regardless of the location and the comfort of the room, it's not worth it to be unsure if you have a place to stay at 10pm when you have a 6 am flight."
8982616,63013774,2016-02-19,57470683,Edward,"Thanks Tom, the room was great! Bed was very comfy and nice. Clean bathroom and lovely apartment overall."
8982616,63258296,2016-02-21,54781607,Steven,"Booked the room but never replied to any of my messages and did not answer any of my phone calls either. When I arrived, I still could not get in touch with him and ended up having to book another place last minute which was very hectic with all my luggage (and wasted my day). I would avoid."
8982616,63400229,2016-02-22,44112681,Buddy,Tom's place was perfect for a quick budget friendly crash close to the airport when we needed to get up early for a flight.  The bed was comfortable.  The room didn't have a tv or much else for amenities.  But it served it's purpose for a quick stay.  The bathroom has pretty tight quarters with the shower being very narrow.
"Tom is easy going and very approachable.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay hear again.\"",,,,,
8982616,63515731,2016-02-23,51861605,Thiago,Great! Tom is a very nice host and the place is super nice.
8982616,63592613,2016-02-24,59359486,Greetje,Tom is a super nice guy. He was friendly and welcoming. We didn't have any problems and the room we slept in was totally comfortable.
"I would book him again anytime.\"",,,,,
8982616,63769709,2016-02-26,31742,Daniel,"WYSIWYG  (what you see is what you get), no surprises, good communication, great value. I will stay again."
8982616,63954445,2016-02-28,33258766,Rachel,Tom was so friendly and we had a wonderful days there. The house was near the subway station so it was comfortable for us to travel Boston. I had a really good memory there :)
8982616,64577232,2016-03-05,61230523,Han,"Tom teaches cinematography and has a lot of stories to tell. The downstairs neighbour owns a lovely cat. The room is quiet and comfortable, ideal for temporary stay."
8982616,65652490,2016-03-16,18673105,Nancy,I felt welcome and enjoyed my conversations with Tom. The description did not indicate that there were three different bedrooms that share the same one bathroom. That said there was never a conflict.  Overall it was a good place to stay for my conference at the Embassy suites which was two blocks away.
8982616,65880799,2016-03-17,173089,Priscilla,Tom was an excellent.  Everything was as described.  He was helpful.
8982616,66070571,2016-03-19,33719475,Philip,Tom was very welcoming and straightforward. Immediately showed me the essentials: bedroom and bath. He was available after that but allowed me my privacy for which I was grateful.
8982616,66605418,2016-03-23,59243408,Leah,"We had only stayed for a short time, but it was very comfy and inviting! The apartment was also a super easy commute to the airport for an early flight!"
8982616,66935930,2016-03-25,54070989,Melisa,"SO CLOSE TO the AIRPORT you can actually walk there if you wanted. It is a simple and efficient space. We had such an early flight there wasn't much time spent here, but it served the purpose well!"
8982616,67596592,2016-03-30,61324943,Amy,"Tom was very friendly and welcoming.  He helped me carry my luggage up the stairs to the room and gave some advice about transportation, especially how to get to the airport.  Good location for a overnight stay before an early flight and close to the T station to get to the sights in Boston.  Clean room, comfortable bed.  The only downside was the smell of cigarette smoke in the apartment."
8982616,67650179,2016-03-30,12725008,Léa,"I spent two nights at Tom's place with a friend. Tom has been really friendly and welcoming. He gave us few advice about what to do in the city and recommended us a really good restaurant not far from his place ! The place is as described, no surprises ! Really close to the metro station, very well located. I would contact Tom again if I had to go back to Boston !"
8982616,67958855,2016-04-01,56542371,Julia,Tom is a really nice guy. My friend and I enjoyed the time in Boston and one point was definitely staying at his place.
The communication between him and us went really well,he responds quick and is very accommodating.,,,,
The room was nice and comfortable and we enjoyed a nice hospitality!!,,,,,
If you are open for good conversations,you are at the right place as well.,,,,
"I would definitely book his AirBnB again :)\"",,,,,
8982616,68450739,2016-04-05,29652949,Natasha,Tom was really accommodating and even let us leave our bags there in advance. Perfect location for our needs as it is just a stones throw from the airport. Many thanks.
8982616,68809650,2016-04-06,63897200,Tanja,"Tom was great host, everything was nice, bed was very comfortable. Also it's a good location, train station is near and airport. I recommend! :)"
8982616,68857626,2016-04-07,3215967,Isabel,"The stay was only a few hours due to a cancelled flight, but it fit our needs. Tom was very responsive to the last minute reservation, and helpful."
8982616,68921631,2016-04-07,29481406,Dirk,Friendly host who will give you plenty of advice how to explore Boston.

8982616,69313931,2016-04-10,5008344,Ben,"I stayed one night.  Super clean, within walking distance from the airport.  Place was lovely, Tom was welcoming."
8982616,69677828,2016-04-12,66583944,Annee,"This was the first air b&b I have done and was a wonderful first experience! The room and place was clean, quiet and had a warm vibe! Tom was really nice and friendly, introduced us to a yummy restaurant! We loved staying here and will always suggest this for anyone visiting East Boston"
8982616,70979804,2016-04-22,39821580,Michael,Great location and Tom was very helpful with tips about getting around and places to see...

8982616,71470327,2016-04-25,38957697,John,"Tom was very accommodating to my late arrival and made every effort to make sure I was comfortable. Also a very convenient place to stay, and one of the most comfortable beds I've ever been in."
8982616,71607347,2016-04-26,14316158,Skyler,Fantastic! Thanks for everything.
8982616,71656999,2016-04-27,29995324,Linda,Always great! Super close to the airport.
8982616,71791199,2016-04-28,20734905,Pauline,I enjoyed my stay at Tom's place; very close to the airport and very quiet. Tom made me feel welcomed and was extremely easy to get along with; he was a wonderful host!
8982616,71912050,2016-04-29,29995324,Linda,Third time that I've booked a room there- that says everything & Tom is fabulous:)
8982616,72526400,2016-05-03,30127290,Lisa,"We stayed at Toms place to be near the airport for an early flight. Tom was a great host. He responded quickly to my questions, was warm, friendly, accessible and happy to provide us with recommendations for nearby restaurants and for getting around. The place was clean, convenient and very comfortable. I'll definitely stay there again if Im traveling!"
8982616,72637542,2016-05-04,6281470,Dan,The apartment is really nice. Tom is super interesting and helpful! I had a good time chatting with him. I would recommend this room to anyone who wants to stay in Boston.
8982616,72752769,2016-05-04,39610621,里里,"Tom的家很干净宽敞,特别是离机场近,即使带着行李也可以10分钟走到乘坐机场巴士的地铁站,非常方便。对于搭乘飞机的游客是最佳选择。"
8982616,72997647,2016-05-06,46222685,Sanjay,Tom was a cool guest - Room 3 is large and very comfortable. Also a $5 lyft from the airport.
8982616,73261680,2016-05-07,5593272,Jehan & Shane,"Tom greeted us and showed us about immediately. He has 3 Airbnb rooms as well as his own, but only one bathroom. Very clean and comfy. Short walk to the subway and a short subway ride to downtown where the American Revolution was planned by our patriots. Near everything. Tom is educated, intelligent and a joy to converse with. We were only there for one evening and had to cut our unique and extremely interesting conversation short in order to see a few sight. His partner operates a restaurant 4 blocks away where the food is freshly prepared and delicious with vegetarian and vegan option; perfect for us. 7 minute ride to the airport makes this a good place for travelers to rest and explore."
8982616,73386909,2016-05-08,69280997,Yana,"Very good experience! It was just a night, but we had a great time. Thank you so much!"

8982616,74567867,2016-05-15,69226493,Yuanyuan,Very happy experience! Tom is very nice and patient. Highly recommended!
8982616,74846254,2016-05-17,71734416,Claudia,Yes - the neighborhood was ok
8982616,75162622,2016-05-19,45999015,Ginger,"Clean, easy, laid back, friendly ! Tom's place is perfect for close to airport. Charming neighborhood across from a historic elementary school and about 6 blocks from the harbor. I took the water taxi into Boston, had a great day, slept well then was on my early morning flight with time to spare."
8982616,75519302,2016-05-22,46132708,Jacob,I only stayed at the apartment for a very short while but Tom was very accommodating and even put up with our late arrival and early-ish departure. Everything was as expected! I would happily recommend it.
8982616,75830323,2016-05-23,4129607,Emily,"I was very happy with our room at Tom's place. I believe we were in room #1. The bed was comfy and sheets and towels tidy and clean. There was a small closet, a bureau with a large mirror, and two windows with shades."
One other of his three rooms was rented out but we never saw the other guest. He has a nice spot at the top of a three story building,so you don't hear the other tenants on the stairs. We got to meet his friendly cat Tabby who was very cute. He also provided bottled water for drinking rather than tap which was nice.,,,,
"His building is a close walk to the Maverick T station. It was a very easy/quick ride to get to Government Square. If we have occasion to be in that area of Boston in the future I would stay with Tom again.\"",,,,,
8982616,76059167,2016-05-24,39610621,里里,"第三次入住Tom的家,每次都给我们很多有用的信息。这次还给了我们优惠,谢谢!Tom家里各种设施都齐备好用,特别还有我们习惯用的被子,而不仅仅只是毛毯和布单。对于需要坐飞机游客更是非常方便,步行不用10分钟,就可以到免费的机场巴士站。"
8982616,76250588,2016-05-25,73831626,Patricia,"My recent stay at Tom's place was ideal for an overnight stay. My husband and I were looking for a place close to the airport as we decided to stay an extra night and we're leaving very early the next day. The location was clean and accommodating. It is located about half a mile (short walking distance) from the free airport shuttle. Definitely a place to stay if you want to be near the airport and leaving early, as the transit system doesn't start operations until after 5 AM."
8982616,76455568,2016-05-27,71283456,Inge,"The place is close to the airport that's the good thing. But unfortunately the room and especially bathroom was very small and from our point of view as well really dirty... Please tom, you really have to use the vacuum cleaner and clean the bathroom!!! I haven't seen something for long..."
As well the price of 115 US per night is for the room/bathroom you get,"very high. \"",,,,
8982616,77014826,2016-05-30,44796368,Sarah,"Very close to the airport. Tom was very friendly and accommodating. Room and bathroom are small, but nice and clean. We would definitely stay there again."
8982616,77591351,2016-06-02,35416178,Tyler,"I've stayed at Airbnb's across the US & Mexico. Probably 30+ or so. This one was WAY overpriced for what you got. I was unimpressed. It reminded me of an Airbnb in Mexico. The room was hot/humid & took more than an hour to cool off. He never responded to my question I sent him. The room was very plain & is shared with several others in the house. I was never greeted by anyone..you just kind of walk-in & use your key until one works. The shower needed to be cleaned. The one pro: it is very close to the airport. The Airbnb wasn't terrible, but it was entirely overpriced for it. $20 tops is what something of its caliber usually rents for on here. I would not stay again."
8982616,77701057,2016-06-03,75037393,Keith,"Clean enough and bed was very comfortable. Host is friendly and accomodating. Very quick ride from the airport via shuttle, taxi or Uber. It's a quick walk to the Maverick T station. Very convenient."
8982616,77849654,2016-06-04,75292159,Robert,"Nice, clean and Comfortable"
8982616,79060260,2016-06-11,2414206,Alex,"The room description was accurate and Tom was professional, a great communicator, and able to book me on very short notice. My room was as clean and well-appointed as a hotel room."
8982616,79220535,2016-06-12,76232471,Christina,"Tom was a great host and very accommodating! The room was just as described, and was perfect for just an overnight stay. Tom also was helpful in pointing out some things within the city. The place itself is close to the airport which made travel very easy."
8982616,80410859,2016-06-18,43369425,Brian,I have stayed in East Boston many times. I would proudly say that this stay at toms was without a doubt the best stay I have ever had. The generosity alone was more then you would ever get at a hotel. The wonderful interactions mixed with the delightful discussions we had made this stay even better. I would highly recommend this as the place to stay if visiting Boston.
8982616,80577577,2016-06-19,46170570,Arman,It was clean house and very close to the airport. Tom was a nice guy and very helpful.
8982616,80934282,2016-06-20,6429691,Javier,"Muy amable, Tom. La ubicacion es privilegiada, realmente cerca del aeropuerto. La habitacion, con cama de dos plazas, es limpia, correcta. Tiene aire acondicionado. El bano esta bien."
8982616,81044361,2016-06-20,21119404,Kinga,Staying here was very pleasant. The room was like described. The room end the bathroom were clean. I recommend it.
8982616,81328669,2016-06-22,73976768,Dennis,"Being newbies to Airbnb, we weren’t quite sure what to expect renting a room in someone’s home but when we arrived our host Tom was great. He welcomed us with a smile and even helped me bring up a suitcase. The staircase leading to the apartment is a little tight and steep but not uncommon for apartments in East Boston built in 1906. The apartment and room are basic but very clean and functional which included air conditioning in the bedrooms only. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was clean and has great water pressure! The kitchen was fully stocked with everything you needed to cook and eat with. We did not try out the TV in the living room."
After showing us the apartment and amenities Tom told us about East Boston Piers Park on the waterfront only four blocks away. A beautiful park full of trees,benches and picnic tables. The views are incredible looking across the harbor at downtown Boston. A terrific park to bring children to as there are two playgrounds with sponge padding on the ground so they don’t get hurt. After walking the pier and enjoying the park we remembered we had passed a local pizza restaurant along the way. We decided to go back and order up a couple of hoagies. We walked back to the park and sat down at one of the park benches and ate them while enjoying the local sounds and views.,,,,
After leaving the park hours later we walked towards an old boat yard that is also shared by local artists. The building murals,eclectic paintings,sculptures were wonderful to see and there seemed to be some sort of a surprise around every corner while walking through the area. Once on the pier we noticed the entire pier had all sorts of different paint drawings which again had all sorts of surprises while walking it. We ended up having a great time.,,,
"As long as you’re not expecting “fancy” this was well worth the journey.\"",,,,,
8982616,81460945,2016-06-23,70500358,Diana,"Tom was so welcoming and hospitable! We had to act fast due to our flight being delayed, thus forcing us to search for an AirBnb last minute. We reached out to Tom who let us rent the space emmidiately despite only being able to stay for one night. He was fast and extremely helpful once we arrived. The room was private, spacious, clean and neat. We enjoyed our short time there. Tom made our trip much better!"
8982616,81600382,2016-06-24,58671269,Rene,I really enjoyed this accomodation:
- cleaned room,,,,,
- good shower,,,,,
- cleaned bathroom,,,,,
- the owner received me very late,,,,,
- very quiet and calm appartment,,,,,
- flexible check out,,,,,
Thanks for your support,"Tom\"",,,,
8982616,81666374,2016-06-24,5414021,Robert,Absolutely fine. Thank you!
8982616,82024028,2016-06-26,48259304,Caterina,"Tom's place was very close to the airport and convenient.  We arrived around 10:30 pm and had to be up by 4:30 to catch a 5 am shuttle, so sleep was important.  Unfortunately, Tom had a cat/s that cried at our door the entire night wanting to get in our room. We didn't get much sleep and made for a frustrating night.  Minus the cat/s it would have been a good place to stay if catching an early flight."
8982616,82260322,2016-06-27,21873023,Edward,"The apartment was very near to the airport and incredibly convenient.  The bed was clean, soft, very comfortable.  I enjoyed talking with the host and the other guests."
8982616,82424672,2016-06-27,75915211,Jordyn,"The host made me and my boyfriend feel very welcome. We were only there for a short while but he made us feel at home with a comfy bed, clean apartment, and recommendations for seeing Boston.  His apartment was conveniently located to the metro T line."
8982616,82755391,2016-06-29,48313462,Yoyo,"Tom's place is conveniently located near the airport.  You can drag your luggage easily to the Airport T station or the Rental Car Center to catch the shuttle to the Terminals.   Tom was a nice host, he was easy going and was attentive to answering my questions. His place was quiet and clean, I would be glad to stay at Tom's when I visit Boston again."
8982616,83000579,2016-06-30,77393410,Jeremy,Tom was very helpful and quick to respond. Very convenient being so close to the airport during an overnight stay. Thank you very much Tom.
8982616,84968974,2016-07-10,44207235,Greg,Tom was very helpful and quick to respond. Conveniently close to the airport for an overnight stay and early flight.
8982616,85312276,2016-07-11,23976600,Peter,Place was great and exactly what I needed after a flight.  Mine was a short stay and this was easy.
8982616,86055274,2016-07-14,46259753,Jenny,"\"Tom is a great host. He is very welcoming and made me feel \"\"at home\"\" right away. He helped solve my small travel problems and even loaned me his bicycle to do some errands and see the great view of downtown Boston. The location and proximity to the airport made this stay that much more positive. As a guest"
8982616,86307950,2016-07-15,79742750,Michelle W.,"Just what we were looking for, came in late, left early- everything was easy!"
8982616,86773921,2016-07-17,82125460,Yi,It very close to the subway. The room is clean and the host is trustable. I lost my poster in my room when I left. Tom helped me keep it. Thanks to Tom so much.
8982616,87078688,2016-07-18,3556142,Daniel,"Very good, near to the Airport and a nice appartement"
8982616,87333943,2016-07-19,65938182,Phyllis,Tom was a very hospitable host.  There is plenty room to relax and the kitchen is available to all.
8982616,87883187,2016-07-22,38794801,Cameron,"My stay here was great. The location is awesome!!!! You can walk to the airport. This is great because Boston traffic is ridiculous. Also, a really nice park with a view of the skyline is really close by. The room was fine and the bed was comfortable. Tom was friendly and gave great instructions. Considering how expensive Boston is, this place was a great value. I recommend staying here."
8982616,88176722,2016-07-23,76386741,Saskia,"Perfect for our flight in the morning! Hopefully Tom had air conditioning in the room, it was so hot this day in Boston."
8982616,88743478,2016-07-25,17013450,Bonnie,The  place was clean and no frills. The exact thing you want when you just need a place close to the airport or to pick up a rental car. The neighborhood is safe and you must try the restaurant called Ecco. We walked back at 1 am with no problem. Tom was very prompt about getting back to us. We were 6 hours late on a Sat night after our flight was delayed and rerouted due to weather. There could have been a little more explanation on what door to try to open since there are 2 that open into the same place!

8982616,89223735,2016-07-27,13246552,Ricky,"Room was just what we needed. close to the airport and easy to use for a quick night layover in Boston before heading out the next day. Tom was very accommodating, we were delayed until very late so he left us a key in a lockbox and gave us instructions to get in. Basic, no frills room, but we didn't need any more. Thanks Tom!"

8982616,90162946,2016-07-31,86147388,Cordae,"This was  great place to stay during our visit to Boston. It is very close to the airport, and is just a short walk to the rail which is one stop from downtown. Tom was a great host, very friendly and personable. This was our first time using airbnb, and it was everything we were hoping it would be."
8982616,90529152,2016-08-01,76361244,Mingjun,"Good! Thank you ,Tom."
8982616,90718403,2016-08-02,3160646,Kimi,Easy to find and convenient!
8982616,90837563,2016-08-02,43113335,Maryia,It was one of the best experience in my travel life :) Tom is very nice and open person. I just can to say if u stay in Boston you must live in this room
8982616,91784735,2016-08-06,85977896,Jen,Tom was extremely welcoming and accomodating.  He allowed us to drop off our bags at noon right after we arrived and he was allowing the previous night guests to store their luggage in his kitchen too.
The bed was very comfortable and there is an individual air conditioning window unit in the bedroom that you can adjust to your comfort level.,,,,,
"The apartment was conveniently located near the airport and a short walk to the Maverick stop on the T.  \"",,,,,
8982616,92372827,2016-08-08,7736917,Tania,Good location for airport.
8982616,92409654,2016-08-08,28972566,Joseph,"Tom was friendly and very helpful, his apartment is really convenient for the airport and we'd love to stay again next time we're in Boston!"
8982616,93403223,2016-08-12,2782694,Cameron,The apartment is blocks from the train making it easy to see all of Boston. Tom is full of useful information that makes exploring Boston so much easier.
8982616,93831171,2016-08-14,27312529,Coral Dawn,"Tom made it feel like we had dropped in as a friend of a friend. I like a hostel setting and this was way more than that. The convenience and ease as far as accessibility to transit and basically walking distance to airport shuttles. The room had it's own air conditioning in it and was on when we arrived. These are modest digs, clean, welcoming and secure."
8982616,94476090,2016-08-15,997158,Mary,This is a great location for going to and from the airport. Literally it was only a ten minute walk. Tom was a very kind host.

8982616,96606419,2016-08-23,91097843,Diana,"As stated, the shuttle to the airport is within walking distance from his place.  I walked in the neighborhood during the day and night- very safe. I felt very welcomed, had great conversations with Tom. He has a vast amount of knowledge in many areas.  He is very easy going. Even the cat that does not belong to him comes to visit daily."
8982616,96811646,2016-08-24,79032027,Hongping,Tom is friendly and kind!

She was so friendly and welcoming and really made us feel at home. She was full of things for us to do and even advised us where to spend 4th of July... Which was spot on!! Marlo's place looks exactly like the photos (if not better!) and we would definitely stay at Marlo's again if we come back to Boston! Thank you so much Marlo!"
8634599,49741969,2015-10-05,10149895,Myles,"Pros: Jil's house is a BEAUTIFUL Victorian and in a great location of the city and she was very communicative with setting up arrival times, coordinating etc."
Cons: Then,my plans changed on the seond day and I asked for a refund of the last day but Jil refused to accept this offer... and this left a little sour taste in my mouth.,,,,
But ignoring that,"I still recommend Jil's place if you're interested in checking out JP in a beautiful Victorian mansion!\"",,,,
8634599,50247577,2015-10-10,34927101,Jacob,It was great to stay at Jil's. Nice spacious suite with private entrance and private bathroom (but you had to pass through a shared hallway to get to it). It was  nice and clean and beautifully furnished in style with the rest of the house.
At the time we stayed there not much of a kitchen,"but Jil told us she would install a zink and a cooking space. \"",,,,
8634599,50552648,2015-10-12,1108215,Barbara,"The accommodations were exactly as described, a beautiful setting, and comfortable. Great neighborhood, easy access to everything we needed."
8634599,51072144,2015-10-17,6875087,Ronak,"We had a great stay at Jil's house. She was very communicative leading up to and during our stay and was very warm and welcoming. The room is beautiful and thoughtfully equipped for guests, with a mini-fridge, sink, dishes and a coffee maker with coffee/tea and fixings for guests. There is even a small table for eating, writing, whatever you need. The house is a gorgeous historic building and really brings home the feeling of being in New England. With a separate entrance and private bathroom and access to laundry, we had our own suite within the house. We absolutely love the Jamaica Plain neighborhood where the home is, and there are plenty of coffee shops and restaurants to enjoy within a 5 minute walk. The pond and arboretum are a treat to visit as well. And a short 10 minute walk to the train can have you anywhere in Boston. We recommend the stay to anyone visiting Boston, wanting an authentic Boston experience."
8634599,52722296,2015-11-01,1445558,Tito,"Jil's beautiful house isn't an Airbnb as much as it is a welcoming home worth going out of one's way to visit. From the moment you walk in the front door, the decades of character and the stories behind each piece of vintage furniture and classic design choice are readily apparent. Classic, Grand and Cozy are the words that come to mind."
The apartment in question is a self-enclosed wing of the house,with it's own private side entrance,kitchenette  bathroom and use of washing machine. Jil and her family live on the other side of the house,so you have as much privacy as you would want,although hanging out with them is much more of a good time.,
It's in the hipster Jamaica Plains neighborhood not far from downtown so you have peace,quiet and lots of great eating along with accessibility to the hustle and bustle.,,,,
And free street parking! (The only street in the neighborhood,and what seems like all of Boston that offers it),,,,
Jil and her family are the most welcoming hosts I've ever had and I recommend this place to anyone looking not just for a place to sleep at night,but a home visit,"and even friends\"",,,
8634599,56127564,2015-12-09,47702794,Zhen,"Jil is a very nice women, We had a very plesant stay. This is our first stay and we are looking forward to our next trip."
8634599,59162631,2016-01-07,2847711,Zaire,The host canceled this reservation 100 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8634599,59508678,2016-01-11,2801703,Aamir,"Jill was a great host and responded to all of my queries very quickly. The space was accurately depicted and the bedroom was perfect for private stay. The bed was very comfortable, and the double shower heads was great. The house is located in a very convenient part of Jamaica Plain, with restaurants and convenience stores within walking distance of the address. With free street parking, I never had to worry about where I was going to park my car after returning from my Office. This was an ideal location for the length of my stay, and I would love to stay here again in the future."
8634599,68578521,2016-04-05,19474075,Martha,"\"First of all, Jill was wonderful, and so welcoming. The room is beautiful and clean, and full of lovely old antiques. The bed is comfortable, and the home and neighborhood are just beautiful. That being said, my stay was a bit stressful due to lack of organization. When I arrived at 8pm, I was given a key and told to enter through the front door. The next evening when I arrived after 10pm, the key would not open the door. After a lot of stress and confusion, it turns out the key was to the back door, which I was never shown. Finally, I am not sure I agree with the posting that you have an \"\"entire home/apt\"\". The room is on the second floor of the house"
8634599,72102402,2016-05-01,7697905,Arin,"Jil was very welcoming and communicative. When setting up the reservation, she got back to us right away via email. During our stay, she was quick to respond to questions and make sure we had everything we needed. The bed is very comfortable. The home is gorgeous. It is walkable to all attractions of JP, and very close to the T station."
"This room would be more accurate as a \"\"private room\"\" listing and not an \"\"entire apartment\"\" listing. It is a very private room. However",you must walk through an open hallway in the house to get to the bathroom. (It is a private bath for your use only) There is no way to lock yourself in the bathroom,and there are two doors into it. Due to this I was nervous to use it by myself at first until I made an active decision to not think about it and trust the host and the renter that lives on the same floor. Further,there is no lock on the outside of the bedroom door to lock your things away when you are not there. This was also nerve racking and I just chose to not think about it. There was a lock inside the bedroom to lock ourselves in for the night.,,
To reiterate,"we (and our things) were very safe and overall comfortable here. The items above are important considerations to those who will book this room in the future.\"",,,,
8634599,74960756,2016-05-17,65396304,Rod,"With a fabulous warm welcome, the accommodation is a real slice of old Boston charm.  Jamaica Plain is a lovely area with great food just around the corner from the room.  The Green Street T stop is no more than 5 minutes away too.  Very relaxed."
8634599,75691109,2016-05-22,70949049,Francine,Jill was extremely welcoming and thoughtful upon my arrival. She honored all my requests and accepted my suggestions.  She is extremely respectful of privacy and in no way made me feel uncomfortable in her home.  I also enjoyed meeting her charming daughter who wanted to help me in anyway possible.
8634599,80561330,2016-06-18,60098020,Christine,"Such a lovely suite in the great area of Jamaica Plain.  I made this reservation at the very last minute, and unfortunately, Jil was out of town for most of my stay, but she did everything from afar to ensure that my visit was complete and comfortable.  The house is fantastic and the suite was spacious, clean and very accommodating. The location is fantastic and within walking distance to shops and restaurants.  A very cozy rental and I will be back each time I visit Boston.  Great value!!!"
8634599,91711158,2016-08-06,72405154,Jj,"We were out the majority of the time enjoying boston, however the one time we saw Jil she was a wonderful host and made us feel welcome. The listing was for the whole house however we stayed in one room (I believe there may have been another renter or two in the house). The room was plenty big for the price and the window unit kept us cool. We had a private bathroom."
8634599,94366140,2016-08-15,14444890,Cara,Jil was very accommodating of our needs and kind to us during a personally stressful time.

All communication was prompt and clear, all went off without a hitch. We  definitely look forward to staying here again. Thank you so much for sharing your home with us!"
5067019,32965070,2015-05-24,10704102,Sharon,"Paul's place was absolutely beautiful--especially the magical back patio. The location was perfect, easy to find, and just a quick walk my conference hotel at Copley Plaza. The bedrooms are spacious, and the beds are super comfortable. All of our questions were answered quickly. It was perfect!"
5067019,51915619,2015-10-25,26248435,Stacey,"Paul's condo is beautiful and in a great location.  He was extremely responsive, gave us detailed instructions for our arrival and even messaged us to make sure we got in without any issues.  I would highly recommend it here!"
13434817,80124200,2016-06-16,52594812,Ben,"Steve was a great host, making sure key hand off was seamless and also making himself available if I needed anything. The apartment itself was exactly as described-nice 2 bedroom in a great neighborhood. A short walk in either direction from Fenway or Back Bay. Would definitely stay here again."
13434817,82505590,2016-06-27,76769869,Claud,Everything was as promised. Steve made sure to check in with me and offer to provide me with anything I needed. The place was clean and in a great location. Plenty of food and nightlife in the neighborhood. Would definitely stay there again!
13434817,84090627,2016-07-05,36550390,Nichole,Stayed at Steves place on the night of the 4th of July. He really went above and beyond by letting us check in a little early and providing us clear instructions on how to find the place. The apartment was also spotless and we had fresh towels waiting on our bed along with the cutest little mini shampoos/conditioners/bodywashes. Would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone staying in the city.
13434817,86012282,2016-07-14,83185530,Mohamed,"Our experience with staying at Steve's place was as best as one could have hoped for.

All the best,"-M\"",,,,
13434817,87030752,2016-07-18,82086523,Blake,"Great place, awesome location in an awesome neighborhood. Perfect for 4 people and it was less than 10 min walk from Fenway, which was important to us. Experience was exactly as described."
13434817,88148359,2016-07-23,18118492,Charlotte,"Great location in Boston with comfortable beds. Steve made sure to answer all our questions quickly and made the check-in process simple. One thing to take into consideration, is that the air condition is only placed in the living room. So the bedrooms are quite hot and humid when temperatures are high outside."
13434817,91041530,2016-08-03,26953286,Aaron,"I had a great stay at Steve's place. It was a little warm at night with only a small AC unit in the living room area, but overall everything was as stated in the description. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good location in Downtown Boston."
13434817,91248622,2016-08-04,13639265,Cian,"The apartment was clean, large, and quiet, in a great location. Though we never met Steve in person he was very responsive and checkin was a breeze. Thanks for a great stay!"
13434817,92554095,2016-08-09,64018321,Jeff,"Very accessible owner which made checking in simple. It was exceptionally hot during our stay and the air conditioner is a portable unit only cooling the living room area. The back room was too hot to sleep in so we had to sleep in the living room area. It was the hottest weekend of the summer, so any other time of the year, this is a non-issue. Location was exactly where we wanted to be."
13434817,94536132,2016-08-16,46283551,Jean-Luc,"séjour assez moyen. L'appartement est grand et a deux chambres séparées. Il est globalement bien situé près du métro. C'est un rez de chaussée avec une sortie indépendante. MAIS,"
Cet appartement ne dispose d'aucun équipement pour y vivre familialement. Il s'agit juste d'un lieu pour dormir (très bonne literie) : il n'y avait que deux chaises,pas de casserole ni poele ni matériel pour faire la cuisine. La cuisinière et le lave vaisselle ne fonctionnait pas,nous avons donc du prendre tous nos repas à l'extérieur. Il n'y a pas de machine à laver. Celle ci est à l'extérieur de l'appartement et coûte 2$ (préparez vos pièces de 25 c !),,,
Nous n'avons pas vu Steve de tout le séjour communication seulement par courriel,,,,,
The apartment is large and has two separate bedrooms. It is well located near the metro. This is a ground floor with an independent output. BUT,,,,,
This apartment has no equipment to live familialement. This is just a place to sleep (very comfortable bed) there were only two chairs,no pan or stove or equipment for cooking. The stove and the dishwasher was not working,so we had to take all our meals outside. There is no washing machine. This one is outside the apartment and costs $ 2 (prepare your 25 c coins !),,,

6629066,47643280,2015-09-21,36427045,Larry,We stayed in units 2 and 3.  Both were newly furnished and very nice.  Both were spotless when we checked in.  The check-in instructions were easy to follow.  Unit 2 is more spacious than Unit 3 although both have 2 bedrooms.  My only caution is that these units can be reached only by a very steep spiral staircase.  They are not handicapped-accessible and would also be difficult for elderly guests.
6629066,48522912,2015-09-27,23708209,Morten,"Everything as advertized , good communication and Swift reply to any question. Highly recomended by me."
6629066,50625628,2015-10-13,39650157,Marsha,We loved South Boston!  It had so many great restaurants and bars- perfect for buying meals to bring in.  The apartment was elegant and well-appointed. It was easy to get into and around the city via the metro. The skyline view at night was amazing!  The little balcony was perfect for playing with our three-year-old.  The only caution we have is that this was up three flights of very steep stairs... so make sure everyone in your group is in good shape!

6629066,53057219,2015-11-04,45090893,Olga,Jason was a great host and was very available whenever we needed him. I stayed here with my colleagues during a conference; the location can not be beat.

6629066,58122536,2016-01-01,16682915,Marcia,"The apartment was beautiful and Jason was very responsive to requests for assistance.  We very much enjoyed staying in the apartment.  The only possible cons are that it is a bit of a hike from the nearest T station (there are buses but those seemed to be infrequent when we were there, which was admittedly over Dec. 29 to Jan. 1 so probably not representative) and the choice of coffee places in the immediate vicinity of the apartment was really not good.  Having said that, the apartment was perfect for us and in pristine condition."

10705351,83074804,2016-07-01,76606505,Libby,Emma and Janine's place was perfect for my trip! Great location in the center of everything- I could walk everywhere.  It had all the amenities one would need and was clean. I felt very comfortable and relaxed and they offered great suggestions on things to do and places to eat. Thank you Emma and Janine for making my trip to Boston that much more successful and perfect!

10705351,90520390,2016-08-01,69816062,Rex,The location of Emma and Janine's apartment was perfect for our visit to Boston. There are several pubs in either direction and access to the subway system (the T) was literally across the street. My wife enjoyed the shopping close by and walking to the Warf or other touristy places near the water was easy as well.
The elevator was broken at the time we stayed but it was not terribly difficult getting to the 4th floor. It should be noted,however,that the elevator would limit some access to the apartment.,,,
"The hostesses were very responsive to any inquiries we had prior to the rental and were just as responsive during our stay for any questions we had.\"",,,,,
10705351,92035786,2016-08-07,21570010,Holly,I had a great time staying at Janine and Emma's place :) it is exactly as described and how it looks in the pictures. Very quirky and homely! The bed was SO comfortable and the sheets were lovely and soft.
It was a bit weird getting into the apartment at first - you enter via what looks like a disused retail unit but once you've been in once and figured it out it's fine. The location is really central - Park Street station and Downtown Crossing are a stone's throw away. Most stuff is walking distance anyway - about 20mins to Hanover street,the harbour and Newbury street. I met quite a few people who told me the area was unsafe at night which made me a bit wary as a lone female. However,I kept myself to myself and didn't hang around so I was fine.,,,
"Overall I thought it was great and I'd definitely stay again. Thanks for having me!\"",,,,,
10705351,92886042,2016-08-10,87809938,Mingyue,"This apartment is awesome!! It's close to everything, Starbucks, convenience stores downstairs. Subway station is 2 minutes walk where Redline can take you to Harvard and MIT. Long wharf is 15 minutes walk where Legal Seafood locates. It is also close to Boston Common information center where you can join the costume guided tour of Freedom Trail."
The apartment is very clean and artistically decorated. Emma and Janine did all the beautiful decoration and paintings.  It is spacious,and the automatic light in the kitchen is very helpful if you have senior travelers with you when using bathroom at night. I will definitely stay here if I travel to Boston again.,,,,
"Emma and Janine are patient hosts. They kindly explained everything. You will love them and their lovely apartment!:)\"",,,,,

10705351,95989226,2016-08-21,89532352,Kate,Emma and Janine were great hosts! They gave us a list of awesome places to go and eat. Their place is spacious and super cute!
10705351,98732471,2016-09-01,4549144,Mark,"Emma left super clear directions so getting into the apartment was a really easy experience. And after that I enjoyed a short stay in a clean and quiet apartment, along with some great conversations. Plus, the location is pretty much as central as you can get."

801722,12564080,2014-05-05,14139814,Alex,"This room was even better than expected - was only a couple minute walk to the subway station, very comfortable, clean, and on a quiet street. Terry also makes sure to provide lots of information about nearby amenities as well as neat things to see for out of town visitors. Would highly recommend."
801722,19790155,2014-09-18,15446588,Annie,"My boyfriend and I had a great stay. This was just like a hotel room. The price was amazing and affordable. A lot cheaper than an actual hotel. It was very cute and cozy. Well decorated and comfortable. The bed was great considering that I do have neck problems. Terry was very flexible and arranged to have the room ready earlier than expected. Check-in is normally at 3pm, we arrived at 11am and the room was ready for us. Check-out is at 12pm, however, our flight back wasn't until 6:30pm. We were able to store our bags before leaving. This is a great place and great location. The train was 3 mins walk away and it brought us wherever we needed to go. There was a pretty steeped hill we had to walk up and down to get to the train, but it really didn't bother me. Highly recommended and would definitely return if we visit Boston again!"
801722,26767653,2015-02-18,25135001,Hye Mi,Terry's place was wonderful!!;)Although I did not meet Terry in person. He was easy to contact via text. He was helpful and the place was easy to go anywhere. (close to subway station)
The room was really clean,tide up and beautiful.There was shampoo,body lotion,teas,towel,microwave

801722,28500110,2015-03-24,24920636,Honey,"My boyfriend and I stayed for 3 nights and FortHill Inn. It is very cozy, clean and pleasant. The bathroom has a fully stocked guest amenities with bathroom essentials, plates and silverwares and coffee condiments! There are huge drawers for storage, microwave and fridge!"
Terry is very accommodating and hospitable. I needed a toothpaste and volunteered to bring one instead of me walking to the store. My boyfriend and I came home at 3am and was having a hard time with the door but Terry was up to help us!,,,,,
We took the Orange line going around the city and came home late at night and felt safe walking back home from the train station. The place is 5 minute walk to the Orange line. There's also a binder in the room with maps,brochures,restaurants and places which is very helpful.,,,
"We would love to stay at Forthill again!!! \"",,,,,
801722,29014396,2015-04-02,18804628,Liu,"Terry is a great host, very friendly to me, gave me all the information I need to hang out. The room is very lovely."
801722,29757023,2015-04-12,15740727,Courtenay,"My room was very nice and clean and my back very much appreciated the comfortable bed. I loved all the tasteful decorations, old-fashioned bathtub, and the many books and information about Boston.  The place was a bit of a climb up a hill from the orange line subway stop and it was in a residential area, so there were not many restaurants within a short walking distance. I did appreciate that neighborhood was nicely quiet at night. I would stay there again next time I'm in Boston."
801722,31130022,2015-05-02,31189941,Behrouz,Excellent experience at this beautiful victorian Boston house! Very close to T orange line. Very quiet neighbourhood!
The room was very clean,and lots of amenities were provided. The private bathroom looks nice,with a descent size and clean towels,shampoo,soap and all you need.,
"Would definitely be back again. Highly recommended!\"",,,,,
801722,33438368,2015-05-28,14281338,Emerson,"The room is clean and the bathroom is very well done. All the amenities were readily available and we had a fine, private stay at Terry's airbnb. Highly recommended for perusing Boston."
801722,41803559,2015-08-09,37982375,Joseph,"We didn't meet the host but that wasn't a problem for us, the room was as described. We had to climb some narrow stairs which was a bit tricky with big luggage but otherwise fine. The area seemed ok but we did not travel to the house past midnight. The room was great, plenty of space and in a quiet area. We found it the perfect place to relax and escape the hot summer evenings! There was good air- con in the room, and the adjacent bathroom had a window you could open if needed. There was a good- sized fridge, microwave and plenty of plates/ bowls etc if required. The only thing to consider is that you have to climb a rather steep hill which is only difficult if you have a lot of luggage but otherwise manageable for any able-bodied person. Overall very enjoyable, will stay again if back in Boston!"
801722,44485899,2015-08-26,41623488,Vince,"Terry was great communicator, neighborhood was mostly brownstones  1/2 mile from main strip, free parking on street was never a issue"
2186358,10220003,2014-02-07,749005,Ann,"Nice comfortable apartment at great location. Amenities were well provided for. Check-in was easy, doorman helpful and courteous. Only complaint is the bed which is not most comfortable and sinks in the middle. All in all, I am happy with this unit and the building which has a well equipped gym and would re-book again this fall when I return!"
Heskel is a great host,"very efficient with the reponse!\"",,,,
2186358,19837972,2014-09-19,10653168,Alexander,Really Enjoyed my stay at Heskel's Apartment. It was even more beautiful than expected and it was a great location (right near fenway park). Would definitely stay at one of his many apartments again!
2186358,22613199,2014-11-10,13010316,Federico,Excellent experience. I only have extremely positive feedback.
2186358,32896015,2015-05-23,27518723,Jane,"This listing is fabulous. What great views, gorgeous building and omg, a roofdeck pool. So close to everything too! Our host left us with a welcome gift bag with all the essentials - that was so sweet!"
I was glad that I lived close by to help with my parents in terms of extra bedding and some sharper knives; it was just a short term leasing property so that is to be expected.  Also,the pull out bed was really small and not the best (bring an air mattress).,,,,
This place is honestly fabulous for those looking to be in the heart of Boston and have the autonomy of a hotel,"while being comfortable and easy just like home. Great place!!\"",,,,
2186358,40122835,2015-07-28,35243539,Nichole,Wonderful welcome baskets.  Everyone in the building was overly helpful with our needs.  Apartment was nice but could use some touching up. I was a bit let down thinking that I was renting from an individual but instead this is a corporation.
2186358,48328715,2015-09-25,8304398,James,"Great Experience - beautiful clean, excellent location"
2186358,51559229,2015-10-21,44994019,Jolanta,The condo was nice and clean. Lots of storage. We were welcomed with a couple of baskets filled with necessities for the kitchen and bathroom. Free WiFi- thank you! We Loved the convenience of the location to public transportation and the proximity to restaurants and city target. It was a great experience. We Will definitely use AirBnb again.

The apartment was clean and well appointed.  It was also very secure.,,,,,

11020786,64345830,2016-03-02,60897182,Edalia,"It was my first time using AirBnb and I am now hooked. Had to snag with housing arrangements for the business trip with my staff and turned to airbnb. Found Dans spot and I could be happier. Dan is gracious and pleasant host. He was quick to respond and put my mind at easy immediately. He was very accommodating and welcoming. His home is just as it is shown in pictures and more. Great location, perfect for a group of friends or in my case colleagues. All amenities you would need, including parking. It was great and we hope to return soon!"
11020786,64494927,2016-03-04,61400405,Nete,"Great home in a fantastic location. House is spacious and airy with lots of natural light.  It is in a great location for getting to bars and restaurants in the area as well as downtown, seaport and North end. Perfectly convenient for seeing the sights as well. Dan was really helpful and friendly, he answered every question I had and made my stay in Boston very comfortable.  Would highly recommend staying here."
11020786,64733491,2016-03-06,61400532,Nicole,"Dan was a very accommodating host right from the start and we all felt right at home as soon as we arrived. Really love the house: clean, bright, comfortably set up. It is also in a great location, close to sights, lots of restaurant and bars within an easy walk. All must see areas like South End, Back Bay, Seaport are also easily accessible on foot or just a few minutes by train. Public transportation (subway and bus) are a short walk away."
11020786,70639032,2016-04-19,64756407,William,"Great apartment & host.  Key pickup was easy & timely.  Apartment was large, very clean and all amenities as expected from the online photos.  Good location across from park in S. Boston.  Walk/short drive to dining options & grocery.  Easy Uber in downtown Boston.  Overall, first Airbnb experience was very positive & I look forward to using it again."
11020786,71560912,2016-04-26,5944909,Mark,Dan was an incredible host and his South Boston retreat was a gem in the city.
My coworkers and I were in town for PAX East and his beautiful townhouse was easy walking distance to anything and everything within the city and stocked with everything we could need.,,,,,
You're surrounded by great local pubs,the locals were incredibly nice and if you're a movie buff - you're a minutes walk away from some highlights from Good Will Hunting and Gone Baby Gone!,,,,
"Couldn't dream of staying anywhere else in Boston and hope to return soon. :)\"",,,,,
11020786,72365338,2016-05-02,11094411,Cody,This condo was great for us. We didn't spend much time in the condo due to wanting to explore the city but it was a great place. Honestly the pictures kind of don't do it justice. Dan was very very responsive to every question we had and more than willing to help. Would recommend this location to anyone traveling to Boston.
11020786,72798626,2016-05-04,27902405,Azar,"Nice home, easy and clear instructions, I would stay here again!"

11020786,74724030,2016-05-16,36308404,Karen,"Dan was a very welcoming host.  He was easy to work with and was very prompt in answering any questions we had.  The home/apt. is true to the posted pictures - clean, comfortable, apparently newly updated, and spacious.  It is close to restaurants, grocery, bus lines.  We (family of 5 adults) enjoyed our stay very much and would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston."
11020786,74883022,2016-05-17,424265,Colin,"Dan's place was great! I only wish that I was there for more than one night. Having just arrived from a week in Italy, I wanted somewhere nice to lay my head down. This place did not disappoint. It was in a great location, top floor/two story condo and very modern with all the awesome upgrades. Everything was seamless for getting in. It was also nice to listen to music from the universal sound system that links all rooms. I look forward to coming back to Boston and stay in Dan's unit!"
11020786,75598077,2016-05-22,53728876,Rich,"My guests and I would like to personally thank our host Dan for his patience, understanding and accommodations during our pleasant stay and trip. Dan was very available, accommodating and a pleasure to talk with and eager to please. We traveled to South Boston from Pennsylvania and some of my group had late departures which resulted in unfortunate late arrivals but thankfully everyone arrived safely. My apologies in advance for any arrival noise that may have disturbed the neighbors at this late hour. This condo is on the 3rd floor of this condominium complex and the unfortunate noise from hauling up luggage along with the chatter and footsteps of adults and children probably echoed throughout the stairwell and into the other units. The key to neighbor consideration at this unit is to keep noise levels at a minimum. The only drawback to this unit is parking since there is only one designated parking space assigned to this unit and open street parking is mostly in tow zones or for vehicles with permits. That said, a parking garage was a short distance from the condo for a reasonable cost per night. Uber was our preferred means of getting around the city and I highly recommended it. The condo was very clean, comfortable and accommodating and the spacious second floor outdoor deck was very scenic and relaxing with spectacular views. There were plenty of towels and linens and the accommodating kitchen had ample pots, pans, and serving-ware. Thank you for making our Boston vacation enjoyable and complete Dan."
11020786,76430088,2016-05-27,11853844,Irfan,"This home is incredible. It is well decorated, very modern, and all the amenities are fabulous. The view from the rooftop deck is incredible, and everything we needed was there. There is also technical support around the clock, which is awesome. There is plenty of space for entertaining and it can house many guests. The place is very clean and feels brand new. I would definitely recommend this place if you need a place in Boston! (It is best if you have a car to travel around in, because it is in somewhat of a subway desert but comes with a parking spot. Also note that it is on the third floor without elevator.)"
11020786,77155095,2016-05-30,4679495,Tareq,"Great apartment and nice set up that's perfect for a group . Apartment was clean , nice furniture and had everything we needed . The location was ideal with easy uber ride to downtown area. Dan was professional and available. Highly recommend this place"
11020786,78972990,2016-06-10,38515275,Selin,"Dan is an excellent host and was very responsive and organized. His place is amazing and definitely a location I would book again. The location is very central and close to the Boston Convention Centre, which makes it appealing for business travel. His house is very clean, modern and accommodating. The roof top patio, central speaker system and even the added touch of having basic toiletries in the house, makes this place unique."
11020786,80337175,2016-06-17,30286367,Erin,"Dan's place was perfect! It was well stocked with everything you'd need. The place was just as described and in a great location. We were within easy walking distance to breakfast spots, dinner options and anything in between. Dan was super accommodating, easy to communicate with and very responsive. If ever back in Boston, we would definitely stay here!"
11020786,81325235,2016-06-22,75104471,Joe,Great place to stay with a larger group.  Recently built with all modern appliances.  My extended family of 7 had room to stretch out.  Two full baths made getting ready a breeze.  Roof terrance made for a great place to relax and has a gas grill.  Safe neighborhood with a few restaurants and a grocery store within 4 or 5 blocks.  1.5 miles are so to the nearest metro so we ended up using Uber.  $6-15 for Uber to Downtown/historic areas.
11020786,81927747,2016-06-25,70401374,Bill,Great place to stay.  Convenient to all segments of Boston.  Love the roof top patio; off-street parking was really needed.
11020786,82667112,2016-06-28,32646858,Bonnie,"This modern apartment was lovely with plenty of room and all the facilities you need. There were six of us staying so there was plenty of room with the two bedrooms and the third bedroom which is a mezzanine type set up above the lounge and beside the rooftop deck....the rooftop deck is ideal for drinks and a barbecue on a nice summers evening. The area is nice - we felt really safe walking around at night and there was a lovely park directly opposite where we watched the baseball teams play each night. Restaurants and a good supermarket are within close walking distance.  Dan was an excellent communicator, we always received an instant response and he was very friendly."
11020786,85135426,2016-07-10,60941098,Jordan,The apartment was very nice. Communication with property owner was great. GPS might take to you a nearby location so be sure to map yourself to the right address beforehand.

11020786,88843373,2016-07-25,13020112,Adam,The host made us feel very welcome. The neighborhood was a great spot to get anywhere in Boston. The home was extremely clean and very nice. We visited in July and especially enjoyed the rooftop patio. Would definitely stay again!
11020786,89642751,2016-07-29,32440133,Samir,"Nous n'avons pas eu le plaisir de rencontrer Dan en personne. Mais il était très accueillant par message interposé, et très disponible pour répondre à nos demandes. Son appartement est tout simplement magnifique à tout point de vue : confort, équipement, propreté. Et la disponibilité d'un parking dédié à l'appartement est un vrai plus quand on est en voiture. Nous reviendrons avec plaisir."
11020786,90378906,2016-07-31,61590909,Dan,From the beginning of the process the host was very involved in making us feel welcome and getting comfortable in the property.  Provided fantastic detailed reminders with amenities in the area to help us on our first trip to Boston.  Were easily accessible via text & email and helped us work through everything we needed.  Would absolutely recommend this listing & location!
11020786,91212978,2016-08-04,57748497,Uwe,"Ein großes Appartment mit Charme, aber leider nur für 4 Personen richtig gut geeignet, da z.B. nicht genügend Stühle vorhanden sind bzw. auch Tische in der richtigen Größe fehlen (auf der Terrasse). Zudem fehlen einige praktische Dinge wie Abstellmöglichkeiten und Leselicht an den Betten."
11020786,92124304,2016-08-07,64221509,Frank,Great spot.  Dan was very helpful with telling us about places to go and do.  House was very clean and exactly what the pictures showed.  Would def stay again.
11020786,93146827,2016-08-11,72332374,Debbe,"The listing was accurate other than 3rd bedroom.  The photo shows it as a couch, but there are two beds in this room.  Also should note the unit is on the 6th floor with stair access only."
Loved the location and the roof top deck,"great for families. \"",,,,
11020786,93628476,2016-08-13,24597659,Jeanne,"Yes, we felt welcome, the place was immaculate and in a great location.  We'd definitely stay here the next time in Boston."

54944,7302910,2013-09-15,6327873,Barb,"The apartment was very well located in the lovely Beacon Hill area. It was close to interesting boutique shops, a variety of restaurants and several small food stores. It was a short walk to either the red or green subway lines and access to other parts of the city was easy, either by train or walking. The apartment is a studio, with bed, sitting area and kitchen included in the one space, but it is more than adequate for two people. We enjoyed the ambience of the apartment and its location."
54944,11076396,2014-03-19,8248052,Rosamund,"Great compact studio in a fantastic location surrounded by great shops, diners, restaurants and 2 mins walk from the public park and Boston Common. Everything you need for a short stay in Boston. No laundry facilities in the building but Charles St launderette within a minute's walk."
54944,20890117,2014-10-06,8830259,Mike,The reservation was canceled 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
54944,33488727,2015-05-28,32012696,Lauren,The host canceled this reservation 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
54944,34842345,2015-06-13,23954669,Diane,"Good communication and easy to follow instructions. Unbeatable location, perfect for those who like the inner city vibe. Very responsive to questions and requests. You'll need to bring or buy cooking and bath basics if you are staying a while."
54944,36215949,2015-06-26,34951074,Jessica,"Great location right off of Charles St. with tons of coffee places and restaurants (try the pizza at Figs!) and the Boston commons right around the corner. Parking at Boston Commons was VERY expensive, but it is the closest lot. All parking along the street is metered (not overnight) or permit parking only. I didn't cook in the apartment, as we were only there for a few days, but everything was clean and exactly as pictured. The AC worked well and kept us cool at night. This was everything I could ask for for our short stay. Due to the superb location and reasonable price, I would definitely consider staying here again for my next visit to downtown Boston!"
54944,53326587,2015-11-08,36980856,John,"The apartment was just as we expected.  The location was perfect, the bed, sheets, and the amenities were very good.  The Wifi was fast and reliable."
6684904,42865679,2015-08-16,10401216,Mette,"We had a great stay at Cityview Longwood apartments. The apartment is spacious and comfortable and was very clean . We needed a few extra supplies (plates, cutlery and glasses) and these were delivered the same day. The gym is sufficiently equipped and is availabe 24/7 as is the laundry room in the basement."
The building's population consists of mostly young students and is very friendly and well-behaved. We had a wonderful view towards the Boston skyline and looking southeast we could see the bay of Boston in the distance. We cycled into central Boston and nearby charming neighborhoods like Longwood and Brookline within half an hour. The apartment is walking distance to the Museum of Fine ARt. The Hubway bikeshare scheme is very convenient and Hubway stations are nearby. The Green Line into town is also very close and dependable. For basic needs there is a large supermarkt at a 5 min walk as well as a few restaurants and pharmacies.,,,,,

6684904,54821058,2015-11-23,34861595,Nicholas,Mike was very helpful in my search for a place to stay last minute in Boston.  Very easy check in/out process.  Very enjoyable experience.
5280827,27566473,2015-03-07,28784261,Jubin,Its a nice little room - neat and clean. Joe is a great host- He is prompt in his responses and he will help you with any local information.
5280827,76671595,2016-05-28,16389239,Linda,"This was basic space, a bit tight and no amenities,  but it met our needs, maybe a little high priced for what it is.  The people coming in late thumped their suitcases up the stairs at midnight which was right outside our room."
The parking could have been a problem,three cars in one long driveway,"but it worked out ok.Joe was prompt in communicating.\"",,,
5280827,78539474,2016-06-07,35254966,Alice,"Joe was very fast in responding. He was very flexible on the check in time. He made sure we could park our car somewhere and that we had everything we needed. The only setback was the bathroom. The smell was a little hard to handle, but other than that, the place was fine for a quick one-night stay. The pictures are an accurate depiction of the place."

5280827,88662009,2016-07-25,44873436,Vanessa,We had a Great stay at Joes place!
5280827,95504317,2016-08-20,10534493,Matt,"Joe offered a comfortable, clean place to stay for a few nights before my girlfriend and I moved in to our own apartment. Pros include clear arrival directions , clean bed, sheets, parking space (!) bathroom. Joe was easy to communicate and accommodating, even though we did not meet in person. Photos matched the room. For improvement, I would suggest being more clear on communicating the set-up of the apartment, as we were surprised there were several other guests, not us and host only. Also, if there are more than one guest parking in car port, that would be helpful to know, as we were blocked in around check-out. It was resolved shortly, luckily, but felt bad other guys had to wake up to move their car. Joes place is great if you need a place to stay for a short amount of time. Those looking for a local Boston area experience might look elsewhere."

11470818,68432518,2016-04-04,20371292,Morgan,The listing was very accurate and Jessica was accommodating and great to work with! I would highly recommend staying at her AirBNB for any small parties looking to spend time in Boston.
11470818,70697699,2016-04-19,32264,Phil,"Jessica was the perfect host! Her place was very clean and really well decorated. It's in a perfect location, across from a park and an easy walk from Copley Square and 2 subway lines."
And,she went above all expectations and helped us with restaurant recommendations,and made it easy to deal with our strange departure times.,,,
I'd definitely recommend staying here! Actually,"I kind of wish I lived in this apartment :)\"",,,,
11470818,71505521,2016-04-25,31887027,Trond,Jessica is a great communicator and very accessible--place was spotless and as good or better than web description.  Excellent location and bed was very comfortable too ;-)   Would stay there again in a heartbeat.

I think i enjoyed Boston even more because of this apartment. Grocery stores are close by,as well as great spots,restaurants,metro.,,

Also,she was available during our entire trip when we had a few questions.,,,,
The unit is roomy and furnishings are great. We did not spend much time in the unit as we were around town but it has every thing you need including a pull out second bed,washer/dryer,etc.,,,
The neighborhood is a perfect location in the south end and is a short walk to the T,Copley Square and Back Bay.,,,,
"I would definitely stay at Jessica's place again.\"",,,,,
11470818,80633242,2016-06-19,74602648,Julee,Great location.  Convenient to good market and lots of restaurants. Right across from lovely small park. Nice playground for children. Basketball court gets lots of use though everything quiets down at night.
Apartment had very comfortable couches and a very comfortable queen bed. Nice shower with good water pressure. Good kitchen.,,,,,

Jessica was also kind enough to help me get acquainted with the home when I arrived. Jessica was also great at communicating and being available via message to answer any questions.

10749312,77110370,2016-05-30,26413341,Tammy,"This was a great house for our stay in Boston! The area, Jamaica Plains, is a great location- you can easily walk to several great restaurants & the Sam Adams brewery. The T was only a couple of blocks away & then it was only a 10 min ride to the center of Boston. The house was comfortable & updated. We got to meet the host upon arriving & she was great! The communication was the best I've ever had through the booking & rental process and I've rented a lot of places. There is a cat on property, Earl Gray, who is so friendly & awesome to have around. All in all, a great experience- I highly recommend staying here!"
10749312,84147369,2016-07-05,2180594,Lauren,Steve and Leisl madder us feel very welcome. They even offered food from their cabinets. House was very comfortable and clean. Great place for kids.
10749312,89892175,2016-07-30,67113620,Deborah,"This house in a quiet neighborhood was perfect for our family's first trip to Boston. It was immaculately clean with plush towels, very comfortable beds, pillows and linens. It was totally up to date with wifi, A/C and stainless steel appliances. Nice, full bath upstairs with a good shower, double sink and tile floor. Half bath on the main floor. Washer and dryer were available for us to use, although we didn't need it. It's an easy, short walk to the Transit station and only a 10 min. ride to downtown Boston. My son played some pick up games of basketball in the nice park right across the street. A very friendly cat lives on the premises. I appreciated the good communication with the host, Liesl, who seemed to really care that our stay at her home and in Boston was enjoyable.  Thanks Leisl."

I messages her a few times during our stay and she responded quickly.  Bedding and towels were clean and the apartment was homey and comfortable."
7454907,46806155,2015-09-13,32131710,Matt,"Had an awesome stay at Kristin's apartment!  She was super communicative during booking, checking in/out, and for questions during our stay.  The apartment was clean, cozy, and in an awesome location in the North End (just a few blocks from Hanover).  Would take this place over a hotel any day!"
3987926,19240110,2014-09-08,19952398,Monika,Lisa and Brian were so nice host. It was our first experience with airbnb and I think we could not meet beter couple of people. Lisa adviced us with everything we needed=) And breakfast and the subway pass was really useful. Thanks a lot
"Monika & Vladimir\"",,,,,
3987926,19448884,2014-09-12,12728278,Pamela,We had a very nice stay at Lisa's and Brian's.
The whole appartment was very clean and Lisa did everything to make our stay convenient. There are a lot of different things for breakfast - even delicious homemade cookies! :-),,,,,
We got unlimited Charliecards (for public transport) during our stay and Lisa gave us good hints where to go best around the neighbourhood as well as around the city (we got a lot information even before arriving...)!,,,,,
It took us about 30 min to go to downtown Boston (10 min walk and 20 min tram ride),which was ok as tram goes at least every 10 minutes - even in the evenings. You can take a Bus instead of walking,as it stops nearby their house - unfortunately we could hear buses going by from our bedroom,so it is not really quiet.,,
But all in all,we recommend staying in this private room as Lisa really is a helpful and nice host,"you get to downtown easily and the room was really affordable...\"",,,
3987926,19494907,2014-09-13,20913566,Georgina,"We were very impressed with Lisa and Brian's house. Their house is about 10 minutes walk from the T station Forest Hill, so no big deal. They were laid-back and friendly hosts, quiet but willing to chat and recommend stuff. Our room was clean and nicely decorated (the Rustic Room), the bedding was clean and comfy, Wifi worked well. The room had good blackout curtains. We loved the little extra touches: Bonbons on our towels, a nice basket full of sweet and savoury snacks, water bottles and even freshly baked cookies! They even provide free Metro/bus passes for the duration of your stay! My husband had a shower and reported that the shower was a fancy spa shower and the water pressure was good. There are two bathrooms to share in the house between maybe 5 double bedrooms, but this was not a problem, no waiting time. Nice and clean. Breakfast was great. Lisa was not fussy about what time we had breakfast, it was all laid out and waiting for whenever we wanted it: boiled eggs, oatmeal, cereals, orange juice, a fancy coffee machine with all kinds of coffee and tea options, muffins, toast, milk, apples and bananas, cream cheese, crumpets and more I can't remember now. There was a living room with a film projector, but we didn't use this as we were busy running around Boston. We loved this place!"
3987926,19900838,2014-09-20,12044091,Diane,"I'm gonna line up with the thousand of good comments Lisa and Brian already have. They deserve such gratitude ! Going to their home is being treated like in a 5 stars hotel : treats on your pillow, home made cookies, their home is yours. It's uncredible to find such a place at this price and location (less than 10min to the orange line, a giant very affordable store on the way). We've only stayed one night but we weren't neglected at all ! I really recommand it to any of you who come to Boston !"
Je me range du côté de ces commentaires positifs que Lisa et Brian ont déjà reçu : ils les méritent grandement ! En allant chez eux,attendez vous à du haut standing : friandises sur l'oreiller,cookies fait maison,"vous vous sentirez chez vous. Ça semble incroyable de trouver une chambre à ce prix et si bien située (moins de 10min à pied du métro avec un très bon et très grand supermarché sur le chemin). Ils nous ont parfaitement accueilli alors qu'on ne restait qu'une courte nuit chez eux ! Je les recommande vivement à tous les visiteurs de Boston !\"",,
3987926,20057266,2014-09-22,21142121,Tom,From the moment we arrived Lisa and Brian made us feel very welcome and at home. We were given a tour of the house and given advice on where to go to eat that evening (an excellent recommendation - (URL HIDDEN) and how to get to Boston the following morning.
The room was clean,comfortable and we were provided with clean towels and homemade cookies too!,,,,
We only stayed two night unfortunately but would have been very happy to stay much longer!,,,,,
"Thanks Lisa and Brian for making our trip all the more enjoyable!\"",,,,,
3987926,20165141,2014-09-24,96847,Rex,"Lisa was very gracious and helpful. She shared information, willingly, suggested places to see and how to get there, favorite eating places, directions, etc. We needed to add an extra night at the front end of our stay and she accommodated this. The rooms are clean with a home-like feel. Very welcoming and comfortable."
3987926,20299760,2014-09-27,18337749,Kathrin,"The stay at Lisa's house was absolutely amazing! As we arrived in Boston via a night bus, we got to Lisa's place quite early but we were greeted with a lovely breakfast and were able to check in immediately. Every morning, Lisa sat with us at the breakfast table and was more than willing to give us tips to do in Boston. We followed a lot of her advises and had a great time. Everything was clean, the breakfast was really nice (muffins, toasts, fruits, coffee) and we even had some fresh baked cookies in our room! The free subway pass was also really helpful and we saved a lot of money through this. Although Roslindale is not in the center of Boston, getting downtown was really no problem as the subway station was quite close. Whenever we had a question, Lisa was always there to help us. Lisa, thank you so much for welcoming us into your home!"
3987926,20521911,2014-09-30,20837124,Maryann,"It's a very happy experience for us to stay at Lisa's Rustic Room for two days. Lisa is so nice and always helpful. It is so convenient to go to the downtown of Boston. We bring our 2yr old baby girl, Lisa is so kind to provide a baby cot to us. Next time when I go to Boston, I will choose Lisa's room again. Thanks to Lisa!"
3987926,20629689,2014-10-02,20525481,Etienne,Nice flat and confortable bed. The included breakfast and the attentions in the bedroom mad the stay more enjoyable. Thanks Lisa
3987926,21085188,2014-10-11,17066402,Carola,"Leider waren wir nur kurz in Boston ( 1 Nacht) , haben die Zeit aber sehr genossen. Lisa hat uns bei allen Fragen weitergeholfen und unterstützt. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt bei den Beiden und würden jederzeit wiederkommen. Schade das wir uns nur kurz kennengelernt haben."
3987926,21303971,2014-10-14,21105495,Drew & Melody,"Lisa was great! She was very nice and accommodating! Everything we'd hope for in an Airbnb host! The place was nice. Good, clean room. Amenities (bathroom, guest kitchen, etc.) were all great. The neighborhood was fine too. Felt perfectly safe. It was just a quick 10 minute (max) walk to the nearest subway stop. All in all, we would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in Boston!"
3987926,21679626,2014-10-21,19759846,Bariş,Lisa was very helpfull and friendly for everything. She also picked us by her car when we lost our way :)
3987926,22109033,2014-10-30,20806133,Selena,"Lisa is a great host! She provided useful tour information about Boston and loved to share her life or opinions with us! We are just like friends! Her home is just like my home:) We have everything we need! TKS! Also, the public transportation is easy! There is a bus stop just across her house's street and you could take metro after 2 stops of the bus! Lisa is sweet to provide free passes for bus or metro! You don't need to worry about the fare about the bus or metro! Thanks! Just come to stay:)"
3987926,22592935,2014-11-10,22081684,Ayana & Doug,"We were so lucky to have our first AirBnB experience here with Lisa and Brian. The private room was cozy (heated blanket, fresh sheets) with sweet touches (snacks, cookies). The shared amenities (kitchen, bathroom) had everything we needed and more, and the transit passes were a great convenience. Moreover, these two were so generous in answering to my last minute needs; everything from printing papers to cooking ingredients."
"Definitely a commendable BnB :)\"",,,,,
3987926,22818901,2014-11-15,6497948,Solangi,"Lisa was the perfect host. This was my first experience using airbnb or anything similar to hotels and alternatives. If my future experiences are like the one I had while staying at Lisa's, then I'll confidently say that there is no need for a hotel. Location was perfect, 10 min walk from station, value was incredible, and everything was super clean. The bed was sooooo comfortable, the popcorn and netflix through projector were great, the breakfast was amaaaaaaaazing! Plenty of board games. It really felt like staying at home, better even. Lisa was really nice, helpful,  friendly, flexible (especially with arrival/departure times),  and personable. She made sure our every need was met, while giving us a perfect amount of space. I wish we could have stayed more thab one night. If I had to stay in boston again, Lisa's will definitely be the first choice. If I could give more than five stars, I would. Thanks Lisa (and Brian!)."
"I hope this COMPLETELY honest review helps future bookers.\"",,,,,
3987926,22965779,2014-11-18,11110752,Jason,"I had a good experience with the Rustic room, which has a great bed with an electric blanket.  There are three other rooms for rent in the house, so guests share their own kitchen, which is stocked with cereal, muffins, eggs, coffee and tea.  There are two bathrooms for four rooms, so you share with one other room. Lisa was very nice and accommodating, and there is even free popcorn and Netflix in the living room.  Upstairs there is a dining room table with lots of pamphlets and some books about Boston and New England.  But I would say the best added value is the unlimited subway and bus pass that each guest receives, which saves you a bundle.  This makes the room an even better value."
3987926,23046789,2014-11-21,23502659,Christopher,First time using Airbnb and it was delightful. Got to the Host house and Lisa was there to give us a tour of the house. Was accommodated with two Charlie passes that covered public transportation through Boston. If all Airbnb's is like Lisa's House then I will certainly be using this instead of Hotels.
3987926,23297928,2014-11-28,18373785,Sabine,We stayed at two rooms during our stay. For a detalied description look at the sportsroom one.
3987926,23591555,2014-12-05,14909225,Daniel,"First time AirBNB experience, and we were a bit anxious about both the unfamiliar city and the service. We feel fortunate to have run into Lisa. She was very cordial and responsive from the start. We arrived quite late into the day, where most of the tourist spots were closed. It wasn't too productive trying to sightsee after 4pm, and we only planned a night of stay. Seeing how the included unlimited metro card could save us a lot of trouble and money (parking around Boston can get problematic and expensive), I asked Lisa for possibility of using it even after we check out the next day. She agreed, and honestly it made a huge difference in our efficiency and convenience. We couldn't have covered the places we did with a car or park-and-walk, and using the T would have become pretty expensive."
We changed room upon arrival (from sports room to rustic,for no other reason than because my girlfriend liked it better). The four rooms are in the same building,two on each floor. It shows different locations on Airbnb so it's a bit confusing. The location is two bus stops away from the end of orange line (Forest Hills),and there are many buses that would take you to the station so the wait was never long. Parking is off the street. The bed is really comfortable,and heating pads and blankets are provided for great comfort. Cable TV is in every room,as well as WiFi. There's a bathroom on each floor (one for two rooms)
"I really appreciated Lisa and Brian's help. They really went out of their way and made our stay and visit better than it would have been otherwise. Thank you!\"",,,,,

3987926,23736614,2014-12-08,21210890,Patrick,"I arrived there, got shown around and explained everything. The bedroom was big and the bed comfortable. The complementary cookies were awesome and the breakfast only lacked jelly/jam. I basically only slept there and didn't interact much with anybody. The access to store and public transit is perfect."
3987926,23830024,2014-12-11,15937477,Andrea,Lisa was great! Very accommodating. We had zero problems. The subway card was awesome! We put it to good use! Nice place! Heated blankets. She had tea and coffee for us and lots of board games! We wish we got to play some board games with you! Would stay again. 10/10 recommend.
3987926,24550851,2014-12-30,24022493,Juo-Han,"Lisa and Brian are very friendly and kind. The price of the house is very worthy. The bed is big and the bathroom is clean. We can cook anything we want in the kitchen and watch movies by projector in the living room. The house is close to bus stations and subway station. Hence, it's very convenient and safe. It would be my highly recommended house when visiting Boston. Very good experience."
3987926,24961899,2015-01-04,5923760,Grégory,"Lisa was a very helpful and careful host. The apartment is very cool, clean and pretty close to the subway or the bus. 5 min on walk to get the orange line, what's do you want more ? Free subway Pass and breakfast are really added value ! The cookies from Lisa are very delicious :)"

The place felt just like home. The breakfast was so fulfilling with well stocked items such as bagels with cream cheese, bread and jam, eggs, Keurig style coffee machine, tea, muffins, fresh fruits...etc. last but least, the complimentary Charlie card is so useful if you are like us tourists who want to explore throughout Boston during your stay not to mention $$$saved. Thank you Lisa and your husband for making our stay in Boston so comfortable and feeling of home away from home. God bless! :))"
3987926,25585906,2015-01-19,26166729,Greg,Lisa was awesome....though our stay was brief she made us feel like we were home...We would definitely stay there again!!

3987926,25769010,2015-01-25,16398710,Laken,"First of all, prior to arrival Lisa sent us all the information we needed, so our trip was off to a good start! When we arrived, there was plenty of free parking on the street, and we were greeted by Brian (Lisa's Husband). He gave us a tour of the place, and explained all information. He was very friendly and made us feel comfortable and welcome. The room, had a couple of snacks, bottles of water and an information sheet with wifi code and other appreciated information...! The two public transportation cards were also available when we arrived (very fun to have!) The bus stop is right across the street! The bed is VERY comfortable.. (usually, I miss my bed, but I didn't this time!) The heating blanket, with controls on each side of the bed is AMAZING. We eventually got to meet Lisa, she was so friendly and happy , it put us in a good mood. They kindly let us play some of their board games ( an awesome selection) and even invited us to play with them later that evening but we were unfortunately busy! The place is very clean, and everything was great. Will be staying again when back in Boston! You won't regret your stay. PS: the breakfast offered is good and a really cool idea , loved it ! Especially the hot apple cider for the Kureg machine...."
Enjoy your stay!,,,,,
PS: if coming home late at night.. make sure you pay attention to what house your going into.. we were stupid enough to walk into the wrong house (the doors were unlocked,"but I was under the illusion my keys were working on the other house). We had a good laugh! \"",,,,

They were very welcoming, and gave me a walk through of the house even when I arrived at 11pm. Both were very friendly, and I wish I had more time to chat and get to know them. Highly doubt this is my last stay. Fantastic neighborhood. I walked around in super cold weather, but never felt threatened."
3987926,27579535,2015-03-08,12757799,Jiwoo,Brian and Lisa strive to be perfect hosts. I felt that they genuinely wanted to make my experience perfect. They were very prepared and experienced. Very friendly too. Would book again in a heartbeat.

The room is just as cute and clean as in the picture, plus the house has many perks (projector to watch movie, free breakfast!).

I was originally looking at hotels near the center of Boston because I thought we'd save money on transportation.  This room was a bit outside the city, but came with Charlie Cards, which made getting around totally stress free, with the bonus of being in a nice quieter neighborhood."
I enjoyed the self-serve breakfasts,as I have stayed in traditional b&bs before,"and not needing to report to breakfast at a specific time made it easier to plan out the rest of our day.\"",,,
3987926,28322719,2015-03-22,27691937,Maria,My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay! We loved the Charlie Passes and the convenience as well as money saving factor of it. We were able to see so much of Boston in just three days. Lisa was very accommodating and even communicated well with me when the Charlie passes were malfunctioning for a moment. I would definitely come back to stay here again! Thanks Lisa and Brian!
3987926,28620852,2015-03-27,18607361,Frank (And Meridith),"Love this place even more on second stay. May not seem like good location on a map, but the Orange line is super reliable and comped by the hosts."

Because we arrived a few hours before check-in, she graciously allowed us to drop off our bags so we could enjoy Boston without all the extra weight! The free public transportation passes were so helpful when exploring the city, and the fact that the bus stops right outside of Lisa's home was so convenient. Thank you Lisa and Brian for such a welcoming stay! Excellent hosts!"
3987926,29983740,2015-04-15,29469601,Stefanie,Our stay with Lisa and Brian was just perfect!!
The room is clean and cosy with the most comfortable bed.  There were even lovely snacks and water available for us.,,,,,
The house offers everything you need. A comfy lounge room to relax in,a great dining area and a fully equipped kitchen with dishwasher,all of which are for guests use.  We were able to cook a lovely home cooked meal during our stay.,,,
There were gorgeous breakfast options for you to help yourself to at your leisure including nice muffins (English,blueberry and chocolate).  Lisa and Brian also made a delicious banana bread,not to be missed.,,,
The house is in a really lovely spot just next to the arboretum which is stunning for a nice walk.  It is also only 10 mins walk or 2 mins bus to the tube and then you can get literally anywhere in and around Boston very easily.  The transportation pass is a fantastic addition to a stay here.,,,,,
Boston itself is a beautiful city and has lots to offer.,,,,,
Lisa was always extremely friendly,helpful and accommodating.  She responded to all communication immediately and kept us updated about check in procedures.,,,,
Prior to arrival she sent a list of some things to do in the area.  We took note,followed a number of these and they were great i.e. eating out in the North End region with lots of Italian restaurants.,,,,
During the visit Lisa took time out to sit down with us and give us tips on great places to visit during our whole stay in America.,,,,,
"I cannot recommend this highly enough.  This was our first Airbnb experience and was the first place we felt home from home since we left our own home 3 months. Thank you!!!\"",,,,,
3987926,30105674,2015-04-17,27670921,Sarah,"Lisa and Brian go above and beyond the average airbnb experience to provide guests with a welcoming and comfortable space to stay in Boston. They are both such kind people that I'm so glad to have met! I absolutely recommend staying with them and will definitely look into staying with them again for a future Boston trip! Thank you, Lisa and Brain!"
3987926,30165252,2015-04-18,25103165,Soohan,AMAZING! They are awesome and super friendly!! STAY HERE when you go to boston!
3987926,30365998,2015-04-20,21785058,Guillermo,"Todo fue según lo pactado. Lisa es una gran anfitriona, tal cual los comentarios previos. Si bien solo estuve una noche me permitió dejar las cosas y pasarlas a buscar luego. Buen desayuno, todo muy limpio y ordenado. Si bien es algo lejos ellos te proveen los pases del subte, los cuales de otra manera son bastante caros. En fin, una buena experiencia en mi primer viaje con AirBNB."
3987926,30464516,2015-04-22,28143179,Catherine,"Nous avons été très bien accueilli par Lisa, malgré un très fort retard par rapport à l'heure prévue. Lisa est charmante et est prête à répondre à toutes nos questions et fournir tous les renseignements touristiques. L'accès à la cuisine est libre et elle nous a gentiment offert le petit déjeuner. Le pass des transports edt très appréciable et simplifie la vie. La maison est dans un quartier calme et très bien desservie par les transports. La chambre n'est pas très grande ,mais suffisante  et le lit confortable. Conclusion nous avons passé 2 nuits très agréables et vous pouvez vous y rendre avec confiance."

Everything was as we expected it to be from the listing. Our room was clean and cozy and the bed was super comfortable. It was great to be able to have breakfast at the house before heading into the city for the day,and there were plenty of filling breakfast options to choose from.,,,,
Lisa and Brian were friendly and welcoming,and made us feel right at home. They were flexible and easygoing and it's clear to see that they are committed to delivering a hassle-free experience for their guests. They are both interesting and easy to talk to,and Lisa even made us cookies one night!,,,
"We couldn't have been happier with our choice to stay with them and 100% recommend their place if you're coming to Boston!\"",,,,,
3987926,33244222,2015-05-26,26904206,Sarah,"Really easy experience overall. The house is two levels. First level has the projector, Boston room, Rustic room and purple bathroom and the second has the kitchen, orange bathroom, sports themed room, and nautical room.  The location was great, the room was comfortable,  and the extras like breakfast and transit passes were a big plus.  Lisa and Brian are very friendly and  helpful. We rarely ran into the other guests or felt crowded in the house and there were no shared bathroom issues at all.  Glad i booked it!"
3987926,33468126,2015-05-28,32388235,Jignesh,It was an awesome experience with Lisa in Boston. Friendly and most considerate host I ever saw.

The bed was so comfortable. The food was delicious also with the cookies, muffins and coffee. Thanks for a great stay you two!"
3987926,33845179,2015-06-01,21959239,Sabine,Lisa is so lovely. I felt like visiting a friend. She helped me with anything I needed. It was easy to park the car in front of the house. The house is really nice. My bed was super comfortable. I loved the rustic room. It was nice to meet other travelers in the house. I enjoyed having the free metro ticket. My time in Boston was so great. Thanks for everything. I highly recommend Lisa and her place.
3987926,34039373,2015-06-03,23260513,Joe,Lisa was a fantastic host and the travel cards were very handy. We really enjoyed our stay - thankyou!
3987926,34286109,2015-06-07,29822808,Elizabeth,Lisa and Brian were the perfect hosts - attentive and caring whilst not being over-bearing.
The room is nice and bed is extremely comfortable! My partner is 6 foot tall and had no problems with the bed being too short. Lisa and Brian even left a couple of bottles of water in the room and cookies- much to our surprise and delight.,,,,,
Breakfast is a good selection - toast,muffins,cereals and porridge as well as omelettes (if you feel like cooking).,,,
The local area is quite but there is a fantastic restaurant called Dogwood just opposite the station,definitely recommend the chicken under a brick,santa fe salad and juicy lucy burger. Otherwise it's really easy to get into town- just hop on the t-line for a few stops with the Charlie Cards that Lisa and Brian kindly provided.,,,
Excellent hosts,"lovely room and great location- we would definitely stay again!\"",,,,
3987926,34661495,2015-06-10,28572031,Caijia,"This is easily the best AirBnB experience I've had. Lisa was an amazing host who went above and beyond to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. The entire place is very tastefully designed, the unlimited passes are a definite plus where the public transport network is so extensive and the bus stop is located just right outside her house, which makes getting to downtown very convenient. I strongly recommend her place to everyone and I'm definitely staying here again the next time I visit Boston."
3987926,34975760,2015-06-14,15876575,Aaron,"\"This place was perfect for me and my small family. Two things made our stay especially special: 1) Lisa & Brian are the best hosts we've had throughout our 20+ stays on Airbnb; they went above and beyond to ensure our stay was comfortable, and 2) Related to #1, the transportation -- particularly with the free unlimited passes included -- was super easy and made our stay very convenient; the place is located right by the bus stop that takes you to the metro (the \"\"T\"\")"
Either way,"these two combined made our stay a great one! This place earns our highest recommendation.\"",,,,
3987926,35577021,2015-06-20,32626283,Vi,Lisa was a great host. She's very knowledgeable about the area and made us feel welcome. The house was within walking distance to the subway station so it was convenient for us. We had a great time!

Lisa saw to every possible need (from warm, fresh baked cookies to movies on the big screen and homemade popcorn, to pleasant conversation over breakfast ) she made my kids and I totally comfortable. She even set up a cot for my son to stay on. And the unlimited T passes made our trip soo easy. Thanks so much for a fabulous stay!"
3987926,37734035,2015-07-10,29733252,Patrick,"Brian and Lisa were goods hosts, very helpful."
They have many tips for visiting Boston.,,,,,
"The monthly Pass for public transfer is really good.\"",,,,,
3987926,38266835,2015-07-14,29828726,Hannah,"We felt welcome in Lisa's home from the moment we arrived. We flew into Boston in the morning and she allowed us to check in early. She met us at the door and showed us around. There were many great amenities (Charlie card, light breakfast, coffee, snacks, water, toiletries, etc.). The best thing was the the great advice Lisa gave us on transportation, places to visit, and restaurants. The bus stop right outside the front door was great too, especially with the included Charlie Card! We enjoyed our time in Boston and our first Airbnb stay. We would definitely visit again and stay with Lisa again."
3987926,38894907,2015-07-19,36894411,Ginger,"The friendly hosts promptly answered our pre-trip questions and gave us helpful tips for using Boston public transportation. They provided two “Charlie Card” transportation passes for us to use while visiting. We enjoyed their suggestions for things to do and places to eat around the area. The bed was quite comfortable and the private room had a locking door for privacy. Thoughtful touches included welcome snacks, clean towels, air conditioner and a noise-canceling device for people not used to city living. The den and living room had reliable WiFi, a pet  Australian bearded dragon and eclectic decorations. The bathrooms were clean, well stocked with shampoo/conditioner/soap and featured a nice “rain flow” showerhead. Use of the kitchen is a plus while traveling. Cooking pans, utensils and provided eggs, cheese, milk, bread, cereal, coffee, etc. made breakfast special."
"Lisa and Brian made us feel at home – we will definitely stay with them again next time we visit Boston!\"",,,,,
3987926,39608095,2015-07-25,26541075,Caterina,The stay at Lisa's and Brian's house was great ! We booked four nights in a very cozy bed. We enjoyed getting breakfast in the morning and the passes for subway and bus were convenient! Also Lisa was very helpful about giving information about everything. For example my twin and I turned 21 during our time with them and Lisa told us where to get the first legal drink in the US. It was so much fun !
We love Boston and if we ever come back,we'd like to stay with Lisa and Brian again.,,,,
"Thank you for an amazing time ! We highly recommend this place !\"",,,,,
3987926,39893662,2015-07-26,178509,Marie,"Lisa and Brian made us feel very welcome in their home, which is what I'll remember most about this Airbnb. The layout of their place is spread across two floors within a multi-family building, and on each floor, there is one or two Airbnb rooms. They offer great amenities (light complimentary breakfast/coffee, unlimited T pass, basket of snacks/water in the room, fresh banana bread!) so it feels more like a homey guesthouse/hostel than other Airbnb's I've stayed in."
3987926,40206757,2015-07-29,7238036,Mejin,"Lisa is a wonderful host! Everything is well thought-out, from the breakfast area to the transit passes (super helpful). She provides great suggestions of places to visit, too. The location is convenient - the Orange Line is a 10-minute walk from the apartment, and it takes you straight to the heart of Boston. The neighborhood has a handy co-op market for groceries and snacks. All in all, a fantastic spot for a fun, memorable stay."
3987926,40487807,2015-07-31,36485072,Li,"Lisa was a lovely, sweet guest, quiet and considerate. The house is very  convenient and clean.We enjoyed getting breakfast in the morning and also received subway passed for our stay which was excellent. Lisa 非常的友善和有亲和力,她的房子所处的位子也很方便,而且干净。我们也很感谢Lisa能提供早餐和地铁卡,一次很愉快的体验!"
3987926,41435424,2015-08-07,36444313,Jessica,"Lisa is a warm and very accomodating person. Her house is very charming, organized, and comfortable, and my boyfriend and I had a lovely one night stay there as well as some fun chats with Lisa.  It's situated perfectly, just 10 minutes by foot from the T and sexonds fron many busses.  We will most definitely be coming back on our next visit to Boston!! Thank you for everything Lisa and good luck with your projects!"
3987926,41801148,2015-08-09,35345325,Xuanhui,Lisa is very helpful and made our stay comfortable. The apartment located in Forrest Hill where is the end station of the Orange line. Would recommend to friends who want to visit Boston.
3987926,42217577,2015-08-11,39533411,Susan,"Rented this room for two nights for my 2 daughters (17 and 20). I will leave the details to them in their reviews, but want to note here that everything was above-board and professional. They had no problems getting into their as-advertised room, the breakfasts were generous, the host and hostess were accommodating, and the metro passes were an invaluable perk! Getting to/from the apt from the Forest Hills stop was a little more difficult than anticipated , but this was at least partially due to construction detours. Overall, I would highly recommend this room!"

Her place was only about five minutes from the nearest station, very easy to find. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend."
3987926,44975221,2015-08-30,40290303,Meaghan,Lisa and Brian were amazing hosts! They were so flexible and kind to us. Lisa was willing to push our check out time back to a time that was more convenient for us. The Rustic Room was great for an overnight trip and the house was very close to public transportation and a few restaurants.
3987926,45673558,2015-09-05,38414659,Lillian,"Staying at Lisa and Brian's was a fantastic experience. It was great having been provided with unlimited ride Charlie Cards during our stay and breakfast fixings. The location was convenient with several buses running on the block and a short 5 minute walk to the orange T line. The kitchen was well equipped although we did not have much opportunity to use it during this stay. Lisa went above and beyond to accommodate our needs. She even allowed my daughter to stay in our room during the first of our six nights and set up a cot for her so that she would have a place to stay before moving into the dormitory at her university. When asked bus directions to certain stores, Lisa graciously offered to give us a ride as she felt the stores we wanted to buy some dormitory items for were difficult to get to by public transportation. The house had air conditioning in each room, was clean, quiet, and inviting. I would definitely recommend Lisa and Brian's home and look forward to staying there again on my next trip to Boston."
3987926,46408288,2015-09-10,37511333,Lucas,"Lisa was a terrific and accommodating host! She sent directions from the airport ahead of time which were easy to follow, as well as info about things to see and do in the area. The room was neat and just as described, and I especially appreciated the free transit passes and free breakfast. The location has easy access to the T which made it easy to see sights in the Boston area. I would highly recommend this location for those looking to spend time in the Boston area."
3987926,46611809,2015-09-12,29190294,Hope,My mom and I traveled together to Boston for a quick weekend trip. The city is great! So many fun things to see and delicious food to eat. Lisa was a great host! We had nightmarish megabus delays and didn't arrive until close to midnight. Lisa was nothing but kind and understanding. You won't be disappointed if you stay here!
3987926,46766851,2015-09-13,41428356,Moises,"Lisa was out at the time I checked in (which was a bit later than 2) so Brian welcomed me to my room. He was great, very informative and friendly. Room was spacious with a very comfortable bed. Will definetly try and stay here again whenever I come back to visit Boston."

We enjoyed pretending to be locals for a night, and walking from the house to dinner. The free train passes into the city are a huge bonus with this house. Breakfast was excellent.

3987926,48690551,2015-09-28,17489227,Brigitte,Lisa a toujours apporté des réponses précises à nos questions avant la réservation et la description du logement correspond à la réalité.
"Le logement est proche d'une station de métro ce qui est très pratique pour rejoindre Boston d'autant plus que Lisa remet un pass gratuit pour la durée du séjour.\"",,,,,
3987926,49814088,2015-10-06,14559122,Jennifer,"Lisa's place was great.  The bed was really comfy. It was convenient to get to by train or bus from the train station,  being on the orange  line. That seemed to be the line we used most on our trip.  The bathroom was always clean,  and there was only one time we needed to use it,  but it was occupied."
If you are sensitive to noise,you may ask to stay on the top floor. It's a creaky old house,so you hear people walking upstairs. It didn't bother me,but guests came in at two this am and woke up my boyfriend walking on the creaky floors.,,

Kitchen was well stocked and organized. Enjoyed chocolate chip cookie, muffin and coffee in the morning. Only small drawback is the location which is someway old neighborhood and at the end of subway."
3987926,50485804,2015-10-12,12433489,Grant,"We absolutely recommend staying with Lisa!  The complementary breakfasts were fantastic and the public transportation passes she provided worked for buses and subways!  We felt completely at home, very safe, and well taken care of.

This listing is well set up for the traveler, all needs are anticipated and Lisa provides a generous breakfast offering. Bathrooms are shared, though I never had any wait to access one. And the location to the T and an excellent, local grocery are convenient. Check in and out were easily arranged."
3987926,51150308,2015-10-18,43782698,Hong,Had to go up to Concord on a Saturday. So happen Lisa was headed up to Concord. Hitched a ride. Fantastic! Just part of the warm hospitality.
3987926,51646023,2015-10-22,45051691,Kathrin,"What a great stay! We definitely enjoyed our time at Lisa's place. It was cosy and nice, but the best thing was how much time Lisa took to show us around and provide recommendations. The free transit, the great breakfast, the nice and lovely room and the lovely atmosphere are just a few things that can be named as highlights. I could even do some laundry. We really had a great time and would love to come back. Thanks so much for a wonderful time, Lisa and Brian!"

Lisa è stata un eccellente padrone di casa: all'accoglienza ci ha mostrato tutti gli spazi utilizzabili,la cucina con la zona colazione,il soggiorno comune e presentato agli altri ospiti che soggiornavano insieme a noi in altre camere. Abbiamo trascorso del tempo anche con loro e conosciuto gente un po' da ogni parte del mondo e anche questo è sicuramente un aspetto positivo. Ci ha dato indicazioni,consigli,ed è stata d'aiuto quando ne avevamo bisogno.,
Nonostante la casa sia posizionata piuttosto lontano dal centro,con 10 minuti scarsi di camminata (o 5 minuti di autobus) si arriva al capolinea della metro arancione (una delle linee che abbiamo usato di più) che in 20-25 minuti ti lascia nel cuore della città. Lisa ci ha anche dato due pass illimitati per corse con tutti i mezzi di Boston,cosa che tutto sommato ci ha fatto risparmiare un bel po'!,,,
La stanza è equipaggiata con ogni confort: asciugamani,lenzuola,coperte,snack,merendine,fazzoletti
Abbiamo trovato tutta la casa pulita.,,,,,
Il nostro soggiorno è stato quindi piacevole e senza intoppi,e avevamo tutto ciò di cui avevamo bisogno e anche di più! Consiglierei a chiunque non abbia necessità di stare troppo vicino al centro della città (ed eccessive pretese ovviamente) di soggiornare presso questo Host.,,,,

Her directions were exact,  her Charlie metro card was a great help,  I could commute without stress,  the place was just 10 minutes walking distance from the subway train station, as well as close to  a very good Indian restaurant.  She had very helpful suggestions on what to see,  though I did not have much time. I could easily get a Lyft ride share service to the Logan airport early morning."

She greeted us at the door, showed us the room/home, and let us know she was there for us if needed. The room was clean, spacious, and felt like a room in our own home. They had a mini movie room which doubled as a game room with plenty of games to play. The bathroom was nice neat, and if you love a nice hot shower, you'll love the shower. The kitchen was spacious and clean. She had a list of sites, to see places to eat, and other night life to experience. Our last night she baked homemade chocolate chip cookies that would rival my grandmothers. Over all I give them a 5 star rating. It was a home away from home for us!!!"

Also in the room you can find a list of historical places to visit, recommendations for cafes and restaurants and other tips on how and where spend time in Boston - a complete city guide which helped me a lot. Thank you for CharlieCard with unlimited Bus and Subway rides - this is so amazing that you offer it to guests.

3987926,70682845,2016-04-19,27297432,William,"Really enjoyed the stay with Lisa. I didn't send out the request until the night before and she responded instantly. The place was easy to find. It was clean, and had everything that we needed. Transit was super easy, the CharlieCards that were included helped out big time. It was only about an 8-minute walk to the T station, and in 30 minutes I was right by the legendary Fenway Park. I would recommend her place to anyone looking for a cozy and quiet place not too far from downtown."
3987926,71574760,2016-04-26,68535519,Emily,Lisa was very timely when responding to us about questions we had before booking.  We found the room to be comfortable and inviting and just what we needed. The room comes with many amenities but the only one we took advantage of was the unlimited CharlieCards which give you access to the subway/buses. There's a bus stop directly across the street and the subway station is only an 8 minute walk down the road making it very easy to get to downtown Boston without a car. We found this room to be of great quality for the value.
3987926,71633409,2016-04-27,24919689,Ran,"Lisa and Brian’s place was in one of the best location. 10 mins driving to Harvard Ave - where has plenty of awesome Asian restaurants. We were staying in both Boston room and Rustic room, for 2 nights. Both rooms are fantastic. We would definitely stay there again if we go back to Boston. The street parking was easy, always found a spot. The bed was comfortable as well."

Lisa was an amazing host - always answered messages/texts, she was there to greet us and give us a tour of the home, having breakfast and coffee included was great, and she even let us store our bags at her place after our check out time. The best bonus was the travel passes, they are a must if you're using public transportation while in Boston! Very friendly and accommodating hosts! Definitely recommend."

Her place is accurate to her description.  The bus stops right outside her place and the Charlie Cards she provides for transportation were such a blessing!  She was patient and very helpful with all my questions in person and in text and helped us make good decisions for our stay on places to go, places to eat, and how to get there.  It is a homey atmosphere. It is safe. Bed was comfy.  Shower was wonderful. I didn't use the kitchen but it was available as was the other rooms in the house.  This was my first Airbnb experience and I can't imagine how it could get any better!  The big screen tv was great to watch on one night also.  If I ever go back to Boston this will be my first hope of a place to stay!"
3987926,75375537,2016-05-21,69753179,Yisumi,It was such a pleasure to meet Lisa. She was very helpful with places to check out and places to eat. The room was just what we needed. The transit cards and breakfast was a major plus. My only regret is not staying longer. Cheers

3987926,76256038,2016-05-26,24296300,Haeyoung,"Lisa's Rustic room was great! Description was accurate and even though it was shared bathroom, I loved how our bedroom was right in front of the bathroom; super convenient. Only 10 minutes walk to the nearest subway and FREE UNLIMITED TRANSIT PASS was definitely awesome! Even though we checked out on time, Lisa offered us if we'd like to use Charlie Card (unlimited transit card) for the rest of the day due to next late check-in, we were able to use transit for free ,yet again! Even though we did not get to meet Brian (?!), Interaction was great, place was awesome. Thank you both for providing such a great space and if you come to visit Boston/East Coast again, we will definitely comeback!"
3987926,76470863,2016-05-27,36572218,Antonio,Excellent value and comfortable stay. The subway cards made our stay extra convenient. Lisa is very friendly and great with communication. Expect several other guests since they rent out several rooms.

The transit passes that came with the room were incredibly useful, as was the subway map provided to us by Lisa. You could really tell they enjoyed sharing their home. The room was exactly as described. They went above and beyond to provide us with internet when our laptops gave the WiFi trouble. Lisa and Brian made our first Airbnb experience easy, safe, and absolutely wonderful."
3987926,78960351,2016-06-10,8540727,Ashley,"Lisa & Brian were fantastic hosts! There were chocolates on towels to greet us, in addition to a basket that had 2 water bottles and several snacks. The continental breakfast had a lot of great choices, and I'm glad the hours had a wide range so we could make ourselves breakfast if we had to get up early, or slept in. The bed was very comfy. This house is right on the street, so if you are not used to street noise you might want to bring earplugs. There was a white noise machine in the room & that helped us sleep just fine.  They also provided a guidebook they had made of area recommendations - we tried Ethiopian food for the 1st time @ Blue Nile & it was wonderful! They also had a guest book where previous folks left their tips & recommendations.  I also loved that they had a bearded dragon named Kaiju that you could pet if you asked (He has a WARDROBE.  Prepare for your instagram to blow up.) Lisa & Brian also had a TON of tips about restaurants & attractions in the area, which was really helpful since it was our 1st time in Boston. Combined with everything previously mentioned and use of the free metro cards, we had an amazing stay in Boston for a fantastic price! I HIGHLY recommend staying here, you can't beat the hospitality and the value! Thank you again Lisa & Brian - if we know anyone who is traveling to Boston in the future, we know where to tell them to stay, and we hope to make a return visit in the future!"

The host family was friendly,unobtrusive,and very concerned about my comfort. Kristina made sure to contact me every few days to see if all was well and if I needed anything from her.,,,
The neighborhood is quiet,and a 5-10 minute walk gets you to shops and restaurants. Another few minutes and you could be taking a stroll around the beautiful Jamaica Pond. By car,you are not far from most major attractions.,,,

Very quick and convenient!  Jamaica Plains, which is a short subway ride from downtown,  is great neighbourhood with some very good restaurants and nice places for a drink. The Whole Foods Store was also short walk away which was perfect for filling the fridge. After a couple of days running around town in was nice to be able to just  cook  dinner and kick back in your own cozy apartment.  The kitchen was well equipped with everything you need to cook a good meal.   We'd definitely stay with them again!"
197972,738868,2011-11-22,842613,Nick,"The studio apartment was great, and Chris and Kristina were really nice hosts, easy to contact and even able to accommodate our early arrival time."
We were in the city to check out a few neighbourhoods,and they were happy to spare the time to sit and chat with us about Boston. Their area of JP is lovely,and within walking distance of Centre Street,for restaurants and shops. We used the T to get everywhere,and were glad to make use of the area's on street parking.,
"Thanks again!\"",,,,,
197972,755133,2011-11-29,511867,Andy,"Chris's place is a really great alternative to Boston hotels, which are always $$, or if you just want to stay somewhere homier.  Especially for a longer stay.  Truly is very large studio in excellent condition.  A great value for the price. Pleasant and responsive hosts (though you are not actually sharing a livings pace with them). Places like theirs just make me love Airbnb more than ever!"
197972,769008,2011-12-06,1461540,Jean,"I live in a neighboring town, but my bathroom renovation was not completed on time and so last minute I needed a place to stay for the weekend. Kristina and Chris were very prompt in responding, and their studio was great! Very clean, and the location was perfect for me as it is close to the subway and to a really fun main street of good restaurants and shops (and public bus access). There is also a beautiful pond nearby if you are willing to walk a little."
The studio itself is really cute and convenient. There is  cable tv,modern appliances,and it really felt like a clean and comfortable home. Boston typically is cold at this time of year,so it was also nice that they provide a down comforter.,,
"I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone. Jamaica Plain is a great neighborhood and a quick subway or bus ride into downtown Boston. Thank you Kristina and Chris!\"",,,,,
197972,801301,2011-12-23,1347400,Jacqueline,The appartment is very convenient and in a axelent location. I would recommend staying in here to everyone looking for a place to stat in Jamaica Plain.

I live in the area, and I often walk right by this location, on my way to the shops or the local subway stop for downtown Boston.  I can highly recommend this studio.  Everyone I know who has stayed here loves the place."

Although, we didnt get to meet Kristina and Chris because we were busy with our schedule, they were the perfect hosts, checking in via phone and internet to make sure our stay was going well!  I would highly recommend staying here!"
197972,923698,2012-02-15,1595400,Claudia,"I definitively recommend this studio. Owners are very nice, good location to visit Boston."
197972,962124,2012-03-01,1360786,Elisa,"I absolutely enjoyed staying at Chris&Kristina's studio. I was in the middle of relocating to Boston and I needed temporary housing. This studio provided everything I needed: clean/spacious kitchen, clean bathroom, and sunny/warm/comfortable bed."
Cleanliness and good location are the two most important things I look for when choosing and rating a place and I give both 5 stars for this studio. Keep in mind that I found this JP studio to be in a good location as a person with a car. Nevertheless,I did notice there was a T stop close by as well as buses running at all times that could take right into downtown Boston.,,,,
Chris&Kristina (and their two boys) are wonderful! They have experience hosting people. They respect your privacy and space. While leaving you to do what you came to do in Boston,they will check in-email,phone,or airbnb- to make sure everything's OK.,,
"I highly recommend this place. If I ever need temporary housing in Boston this will be the first place I will look for :). \"",,,,,
197972,997706,2012-03-13,1845815,Jon,We stayed here for three nights and it was wonderful -- clean and neat with a full kitchen and a great shower. The location was also ideal: on a quiet residential street but not too far from a commercial area; accessible by public transportation but also convenient with a car.
Overall,"we highly recommend it and would definitely stay there again. \"",,,,
197972,1017070,2012-03-19,1684729,Chrystelle,"This studio was in a great location. The studio is 5 minute walk to the T and to great shops, pubs and restaurants. It's a 20 minute ride to downtown."
Chris and Kristina were gracious hosts and very accomodating. The studio itself was very clean and cozy and the bed was incredibly confortable! Great place to stay for a single traveller or couple.,,,,,
Would definetely stay here again on a future trip to Boston.,,,,,

197972,1039630,2012-03-25,1619496,Anika,"I greatly enjoyed staying at Kristina and Chris' house, the space was spotless, well taken care of, and had all the necessary things available when I arrived (towels, sheets, maps, password for the wireless connection ...) - there was nothing amiss. I was greatly impressed with how responsive Kristina was to all my emails related to the booking and prior to arrival; this made it really easy to arrange my check in even while the family was out."
The studio is located in a lovely neighborhood,very quiet and almost exclusively residential,so that there is not a lot of traffic. Extra bonuses of the place:  the next metro station (Stony Brook) is a short walk (less than 10 min) away,the train gets you to the city center in less than 20 min; if you walk for 10 min into the other direction you'll find yourself in the center of vibrant Jamaica Plain with access to a number of restaurants of all varieties and price range,stores etc; and close by is the Jamaica Pond - I even went for a run in the morning in the park (with dozens of locals who appear to do that all the time).,
All in all,"staying at Kristina and Chris' place was a great experience and I  would come back any time. \"",,,,
197972,1127117,2012-04-14,1712355,Craig,"This is a really nice place to stay, I couldn't recommend it enough if you are planning a short stay in Boston. I stayed for 3 weeks while working at UMass and shared with my partner for most of the time, so it easily accommodates two people. The apartment is two rooms but has everything you'd need for a stay (there are laundrettes close by as well). The apartment is very light and catches a lot of sun and is spacious enough for only being two rooms (plus bathroom). There's ample kitchen equipment if you are looking to cater for yourself for a while. The further plus point is the location! It is literally 5-7 minutes walk to the Orange line on the T and then 15-20 mins. to downtown and T connections. It is walking distance to Jamaica Plain/Centre St. which is itself an interesting area with restaurants and bars and shops (good Whole Foods store for quality groceries and supplies). It's a nice neighbourhood, leafy and walking/jogging distance to parks and Jamaica Pond. Then the further plus is that it's very quiet at night! The hosts Kris and Chris were always on hand in person or on email and sorted out any issues promptly and gave a lot of good local advice and were welcoming hosts! A really good spot to stay if you are planning a visit to Boston."
197972,1146744,2012-04-18,45276,Ralph,"Kristina and Chris could not have been better hosts. The studio was immaculate and spacious, and is in a great part of town. We loved Jamaica Plain. It's easy to get to the centre of the city but JP retains a unique character and sense of community. The local restaurants and cafes are superb and Kristina and Chris gave us some great tips. They were also very generous in answering all our questions about Boston. JP is the perfect place to stay if you really want to feel part of the city, and Kristina and Chris will give you the sort of warm and friendly welcome that you rarely get in a hotel."

We arrived quite late in the evening and Kristina was there to greet us, explain the area and direct us for groceries and food.  The studio is well equipped and JP a lovely area in itself.  The T is only a 5 minute walk away - about 20 minutes to central Boston.  Having the dishwasher was a nice touch. Good TV and sound system (great British loud speakers!).  We enjoyed our stay very much."

Everything that I would like to say has already been mentioned in previous reviews, but I will repeat some again. Chris and Kristina were excellent. They were quick with their responses and very thoughtful, for example they emailed me a map of the area highlighting the local points of interest, such as shops, T stop, parks, and cafes ahead of time. They had wonderful suggestions, that always proved to be enjoyable. They are pros and we are recommending their studio to all our friends."
Jamaica Plain is such a nice respite from the city. The studio itself is on a residential block which is nice and quiet.  If you want action walk over to Center Street a couple of blocks away where there are many bars,restaurants,"and shops. \"",,,

Kristina and Chris were very responsive,helpful and flexible. We could check-in earlier and check-out later on a day. They left us some very useful notes about shops and restaurants nearby - we tried a few places and they were fantastic!,,,,

Even though we didn’t have a chance to meet in person, Chris and Kristina were perfect hosts.  We experienced some unseasonably cold weather during our visit, and our hosts took it upon themselves to deliver a space heater to the studio to ensure that we would be comfortable.  They also were extremely easy to communicate with during our stay and were very helpful in answering our questions about getting around the city.  The studio itself was immaculate and in a perfect location, just about a 5-7 minute walk to a subway station that conveniently took us right downtown for shopping and all the attractions.

Location: Neighbourhood was beautiful,clean,and quiet. As expected,we did have to take the subway into the city but it wasn't a big inconvenience since the transit system was very reliable. Very small grocery store around the corner but it sufficed for snack and breakfast food. My boyfriend and I had a lovely 6k run that was almost entirely in an expansive (and quite picturesque) park nearby (don't know the name unfortunately).,,
Apartment: Quite small,but clean and well-maintained. For a short stay like ours,the kitchen was just what we needed. We kept milk and leftovers in the mini fridge and all the appliances (stove/oven,dishwasher,fridge,etc) were in great condition. That being said
Hosts: Chris and Kristina were very gracious and friendly. I forgot my iPhone charger and Kristina was kind enough to loan me hers for the week!,,,,,
Overall,"great experience and would certainly return for a short stay in the city.\"",,,,

197972,2729597,2012-10-27,3649479,John,"We received a warm welcome from Kristina. The apartment was spacious well equipped  which fromed a perfect base for our first visit to Boston. A great quiet neighbourhood, easy commute to the city. We were very impressed with the train service."
197972,2759148,2012-10-30,1789244,Sylvia,"We had a very good first experience with Airbnb, thanks to Kristina! Very good communication (fast message response) back and forth! It was our first time being in Boston, and it was a wonderful experience, partly because we had a nice place to rest, and called our home, away from home! The only negative was the arrival of hurricane Sandy, that delayed our departure with a day! Kristine really worked hard to see if we could stay another night in the studio! Unfortunatly for us, her other guests where planning on coming.Kristine called us back later that they had to cancel, and we where able to use the studio for another night! Unfortunatly we had made some other arrangements already by that time. Thanks for all your help Kristine, we really appreciate it. We will definitly try to stay in your studio again, whenever we come back to Boston!"
197972,2830823,2012-11-07,1983467,Séverine,"Extremely nice studio. We could not hope for better, perfect studio (clean, everything that you could need if you want to rest a little in the flat, nice bedroom/kitchen/bathroom just for you) in a so lovely and quiet neighborhood (5 min walking distance to the metro). Perfect if you want to a more friendly place than hotel and if you want to feel at home after daily visits of Boston). I would definitely recommend this place and also because of the interesting price in comparison with city center hotels and some AIRBNB offers! Thank you Chris and Christina.  I missed your neighborhood!"

It is a very convenient location, within walking distance of the \"\"T\"\" and several local shops.  We hope it will be available when we return to Boston as we would stay there again!\""
197972,3012487,2012-12-03,3665813,Patricia,"Super apartment, super location, super hosts! Kristina was always available for assistance but made us feel the apartment belonged to us. A well equipped kitchen & close by organic market made for relaxing mornings over breakfast, and the nearby T station gave us access to all parts of Boston. A definite stay for anyone coming to Boston!"
197972,3136283,2012-12-22,4264109,Ben,"Great little studio for my inlaws, they loved it. We will use again next time they come to visit! Kristina was very helpful and accommodating."

197972,3217749,2013-01-02,1684729,Chrystelle,"Second time staying at the studio. It was as great as the first time. Chris and Kristina are great hosts. The studio is comfortable and has everything you would need. The pubs and restaurants nearby are fantastic. Chris and Kristina left a list of notables in the apartment, we tried a few and they were all well worth the visit. The studio is in a charming neighborhood and a 5 minute walk to the T to bring you anywhere you need to go in Boston within 30 minutes. Truly great place. Definetely recommend!!!"
197972,3296973,2013-01-07,1091637,Noah,"A fantastic place to stay in Boston. My wife and I were visiting for the first time, and the studio was a fantastic homebase for our four-day exploration of the city.  The neighborhood is safe and has a host of great restaurants, bars, (and the Sam Adams brewery) etc. all in walking distance, and the Orange line was a super-convenient five-minute walk away. It was really nice seeing a corner of the city that we wouldn't have if we were just sticking to the traditional tourist spots. The studio itself was clean, very private, and homey, with a nice kitchen and an extraordinarily comfortable bed. Kristina was really accomodating and cheerfully answered our questions.  Would stay here again in a heart beat."
197972,3565589,2013-02-18,3525886,Antonia,"Veyr nice and comfortable studio, tons of light (very nice in winter), ample kitchen which is very helpful if you plan a longer stay. It is 5m. away from the subway and it takes 15m to get to downtown. The neighborhood, Jamaica Plain is full of little restaurants, cafés,  and if you want a bit of exercise you have the Pond. So it is a good mix, a relaxed place but very close to the amenities of downtown. The place itself  is very tidy, clean and well equipped. Kristina and Chris are very good hosts and very considerate. I highly recommend this place!"
197972,3667334,2013-03-02,4586728,Hilary,"What an excellent option for staying in JP!  Kristina was accessible, friendly, and kind.  The studio was just the quiet, clean retreat I needed after long tiring days at my company's main office.  Plus, it is just blocks from the T, and a short, enjoyable walk to Centre Street and all its good food.  I slept well on the comfortable bed and enjoyed eating breakfast in the bright kitchen.  I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in town, and hopefully I'd have more time to cook in that big kitchen!"
197972,3760947,2013-03-12,652973,Sandra,"Chris & Kristina's studio is extremely clean with lots of character in the colorful decor.  We experienced a lot of snow in early March, and one of us was sick for most of the trip, but the studio was a great place to cozy up from the cold.  A little shop around the corner (on the way to the T station) was convenient for coffee, snacks, and veggies, which also helped to make the studio home-y.  Thanks for creating such a great space."
197972,3876488,2013-03-24,3725328,Kathleen,"\"This would have been a 5 but for another New England snow storm and broken car which prevented the owners being there for our stay last week. We became the property caretakers and snow shovelers. I was able to stay in contact with the owners by email and phone and let them know of a few things which were missing or unworkable in the kitchen. These were really minor compared to the great place they provided us. We would definitely stay there again. The neighborhood is terrific - funky, beautiful, safe, and easily accessible to anywhere in Boston via both bus and the \"\"T.\"\" The 39 bus at the bottom of the street took me directly to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Gardner Museum in no more than 20 minutes. \""

The studio itself is very cute - it is well decorated and has great fixtures! The nearby area is fantastic - lots to do in Jamacia Plain: great restaurants, bars, and shops. It is also a 5 minute walk to the Orange Line, which made seeing the rest of the city a breeze. The host was great as well - she gave us a great welcoming and provided info about the area, and then was only around when we needed her - the studio was very private."

The apartment is a ten minute walk to the subway and the subway is a fifteen minute ride to downtown Boston.  Exceptionally convenient.  Little neighborhood grocery stores abound within walking distance of this private second story fully equipped apartment.  Comfortable sleeping for two.  Be careful about parking next to the unmarked sidewalk wheelchair cutouts - they are hard to spot, especially at night.  They also attract tow trucks.  Fun stay.  We'd do it again."

197972,4699610,2013-05-21,1900739,Laurie,Great stay in Jamaica Plain:) This apartment is so comfortable and a great base for touring Boston. It really is a 4minute walk to the subway and about 12minutes on the subway to the downtown crossing. Kristina was easy to get a hold of and communicate with when we needed to. There is a full kitchen with all the amenities too if you need it. Bed is very comfortable with lots of extra blankets and pillows available. Jamaica Plain is also a fabulous neighbourhood to investigate. We would 100% recommend this apartment to friends:)

Chris and Kristina had left us some useful information with recommendation of where to eat and drink in Jamaica Plains, plus there were general Boston leaflets and maps to look at too. The local area has a good selection of bars and restaurants and we can recommend the free Samuel Adams Brewery Tour which is just down the road!"
197972,5111211,2013-06-13,5044796,Daniel,Chris and Kristina's place was wonderful! Very clean and very private. They were very accommodating despite our arrival at an ungodly hour.  Their place is in Jamaica Plain which is in a residential side of Boston. The neighborhood is friendly and safe.  The subway station is maybe a 10-15 minute walk and you can take the orange line directly into the heart of Boston.   This was our first time using Airbnb and I was thoroughly impressed. I would highly recommend staying with Chris and Kristina during your trip to Boston.
197972,5180253,2013-06-17,5999414,Kathy,The studio was perfect for our Boston trip and we loved jp area.  Kristina was helpful and so pleasant to work with. Would definitely stay here again!

197972,5690528,2013-07-12,4073368,Jillian,"Chris & Kristina's studio apartment is wonderful--wish we had one at home like it! The location is good with a subway stop just 5 minutes walk away.  There is an excellent range of amenities nearby, which the hosts had documented in a thoughtful information sheet complete with maps.  (We can recommend the coffee at the City Feed & Supply Store just 3 blocks away!)  The check-in was easy and Kristina had kindly anticipated our arrival on a hot evening by turning on the air conditioner in advance.  There were only two small inconveniences: the WiFi signal was a bit weak although Kristina did try to adjust it and the bathroom louvre doors were a bit temperamental.  We will definitely plan to stay here on our next trip to Boston."

I highly recommend their studio, and if I find myself returning to Boston I will definitely re-book there!"
197972,6457824,2013-08-13,6602624,Patricia,"I recently stayed with my husband at Chris and Kristina's apartment. It was really nice and quiet, and the apartment was very clean. Kristina was extremely responsive and helpfull. She left us a map with lots of recommendations which we followed and enjoyed. We liked the neighbourhood because it was like living the real Boston, not touristic at all!! The metro station is only 5 minutes walk away. I certainly recommend staying at Chris and Kristina's!! There's also a good choice of restaurants and deli's nearby. We would like to thank both Chris and Kristina for their kindness and hospitality."

The space itself is true to the photos, with the kitchen being more spacious than expected. Completely clean and comfortable, with cute stylish furnishing. The neighborhood is very charming and public transportation is mere blocks away, as well as a nice neighborhood park/playground, Whole Foods, cafes, Sam Adams Brewery,etc. We were car-free with an older child and an infant during our stay, and were able to get around on foot quite easily (FYI, we live in a rural area, so are by no means accustomed to having to walk to the store,etc). Kristina and family were on vacation during our stay, but she was always extremely responsive and helpful via text. We truly did not want our stay there to end!"

Full, well stocked kitchen (actually larger than appears in photos), VERY comfortable bed, cosy living area with a fancy tv/sound system and light and airy throughout.  If you're familiar with the area, it's ideal...and if you're not, it's still ideal because it's safe, quiet, close to the subway, w/in walking distance to all JP has to offer including the pond.

All the windows could be opened which was great as we had perfect weather. The kitchen/dining area was, as other reviewers mentioned, bigger than it looks in photos and well equipped. The neighbourhood was very quiet, especially at night, which was amazing when you consider it was only a 5 minute walk from the T and then another 10-15 minutes on it to be right in the centre of Boston. Check-in and communication was very easy and pleasant with Kristina and she was very accommodating when we couldn’t be completely accurate with our arrival time and with our late request to add an extra day to the start of our stay."

Kristina & Chris had prepared some perfect recommendations for restaurants,super markets and other facilities in the near area. But there were also tips for the stay in Boston.,,,,

197972,11364898,2014-03-31,533861,Judy,"a wonderful place and an equally wonderful host. Comfortable, quiet and quaint. Just a nice place to come back home to after a long few days of conferences. . A big thanks for coffee in the cabinet!! Highly recommend and will definetly stay again."
197972,11542168,2014-04-07,12566913,Daniel,"Excelente ,todo bien ,a pesar de la distancia es muy facil llegar a Jamaica Plain .El estudio es muy lindo ,limpio y con buenas comodidades .El lugar muy tranquilo"
197972,11858204,2014-04-17,10727360,GraXioza,Chris and  Kristina's studio was perfect for our stay. It was very warm even if it was cold outside. They even allowed us to check in early. It was very near the T and the neighborhood is beautiful.
197972,12108057,2014-04-23,7364237,Greg And Lisa,"\"Chris and Kristina's place is great! Very clean, everything was as promised, and Kristina was always there when we needed her with helpful tips for transit, restaurants and things to see (or avoid). We loved the area - Jamaica Plain is beautiful - it was very walkable and close to the orange line \"\"T\"\" station. We even walked to the Samuel Adams Brewery tour. I would definitely recommend this to a single person or couple looking for a nice place in Boston. We hope to stay there again if we're ever in the area!\""
197972,12243146,2014-04-27,13110231,Kelvin,"Kristina's place was just perfect for our needs and we had a great stay. We had excellent pre-arrival communication with Kristina, a warm greeting upon arrival, and fantastic insider information about the area (including a map of Jamaica Plain that identified some of the shops and restaurants which was very helpful). The suite was perfect for us (3 adults) with a full and well-equipped kitchen that was separate from the sitting/sleeping area. The house is located on a quiet street in the heart of Jamaica Plain and is just a 5 minute walk to the bus stop (bus #39 that links into the Green Line subway and provides good access to Fenway/Backbay) or the Orange Line subway station (and was a quick 15 minute ride to the centre of downtown).  I would highly recommend this suite and definitely plan to return on our next trip to Boston."
197972,12877292,2014-05-13,8784588,Matt,"\"We didn't meet Chris, but Kristina was very welcoming and accommodating. She even carried my wife's bag up the stairs. There was also no problem with us checking out a little late. The studio had the charm you would expect in an 1860\"\"s house"
197972,12985741,2014-05-16,739824,Katy,"This was a great place to stay! It was on the top floor of a house with its own private entrance, and it was very quiet and well equipped.  The location was absolutely fantastic - walking distance to shops and the Stony Brook T station.  I was traveling by myself, and I felt entirely comfortable walking around the neighborhood after dark.  I also rented a car during my stay and was able to find street parking within about a block of the house.  I would absolutely stay here again!"
197972,13066156,2014-05-19,9053052,Donna,We enjoyed our stay in this roomy studio.   I loved the comfortable bed!   The neighborhood was great--we felt completely safe walking back at night.   The Wirths were great hosts and thought through our needs well as evidenced by how they equipped the studio.
197972,13414596,2014-05-27,12599092,Dean,"We were very pleased with our stay at Kristina's. This was our first AirBnB experience and we are pleased to report it was as expected, if not better. The room is large and spotlessly clean. Comfortable bed and cable tv - can't complain at all! The apartment is in a great neighbourhood, very quiet and close to some great restaurants (Tres Gatos is a brilliant little tapas bar within 5minute walk; Canary Square and equally good SportsBar/ restaurant just across from Tres Gatos). I would highly recommend staying here as we love the fact it is within 10-15mins of downtown, but without the noise/chaos of staying in the heart of the city). Kristina is a great host and made us feel at home. No complaints, great value for a long weekend in the city!"
197972,13844083,2014-06-06,4648426,Laura,"We spent 4 days in Kristinas studio and had a great time. Everything we needed was there (fully equipped kitchen, bathroom, even a huge TV!) and the studio was very clean and comfortable. We only met Kristina once at the check-in, she was nice and gave us all the information we needed."
The neighborhood seemed to be very safe and the next metro stop into the city just 10 minutes away.,,,,,
"We had a very good time and can recommend this studio!\"",,,,,
197972,14078274,2014-06-11,13438043,Jan,"Wij werden bij aankomst 's-avonds gehaast door de verhuurder ontvangen. Het appartement voldoet in grote lijnen aan de eisen voor een verblijf van meerdere dagen. Het appartement is gelegen achter de woning van de eigenaar en de ingang bevindt zich in een andere straat. Het staat in een leuke wijk. Rustige buurt en voldoende privacy. Metro, supermarkt en restaurants op loopafstand. Minpunt is dat er door airbnb was gemeld dat het appartement over airco beschikt, wat echter niet het geval was."
197972,14877287,2014-06-28,129741,Patricia,"Kristina could not have been any nicer, this was a delightful trip all round ."
197972,14963278,2014-06-30,14993751,Molly,"We didn't actually get to meet Chris & Kristina, but they made sure we were comfortable and taken care of during our stay (they even installed an air conditioner mid-weekend, while we were out, since it was so hot outside - very thoughtful).  The studio is quite small but clean and comfortable, and the neighborhood is peaceful and quiet, though just a short walk from the many shops & restaurants on Centre Street."
197972,15441164,2014-07-09,11451466,Anders,"JP and this Studio were really as expected and advertised. The neighborhood is so nice and quiet. Only 5 minutes’ walk to the Subway is an extra plus. My son and I were here for the Red Sox, so, only two stations away and a walk took us to Fenway in about half an hour. The hosts were very accommodating and rapidly quick to respond to any questions we had. A really nice family! We will be back in Boston and would definitely stay here again."
197972,15620705,2014-07-13,7581428,Ami,"My mom and I had a fabulous time here. Kristina was an excellent host. She accommodated our request for early check-in and was reachable by text throughout our stay. The kitchen is very well equipped, the bed is comfy and the shower had good water pressure. This is a great space with lots of windows. We had a rental car one day and it was super easy to find street parking at night."
I would highly recommend this studio if you're in town for at least a few days. However,if you're in Boston for 2 days and want to maximize your time there,I'd think again. While the studio is only a short walk (5 minutes) away from Stony Brook station,the subway (the orange line) was not running frequently at some time of the day,so it took us some time to get to the back bay area. In short,super lovely place
197972,15817698,2014-07-16,2191495,Ghislain,"Host Kristina was very helpful in advices before and during our stay.  Fast responses, a good host. The apartment has all the things that we needed. Since it’s a little out of town, if you’re a first timer in Boston and have no car, I would recommend to see MBTA web site and have a look at the subway system.  Orange, green, red line…  truly not difficult and after that you will be able to visit most attractions in Boston."
So we really enjoy our stay at this apartment.    Enjoy your stay in Kristina’s apartment,enjoy Boston!,,,,

197972,16139109,2014-07-22,17642385,Lauren,"This was my first AirBnb experience. The apartment is exactly as promised. The hosts provided excellent, quick communication. The neighborhood was lovely. Using the train was very quick and easy and it was nice to explore a different neighborhood. Very clean. Everything you need is there. Only suggestion is if wifi is important then maybe not book this place as we had an issue getting on with a weak signal (wasn't important to us anyways). Highly recommend the place."
197972,16339639,2014-07-26,13902789,Aurelie,Séjour très agréable au studio de Kristina et Chris! Toutes les indications nous avaient été donné pour facilement trouver le studio. Ils nous ont spécifié à plusieurs reprises qu'ils étaient disponible si nous avions des questions.

197972,17347241,2014-08-11,1325248,Blake,"We had a wonderful stay in Kristina's studio in JP! Kristina was super responsive and helpful from the day we inquired about booking and was able to accommodate our request to arrive a little early. We live in NYC, so when we come to Boston for vacation we like to stay in JP because it is so relaxing and beautiful while being an easy T ride into the city. Kristina's studio was just that -- the perfect place to relax after spending the day out and about. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here on our next trip to Boston! Thanks!"

197972,21070677,2014-10-11,14797334,Jessica,"Together with my husband we were staying in this studio for 6 weeks. My husband was doing a course at Harvard Business school (Cambridge) and I was doing a research project at Harvard School of Public Health (close to Roxburry and Mission Hill). Basically, you have everything you need in this studio: a well equiped kitchen, a cozy table to sit on, a couch, flatscreen TV, a neat badroom, and even a cozy balcony to enjoy your coffee and the squirrels who visit you once and while."
The neighbourhood is really great  and convenient with parks,shops and the metro station nearby.  Chris and Kristina were really friendly owners and were happy to give you a hand or advise you about where to go or what to visit in Boston.,,,,
"We enjoyed or stay very much and the studio is definitely suitable for both short and long stay Boston visitors.\"",,,,,
197972,21217481,2014-10-13,11460236,Gérald,L'accueil fut agréable et très aidant. La propreté de l'appartement laissait un peu à désirer. Sous le lit l'aspirateur n'a pas dû être passé depuis plusieurs semaines et les barreaux du lit n'ont pas vu de chiffons depuis plusieurs jours.
En conclusion,"c'est cher pour ce que c'est.\"",,,,

197972,28022366,2015-03-16,20471309,Larry,The apartment was actually better than described.  It's more of a two room apartment than a studio.  It was scrupulously clean and inviting.  The bed was comfortable for me and my wife.  Everything one wanted was there where you would expect it to be.
Kristina was welcoming and generous. The location in Jamaica Plain was great for us.  There are no hotels even close,and it let us walk to our daughter's apartment in JP.  Also close to Center Street,a street full of nice stores and very good restaurants. Finally,"the price was VERY fair for what we got.   In all we would certainly want to go back.\"",,

The apartment is in an lovely community of historic buildings, a coffee shop/grocery is directly between the subway station and the house, and the apartment was equipped with everything we wanted to make home meals and to hang out.  Chris and Kristina make you feel welcome and attended to without intrusion, so it feels just like you have a little place of your own in the city.  We will definitely call again next time I travel to explore this fascinating city.  Megan"
197972,30121923,2015-04-18,2001509,Meena & Ari,We felt welcomed warmly and the information provided was all very clear. The neighborhood is quiet. Everything we needed was there. They responded promptly to all our questions. We had a very pleasant stay!

She redirected me and recommended street parking for my boyfriend and gave us great recommendations for local restaurants, coffee shops, and cafés!"
The studio itself was lovely,everything was clean,fresh,and well maintained. My boyfriend and I stayed for two nights and three days and the space was cozy but we never felt cooped-up. The bed is very comfortable and the extra hangers in the closet were a helpful and thoughtful touch. The space heater next to it worked beautifully and warmed up the entire space.,,
It's located within half a mile of several great cafés,restaurants,and little shops,which was lovely. We didn't have the chance to use much of the kitchen but from what we saw it looked nice! The little two-person table was perfect for quick meals together,and the dishwasher spared us handwashing,which was a nice thing not to worry about during a weekend away.
One small note: while there is a mini fridge there's no freezer,which was fine for us but might be good to know for future guests.,,,,
I'd recommend this space to anyone staying in the area,"and definitely book it again in the future!\"",,,,

197972,31589222,2015-05-07,7272478,Jacob,"This is a delightful studio in a quiet part of the JP neighborhood. Everything in the studio is as advertised making for a wonderful stay, but the only thing to know is that there is a very flimsy bathroom door, which is 3 feet from the bed.

Chris and Kristina are very nice and friendly hosts who were really responsive both prior and while our stay. The apartment itself was clean, spacious and offered everything you need for a pleasant stay. Jamaica Plain (JP) is a very nice and quiet area and the nearby subway station (Stony Brook) is only eight stops away from Downtown Crossing  (10-15 minutes).

I really enjoyed the location - Jamaica Hills was beautiful and a little off the beaten path, but we were very close to both the metro station (short ~10 min ride to downtown) and some Hubway bike stations, as well as parks and restaurants. The residence was great too - private entrance, two-person bed and a couch you can fold out into a bed. It worked well for our group (me, my brother and my father)."

197972,42870481,2015-08-16,35667527,Jaime,Great experience. Room is just as described. Photos are accurate. Great area. Food and grocery within walking distance. Downtown Boston short cab ride away. Hosts were available but not invasive. Very helpful to answer questions and provide local insight. Would stay again.
197972,43914779,2015-08-23,2243648,Harvey,We visited our daughter in the area and so did not meet our hosts but the apartment suited our needs well. It would be a little tight for 3 adults. The neighborhood is very interesting with lots of shops on Centre street. O recommend hopping on a Hubway bike there and taking a spin up the Emerald Necklace to the Charles river or taking the Southwest corridor.
197972,44434595,2015-08-26,8922627,Lib,"We had a lovely stay at this little apartment, it's really cosy but also feels light and airy too - pretty much exactly as in the pictures! Our hosts weren't there to meet us personally but left keys and instructions for us to let ourselves in - communication was great and any questions we had were answered straight away."
Lovely chilled out area to wander around. We liked that we were provided with a map marked out with places of interest and good restaurants and cafes - we tested a few out!,,,,,
The only thing I will mention is the bathroom door is a sliding one and there is quite a gap round the edge so depending on how close you are with the person  you are sharing with you may want them to go to the kitchen whilst you use the bathroom! Haha. This may or may not bother some people...,,,,,

197972,46720766,2015-09-13,38595848,Robert A,We were first time Airbnb users and were thrilled with the experience.  I had questions about the Transit system in Boston and Kristina emailed us back right away.  She also kept in contact up until our arrival. Chris and Kristina left the key and their number to reach them if needed.  We met up with them later in the day.  They are very warm and hospitable hosts.  Informing us of a local music festival that was going on in the neighborhood that weekend.  The apartment was perfect.  It has a private entrance and is decorated so nicely.  So many amenities!!!  It really is a home away from home.  They thought of everything.  We will definitely come back!  The people of Jamaica Plain are friendly and creative.  We enjoyed the support of Community throughout the neighborhood.  The stores and restaurants display local artists works.  JP is a beautiful area with classic Victorian homes.  Each one unique.  The area is safe.  We took the train back to the apartment from the city at midnight and felt completely secure walking through the neighborhood. JP is only about a 20 minute ride into downtown Boston from the Stony Brook T station.  So convenient...you can park for free on the streets of JP.  No parking permit necessary.  Hop on the T with a Charlie card ( for only 19.00 for the week)its good on the T and busses.  You can basically get to anywhere in the city and that includes transfers to any of the T lines.  Honestly...the best Boston trip ever!  THANKS

197972,48724872,2015-09-28,40977057,Mariah,"We were very pleased with our first Airbnb experience! The loft was exactly as pictured and Chris and Kristina were fantastic hosts, very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again. Our only complaint was that the wifi was slow and wouldn't always connect."
197972,49240294,2015-10-02,42728066,Samantha,"This was our first experience on airbnb. The loft was great, private entrance, 4 minute walk to the train station and 15 minute ride to Fenway Park. We felt safe walking in the area and there were several great restruants near by. Kristina was great and the space was just what we needed. We would certainly come back."
197972,49517887,2015-10-04,3394127,Jennifer,"Wonderful stay at Chris and Kristina's place.   They were wonderful and fully communicated everything with us before and during the stay.  We arrived very late and they had our instructions and even allowed us to park in their parking spot so we didn't have to find street parking in the wee hours (THANK YOU AGAIN!)   The studio was clean and perfect base for our Boston adventures, it was walking distance to Sam Adams and the T stop was super convenient and easy to get to.   The only thing different from the pictures that was noticeable was the bathroom door was a little less private than pictured - luckily we have been married for awhile and are long past that being an issue.   Overall we glad to make this our home base and we would gladly recommend (and stay here again!)"
197972,50625674,2015-10-13,13969772,Darcy,"We had a very nice stay. The studio was just the right size for my daughter and me. It has a great location to the subway, downtown, and Jamaica Pond."
197972,51714183,2015-10-24,41949904,Erin,"Our experience was great!! After a long day of traveling, Kristina met us at the curb with a smile and a little treat!!! She was very accommodating and checked in with us to see how things were going for us. Our lodging was perfect for the two of us! Just enough space!! A really wonderful experience in a marvelous city with an awesome hostess!"
197972,52098336,2015-10-26,15563286,Lourdes,"Hemos pasado unos maravillosos días en Boston. El apartamento era muy amplio y muy confortable. Estaba limpio tenía todo lo que podíamos necesitar. Incluso detalles como un mapa del barrio con localización de tiendas, restaurantes, etc. Sin duda volveríamos allí si volviésemos a Boston"
197972,53374010,2015-11-08,46807327,Richard,Clean. Spacious for one or two. Convenient to a great Boston neighborhood where I was visiting family. I'd stay again.
197972,54939066,2015-11-25,7518892,Peter,"Wonderful experience! The privacy and location were exceptional. The apartment was immaculate, comfortable and exactly what I was looking for."
197972,55529313,2015-12-01,49816929,Alexander,"Great stay! Chris and Kristina were extremely responsive before the stay, and they made sure we had everything we needed when we arrived. They were very responsive if we needed anything during the stay, but otherwise didn't bother us at all! The place was great and we would definitely stay again!"
197972,55845053,2015-12-06,15013963,Dana,"We--my husband and our 4 year old-- visited Jamaica Plain, and wanted to stay in the same place as last year, as it is perfect --good location in JP, great kitchen, cozy and clean. Thanks alot Kristina and Chris (we have not met them yet!)."
197972,56813770,2015-12-18,50855558,Ryan,Chris & Kristina were very welcoming and were ready to help with whatever I needed. The space is simple but complete and was perfect for my needs. The location is great - very close to the T and an easy commute downtown. I will definitely stay again if the need arises and would recommend the apartment to anyone visiting JP.
197972,60072106,2016-01-18,44461469,Karen,"This apartment was exactly as advertised.  We came in late at night, were told where to find the key and where to park.  The apartment has everything you would need for a stay in Boston, very clean, full kitchen, very cozy place.  We would love definitely come back."
"\"",,,,,
197972,63886987,2016-02-28,24421318,Michelle,"Kristina was a lovely host, greeting us when we arrived and even recommending restaurants to us. She was also efficient and helpful whenever we came across any problems. The studio was exactly as described, and was very comfortable for the month that we stayed there."
197972,68129250,2016-04-02,11614937,Linda,"My daughter & I stayed here for two nights while visiting colleges & touring Boston for the first time.  The location was great, as we were able to park our car & then use the T to easily get in & out of town.  It was extremely convenient to Northeastern University (two T stops).  The place was  just what we needed and fairly comfortable.  The double bed was comfortable, but the pull-out sofa was basically just cushions on the floor, so not as comfortable for my daughter.  Otherwise it was well equipped with everything we needed and we enjoyed the big-screen TV & the DVDs provided!  We didn't get a chance to explore the neighborhood too much, but it was an easy walk to the T station and we enjoyed seeing all the beautiful homes in Jamaica Plain.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to leave the car behind & explore Boston by T and by foot!  We will stay here again if my daughter ends up going to college in Boston!!"
197972,69304520,2016-04-10,5130089,Lauren,"Overall we had a great stay at this studio. We didn't spend very much time there and didn't utilize the kitchen, but location was very convenient for our needs, and the space was clean and organized. The check in and check out was extremely easy, and Kristina was flexible. Side note- I wouldn't recommend using the pull out sofa as an extra bed if you're coming with multiple guests, it did not seem very clean or inviting. Glad my sister and I didn't mind sharing the bed (which was both clean and comfortable)!"
197972,69768651,2016-04-13,6166448,Freddie,"My stay at Kristina's studio apartment was lovely and as described. We never met our hosts but they were super accomodating (including letting us check in early) and promptly responsive to questions we had. I used to live in the neighborhood and it was a great spot for a homebase for this visit, for both walking and public transit. Thanks for the great stay!"
197972,70217584,2016-04-17,56849580,Karen,"Nice little place.  Very conveniently located with a short walk to the T, and only a few more blocks to the Sam Adams brewery (free tours - and free beer!).  Kristina was there to greet us.  She couldn't have been more gracious, allowing us an early check-in and ready to answer all our questions, then checked on us during our stay to make sure we were comfortable, bringing us whatever was needed, even a new pull-out bed!  My only con is that the bathroom is far from private, with just a folding closet door between you and the bed, and a very small shower.  But it's very clean with lots of amenities - microwave, small fridge, full kitchen with plates, cutlery, pots, etc, even coffee and tea in the cupboard (loved that!), iron and ironing board, hangers, and blow drier.  Thank you, Chris and Kristina, for allowing us to share your studio."
197972,71023929,2016-04-23,16942052,Silvia,"My husband and I were very satisfied with our one week stay at Chris & Kristina's studio in Jamaica Plain. The studio was perfectly comfortable for us; it was just like the pictures indicate. Very well illuminated, a lot of windows. The kitchen very big and I loved cooking there. Chris and Kristina were extremely helpful. They answered instantly our questions through email, and solved some small inconveniences immediately. Kristina, with whom we had most of our contacts, is very efficient and it is glad to have someone like her as a host. The neighbourhood is great, very nice to take long walks, to the pond, to the arboretum; even to go walking to the supermarket and to the T station was a pleasure. Connection with downtown was perfect through the T or through the bus 39."
197972,71473659,2016-04-25,66286990,Hakim,I would defiantly recommend staying here if visiting Boston. Beautiful neighborhood with friendly neighbors and a great host. Comfortable and homey better then most hotels I stayed in 5stars for me
197972,72285848,2016-05-01,7533709,Susan,Everything was perfect for our stay. The studio was just as described and provided a  quiet and private place for us away from the intense activity of a new baby's arrival and non-stop movement of our two year old grandson. We were able to refresh and regroup each night for another day. We would happily stay there again. Kristina & Kris were super hosts.
197972,72931891,2016-05-05,41072708,Lisa,This was a great place. I used to live in the neighborhood years ago and this place was ideally located within walking distance to the great restaurants and shops on Centre St.  in JP and the Stony Brook T stop.  The apartment was set up wonderfully with everything my 8 year old son and I needed to be comfortable.  Also loved the autonomy and convenience of check-in and check-out. Thank you!
197972,73621242,2016-05-09,256408,Laura,"Kristina and Chris were great. My parents and brother came in from out of town for a graduation and my house was too small, so they stayed here. It was perfect, with a big kitchen and cozy bedroom. They were very flexible and understanding of first-time Airbnb-ers. Would recommend to anyone coming to Boston and wanting to stay more off beaten path, or near family/friends in JP."
197972,75858246,2016-05-23,23655878,Xuping,Great location. Lovely neighbourhood. A chill place even for three adults.
197972,76760198,2016-05-29,2831087,Alvin,Kristina was very accommodating and she let us leave our bags in the apartment before check in time so we can wander around the city.  The neighborhood is quiet and it made us feel like we were Boston residents rather than tourists. Its an upstairs unit and I'm glad we packed light because it would have been difficult to carry a heavy luggage up to the apartment.  The place is clean and has cable TV which enabled us to watch the Warriors game. We were there during the hottest day of the year and needed AC but had issues that was later resolved which we are grateful for.  The place is comfortable and spacious and we liked the sofa bed. We would stay here again and would recommend Kristina to future guests.
197972,77816493,2016-06-03,7608351,Ekaterina,"We loved staying at the apartment. Kristina is a fantastic host! She was very helpful and nice. She gave us a lot of useful information. The apartment itself very comfortable and beautiful. The kitchen is big enough and there is everything you need to cook. Tv, Internet all functioned well."
"Subway is near the apartment. \"",,,,,
197972,78436445,2016-06-06,69555297,Deb,Chris and Kristina were great!   This was our first AirBnB experience and I am so happy it was with them as it couldn't have gotten us off to a better start.  Their studio was perfect for our needs and we loved their neighborhood which is full of unique and beautiful homes.
197972,79351271,2016-06-12,70252395,Angela,"This studio is great...clean, comfortable, convenient, quiet, and in a safe neighborhood. It was my first airbnb experience and proved to be an excellent choice. I hope it will be available when I make future trips to Boston."
197972,80087023,2016-06-16,35461449,Eileen,Chris and Kristina were wonderful hosts. The neighborhood and the apartment were just as they described.  The neighborhood has so much character and the small walk to the subway station made it super easy to get in and out of downtown Boston.  We highly recommend it and would certainly come back!
197972,80362252,2016-06-17,51386492,Joannis,"This is a great place to stay. Quiet and really lovely neighborhood, about 5 minutes walk to the Metro that brings you in 15 minutes to Downtown Boston. The studio itself was very clean and equipped with everything necessary. Chris and Kristina are perfect hosts, the communication before and during our stay was easy and uncomplicated. Wenn really enjoyed."
197972,81239233,2016-06-21,1224400,James,I arrived late after the Red Sox game and Kristina and I discussed that she would leave the key in the mail box for me because she would be at her sons game .
"The key was In her mail box with a nice welcome note and a map to the room around the house above the garage .\"",,,,,
197972,82699503,2016-06-28,69584290,Louise,"This was a great place for us.  Chris and Kristina made us feel welcomed and also had books and dvds specifically for our child.  Excellent location, including proximity to bus and subway.  It is centrally located in the nice part of JP.  It was easy to get to all the restaurants and stores."
197972,84970571,2016-07-10,59750228,Valerie,"Chris and Kristina were great hosts! They were very easy to communicate with, and provided plenty of information  to help us navigate the area. Their recommendations for nearby restaurants were great! They checked in occasionally while we were in town to see if we had questions, but gave us our own space and privacy at the same time."
The apartment is exactly as described. The kitchen has the basic amenities you'd expect and want. The apartment was very close to the T stop,making it easy to get around Boston. The neighborhood is very walk-able and full of excellent restaurants. The nearby Jamaica Pond is a great place for a walk or jog!,,,,
"We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others!\"",,,,,
197972,85561233,2016-07-12,10489117,Rusulenni,Chris and Kristina we super accommodating and easy to contact. Responded very quickly to my request. This home was super cozy and close to everything. Walking distance to the T and so close to everything JP has to offer.
197972,86843072,2016-07-17,80554390,Caroline,Although I did not get to meet Chris and Kristina they were perfect hosts! They left the key for me with directions to the entrance of their loft; which is absolutely amazing for a nice little getaway. I am familiar with the area but they did have directions for certain locations around Boston which was awesome. I would definitely stay at their place again if need be!!
197972,87789835,2016-07-21,22611313,Ian,"Happy with the experience, the studio is a stand alone in a quiet neighborhood with public transportation close by. Kristina was great and allowed us to check in a little early since we arrived a little early. Didn't use the amenities much outside of the WiFi, A/C, and bathroom, all worked just fine. Only negative was the Yankee house key that drew the ire of the security staff at Fenway:-)"
"Would definitely consider staying here again next time when visiting Boston. \"",,,,,
197972,88922622,2016-07-26,2776826,Laurie,Our experience was wonderful! Super cute and just the right size. Great location in JP!

197972,91501431,2016-08-05,25787920,Barbara,The studio was just as described - very private and comfortable and really close to public transportation but yet a great neighborhood.
197972,92311792,2016-08-08,36181767,Alessandro,"I was staying at the apartment with my girlfriend for 2 nights while we were visiting Boston. At our arrival everything was clean and the apartment was just as described. The cons are that the shower is really small and it's nearly impossible to shower without getting your hair wet, which is really annoying especially for women. Also the furniture is a little worn. Nevertheless we felt comfortable and enjoyed our stay in Boston. I would recommend the apartment to everyone searching for a cozy stay in a really nice neighbourhood!"
197972,93351007,2016-08-12,42914991,Olivia,We had a fantastic two days staying in Boston. The apartment was perfect and had everything we needed and then some! Excellent location with a short walk to the T line providing quick transport into the city and Fenway Park. Thank you so much- we hope to return again one day!
197972,93630834,2016-08-13,62540194,Lisa,"We stayed at Chris and Kristina's studio for 2 nights with my family (3 adults + one baby)  and we found the place wonderful: very convenient, very clean, cozy and welcoming. The kitchen was very well equipped. Our hosts were very nice and flexible for arrival time and departure. The subway station is very close by and convenient. We loved the neighborhood. We would certainly go back next time we go to Boston."
197972,94615075,2016-08-16,726201,Katherine Lee,"the host was very flexible as my schedule changed more than once.. the neighborhood is safe and comfortable for a woman traveling alone: the rooms clean and lots of windows for air and light : plus air conditioning , which is a must have in the summer in  Boston.   The bed is just the right firmness. I loved the JP neighborhood and the lake."

She even gave me life advise. Especially as a international student, I had excellent experience in Boston thanks to her. The location of the house is not bad at all. It's easy to get to downtown Boston using public transportation."

She even gave me a backstage tour in the Boston Opera House, which was an unforgettable experience. Bond, her dog, is such a precious soul. The room and the bathroom was nice and clean, and the house itself has lots of characters. Bus stops are just 2 minutes walk away, which connects to MBTA stations and afterwards it is very easy to get to anywhere in Boston. I highly recommend Eliza's place!"

It's not far from downtown and is easy to walk around, The house is beautiful and organized and the neighborhood is really calm, the bedroom is huge and very cozy with a lot of blankets and pillows.

9383459,60126933,2016-01-19,18219588,Haylee,"Eliza was a phenomenal host! She was super accommodating and friendly and the house is just amazing. This was my first time to Boston and I felt so much at home and traveling by myself wasn't as intimidating as I feel it would have been had I stayed in a hotel or hostel. The area is easy to navigate, about a 15-minute uber ride downtown."
9383459,60354413,2016-01-22,10920148,Veena,"Eliza was a perfect host, she made sure I had everything I needed and was comfortable.

The room itself is comfortable and the desk is convenient. The blinds let one black out the room at night and let in a good amount of light during the day.,,,,,
The neighborhood is normal and feels safe. There are food places right around the corner,open pretty late. The Red Line is an 18 minute walk—longer than I expected.,,,,
"Unfortunately a little mouse visited my room in the night. Eliza recommends not keeping any food out and I absolutely endorse that sentiment. Keep it all in the kitchen.\"",,,,,

The location was pretty good,with public transportation. It is required to walk 15-20 to the nearest Andrew red line subway station that I used. This is an good place to stay. The one thing that I've still blame myself is the fact that I have broken the hanger for towels in the bathroom. In spite of the fact Eliza has understood me and got into my situation. Thank you very much for warm welcome and understanding!,,,,
"The one thing that I've noticed it was just a little cold tonight there. But there were the coldest days in Boston.\"",,,,,

Coming from a small town it was a boon to have her experience to draw from! Our accommodation was exactly as had been presented, and was a wonderful place to chill out away from the bustle of Boston proper."

She is honestly one of the funniest and sweetest people you will ever meet and I highly recommend staying with her to everyone.

The house is beautiful and not far from the city at all. I highly recommend staying here!!"

Right from picking us up at the train station to the moment we bid good bye, Eliza was extremely welcoming and gave us an amazing company :) Her house is fabulous! Really unique with a world of its own and Eliza happily shared with us the interesting history of the house. Her dog, Bond is sweet and very friendly too! Also, the location is not too far from downtown, easily connected by public transport, though for the 3 of us Uber was convenient and affordable too. Highly recommend staying here :)"
9383459,74478109,2016-05-15,32689185,Gretchen,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Eliza's place for a weekend. The house is beautiful and very unique. It's nicely secluded, has a lovely garden outside and the cutest dog inside. The bedroom is a good size and the bed is comfy. Also, the shower pressure was amazing. Location is also convenient - it's a quick bus ride downtown. Eliza is very helpful and generous. We were glad we got to sit and talk to her for a minute among the busy weekend."
9383459,75167926,2016-05-19,7183358,Bruce,"We had a marvellous time in Boston - Eliza was a very accommodating host providing us with clean facilities, travel info and personal experience. Her knowledge of local history was very helpful in making decisions on what to look at.  Public transport from her house was easily accessed. We thank Eliza for making our stay memorable."
9383459,75733795,2016-05-22,28776825,Jenny,"Although my flight was delayed 5.5 hours which made me arrive to Eliza's at nearly 3AM, Eliza was very accommodating and super helpful when I was sleep-deprived and having trouble finding her place. While I was out most of the time exploring Boston, Eliza was always responsive to my texts and questions and did her best to make my friend and I feel at home. It was also super easy to get to downtown Boston from her home with a short Uber ride."
9383459,76203498,2016-05-25,8287275,Dave,"Eliza is a very helpful, warm and generous host.  She made me feel welcome, answered my many questions about public transport and places to eat in detail, and even lent me a Charlie card to use.  I had space to myself when I wanted it and company with her when I wanted it.  All in all a wonderful host."
She lives in a very multicultural working class neighborhood of South Boston in an old rather interesting uniquely constructed house with multiple levels and winding corridors.  My room was simple and comfortable  with a large desk area and a double bed.  There is a considerable library on the main floor which I was welcome to borrow from so I had a good book to read at night.  I had access to her refrigerator and was welcome to prepare my meals in her kitchen.  She allowed me to use small quantities of items like cooking oil,spices,milk for cereal,etc.,,
"I can recommend a stay with Eliza for anyone who is happy to stay in a modest friendly home.\"",,,,,

This is a lovely home. Very comfortable and extremely interesting with all the antique bric-a brac and incredible garden.  It's a lovely island amidst a pretty rough neighborhood. It only takes a handful of homeowners like Eliza to get the ball rolling to reclaim an area.  I didn't meet Eliza as she was away visiting her mother,but her house/dog sitter Devin was very helpful,,,,

Das Zimmer war genau so wie angegeben,klein aber sehr gemütlich. Die Nachbarschaft war nicht gerade die Beste,aber Anbindung an die Öffentlichen war sehr gut,sodass man nichts zu befürchten hatte. Das Haus ist sehr alt und leider hatte ich in meinem Zimmer eine Maus,Eliza hat aber 2 Zimmer zur Verfügung,wodurch ich Gottseidank in einem mausfreien Zimmer nächtigen konnt- dies war aber leider kleiner
9383459,94588680,2016-08-16,44001604,Thomas,Wir wurden schon erwartet und herzlich begrüßt.

The host was friendly and accommodating, he responded quickly to any questions and messages. Unfortunately the apartment was not very clean, although we stayed in the middle of the holiday season, which is a very busy time, so perhaps this is why."

The location of the apartment is perfect for many things to do in Boston (and convenient to a T stop, for access to many more).  It's a small studio apartment, but I only needed a place to sleep, so it was perfect.  (P.S.--The water pressure in the shower is fantastic.)"
2108738,31387820,2015-05-04,2538710,Julia,Tom's apartment was great and very welcoming. The location was perfect too. Tom was very friendly & got back to us quickly. We highly recommend staying here!
2108738,32173242,2015-05-15,3788832,Emily,The location and architecture of the apartment are fantastic. Set at the back of the building away from street noise in an exclusive neighbourhood. The subway and Fenway Park is a 5 minute walk in one direction and the great shopping in Newbury Street is 5 minutes the other way.
Tom was a very responsive host and answered all queries speedily.,,,,,
Our stay in Boston was great but the apartment standards were disappointing. The host lives here when there are no guests and the level of cleanliness and basic things like hanging space and useful local information were severely lacking. I hope that some of our visit money is invested in a professional cleaner. The bed and sofa were also EXTREMELY uncomfortable,the mattress had no support and creaked so loudly you couldn't even turn over.,,,,
"I have left detailed feedback for the host so that hopefully the next visitor can experience the apartment with the potential it has to be fabulous.\"",,,,,

Parking is tough but we actually lucked out and found meter parking right on street in front of apartment. Don't count on that though. Two of us in apartment.  The apartment itself is fine but really really needs a deep cleaning. It is a bachelor pad and kinda has that aroma to it.   That's really my only negative. It needs a scrubbing.Otherwise great location, pretty building and otherwise fine."
2108738,36641165,2015-06-29,33257852,Noelle,"Tom was a wonderful host and I really enjoyed my stay at his apartment. His place is clean and cozy and prime location for everything, my favorite being a short walk to shops and Boston Common. Tom was very prompt when answering any and all of my questions, he left the key exactly where he said it would be, and he gave me a bunch of suggestions when I told him what I like to do. He also left a little note for airB&B-ers with his favorite coffee shops and restaurants which was very thoughtful. I would highly recommend staying here if you are coming to Boston! :)"

2108738,59489996,2016-01-11,27862361,Stephany,"I could not have a picked a better location than Tom's apartment for my stay in Boston. It was my first time visiting the city and the apartment is in walking distance to almost everything you would want to see in Boston. Restaurants, shops, and landmarks are only minutes away by foot. The apartment was in a great neighborhood and very spacious for 2 people and it can easily accommodate a third/fourth person.  I would stay here again and I would definitely choose this over the hotels."
2108738,83001854,2016-06-30,6545916,John,Tom is a fantastic host at this great location. He's very responsive and the place is terrific for a Boston visit!
2108738,90246934,2016-07-31,30011554,Gwyn,"The apartment was central to the Boston, just around the corner from the green line which makes the location ideal. The apartment itself is in an older building. The tall ceilings make it ideal in the summer because it keeps it cooler without AC, but because the apartment is older it was difficult for me to open the windows and set up the screens since they stuck or didn't close all the way. The space itself is enough for one person for a longer stay, although the kitchen is very small and could be better stocked with utensils and such. Most of Tom's belongings are being stored here, so there is not much space to put your own belongings. The bed was soft but shook a bit when getting on and off."
Overall,a good place to stay if you are only here a short time,"or for a longer stay is ideal if you plan on going out into the city often. Tom is very friendly and easy to communicate with.\"",,,
2108738,92254985,2016-08-08,22577752,Antti,This apartment has great location such next to subway and Newbury street. It's also very close to MIT and you find convenience store behind the corner. There are also many restaurants nearby.
"This place has great value.  The studio do what is supposed to do. It's not too fancy but it's quiet and clean. You can watch tv and Internet works well. I would stay here also in the future. And Tom communicated very well before and during my stay. \"",,,,,
2108738,93330656,2016-08-12,5243841,Michelle,Tom's place was an excellent location in the Back Bay Area. Place was clean and nice to stay in our own little studio.

Tom's was very responsive and helpful during our stay.,,,,,
Unfortunately our stay has been ruined by the terrific conditions of the apartment which was not clean at all and not very functional. The kitchen and the refrigerator were particularly obscene (and we just couldn't use them),the towels in the bathroom were dirty and still wet,there was a huge quantity of sand hidden under the carpet,the trash was full,we found hairs on the linens and there was no space four our belongings (Tom lives there and the apartment is full of his own belongings).,
For our trips we are used to stay in airbnb apartments (our own is on airbnb during the summer period) and never find one in these conditions.,,,,,
We immediately informed Tom who apologized several times and paid back the cleaning cost (it seemed that the cleaning service didn't clean the apartment before our arrival),,,,,
It's a real displeasure for me writing such a review because I think that Tom is a great person but his apartment's conditions really ruined our stay.,,,,,
Nevertheless,if clean and with some free space for the guests' belongings,"I definitely recommend his apartment.\"",,,
8552338,50868355,2015-10-15,14582406,Alexandra,"The House was very big, the room was nice and the arrival was no problem at all, as Marlene left us a letter with the key and a very well organized description and map of the house. Unfortunate the sheets were just ready from the dryer when we arrived, later then planed. So if we would've arrived earlier like planed, we couldn't lay down as the bed wouldn't be ready."
The people in the house were very nice and very welcoming!,,,,,
Unfortunate it didn't say in the listing how many people live in the house and when we arrived there were about 8 people in the house,which is a lot. Therefore the kitchen wasn't as clean as shown in the listing and the house little messy unlike in the pictures. It didn't bother us too much,because we understand of the situation,although for the room price we would rather be comfortable cooking in the kitchen.,,
My reason for a poor grading is the invasion of privacy,when they moved a table into our room during our Absence,which we didn't like at all. I could have private things or bras laying around. Another incident was; kind of waking us up as we slept in,because the room owner needed something from her room and asked if she could look for it cuz she couldn't leave the house otherwise.,,

3601254,17127839,2014-08-07,18968755,Nathan,The room was quiet and the location was nice.  Good place to stay for a night or two in Boston.
3601254,17241497,2014-08-09,7157116,Alyssa,"\"This little studio was wonderful! Perfect location, nice and sunny, and very cozy. I would highly recommend staying here. Bernie was also extremely efficient in answering any and all questions I had and got back to me within hours. One word of advice - the \"\"kitchen\"\" here is quite small"
3601254,17856795,2014-08-18,18343232,K,"While this was our first Airbnb stay, we regularly travel."
This was our worst lodging experience EVER.  Airbnb sent an email in advance asking to confirm w/ Bernie as host.  We did and also asked 2 questions about early check-in and/or a place to leave luggage.  In the only email from Bernie,he said the check-in was at 12 noon.  Bernie failed to respond in advance of the stay to the 2 emails (8/8/14,8/12/14) and 1 voice mail message on 8/15/14.  We also sent an email on 8/15 to the Airbnb Help Center marked “urgent” – since we never heard back from our host – but we never heard from Airbnb.  Therefore,we made multiple efforts,including on the day of check-in to raise concerns.  Had Airbnb responded,we would've relayed lack of cleanliness and that the room was not as described.
At the office we were told check-in was at 2pm and not noon.  The person at the desk inferred we were lying until the email from Bernie was found that clearly said noon.  This was insulting.,,,,,
In addition to the poor attitude and poor customer service to even gain entry,the room was definitely not as described in both the narrative and the photos.,,,,
1.Kitchen: The kitchen was disgusting,unusable and a public health hazard.  It consisted of a few appliances wedged into a sliver of a closet (photo).  There was black mold along the sink edges,and back of stove (photos).  Cockroach/vermin droppings were found in the cabinet above the refrigerator (photo).  Pots/pans in this cabinet were filthy (photo).  Kitchens typically have a coffee maker - none here.  Toaster was wedged onto an upper shelf of a closet,next to a hammer and stained pillows (photo).  Noone would ever consider cooking or eating anything in this room.,,
2.Room itself:  There were long hairs on the bedspread and futon that were visible.  Was this room really cleaned?  Room overall not as described – no usable kitchen; dirty,unsafe,and public health hazard.,,,
3.Safety: hanging power strip w/ cords (photo).  This is a fire hazard,period.,,,,
4.Bathroom (photo):  The picture hanging on the bathroom wall had a wad of dust on the picture frame.  How long was this here getting bigger and bigger?  The room was allegedly cleaned immediately before we entered – if this bundle of dirt was there – what else wasn’t clean?,,,,,
5.Building Security: In the morning,we found that the front door,that requires a key to enter,was propped open with a stack of newspapers.  This defeats the purpose of needing a key it is quite easy for anyone to just walk in.,,
We paid $286.00 for what we were led to believe was a studio apartment with a kitchen that included a cleaning fee.  The kitchen was not usable as described above and the place was not only filthy but contained black mold,vermin droppings and hazardous safety conditions.  Therefore,we are owed a full refund immediately.,,,

We would rent this apartment again."
3601254,20390064,2014-09-28,21108660,Jeff,The listing was exactly as described. Perfect location for a weekend getaway. Host was very easy to work with and had no problem accommodating our late arrival. Its definitely not a luxury hotel but that's not what you are paying for here.

If you are expecting a full kitchen - this is a hideaway smaller kitchen that I probably wouldn't use.  Not a big deal for us because we eat out on vacation typically to try out the local yummy food!
3601254,20953784,2014-10-08,2018298,Andrew,Bernie was always easy to reach and made check in and check out a breeze.   If you are going to Boston on a budget I would definitely recommend staying in this location.
3601254,21042208,2014-10-10,12417751,Vicky,"I didn't see Bernie, so I can't evaluate him as a host. The department is good but small, just for two nights max. The only thing is that he didn't answer the mails until the next day."

The location is awesome,nice and quiet street,"close to downtime around 15 minutes walking. Bernie responds quickly and everything was ready on time. Little detail would be the bathroom that was not super clean but it was not that bad neither.\"",,,
3601254,21464062,2014-10-18,2006876,Lina,"Instructions for getting to the office to get the keys were straightforward. The neighborhood was great, safe, and so convenient to the wonderful sights of Boston. The bed was comfortable and the shower worked well. Other than that, it was a bit dirty, outdated, and the stove needs to be replaced. There was no place to hang towels in the bathroom, which is not good in a humid climate. There is really no working place in the 'kitchen' and no place to put dishes after washing them. The plug in situation was scary with an extension cord hanging off the fireplace mantle with several things plugged into it. A cord snaked under part of the carpet. The cabinets in the 'kitchen' were worn out and/or never cleaned inside. This did not inspire us to actually use them for food storage."
3601254,21741066,2014-10-23,239233,Eric,"The apartment was as expected per the airbnb reviews.  But everything worked (wifi, TV, refrigerator, coffee maker).  Plenty of hot water for the shower.  OK budget value based on the condition of the apartment (so-so) but worth it for the great location."
3601254,21944912,2014-10-27,11530387,Philip,Host was away and we had an email to inform us to pick up key from another address. This meant one of us had to wait with the luggage in the dark and rain as there was no one at the listing nor shelter. We feel that this was unprofessional as we were left on our own to negotiate the room and it's facilities.
3601254,22295032,2014-11-03,14945326,Francisco,"Excellent apartmente and service. This is what i call A+. I am 24 and went with my girlfriend on vacations to boston. We wanted a place near everything and well kept. This was it. It has everything: Bed, Wifi, Microwave, Fridge, Coffe Maker, TV, Work Desk, Bathroom, Stove, Sink, Utilery(Fork, Cups, Plates). It was very comfortable and private. It is 5 blocks away from a shopping mall prudential and shopping street newbury st. Also close to subway station. I would definitely stay here again!"
3601254,22403904,2014-11-05,20983122,Michael,"This place is great!! The pictures really don't do justice on how large this apartment is, it has crazy amounts of closet space and is SUPER close to the subway (took about 20 min to get to union sq). Bernie was very easy to get a hold of and a really nice guy. My friends and I were all coming in at crazy times of the day and had no problem getting keys at any time!! Highly recommended!!"
3601254,22647763,2014-11-11,14904358,Diana,Nice apartment in a an awesome location! Would definitely stay here again.
3601254,22892223,2014-11-17,22009572,Michael,"The studio was pretty much what we expected from the photos and from previous reviewers. There was plenty of space for my wife and I, though definitely a 'no frills' kind of experience. for the price and location, I would do this again for sure. Not the cleanest bathroom, but all in all the space met our needs and we had a great trip to Boston."
3601254,23453587,2014-12-01,16980190,Marie,"Vrai galère pour récupérer les clés, nous avons dû tourner en rond 2 heures avant de les récupérer car la personne ne répondait pas au téléphone et ne nous a pas indiquée l'adresse de rdv dès le début!"
Le quartier est vraiment sympa,calme et safe,proche de tous les commerces et dans un des meilleurs et plus beaux quartiers de Boston!,,,
L'appartement en lui même est convenable malgré les problèmes pour allumer les lumières.,,,,,

3601254,25154119,2015-01-07,24560847,Paul,"The original apartment that I booked had been damaged by a previous BNBer so he moved us to another apartment he had available, which was even better than the one we had booked and at no extra charge. He was very helpful with any minor problems raised such as getting the Wi-Fi up and running. When we had to check out early on our final day before departing in the late evening, he was very accommodating with looking after the bags for the day."
3601254,25621166,2015-01-20,18505867,Chris,"The studio in Back Bay is in the perfect location for visiting Boston.  The place is exactly as described and professionally operated, run like a hotel with properties scattered around Boston.  The main lobby is located a couple blocks away and has lots of tourist info as well as staff to assist you."
3601254,29660833,2015-04-11,8797367,Erica,"We had a great stay.  Bernie made our extended stay very easy, and being in walking distance to work in the Back Bay was very convenient during this winter's storms."
3601254,30094578,2015-04-17,30240469,Logan,"Great spot! A little hard to find parking in the area, especially late at night, but that is a Boston problem more than anything.  The location itself was close enough to T's and buses for everything I needed to do. It even has a stove and refrigerator if you don't want to eat at one of the amazing restaurants that are only blocks away."
Would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Boston,"great value.\"",,,,
3601254,30773385,2015-04-27,5154334,Grant,Bernie was very helpful and even gave us an unexpected upgrade.  The apartment was clean and had a great view of the Back Bay.
As I expected when making this booking,the location was excellent and within walking distance to everything.,,,,
"I would definitely stay here again!\"",,,,,
3601254,31393420,2015-05-04,31627625,Francesca,"We stayed in Back Bay for 2 nights. The studio was clean, had kitchen amenities and was in a great location. We walked to Fenway and to Copley Plaza/Newbury street with ease.  We had a great time and would definitely book with Bernie again."
3601254,32327717,2015-05-17,26170002,Antonio,We need to call many times before being able to contact the host get in the Studio causing delaying in our schedule. Building and studio are old and pictures need to be updated because there isn't the air conditioned on the right window and the Studio didn't like much clean. WiFi wasn't working but we spent 2 days and we didn't really need so i warn host when we left.
Location is great! fabulous Back Bay area,"close to T line and easy to get everywhere in the city.\"",,,,
3601254,32791602,2015-05-21,6289064,Lauren,"Very pleased with our stay here. Key pick-up and drop off was seamless at their office down the street and everyone there was very nice.  The building is quiet and in a perfect location, right next to tons of restaurants, coffee, bars and walking distance from Fenway.  The apt is pretty straight forward and is a nice clean space and even has kitchen appliances.  Bring your own toiletries (and consider bringing your own towel). The internet wasn't working and it would have been nice to have had the window unit in place since it got pretty warm during the day.  Very minor compared to how much we enjoyed our trip and our stay here. Thank you!"
3601254,33278863,2015-05-26,6512665,Avery,We enjoyed our stay. The apartment is in a very nice residential area. Great access to the Charles River Esplanade for running or walking. Checking in and out was very easy. The apartment was nice and tidy. As mentioned in other reviews the WiFi did not work and there was no air conditioning but this did not affect our stay.
3601254,34326372,2015-06-07,2628436,Heather,"Key pickup (3 blocks from the actual apt) was very smooth despite some last-minute changes to our plans.  Wifi didn't work, as has been the issue with so many other reviews, so this listing should probably stop advertising that internet is available.  My husband and I are from the area and had no problem navigating our way around town - we only used the apt to sleep, so it was perfect for our needs!  The apartment isn't luxurious by any means, but it was clean and tidy.  The bed was not the most comfortable, but I am 8 mos pregnant so that may have been the primary issue!  Perfect location for exploring the city on foot."
3601254,34547266,2015-06-09,32382324,Kevin,"The property was as-listed with the exception of working WiFi. It is what it is... a space to lay your head while you're out and about in Boston. Location was perfect, but if you're looking for upscale amenities, this is not your place. For the rate, however, you will be hard pressed to find better value. The 10am check out was negated by being able to store our luggage at the key drop just down the street."
3601254,36331641,2015-06-27,36139218,Kevin,Great location. Easy to get the keys. Small but a great spot. Perfect for a couple.
3601254,38518327,2015-07-16,34957211,Oscar,Conclusion:  Mismatch between expectations and reality.
On the positive: The apartment has an excellent location,nice and quiet neighborhood,near the river for a nature walk,plenty of restaurants,coffee shops,many types of stores and services within walking distance.  People at the rental office are nice
However,my overall evaluation is: “disappointment“,mostly because it was short from my expectations. Since the strict policy for payments make no room for regrets (neither reimbursements),I had to stay and endure with the facts that I had this place to stay and no time to look for somewhere else. So,I decided (had to) to endure it.,
The disappointment come from the apartment itself,it is an old unit within an old and decaying building.  The building is the decaying unit of the neighborhood. The hallways and stairways have a dirty looking carpet and a rare smell. The apartment looks no clean – I let the people in the office know about my perception from the beginning. I realized that the age and wore of the apartment make impossible to be clean and/or appears clean,the floor is scratched,the kitchenette and kitchenette sink are old,stained  and wore.  The windows are rusty and dusty; the apartment is due for a refurbishment. Pictures posted at the site do not reflect this.,
The internet signal,after logging in with the provided password,is weak,unstable and nonfunctional. It looks that the router is somewhere in the building far away from the apartment. This was constant for the 5 days of my stay. Looking at comments from previous users,this internet access and functionality problem looks to be a constant old problem.,

3601254,82104320,2016-06-26,15155056,Veena,"The studio is pretty basic. The best thing about this place is the location, which is fabulous-- easy walk to the river, Newbury street, T, etc! Bernie was very responsive to our messages before and during our stay. Unfortunately the wifi never worked, he had the company come out and try to fix it but we couldn't connect with a PC, Mac, phone or iPad."
3601254,84267614,2016-07-06,34543487,Kate,Would not stay again until the following are addressed:
-Upgrade sheets and towels- the ones provided were very rough,,,,,
-Running water in the shower- the hot water dripped a considerable amount of water constantly,,,,,
-A shower curtain liner is added,,,,,
-Pictures of the kitchenette are posted on the listing- the sink and stove are virtually unusable,,,,,
-More cups are provided- we purchased our own plastic cups,,,,,
-The rickety chairs are replaced,,,,,
-Decor is updated,,,,,
If these issues are addressed I would stay with Bernie again. You are 100% paying for location with this listing- stunning location on Beacon Street,very quiet,"relatively easy key pickup (~10 min walk from pickup to studio) and the space is quite roomy for a studio. \"",,,
3601254,91033016,2016-08-03,48283191,Krystal,"Bernie was great with responding to the questions I had before our stay. The apartment is located in a great area of Back Bay where it's quiet for a good night's rest, but still close to the T as well as many restaurants and shops."
3601254,92445009,2016-08-08,83401089,Chip,"bernie was a great (URL HIDDEN) and description was accurate.  the neighborhood and location was great.  we were able to walk to 95% of everything we did, restaurants nearby, convenience store nearby, bars, etc.  as a 1st timer to boston, this was a great place to stay and a fraction of the cost of a hotel.  would definately stay there again.  thanks bernie."
3601254,95637828,2016-08-20,86627937,Scot,Bernie is very professional and great to work with. The location can't be beat for the rate.
3601254,98733683,2016-09-01,57231679,嘉俊,"after coming to the apartment last afternoon,we just put our luggages in the room and went outside to purchase some necessities. we did not have a careful check on the apartment."
we went back in the evening,and found that the sanitary conditions are terrible……,,,,
the couch is full of trash,the cabinet is smelly,the pan is oily,the bathroom is very dirty. it is disgusting.,,
what's more,the tap water cannot be closed completely,so it is noisy and we cannot have a good sleep.,,,
we went to office several times to ask for help,however,it did nothing helpful. we asked to get refund,the administer told us the manager was not there,so he cannot do anything because he did not have the right. we asked him when the manager would come back on Sunday,he said it might be Monday. When we came the office on Monday
We cannot tolerate it at all,so we moved out immediately. Of course,it cost us a lot.,,,
"IT IS ABSOLUTELY A UNCOMFORTABLE EXPERIENCE.\"",,,,,
3601254,99797132,2016-09-06,62712213,Varun,We stayed at Bernie's place for 2 days and here is our review:
Check-in/Check-out - The office is located at a 6-8 minute walk from our place of stay. We asked for an early check-in and were granted the same. After check-out at 10:00 am,we asked for our bags to be kept in the office (our bus back to NYC was at 6:00 pm and we didn't want to carry our luggage all around the city with us),and the gentleman at the desk politely agreed. So overall,the process for check-in and check-out is pretty smooth.,,
Location - This was probably the highlight of our stay. Bernie's place is located in Backbay and is conveniently close to restaurants,pharmacy,shopping places and we would usually walk while getting to enjoy the beautiful fall-like weather.,,,
Amenities-,,,,,
1. Bed/Mattress - The mattress was comfortable. The sheets/pillow-covers appeared to be really old but were clean.,,,,,
2. Kitchen - There isn't really a kitchen. The place has a stove,sink,refrigerator,basic utensils. Do not expect to cook a full-fledged meal here because there isn't enough space to do so. However,we never planned to cook so this didn't affect our stay at all.,
3. Wifi - This is where the issue starts. The wifi was intermittent and we often had difficultly in connecting to the wifi.,,,,,
4. Bathroom- The bathroom definitely needs to be renovated / worked on. Water kept dripping from the tap no matter what we tried. It made a noise all night and it was difficult to not be bothered by it. It was difficult to judge whether the towels were clean or not because they were really old and worn out. Would recommend carrying your own towels if planning to stay at Bernie's place.,,,,,
Price - Difficult to find a room to stay in Backbay at the prices as are offered by Bernie,particularly if you organizing a last minute trip like we did.,,,,
Overall,"it's a decent place to stay given the price and the location but needs improvement on a few things mentioned above. \"",,,,
4977034,25534289,2015-01-18,26220925,Catherine,"This was a great experience. Together with two colleagues we decided at the very last moment to rent an apartment in Boston downtown for the week-end and it took us a very short time to book Jeff flat. The loft is very well located near China town, everything is close by walking. Jeff is a very friendly person and make all his best to make us feel comfortable. This a very nice apartment with modern decoration. It fully complies with pictures, and I would say it was even above our expectations. The roof top is really a plus. This has been a very good surprise for my first experience with Airnb. I would warmly recommend Jeff's flat."
4977034,27920875,2015-03-15,8755379,Courtney,"Jeff is s superior host.  He kept me frequently updated, offered good advice about the neighborhood and even arranged for an extra bed to be left in the apartment to accommodate my group.  He arranged to meet me personally to hand off the key and to show me around, as well.  When I had a question over the weekend I texted him, and his reply came back in minutes. The home was spotlessly clean and it's absolutely beautiful.  It is larger than in the  pictures, full of light, spacious and with a sense of quiet and order that is delightful after a day of handling the noise of Boston.  The kitchen is to die for.  My guests and I decided it could serve as our model home - really beautiful design. It really is steps to South Station, and also to lots of restaurants, Chinatown and within walking distance to the tourists sites  near Fanueil Hall, as well.  HIGHLY recommend!!"
4977034,28311299,2015-03-22,430174,Elina,"This place was very nice, clean and looks just like the pics! The host, Jeff, was incredibly helpful and even did a walk-through beforehand. The loft is in a great location and had more than enough space (and beds) to accommodate my family."
4977034,29784146,2015-04-12,5585682,Frank,"Jeff was very responsive and flexible before, during and after the visit, making sure the place was a good fit for my expectations and arranging access despite his workday schedule. Jeff's space has a generous loft layout, is tastefully decorated and is very convenient for a Boston visit. Just as described in the listing. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat."
4977034,30192210,2015-04-19,11544856,Elian,I cannot say enough wonderful things about this loft and overall experience! Jeff was responsive and incredibly helpful from the beginning. The loft was even better than advertised- absolutely gorgeous and very close to the train/subway station. I would highly recommend this space if you are planning a trip to Boston! Thank you so much!
4977034,30682134,2015-04-26,22047258,Robert,Jeff was an incredible host. Provided all the details that I needed to know about the house and checked on our group throughout the weekend to make sure everything was alright. Location is superb. Right across from the South Station Bus and Train Terminal so very it is very convenient for those who are traveling by train or bus into Boston.
4977034,31172055,2015-05-03,3382379,Fernand,Jeff was a great & friendly host. He was very accommodating & waited for us to let us in. He helped us with the suitcases & explained things. He was reachable when we had questions. The house is very comfortable & has lots of character. It is within walking distance to the park & Charles street & one block away from the subway & airport silver line. Highly recommended. Will definitely book it again whenever in Boston. Thanks Jeff.
4977034,31779939,2015-05-10,20372922,Justin,Jeff was a great host. Beautiful loft and great location.

4977034,33003384,2015-05-24,32145349,Dayana,"This place was beautiful! We were two couples in Boston for MDW. Completely in awe of the loft-style layout and loved making dinner in their really impressive kitchen, and the roof deck is really pleasant in the warm weather. Just be mindful that one bedroom (the master) is much bigger/nicer than the other one (by the roof deck), but it was no problem for group. Thanks again, Jeff!"
4977034,34279856,2015-06-07,28779263,Brian,"Jeffs communication leading up to our amazing weekend stay in Boston was top notch. Jeff met us at the loft, gave us a quick tour, showed us how to use everything and answered any questions we had."
4 longtime friends traveling from all over the east coast is not an easy thing to plan...especially trying to find space. Jeffs space was more than ample enough for us guys to relax in a luxury loft in the center of Boston. The roof deck was the highlight of our trip. The work Jeff did on this loft space is some of the best renovation I have ever seen.,,,,,
Steps from South Station,we easily walked to the North End,Boston Common,Back Bay and to a game at Fenway Park.,,
The kitchen and bathrooms are top notch. Ample space to nap/sleep on beds,reclining chairs,couch or the floor depending on how firm you like your surface ;),,,
I hope to rent this space again this year .... anyone who can get this rental is lucky beyond words. Such a great experience in a very unique space.,,,,,

4977034,36475101,2015-06-28,2817042,Jon,Jeff's place is fantastic and perfectly located. The pictures don't really do it justice. He's extremely helpful and made sure we had all the information we needed. Would definitely stay there again.
4977034,37152651,2015-07-05,31530628,Maria,"Having lived in Boston years ago, we wanted our kids to experience the city just as we had. Jeff's apartment was in an ideal location for getting the most out of our short stay. His apartment is beautifully appointed and spacious with high-end amenities. The roof top deck was a great place to relax and unwind. Jeff was very helpful, accommodating and always quick to respond to our questions. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"

Jeff has been really responsive before, during and after we stayed in the loft. The loft is really spacious, with top of the line equipment and ideally located, 10-15 minute walking distance to all major Boston places to visit. Truly recommend it!"
4977034,43396413,2015-08-19,30416062,Lori,"This is a very nice and spacious apartment, with a layout well suited to either assembling or retreating from company. Roof deck is great for cooling off from the summer heat and for admiring surrounding buildings. We were mainly focussed on the convention center (BCEC), which is conveniently accessible by taxi, Uber, T (silver line), or foot, depending on urgency."
Jeff is extremely helpful and communicative. He accommodated our late evening arrival time with a key service,was careful to ascertain that the sleeping arrangements would suit our party (comfortable sofa,by the way),"and was responsive to queries during our stay. I recommend this listing.\"",,
4977034,48530997,2015-09-27,18941629,Justin,"Jeff's place is in a great location to see all the sites in boston. Close to public transit and convenient stores.

One complaint- master bedroom is right by a floor hallway and the noise from neighbors coming home at all hours of the evening was very disruptive to our sleep.,,,,,
Otherwise,"great place. Lots of space! \"",,,,
4977034,50327189,2015-10-11,44123491,Marian,"This was the first time we've used airbnb but we had nothing to worry about.  Jeff was very helpful, the place is awesome, and the location was perfect for us.  As Is noted in the description, there are lots of stairs, so if you have health issues it might be tough.  Otherwise, enjoy!  Btw, right around the corner is Les Zygomates, a wonderful restaurant!  And if you end up with bad weather, it's very close!"
4977034,51147797,2015-10-18,13077133,Justin,"Jeff was communicative leading up to our stay and gave us ample flexibility in arrival time and check-out.

We look forward to booking again on Head of the Charles weekend in 2016."
4977034,52512598,2015-10-30,41305051,Nate,Great place and much more spacious than it looks online. The location is ideal. Jeff is easy to work with and bends over backwards to ensure everything is in place for your arrival. I would recommend staying here to anyone and when I come back to Boston I'll try to book the property again.
4977034,54664067,2015-11-22,9711163,Mark,"Jeff was an excellent host. The logistics to get the key were perfect and he was there to explain everything that needed explaining.  The apartment itself was why I like Airbnb to begin with: delightful and unconventional when compared to a normal hotel room, with its wide open spaces, and spread over 3 floors in a genuine loft. The location, as others have mentioned, is perfect if you're arriving into South Station, and is on the edge of Chinatown with its great restaurants and a short walk to the Freedom Trail."
4977034,70723315,2016-04-20,12208926,Anthony,"My best airbnb experience to date; not that I have too many; but everything about Jeff's place makes us feel we have a home in Boston. The loft is spacious, beautiful, and yet very cozy. Location is super convenient. Jeff is a fantastic host that will make your stay very comfortable. I want to come back, and I recommend Jeff's place without any reservation."
4977034,72116740,2016-05-01,1095421,Scott,"Jeff was the friendliest and most helpful host I've had. Although we didn't meet in person, our arrival went extremely smoothly and Jeff was accessible and responsive during our stay. And his apartment is a brilliant space - perfectly located for a discovery of Boston. My best Airbnb experience so far."
4977034,73815492,2016-05-10,44595820,Nadia,"Three things about this place that make it perfect; the space, the location and the host. The pictures show beautiful design and unique use of space. The unit is clean and comfortable. We didn't make use of the deck because of inclement weather however there was so much room inside for everyone to relax and enjoy each other's company. We were in Boston to celebrate our son's graduation from Emerson. The apartment was the central spot for all visitors. Located right near South Station was so convenient for relatives flying in and out of town. We walked and took the T everywhere. The location was easy for sightseeing and even attending a Red Sox game. Finally Jeff was an excellent host. We didn't need any help finding our way around Boston but he offered his support and was great with communication and accommodating our needs. I absolutely recommend this place. If you're like us, you won't want to leave."
4977034,74502232,2016-05-15,23397277,Suzanne,"We stayed at Jeff's apartment in Boston with our two kids. Based on what we saw in Airbnb we knew it would be nice, but it turned out to be far beyond our expectations. It was extremely spacious, well appointed, and the kitchen was fantastic. It was a great location, and walking distance to all major points in Boston. Jeff  was great at helping us get settled and making sure we didn't have any problems. He was one of the most communicative hosts we have had. We will definitely be coming back!"
4977034,76914206,2016-05-29,33531608,Sally,"Jeff was a great host! Texted him throughout our stay with questions and he got right back to me with an answer. Home was exactly like the pictures, absolutely beautiful loft in the middle of the city with plenty of amenities within walking distance. Would absolutely stay at this place again!"
4977034,78091424,2016-06-05,38610834,Jeremy,"Jeff was very communicative right from the start and even checked in in to make sure everything was going well after we settled in. This place is perfect. As nice as the photos are, the place is actually nicer than they show. Just the right amount of space, well appointed and decorated and that roof deck! A perfect spot for a weekend in Boston."
4977034,80677173,2016-06-19,15105829,Rafo,"So easy staying at Jeff's. Everything was already taken care of, the space was even bigger than it looked in the pictures. And so close to everything."
4977034,84086474,2016-07-05,75610073,Rachel,Jeff is a very accommodating host.  I greatly appreciated the flexibility with check-in and check-out times.  The listing is beautiful and actually quite larger than pictures indicate online.  The location is ideal; it is a few minutes walk from the South Station T-stop and the bus station.  Popular areas such as Newbury Street and Boston Common are walking distance.
4977034,92357174,2016-08-08,78710264,Ana,Amazing place! It had an open warm vibe to the home and the windows were so big it allowed all the light to come in from outside. Having dinner on the balcony was wonderful as well! We were able to see the beautiful sunset. Overall the experience was perfect. Jeff answered any questions we had and let us know we could call him if anything. Communication was great and the location was amazing! There were so many stores and restaurants around us that we got to just walk around and explore!
4977034,97087767,2016-08-25,53211882,Catherine,"Jeff was great, always easy to contact and always got back to us straight away, and very accommodating.  Loft was exactly as described and as looked in photos.  The only negative was that the lift was out of operation,  so 5 days of having to use stairs up to fourth floor was not fantastic.  If we had of been a few years younger this would probably not have been an issue.  Jeff did meet us upon arrival and helped lug our luggage up all the flights of stairs, which was greatly appreciated."
The loft was in a great area for transport,"food and walking distance from the Downtown Shopping area.\"",,,,
4977034,98233920,2016-08-30,18079536,Chantey,"\"Jeff was a wonderful Airbnb host. Everything about this home was fabulous from the excellent location , beautiful furnishings,  gorgeous kitchen and bathrooms (actually it was all gorgeous),  and the \"\"I so wish I had one\"\" rooftop deck!   The main building elevator was out of order but Jeff notified us and met us upon arrival to help with bags. The trek up the stairs wasn't fun but we were gone all day so it wasn't too bad . Jeff was extremely helpful and accommodating during our entire stay . We would definitely love to stay here again next time we are in Boston! \""
10857914,79715715,2016-06-13,66800271,Carolyn,"Our hostess, Kathie was waiting for our early arrival from the airport.  She was very gracious in accommodating us with this request.  The townhouse is situated right in the heart of everything.    The townhouse is beautiful and well appointed.  Everyone of our family of 6 had space to themselves and even allowed for inclusions of other family members to make preparation for our son's wedding."
10857914,80746312,2016-06-19,23934595,Lynsey,"The townhouse is beautiful and exactly as advertised.  The chef's kitchen is wonderful with every possible amenity available and the house really is as tastefully decorated as the pictures suggest, but comfortable and homely too - we were definitely able to relax here.  There is a wonderful sound system which can sync to your online music service and even a printer you can use if you need one."
The bedrooms are light and spacious with some of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in.  The linens were just glorious with luxury sheets and towels in every room.,,,,,
The 3 bathrooms are a highlight with blissful rainforest showers and even steam room and Jacuzzi bath functions in the Master en suite.  Kathy also provides high end toiletries for guest use,which was a lovely touch.,,,,
The house is perfectly located for all the sights of Boston.  Boston Common is only a 5 minute walk away and nothing is more than a 10min Uber ride away.,,,,,
As the helpful floorplan shows the property is on five levels,so those in poor fitness may find the upper bedrooms a little tricky to haul their luggage up to,but this is literally the only negative I can think of.  Kathy was so helpful when we needed to check-in early and leave late and we were incredibly grateful for her kindness.,,,
Overall it was a perfect stay and my best with AirBnB so far.  Thank you for having us,"Kathy - I'll definitely recommend you to colleagues visiting Boston in future!\"",,,,

10857914,85641607,2016-07-12,70339738,Tanner,"Katherine is incredibly welcoming upon check-in and goes the extra mile to make you feel welcome. We had 8 adults and two children in this home and we were VERY comfortable. The finishes are all top-notch and Katherine made everything easy for us from answering questions to providing information about Boston to making sure we could check out with confidence. The location is also perfect. We made short trips to the freedom trail, Boston Common, the aquarium, and Fenway park. We could either walk or catch the train with very little effort. I am speaking for the entire family when I say that we would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
"Thank you Katherine!\"",,,,,
10857914,87799424,2016-07-21,55780219,Howard,Our party of 6 adults completely enjoyed our stay in Katherine's beautiful home.

The home is located within walking to all in Boston which makes it a great place to stay.  The home is well appointed and accomated all of our needs. We highly reccomend her beautiful home and would stay there again!

6911945,40049813,2015-07-27,21013102,Nadine,"Me and my boyfriend stayed 2 nights at Peter's place. It has been a real pleasure for us and we enjoyed our time very much. We were allowed to use the whole appartment because Peter was away for weekend. Appartment was very clean and was a nice and cozy place to hang out for us. T-Station is like a 10 minute walk away and also a walk to the sea takes about 15 minutes. Unfortunately we could not meet in person, but maybe next time! :)"
6911945,43198359,2015-08-17,9187488,Hamza,"Peter and Sam were the best hosts my girlfriend and I could have asked for.  From their prompt communication and replies to their friendly attitudes and comfortable apartment, everything was perfect.  We asked them for some suggestions and they gave us a ton of places to go and sights to see.  We followed through with most of them and they were top notch.  We actually met them coincidentally at a coffee shop the morning after and they were fantastic in person as well."
Their apartment was beautiful,very clean,smelled great,and in a great location.  We were a short walk from Harpoon Brewery,Seaport,and Faneuil Hall.  Although it was so close to everything
6911945,44240158,2015-08-24,41764229,Erin,"Peter let us a nice framed note and a bottle of wine (that we didn't end up having time to drink) so we felt immediately at home in his apartment.  The place was incredibly clean and tidy and filled with a collection of beautiful antique furniture and accent pieces, so cute!  Our room was comfortable and had plenty of space for our stuff so we didn't feel cramped.  Peter was very quick to respond to any questions and made the 'check-in' very easy for us.  This was a great find!"
6911945,44778545,2015-08-29,8926183,Maureen,"Great apartment!  It was spotless, very comfortable, and decorated with some charming antique items."

6911945,46014438,2015-09-07,13817582,James,"Listing description was completely accurate. Peter welcomed us with a nice note and bottle of wine, which was a great touch. Communication between Peter and I was quick, clear, and concise. Experience in South Boston was very positive. Street parking was available right near the home. Home is located on a side street, so there is minimal traffic noise."
6911945,50669342,2015-10-13,44444074,Josie,"Staying at Peter's place was a wonderful experience.  The neighborhood was great.  We became regulars at the nearby restaurant Lincoln Tavern.  The apartment was adorable and clean, we felt right at home and admired the decor the entire weekend.  The highlight of this experience was Peter's hospitality.  Right from the beginning communication with him was quick and thorough.  He went above and beyond to make sure we were all set and was ready with recommendations to help enhance our experience. We would definitely stay here again."
6911945,94200888,2016-08-15,86211572,Michelle,"Peter's place was a great place to stay for our weekend in Boston. The place is just as described, and in a great area!

Only thing to consider: it is not really central, but bus stops are right around the corner and you can also walk into the center (took me 50minutes)."

It was near the T (subway) and a quick hop to downtown and 30 min to Cambridge. It is also near the bunker hill monument (end of freedom trail)."
6886946,38919774,2015-07-19,37789523,Trish,"This is a beautifully decorated apartment in a safe neighborhood, with a roof deck up top. Christina made us feel welcome right away by leaving a bouquet of sunflowers on the table for us. Beds were super comfortable, and the kitchen uncluttered, making it easy to make meals. The location was great for getting into Boston by public transportation, just a short stroll away -- and for getting away from it at the end of the day. A calm haven. We loved it!"
6886946,39998153,2015-07-27,37709567,Bhavin,"The townhouse was perfect for our needs, clean, nice sized common areas and comfortable beds and sofas! The rooftop views were amazing and it's where we spent most of our down time! If you're looking in the area, I recommend this place!"

Listing Description was accurate. Centrally located. Nicely Furnished with all amenities. Very comfortable for a small family. Short walk to the T-station.,,,,,
Minuses,,,,,
- 2 flights climb with lots of luggage is a bit exhausting.,,,,,
"- Parking permit is a must if you plan to rent or arrive with a car on weekdays\"",,,,,
6886946,45797263,2015-09-06,17886543,Marylena,"This apartment is very good for those who desire more space and sleep quietly at nights. The neighborhood is very residential, and once you learn the times of the buses and subway, it's very easy to go everywhere. There is a bus (93) that leaves you literally in the front door, which was great help. You can walk from/to the train station or take this bus in case you are tired of walking the entire day, which was our case."
We didn't see Christina,but she was very responsive to our couple of inquiries via messaging. The apartment was very clean,a lot of light especially in the leaving room and kitchen,which was great. Pictures of the apartment are accurate,but this particular one in the listing makes the living room look dark,which is not the case at all.
Unlike most of the apartments we have rented through Airbnb,this is someone's home,not a second property for rental purposes. However,it is well prepared to receive guests.,,
Very comfortable stay,"highly recommended!\"",,,,
6886946,46966296,2015-09-14,40449717,Robbie,The listing description was accurate and the neighborhood was great. Christina was very accommodating and worked with us to make it easy to check in and out. She even allowed us additional time to check out on Sunday.
Her place was spacious and peaceful. The rooftop patio was great too,"although we didn't have any free time to spend up there. Christina's place was a great spot for the three of us to go and recharge in between excursions in and around Boston. I highly recommend Christina and her home.\"",,,,

6886946,49801508,2015-10-06,13616259,Jeanmarie,"Christina has a wonderful place to stay. The apartment looks just like the pictures, was very clean, quiet. We didn't get a chance to get up on the rooftop balcony thanks to all the rain, but that's okay because the living room was so comfortable to relax in. Nice size kitchen, plenty of room to cook in. The neighborhood was convenient but not right on a busy street. Parking was easy and was unrestricted during the weekend. Highly recommend!"
6886946,50472594,2015-10-12,35574326,Nicole,We stayed at Christina's lovely Charlestown home for a girl's weekend and could not have had a better experience. We
found the rental was exactly the way it was pictured/described on AirBnB,and Christina was very responsive during our stay with any questions we had.

Christina called the day before we arrived and left us instructions and a guidebook to enjoy Boston and her neighborhood. She was available by text the entire time when we had a question. It was very easy to get an Uber and was a short ride to any place we wanted to go. Her home was lovely, clean and comfortable. Loved it!"

Check-in and Check-out were simple and easy becouse everything is tidy and the house is very functional. Furthermore,Quinn explained to me every doubt I asked him at the moment.,,,,
The location of the house is really good,very close to the subway station. I could arrive to Boston in a few minutes.,,,,
I recommend the house. It's clean,"tidy and convenient. I would repeat.\"",,,,

2634361,20677169,2014-10-03,21894785,William,Room was simple but very clean.  Checking in and out was very straightforward and not the least bit time consuming.  The location of the house was very good given the price of other places that are farther away.  Great value for a town with expensive lodging options.
2634361,20966804,2014-10-08,21481342,Mina,The host is great. I'll come the next time. The instructions was very clear and the room was clean. near to the Subway station. I would recommend Quinn.
2634361,21312995,2014-10-14,3739875,Dominik,"The room is good value, basic but has all that is needed and is clean. The check-in is well organised and the host was easy to contact. The area is a suburb, but the blue T line gets you downtown quickly, with only few stops. I felt safe and the area has cheerful shops and restaurants with food from around the world. If I am again in Boston and require budget accommodation, I would love to be your guest again. Highly recommend."
2634361,21545752,2014-10-19,5415458,Lidya,"I got good directions from Quinn & May, very clear and they are very responsive with the emails. They prepared the room as they welcoming friends. Fresh towels are ready and the bed is comfortable. They also very considerate, shampoo and shower gel are ready in the bathroom, also Gillette shaving foam."
I was surprised with the surroundings on the first day,not many people around after 7pm and a little bit dark,but on the 2nd day,I found the surrounding is safe,at least I feel okay when I came back about 11pm.,
The house is very near with train station,it's easy to find and I found it very convenient. Orient High is about 15-20min from Aquarium (I started exploring Boston from here) and 3 stops away from airport! So no need to rush to the airport.,,,,
About the house,it's not new house but it's well maintained. The room is spacious and clean,and the most important is the clean bathroom! and that's all matters for me.,,,
"Thanks so much Quinn and May! It was a pleasant stay and I will contact you again in the future :)\"",,,,,
2634361,21812613,2014-10-24,20530446,Dick,"This was a great location for an overnight stay close to the airport.  The room was clean, with a comfortable bed and there are two large shared bathrooms well stocked with the essentials .  We never met the owner, but she was very responsive by texting when we had a question.  Her directions from the airport were very clear and the key was waiting for us in the mailbox upon arrival."
The kitchen is available and there is filtered water which was nice.  However,the kitchen is very sparsely equipped,no cups and only a couple plastic glasses.  Our main problem was the lack of heat in our room.  There is a baseboard heater but no way to control it,the thermostat must be somewhere else in  the house.  It was cold and rainy when we arrived,temp about 55F,and the room was very cold.  There is a window air conditioner in the room with huge gaps allowing cold air in.  We texted May and she sent over a a friend (who did not speak English) that assured us everything was OK
2634361,22042729,2014-10-28,3788804,Amber,"I had a good stay. Picture is pretty accurate. It was nice that there was a mini-fridge in the room.  It did get cold at night so would've liked an extra blanket or a thicker blanket.  Keys were easy to find.  Bathrooms are clean, and water pressure is good. It is not a hotel, so you will have to make your own bed, throw away your own thrash, etc.  As far as location, it really is a 3 minute walk to the blue line.  Blue Line was very convenient for me as it was only 2 stops from the airport and the Aquarium was on this line. At the Aquarium stop you can purchase tickets for the hop on/off trolley, duck tours, ferry to Salem and Harbor Cruises.  Government Center is shut down, so transfer to downtown will have to be made at the State stop. Downtown, with transfers, is about a 10-15 min train ride."

I would only suggest to find an alternative way to pick and leave the keys, to avoid any inconvenience: the mailbox is not the safer place"
2634361,28457002,2015-03-23,10139633,Julian,Everything went pretty well. The room was cozy and the bed is good. There is a fridge inside the room. The bathrooms are clean.  The only bad thing was the heater making some noise but it's not really a big deal. Very good.
2634361,31417031,2015-05-04,32443637,Roger,Very quick customer service. They answered all my questions within 5 minutes. Clean place. I'd stay again
2634361,32293411,2015-05-16,30312020,Yingzhu,"I chose to return and stay in May's room for the last three days in Boston. The room was spacious and clean, as usual. The host was nice and considerate. I would love to recommend this room to other people."
2634361,32709140,2015-05-20,23286244,Jieyu,"We had a quite comfortable stay in May's apartment. The room is large enough for three people and everything is very clean. Though we didn't have a chance to met May in person, it is still convenient for us to check in and out for May made everything clear."

note - the second bed is not a real bed. its a cot that is not appropriate for sleeping. we brought up a single mattress from the basement,"which worked fine.\"",,,,
2634361,36160330,2015-06-25,36545818,Micha,"Host was very responsive and explained everything well. Good location, close to subway to go downtown.  $10-15 to come back via Uber. Room nice and clean. Only downside was the shared bathroom was not cleaned properly. For the price though I would consider this place again any day."
2634361,36347589,2015-06-27,36569064,Longguo,good place to stay. vey ez to get transit to anywhere in or near boston area. house owners are friendly and helpful.

2634361,41531914,2015-08-07,40233021,Jason,"Overall, a good experience for our first time using Airbnb. Easy check in and check out. Good with communication. The room was large and spacious. There was only one bathroom available for all the people staying there to share as the other bathroom was always locked. Never met the host though."

5 minutes walking from apt,will meet beach,,,,
"The best thing is it located in near airport\"",,,,,
2634361,42087866,2015-08-10,40702500,Kevin,Great place to stay!  Super close to Orient Heights subway station.  Clean bathroom and clean room.  I didn't see anyone else when I was there.  Very private.
2634361,42976530,2015-08-16,9039470,John,The hosts were very helpful regarding getting to the place from the airport. It was inexpensive and easy to take the Subway and to get from the airport to the subway to begin with. A very short walk from the subway station to the place was simple. The neighborhood is interesting - classic old Boston suburb feel with several restaurants nearby to choose from. The hosts were nowhere to be seen and I got the feeling from a couple of other guests that it was like a boarding house and not really true to the spirit of what AirBNB is about. But for my purpose it was convenient and an ok experience.
2634361,43548766,2015-08-20,20518876,Erin,"Very easy to get to from central Boston, host easy to get in contact with even though we never met. Room was spacious but had a lot more furniture than is necessary. Worst part was lack of wifi in our particular room, wifi signal extremely weak so we had to use the common room in order to go online. Convenient and cheap, would stay again."
2634361,45907612,2015-09-06,9076550,Andreas,Nice room with an old piano (big plus!). Calm neighbourhood.
Toilets couldn't be flushed on the weekend we were there,apparently a guest misused them.,,,,
"WiFi signal downstairs and in our room was unfortunately super weak.\"",,,,,
2634361,46634162,2015-09-12,3104843,Andre,"Enjoyed my stay. It was fun to be part of east Boston for almost a week. The room was convenient and peaceful. Close to the blue line that takes you downtown within 15 minutes. Cheap, clean, complete. Didn't meet Quinn-May personally, but she communicates clearly in a friendly tone of voice."
"\"",,,,,
2634361,50499934,2015-10-12,8649710,Dmitry,"It was pretty much what you can expect from the listing. I never saw Quinn-May personally. The room was clean when I got in, I had few problems with the lock in the room but the host was very responsive and the issue got fixed fast. There was couple rooms like mine in the house with guests coming and leaving. The location is also very good just 2 minutes from Blue line T (metro station), you can get to downtown in 20 minutes. NOTE: The only downside of this listing is that Wi-Fi is really-really bad, if you absolutely need consistent wi-fi you should rent something else, otherwise it's pretty good choice"
2634361,51254695,2015-10-18,6180012,Sachin,"This is a great place, clean rooms where u want to end up before taking the flight out of Boston, its just 3-4 miles from the airport, a 2 min walk to the Blue line station.nice view of the beach at a few mtrs.from here, no intrusion from the host,very cosy, comfy, there was a piano in my room. there is a dominoes, burger king, liquor store, all walkable from here,overall a great place as long as u r willing to share a common loo. entry n exit r all automated which is something I like especially if u r returning from a slotched party! The host will respond to u immediately for anything which I really appreciate"

2634361,75821518,2016-05-23,58722777,Megan,"The room was very nice overall. Everything was clean, the host's directions via email were clear, and there was adequate parking coming in on a weekend afternoon. Even when we ran into a small issue, Quinn-May replied within 5 minutes to our email. After reading other reviews, I was slightly skeptical of the shared bathroom, but it was perfectly clean and operational. I don't believe there was anyone else staying during the course of that weekend, and if there were then we could not hear them."
Also,big plus,within close walking distance to a liquor store and pizza shop,very friendly and delicious.,,
The only real problem we had: We could not figure out how to get the overhead fan on,and there were 3 different remotes that did not work,so instructions for these would have been helpful. Other than that,"everything was great.\"",,
2634361,76564186,2016-05-28,18100738,Eunice,"The room was clean as well as the bathrooms. The bathrooms were both stocked with shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and some extras. It was quiet and the place had A/C and a refrigerator. The rooms had towels provided for each of us. Our place was close to the city and right by the metro station and parking lot! We recommend this place to anyone!"
2634361,77261780,2016-05-31,74240748,Sam,"The room was nice and clean. It was close to subway. There were two bathrooms as listed, and one was better than the other. It was a great experience overall. Big plus: there was an old piano in my room."

2634361,84147527,2016-07-05,27331857,Vikas,The apartment was located very close to the airport. Parking was easy to find on the streets. The apartment itself was very neat. Quinn had organized everything really well and we had no problems during our stay. I would highly recommend this place in Boston
2634361,85233666,2016-07-10,67514723,Helen,"Just two stops from airport, five minutes by walk from subway station, very convenience by public transportation. It's a right place if you want to find a nice place to take a rest, especially when you arrive at late night."
2634361,86501034,2016-07-16,49431322,Lipeng,"It is a comfortable room, we have spent a very nice holiday."
2634361,89337944,2016-07-28,17675422,Don,"We wanted basic accommodations for 3 people with good access to Logan Airport and MTA to Boston.  This place provided that.  We liked the local restaurants and the neighborhood felt safe.  We enjoyed walking to Constitution Beach and watching planes taking off and landing at Logan.  We were able to park our car within half a block of the house.  The room with one small double bed and one twin was cramped but adequate.  The two small bathrooms were shared with the 3 or 4 other renters in this multi-room first floor AirBNB.  There was no breakfast, by the way, but the room had a good refrigerator and there was a shared kitchen we did not use.  The overhead fan would not work and no one was available to  ask for help.  It was a very hot day and the small AC was barely up to the task.  We really wanted the fan to work.  With no host available we felt we were at a self-service rooming house.  There was no sense of personal connection.  We like to meet the host when we stay at AirBNBs."
2634361,92984680,2016-08-11,23336965,Pierrick,"We stayed 5 nights at Quinn-May's appartement, the place was clean, close to the subway and the bus station. The neighborhood is calm and there's even a beach at 5 minutes by foot. I recommand it if you want to stay a few days in Boston!"
2634361,93120051,2016-08-11,2491574,Paulina,"We had a layover in Boston and the place served it's purpose, clean and close to the airport."
1175376,5251678,2013-06-20,4600382,Ginger,"I thought the Boston residence was great. Clean, quite and convenient. Enjoyed the bistro set on the balcony for breakfast. It was also nice to have a code for easy access and not have to worry about keys. Wifi was fast. Cell service for AT&T no bueno—but that's AT&T's fault ;-)"
1175376,5465005,2013-07-01,5883006,Ian,"Great spot - clean, newly renovated and in a perfect location for what we were looking for. The keyless entry was very handy for a few of us coming and going, and made arrival/departure very easy."
"Highly recommended!\"",,,,,
1175376,5909080,2013-07-22,6504703,Julie,This apartment was perfect for our one-week stay in Boston. It is located in a great neighborhood. It is walking distance to the subway and a lot of Boston sights. It is also close to nice restaurants and children playgrounds.
We also found free parking on the street next to Northampton for the whole week. :),,,,,
The place is sparkling new and well furnished.,,,,,
"We would definitely come back here for our next stay!\"",,,,,
1175376,7324938,2013-09-16,2229931,Fabio,"The apartment was exactly as shown on the pictures. Most things look completely new and unused, everything works and is in good condition. The balcony is nice, we actually had some squirrels visiting us now and then. The only remark I have was that both beds had linen on them covered in hairs. (cat?) There was enough replacement linen available though, so not a real big problem. The rest of the apartment was spotless."
The neighborhood itself is less trendy then I expected based on the description. I never felt unsafe,people that I encountered in the street are friendly and helpful,but if you are not from a big city I guess some parts of South-End can be a little bit intimidating. The major tourist areas such as Boylston/Newbury street are all a ~10 minutes walk away. The bus stops are around the corner,the train station is a few blocks up. Cabs in Boston are cheap and everywhere.,,
The reception was all self-service,all doors have electronic locks with codes. This is convenient and saves you from juggling with keys,but personally I always like to meet my host in person,that is one of the main reasons I prefer airbnb over a regular hotel. This is not an issue though,"more a personal preference. A nice guidebook with tips and tricks is provided.\"",

This property was ideal for my needs being that it was within walking distance to the park and had everthing I needed for my short stay. The property was smaller than it looks in pictures but it still accomidated my guests and I quite well. I was amazed by the fact that I could reach Will by phone and he would pick up immediately, and the same by E-mail. I have no complaints about this property and would highly recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Boston."

La décoration est soignée et la cuisine très bien équipée. La terrasse exposé est à l'est super pour le petit déjeuner ou le brunch et même en octobre nous en avons bien profité.Seul petit défaut : du fait de la climatisation dans les chambres, celles-ci sont mal insonorisées par rapport à la rue et il y a beaucoup de bruitCela ne nous a pas empêché de passer un excellent séjour.."

It was in a cute neighborhood and the keypad locks made it easy for a group of us to go in and out without the hassle of keys.

Rooms are well appointed. Balcony with a view of Prudential Center is certainly a plus! The communication has been kept minimal but very professional and clear. Overall, it just totally hit the spot!"
1175376,13745346,2014-06-03,13936791,Kim,The Apt was very nice. Clean and comfortable. The Beds were clean and comfortable also. The washer/dryer is great. The keyless entrance made it very easy for getting in & out. We enjoyed our stay. The building is old much like the city itself! The location is good as there are restaurants & coffee shops within walking distance. We were able to find parking on the street and close by streets. It really wasn't a problem. This was a good location for driving or using the T train to get around. We didn't have any problems staying at this Apt and would recommend it.

I was there with my two business partners and we spent a lot of time in the unit meeting and working, so my main comment would be that I wouldn't want to spend much time on the couch.

Something to consider is there is no lift,though our appartment was on a first floor,not too much effort if you can climb stairs.,,,
One of the bedrooms was a bit colder since it's not completely termically isolated from outside.,,,,,

It was a great home place for us to use as a home-base for our family trip to Boston. It slept 2 adults and 3 kids without trouble (1 kid stayed on the couch).  Nice kitchen and dining area. Bathroom was clean. Laundry unit looked nice, but we didn't need to use it."
We felt it was a little too far from downtown to be able to walk down and then do the Freedom Trail. However,the subway is pretty close (2 long blocks - both Green and Orange lines are nearby). Also on several bus lines. We did walk to Fenway without trouble - took about 25 minutes.,,,,
The neighborhood was really cool and had many cafes,diners,and places to eat nearby.,,,
The bed my wife and I slept on was servicable,but was pretty soft.,,,,

1175376,32497248,2015-05-19,7078634,Colleen,The apartment was clean and it worked for four people. Add another it would have been too small. The kitchen is nice and stocked. We did not cook the dining area was nice to have for work and it had a small balcony. The listing was as advertised. The neighborhood is south end but is more on the outskirts and so there are not that many stores around. Although two good restaurants around the corner worth trying. One has burgers and beer and the other is southern food called Estelles. It was pretty good. All in all a good place to stay and would recommend.
1175376,32801493,2015-05-21,526137,Ross,Great apartment in up and coming location. Property is managed by a 3rd party and so is very professional. Keycode access means you can get in when you want. I felt it was perhaps a little overpriced but has been recently refurbished to a very high standard and if there were 5 or 6 of you dividing the cost it would be good value.
My only suggestion for improvement is the couch,"which is long past its best\"",,,,

It is well located in a red brick historic residential area and convenient to most of Boston's touristy attractions. It is welcoming though not as clean as European standards would request. If you cannot get a parking permit, check Camden Street - one block away next to the church - for a fee spot."

It is in a great location with an easy walk to the metro, wholefoods and lots of great restaurants and cafes. Having the separate dining room and outdoor patio make the apartment a comfortable size for four adults. We were two couples and found the apartment spacious. It was also great having the dishwasher, washing machine and dryer in the apartment. We would definitely stay at Will's again."

1175376,76774120,2016-05-29,63667073,Jennifer,"We found the listing description accurate. Very cute little place in Boston that we found to be very accessible to any place we wanted to go. Will's place was clean, comfortable, nicely decorated and super convenient. While we found the two bedroom a little small for the six of us - two parents and four teens- it also gave us a true taste of living in the city. Will's place was easy to access. We really enjoyed our stay."

The apartment is definitely a place for 4 people, trying to fit 6 people ended up being uncomfortable, the sofa bed does not work properly, the A/C of the place does not work at all, the only A/C working are the ones on the rooms, shower also does not work properly, the door of the balcony was broken."

2660908,14826918,2014-06-27,15485701,Jovana,"The check-in procedure is very convenient for travelers, as it is impersonal, so you don't have the stress with appointments if your travel gets delayed. We didn't meet Shawn, but to our problem with the Internet he reacted instantly (thanx for that). The apartment is a bit further away, but we knew that in advance and did not mind. There is a bus line in front of the house bringing you downtown, which is really convenient. The bus didn't always run according to the schedule, but as we stayed only a couple of days I don't know how frequent it happens."
2660908,15056456,2014-07-01,13787152,Janet,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay in this cute apartment. There was plenty of space for the two of us. It was relatively clean when we arrived, with fresh linens on the bed and clean towels. The kitchen was up to our cleanliness standards, although it was disappointing that there were no basic things for cooking (oil, salt and pepper etc). We bought an olive oil and left it for the next guests. We had one issue with a blown fuse one morning, caused by blow drying my hair with the light on in the bathroom, so after that, I used the dryer on low and without lights on. The fuse box is in the basement, in case this happens again. Shawn was willing to help out, however we just resolved the problem on our own. The location of the apartment was decent. It is about a 15 min walk from the Sullivan subway stop. Cabs were slow to get to our apartment, so call ahead especially if you need a cab on time for the airport (our cab took 30 mins on the day we had to depart... stressful...). There is a whole foods that is about a 20 min walk away. Another perk is that there is wifi in the house!"

705900,10839707,2014-03-10,3170766,Matthew,Impeccable apartment in a beautiful historical building in the best possible location
705900,23049695,2014-11-21,23674934,Phillip,This 1 bdrm is s gem. It sits on the top floor of a lovely brownstone just a quarter of a block from Mass Ave and convenient to the Hynes Ctr Green Line T-Stop. The location is superb.
Inside Richard left a clean,well appointed apartment that has a cozy living room with internet and flat screen TV,a comfy couch and fireplace. From the bay window there's a    great view of the Boston skyline.,,,
I was there in during s winter polar vortex and it was cold outside but comfortable in the apartment. The bedroom held a very comfortable king sized bed and nice closet.,,,,,
I didn't have an opportunity to use the kitchen but it was well equipped and spotless.,,,,,
Richard left some nice toiletries in the bathroom along with fluffy towels.,,,,,
"Overall it was a lovely apartment and a great  bargain. Highly recommended.\"",,,,,
705900,23148309,2014-11-24,19350201,Leola,"\"This spacious apartment was really lovely, comfortably furnished, and exactly as described. The location is wonderful -- a very pretty part of Boston -- and so convenient to public transportation.  The apartment was immaculately clean, included lots of towels, a well-equipped kitchen, and numerous thoughtful extras such as small bath soaps and shampoo, & dishwashing soaps. There's excellent closet space in the bedroom & a comfortable bed. Two bottles of wine were a very generous \"\"extra\"\" which enabled us"
The only negative during our stay on a cold weekend in November was the temperature in the apartment: it was too hot,even with all of the windows opened. Richard was very quick to offer help as soon as I contacted him. However,even after turning off the radiators,and leaving the windows open,the apt. was still a bit too warm. A Hershey's chocolate bar left on the kitchen counter actually melted while we were out for the day. Possibly the heating in this circa 1899 building was malfunctioning during this time,as we noticed that the windows in the stairwells on other floors were open
Richard was a very attentive host,provided good communication,and obviously strives to provide a good experience.,,,

The accommodations are as described, good basic furnishings, excellent bed! Minor concern was new stove and Richard was as helpful as could be in a pinch. The view is great as is the overall location. Very safe area and close to everything. Highly recommend when you want an in town location."
705900,31180891,2015-05-03,27102425,Alisha,"Richard was an excellent host. If you're in Boston, choose this penthouse suite! It has everything you'll need, and wine is provided :) the public transportation (the T) is a super short walk away, and it's located in the best shopping area in Boston. If you need anything at all, or just have silly tourist questions, Richard is always a phone call away. The top deck on this building is great! Lounge chairs, and a table and chairs for a picnic or sunset viewing :)"

Richard was very prompt in all his replies and the check in was easy and convenient. It is close to trains , shops and lots of restaurants and cafes . It was easy to get to any part of the city from this area but in the end we ended up spending a lot of time in the immediate neighborhood . The amenities provided by Richard were top class and the apartment spacious and well provisioned . I would highly recommend it for a short stay"

It's very clean and comfortable with a small but adequate kitchen if you want to cook , and a lovely living room looking over Commonwealth Ave. It's one street away from the great shopping street Newbury st and an easy walk to Boston common. Thanks for an enjoyable stay !"

705900,51886123,2015-10-25,2907936,Elizabeth,The listing description was accurate.  The space was warm and welcoming. We appreciated the welcome of wine awaiting us as well as the robes and comfortable king size bed.  The location was perfect for our visit with our daughter who's attending college just across the Harvard Bridge.  This Back Bay location affords easy access to all things Boston.

Right next to Newbury Street and public transport and you can walk all the way down to Boston Common on the park path across the street. Richard was a great host. There was wine provided as a welcome, all the instructions to get into the apartment were very clear and the apartment itself was extremely comfortable. We would highly recommend the Carlyle to anyone visiting Boston."

The apartment was spotless-clean, tastefully decorated, cozy, and comfortable. The kitchen was well equipped with plenty of utensils, cookware, and tableware, which was great since we prefer to cook than eat out everyday. I would definitely stay there again next time I'm in Boston and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a first-class accommodation."
705900,65335586,2016-03-13,55781796,Kate,"The Carlyle Penthouse suite was adorable, and we were comfortable immediately.  The location is fabulous - so close the Hynes T stop, and, of course, Uber everywhere.  After our 12hr travel day, it was wonderful to walk in and see a bottle of wine (actually, two - but I'm a white wine gal).  We slept like babes throughout our trip - the bed was so comfortable and the apartment quiet.  Our first Boston day had unseasonably warm weather, so we got to enjoy the warm breezes on the roof deck.  We will definitely remember Spare Suite on future trips to Boston."

The building is situated in a wonderful central area and it is just 5 minute walk to the Haynes Convention Center T station and close to Fenway Park. From the moment we entered the apartment we felt at home: clean,  high ceiling, modern and fully equipped cozy home. There was wine and nice music, and it was the perfect start of a wonderful spring vacation. We hope to come back soon.  We had all the privacy we were looking for.

However,the 10am checkout time is a major drawback. While this is an Airbnb and not a hotel,the cost is comparable to that of a luxury hotel. Having to wake up early in order to clean up/cook/get ready is an unnecessary,"added stress.\"",,
2634499,18460583,2014-08-26,13685188,Cristian,Great communication with Quinn and he was very helpful to allow me to check in earlier and even on short notice. Easy to communicate with him and he is always available to reply to any query very fast.
The room is big and comfortable and there are enough bathrooms in the house available. It feels a bit like a hotel at times but this makes it easy if you just need a room.,,,,,
The location is a bit far from downtown but very close to the airport and you have easy access to the beach. There is the metro nearby so getting to Downtown is easy.,,,,,

Didn't have to worry about disturbing others when coming in late because rooms are private and separated from shared common area. It was nice to be able to check out but store our bags for a while. Super convenient location to food and print shop as well as restaurants and the train station. Coin washing is a plus. Public beach down the street a nice plus.

"If you like \"\"down to earth\"\" living and experiencing \"\"the real Boston\"\" this is the place to stay.

It was perfect for what we needed and we'll be back.  (URL HIDDEN) seems like a lot of people have left their basic cosmetics (new shampoo",lotions,"toothpaste etc) maybe due to flying and not checking (URL HIDDEN) if you are coming in...there's bathroom products already there...we added ours to the mix...checkin in was seamless when we checked the mailbox:)\"",,,
2634499,34256639,2015-06-06,13839499,Angie,"This is not your desired airbnb experience. It is more of a hostel/guest house where each guest (and here are many rooms) has their own room and shares a bathroom and kitchen. It's useful for the airport. May was kind and let us keep our bad in to basement for a week while we travelled overseas. However, the bathroom is not clean. The kitchen is useless- not even a mug to make tea or coffee. His place is very expensive for what thou get-- but so is Boston. You don't get the 'local experience' staying here. It's not different to a cheap motel or hostel only less clean in some cases. But if you just need a close to the airport to rest your head for a night it's fine."

I had two clean towels and clean sheets on the bed. I never saw hosts and doubt anyone does. Many, Many keys are outside in a non-secure mail box.The front doors of each duplex unit were open when I arrived during the day. When I got back at night, the front doors were closed and locked. My room door had a door knob with no lock from the inside. It did have a chain with a sliding catch on it on my side. Not much protection from an intruder if one happened by...Anyone could have opened my door a few inches and looked inside at anytime. If you are very independent and aren't too worried about security, then stay here. The duplex is less than 2 blocks from the T station which is great. From the bathroom, you can hear the engines of the planes rev up for take off from Logan. It's any easy T ride to Logan. My room had a window air conditioner. Your name and arrival/departure dates will be listed on a piece of paper in a plastic pocket on your room door."

However, I was told the room would be ready for check-in at 4pm; when I arrived at about 6:30pm, the bedding had not yet been changed, and used towels were hanging on the door knob. I went out for a couple of hours, and when I returned the room had been cleaned. Other than that, it was a very pleasant experience. I was a bit concerned about parking, but that worked out fine, as well. Thanks."

Clean sheets, towels, and hand towels were ready as well as some used shower supplies left in the bathrooms. We did not use the kitchen much except for needing water to drink, but unfortunately, the other guests left dirty dishes out. Other than that, this location is very close to a metro station on the blue line."

Hotel of 3rd class disguise in a room in a guest house. This house shouldn't be part of Airbnb because it doesn't respect its rules,principles. It's our badest experience in Airbnb.,,,,
From the outside,the crumling house and the badly kept garden seems abandoned. The owner didn't welcome us.,,,,
The inside : an old-fashioned decoration,and the most shocking,pieces of paper on each room (there are five) with number of room,number of people and name of the host (totally impersonal).,,
We were three people and had the smallest room and the only one with only one bed. There was a camp bed for our daughter with BLANKETS by way of mattress !!,,,,,
Bathrooms and kitchen dirty : hair everywhere in the bathroom and in the kitchen,dirty dishes in the sink,leftovers of breakfast cereal on the floor.,,,
Washing machines unusable because there were always full.,,,,,

There was one light bulb that worked in the room out of six and when I first woke up that one was out too.  It magically turned back on after I texted the hosts.

Todos fueron muy amables y nos facilitaron un lugar donde dejar el equipaje a la salida por unas horas. Había productos de higiene y facilita toallas, además se podía utilizar la cocina. Se fumaba en un balcón de la casa, así que dentro no había humo. Muy cerca del aeropuerto y a 5 minutos del metro. No encontramos supermercados cerca, sólo una pizzería. La cama es de tamaño queen y muy cómoda. Tiene aire acondicionado y el wifi funciona muy bien! Sin pérdidas de conexión. Aunque no conocimos al anfitrión responde rápidamente los mensajes. Hay que tener en cuenta que para acceder  a la casa hay 6 grandes escalones y luego una escalera empinada,ya dentro de la casa,que es una típica casa bostoniana. Vecindario tranquilo y seguro, no encontramos malas pintas. Se puede volver sin miedo por la noche. A veces se escucha despegar a los aviones.

Shelley was very accessible and answered any text messages almost immediately during my stay.  This was my first airbnb experience, so I was nervous about staying in a stranger’s home, but Shelley made me feel like a family member as soon as I walked in her home.  The train station is a 10 minute walk away or you can use Uber to just about anywhere in the city for less than $10.00.

When we arrived she told us she was now renting 2 rooms, which meant that we had to share the bathroom with strangers. Knowing this we would not have accepted or booked. Unfortunately this was not the only negative point. The bedroom was nice but not clean and really full of dust, as if not cleaned for weeks, which we both found disgusting. Especially knowing that it was rented all the time. I would of course expect a clean room and the pieces of dust were large and more than obvious. This was our first experience with airbnb, and we found it difficult to critizise being in a private household. And I'm not sure we will use it again but i guess we should give it another chance..."

I was in contact with her through text, so I didn't feel out of place or alone in a new city. She often said, \"\"text me if you need anything"
The room was a good size,with a very comfortable bed and a TV equipped with DirectTV. I had access to a half-bathroom upstairs right next to the room,and a full-bathroom downstairs. She had clean towels for me to use,and all of the basic necessities for a quick stay in Boston.,,
"I would HIGHLY recommend staying with her.\"",,,,,
3727560,23805930,2014-12-10,10317360,Theodore,"Shelley was welcoming, and communication with her before my arrival was superb.  The room and bed were very comfortable, and the off street parking was nice to have in Boston.  As titled, the the room/house were quite charming."
As mentioned elsewhere,there is a second room listed in the house.  So,"you may be sharing a bathroom during your stay.\"",,,
3727560,24257425,2014-12-23,16192119,Alex,"Shelley was a great host and my stay at her place, though short, made me felt at home. Her house is gorgeous, listing is very accurate. Shelley is welcoming and easy-going."
3727560,24964296,2015-01-04,24640181,Yvonne,Shelley is a friendly host. Her house is pretty too. There are cats in her house which my boyfriend loves them so much haha. Shelley's place is very clean. I highly recommend this to anyone going to Boston. :) Thanks Shelley so much for hosting us!!
3727560,25636416,2015-01-21,25350910,Catherine,"Shelley was very welcoming although we only saw her once during our 5-day stay. The house is charming and the bedroom is lovely, and the location is great - a short walk to the T and then a very few stops into central Boston."
The only downside is that the doors to the bedroom,bathroom,and loo don't lock,"which wasn't a problem at all but doesn't feel very private!\"",,
3727560,27317531,2015-03-02,24339421,Jeffery,Great place to stay! Shelley is very nice and a great host. She had coffee that was a major plus.
3727560,27706851,2015-03-09,28809637,Heather,"Shelley was great to work with! Her house is so beautiful, the cats were adorable and friendly, and the whole house smelled like vanilla :) the house is located very close to the bus station and it was easy to transfer to the T line."
Thank you Shelley for a wonderful stay!,,,,,
"I would highly recommend this for anyone visiting that wants a more comforting and inviting stay then at a hotel. \"",,,,,
3727560,27906951,2015-03-14,18294031,James,"Shelly was a great host.  very accommodating, nice and helpful."
3727560,28671884,2015-03-28,29074646,Richard,"Shelley was not around much during my stay, but left things out for me, and was contactable via email and phone. Her home is a lovely old wooden house from the mid 19th century, with a partly sloping ceiling in the room. The bed is very comfortable. The two cats are very content and keep to themselves, but do manage to leave their hair about the place and scatter a few grains outside the room where the litter tray is. I walked everywhere (about half an hour into town), so am not sure about local transport options."
3727560,28897692,2015-03-31,5762436,Cassy,"Shelley was a most welcoming and friendly host. Her home was a living monument to times past, with fabulous antique furniture, and the original features of an old Bostonian home. The bedroom was spacious and the bed very comfortable. Shelley's place is located very close to public transport routes."
3727560,30441889,2015-04-22,3965781,Adrian,Shelley's house was very comfortable and was only a 10 minute walk to the T station from which you are only a handful of stops from downtown. Shelley was very helpful and gave us directions and recommendations of what to do in the area. There were 2 other guests at the house so we did have to share a half bathroom but also had access to a full bathroom downstairs. We had a great stay in Boston for the Marathon.
3727560,30651003,2015-04-25,31623730,Joseph,"Shelley had a very nice house. Since my mom and I both stayed there, she actually gave us a room with 2 beds. We came a bit later than expected, but Shelley was very accommodating. She is a very friendly person and has 2  friendly cats."
3727560,31058614,2015-05-01,29568727,Tristan,"Great, exactly what I was looking for.  She was very helpful and able to accommodate me getting in late.  It was close to where I needed to be and parking was included.  Sad I didn't get to see it at all in the day or spend any time there."
3727560,31740995,2015-05-09,32257061,Stephanie,"Shelley was a lovely host. We didn't interact with her very much during our stay, but she was always very helpful, and so friendly."
Her house is around a 20 minute bus ride from downtown Boston; (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) has the trip as around an hour walk. The neighborhood has not been gentrified,but it did not feel unsafe. The house is 2-3 stops away from Flour,Myers and Chang,and the best of what the South End has to offer. I found it very easy to get around during my stay.,,
The house itself is a little older,but cozy and welcoming. The room was small,"but comfortable. I would say that Shelley's home is a good value for the money.\"",,,
3727560,31848388,2015-05-10,32600524,Johnathan,"Great time in Boston,  Shelley was an absolute hero and single handedly delivered us to the wedding we came to attend but almost missed. We would definitely recommend Shelley to other visitors."
3727560,32160315,2015-05-15,23925819,Javier,Great stay with Shelley. We were travelling and it was an ideal place  for three days.
3727560,32915667,2015-05-23,19866181,Stella,"Shelly's place was just what we were looking for, a quiet bedroom to retire after our adventures in Boston during the day. Great bathrooms, a comfy bed, and everything as pictured."
The address is a little quirky,which caused trouble for our uber drivers,"but if you're driving or taking public transit you won't have any problems.\"",,,
3727560,33082894,2015-05-25,484092,Gina,"Communication with Shelley was fine, she was not in town when my friend and I stayed which was not a problem, she left keys and instructions for us so it was all good. However I will say that I was surprised to learn on the day of check-in someone else was staying. I realised afterwards it is cross-listed as a 2 bedroom stay. It felt a bit odd then sharing a bathroom with this other person as we didn't feel it was sold to us in this way."
My friend and I did not feel entirely comfortable in the neighbourhood,that could be a personal thing but we are very different from each other and both felt it from the outset.,,,,
"I will also say the reality of the house was different from what is portrayed in the photos on the website.\"",,,,,
3727560,33662631,2015-05-31,5499774,Anna,"Easy to find, comfortable room, close to the bus station and a solid WiFi connection. Shelley was a great help and went out of her way to make our stay comfortable. A great base from which to explore Boston."
3727560,33876290,2015-06-01,20784393,Marc,Shelley was an amazing host and the location made it very easy to commute to downtown! I definitely recommend staying here! A++++. Also my fiancée was in love with her cats -- they are super friendly.

3727560,35095453,2015-06-15,824853,Eliot,Host very friendly. Comfortable room. Integrated working class neighborhood.
3727560,35231807,2015-06-16,30859852,Nicole,"Shelley was very helpful staying in touch as we travelled to Boston, making sure we knew how to get to her house from the airport via a free bus ride and a short Uber trip. The room is quite comfortable and is well represented by the pictures. We just came in and out over a 24 hour period, and we saw her as we were leaving, for the first time. It's the cutest house on the street, which is set back from the street, with a nice little garden outside of the house. Very charming. Especially with the kitties!"
3727560,35728276,2015-06-21,139131,Julien,"Shelley's place is a lovely quiet house, walking distance to all the transport options we needed and very clean and comfortable. Shelley was really welcoming and friendly, with plenty of tips and advice for how to get around Boston. Great stay!"
3727560,36094458,2015-06-25,6413849,Evie,"Shelley left the key for us outside as she was going to an event out of town, and because of our schedules, we didn't see her at all. A sticky note was on the door of the room we were meant to use, and that's it! Please note: SHE HAS CATS !!! This is not written anywhere in the listing, and it should be. We two very allergic-to-cats people did ok, though, by staying out of the house except to sleep (that room was closed off to the cats -- at least there was no cat hair around)."
Later that evening,we brought back some groceries to microwave,but had trouble finding plates. Also,towels weren't left out,so we were unable to take a shower.,
The bed was very comfortable,and although there's no a/c in the room,the fans kept the air moving on this very warm evening.,,,
We had to leave for an early flight the next morning and tried to be as quiet as possible,"but it was squeaky. Hope we didn't disturb anyone!\"",,,,
3727560,36453366,2015-06-28,4873435,Simon,"Shelley is a very nice and accommodating host, and her house is one of a kind. Nothing in there is modern or new, which gives it undeniable charm, though it might not appeal to everyone (no AC for instance). The house is conveniently located near public transportation and there is a great little sandwich place nearby for a quick lunch or dinner. Parking was easy, which was a big plus for me."
3727560,38332261,2015-07-14,37246211,Meghan,"Shelley was a great host.  She left the keys in a location we discussed along with instructions on how to get inside.  Before we got there, she instructed us to take a bus from the airport - take the silver bus, not the blue bus! Then it is a ten minute uber ride to her home from South Station. If you are not accustomed to diversity - this is not the place for you. We used public transportation by day and uber at night.  I was comfortable with the neighborhood by day but felt most comfortable taking an uber home late at night - much like I do in Chicago. She has cats that keep to themselves. House is very clean. Half bath upstairs by bedrooms - both of which are airbnb listings. Shower is downstairs in a full bathroom. We stayed when it was unseasonable hot in Boston and luckily did not spend too much time in the house/bedroom because there is no A/C and it was sooo hot upstairs."
3727560,40282760,2015-07-29,10000200,John,Shelley was a very accommodating host. She went out of her way to help us during our brief stay.

Even though we did not meet her until the next day, we know everything we Had too to get by."
We talked with her on the second day for a good half hour,she is really Nice.,,,,

3727560,42619827,2015-08-14,20893400,ZhengOu,"It's a fancy house but maybe unsuitable for every guest I think. The house is not only in an old-style, it's really really old. You'll received a long rules for 8 pages. It's a little hard to take a bath downstairs since the bedroom on the loft. There are two giant  and wired cats in black looked like some witch's one. And you maybe not see the hostess during the days you stay in...But I like that! I think travel is just a special journey to find some difference in the same earth. I'll introduce the house to my friends who likes fancy experience. How do you think about yourself?"
3727560,43214210,2015-08-18,11387761,Maj,Shelley was a great host. She have a nice home and my friend and I really enjoyed our stay in her nice and cozy house.
We used the fridge for breakfast which was a great opportunity. There was air condition in our big great room which was very necessary.,,,,,
"I will recommend Shelley as a host anytime. \"",,,,,
3727560,43572409,2015-08-20,40989375,Preston,"I only had $300+ hotel options left in Boston during a large conference. Airbnb was the only option for my budget, so I joined and gave it a go. The hostess of first booking never confirmed, and I had to wait over 24 hours to try again.  The host of my 2nd booking accepted right away. But later cancelled when he said the guest before me wouldn't check out in time to get ready for my 5pm arrival. Shelley accepted and everything was as described. It was a sweltering week in Boston, and her house (like most there) does not have central AC. The lower level was hot, but she had a good window unit in the guest room, and I slept very well."
3727560,47969311,2015-09-22,5358313,Zhaohua,"房子在波士顿的住宅区附近。离地铁站步行距离十分钟,我和我男朋友非常喜欢房间里的三只猫,但如果不是宠物爱好者,可能会觉得屋子里略有猫味,猫毛也可能会造成一些困扰。总的来说,二楼的卧室房间舒适优雅,除了洗澡时需要下楼,一切都称得上便利。"
3727560,49857940,2015-10-06,2809965,Mathias,Shelley was waiting for us when we came in. She gave us a short introduction to the house and room and provided us with a second blanket and an air matress -  which obviously was the second bed mentioned in the description.
The room is not very spacious,but ok - we had a lot of luggage. There is another room which was rented to another couple and a bath room on the same floor with toilet and sink.,,,,
The main bathroom with shower is downstairs.,,,,,
Everything was clean. Shelley has some lovely cats which are really nice.,,,,,
Location is ok and near the city. Parking in the driveway was not offered to us,but was no problem at all omn the street.

Her home is beautiful and our room was clean and cozy. Shelley made us feel welcome and comfortable and seemed more than happy to answer questions and offer recommendations for transportation, dining, etc. Cab rides from her home to some of Boston's coolest neighborhoods are short and inexpensive. We had a lovely experience!"

Its located 2 minutes from Dudley square..where you find all the bus connections, citybikes, and super nice coffeebars & restaurants. Great  atmosphere..people live  here..everywhere low wooden houses, with a view on the highrise touristic city on a (safe:))distance."
The room has (old) windows,tv,airco,lots of decoration and a perfect big bed. Its a pity the bathroom is downstairs but that s why you dont pay double the price i guesse. The house is old..dont expect luxery but atmosphere and cosyness.(bonus: lovely cat). Btw super silent!,,
The host is how you wish a host to be. Sharing,helpfull,"kind. I was extremely happy with the very late check in..No problem at all. Always prompt reply by (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) or sms.

She was there when we arrived and gave us some good options for food places and directions to help us in the morning to find where we were going. It was a great location and cost around $10 using Uber to get from her home to the downtown building we needed to go to. Shelley went above and beyond to assist in making the stay amazing! Always there is i had a question and we were able to text before and during the stay to make everything go great. They only downfall and this has NOTHING to do with Shelley or her home was lots of restaurants in the walking area closed at 9pm. Normally that would be a non issue but our flight was delayed and when we got from Airport to Shelley's House to getting out for food it was already 845pm. Other that that it was my first time using AirBNB and it was great, perfect for us! Thank you again Shelley and see you again!"

The apartment itself was very comfortable, it is a third walk up without elevator (but we knew this going in) so plan luggage accordingly. Very close to Fenway and great restaurants and shopping. Walking distance from pretty much everything, the T station is about a block away."

Biggest draw was the location - 1 block from my conference at Hynes center and right in the midst of back bay shopping.  Place itself was very clean and well-kept, keypad entry to building and unit was a breeze and nice to not have to worry about a key exchange.  Overall this is a very professional setup - it appeared that the entire building is short-term rentals; places probably don't have the character of staying in someone's actual place (as some airbnb-er's seek) but honestly I prefer this."

5791960,54121956,2015-11-16,22884194,Albert,The apartment was well located on Newbury St in the heart of Back Bay. It was exactly as advertised and easily met our expectations. A guest should bring or buy soap for the bath or shower. The kitchen is well stocked with appliances and cooking utensils but no spices or other foodstuffs.
5791960,54710908,2015-11-23,2339212,Andy,Fantastic location in Back Bay neighborhood. The apartment was easy to find and very comfortable. Clear instructions about how to access the apartment and to get around. Wonderful place to stay!

5791960,77392035,2016-05-31,1444485,Naxin,"The apartment is at the perfect location, and has everything we need. Check-in/out was very easy and Brent was responsive to our questions. Just keep in mind that there is no elevator in the building, if you have a lot of luggages or require elevator access."
5791960,77904784,2016-06-04,21619129,Ann,The apartment suited us perfectly and we had no need to contact the host while we were there. This three story walk up had all we needed (except there was no shower soap) and it was clean and confortable in a perfect location! The couch sleeper was comfortable too and we would stay there again.
5791960,84517161,2016-07-07,59493828,Marin,"Fantastic location. Couldn't be better. Close to shops, restaurants, T, Fenway, Charles River. Loved it! Modern and clean."

14591627,96371426,2016-08-22,9316519,Jason,"This was my first trip to Boston, and I really lucked out finding John’s listing. Having my own room and bath was exactly what I was looking for and it was also within my budget as a lone traveler. The accommodations are clean, safe, and comfortable and appear recently updated."
John was a most gracious host,responsive to my inquiries and accommodating when my arrival flight was delayed.  He provided thorough details of how to get around on public transportation (Silver and Orange Lines are within blocks),although I discovered most everywhere I wanted to go was perfectly walkable.  The house is a quintessential “Boston” Brownstone Row-house (though John describes it more accurately) surrounded by the SoWa art district,intimate neighborhood restaurants,and parks.,
I really wouldn’t change a thing.  I probably got spoiled a little since I was John’s first Airbnb guest,but he was a friendly,helpful and genuine host and I wish him much success in his Airbnb endeavors.,,,
"Highly recommended.\"",,,,,
14591627,96847438,2016-08-24,91171527,Nathan,"John was an incredible host, the type all Airbnb hosts should be! John was the best host anyone in our group has ever dealt with through Airbnb. No joke. He went beyond what we expected to ensure our stay was comfortable and enjoyable all-around. He was quick to respond to all communications prior, during, and after our stay. Located in the South End, his place is in a perfect location to walk to many of the Boston tourist staples, as well as countless local favorites. It's also located near the subway to take you just about anywhere around the city. As a host, John had lots of suggestions on restaurants, entertainment, and must-sees during our stay. He's lived in the area for over a decade and can guide you to some hidden gems! The interior of John's condo was beautiful and incredibly clean. While this is a shared space, John is very receptive to being as available as you'd like; whether that's hanging around or doing your own thing, you'll have no issues. We can't express enough how much we enjoyed staying with John in Boston and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to anyone passing through. This was an incredible value for a beautiful space in Boston, excellent location, and a host who was very easy to work with! Thanks again, John!"
14591627,97349457,2016-08-27,11554223,Mira,"Fantastic experience! Beautiful and pristine hotel-grade room with en suite bathroom in a charming Boston brownstone. Quiet and conveniently located neighborhood, easy access to public transport. John was a wonderful and gracious host, providing a delicious breakfast and even offering to pick me up from the train station. Would book again in a heartbeat -- highly recommended!"
14591627,97831869,2016-08-28,69720024,Micka,John had a bottle of wine waiting on arrival. He had lots of great information about the area and what we could do. The room was VERY clean and comfortable. Very happy with our stay. Thanks again!!
10164810,63922517,2016-02-28,18799543,Kristen,"Harriette was a great host and overall very responsive. The apartment was clean and in order when we arrived and the building is lovely and in a wonderful location - easy to get to any part of the city. Keypad access made it easier to get in and out of the building and when I needed to check out later than expected Harriette responded to my request promptly and provided a new access code. Overall, it was a good experience and I would suggest this apartment to anyone looking to stay in the area."
10164810,74497326,2016-05-15,50983922,Rj,We had a great time at the apartment! Within walking distance to a good number of shops and restaurants. The rooftop view is a great look at the entire city.

Very quiet and lovely neighborhood to walk around in and a short 5 min walk to fun and lively bars and restaurants.  The place itself was nice and clean.  The host was also very responsive and helpful.  We had a late flight on the day we checked out and the office allowed us to keep our bags while we ran around Boston on our last day.
10164810,82156943,2016-06-26,1136670,Marie,"We had a great time in Boston. The location of the apartment is perfect, next to grocery stores,  gourmet restaurants, bakeries, parks for kids."
The apartment we rent was located on the 3rd floor with no elevator,so not convenient for family with kids (no storage strollers),but perfect for couples who want discover Boston.,,,

4573388,29822472,2015-04-13,27003590,Kevin,"The apartment was ideal for our needs. We were out and about most of the time and basically only slept at the apt. Beds were comfortable and shower was great.  Location was excellent,close to transportation, not far from the airport and short walking distance  to Quincy Market,  TD Garden , Boston Common,  as well a ton of great Italian restaurants,cafes and gelatarias."

4573388,32053637,2015-05-13,13274590,Bernhard,"The apartment is located in the charming Northend. Lots of nice spots are just around the corner. The apartment itself is really nice and spacious and offers all faciliets that ensure an enjoyable stay. As it is a flat which is professional rented out no condiments will be found, leading to the fact that if you intend to used the well equipped kitchen you have to buy the stuff or bring it with you. We really enjoyed our stay and the set up is quite and cosy. If you follow the instruction that Dror is providing to you, you will have no problems to get the keys and find the apartment. Dror is a fast responder and the administrative stuff was handled very professional."

4573388,46466758,2015-09-11,31357347,Jim,"We stayed in Boston for three nights and were very pleased with this rental. The apartment was as advertised and easily accommodated our group of four. We enjoyed our stay in the North End and were able to walk to countless restaurants, shops, and attractions throughout the downtown area. This apartment is highly recommended for anyone planning a stay Boston!"
4573388,46652072,2015-09-12,21416119,Emma,"We didn't meet Dror, but he provided really clear and straight-forward instructions for key collection, which was easier than I'd expected.  The apartment was definitely compact and the stairs are quite steep and difficult with luggage, but I think that's the price for the good location and historic building.  The location was excellent in Little Italy (lots of good cafes and bars) and the apartment was very clean and had everything required.  Overall I would stay again, however probably not for more than 1 or 2 nights just due to the size."
4573388,49046287,2015-09-30,34438646,Julie,Our stay was wonderful and location was perfect for Boston. Will book here next time we travel to Boston.
4573388,49484678,2015-10-04,43010729,Kurt,"Wow! What a great apartment in the best location in all of Boston (ok, that may only be true of you love being immersed in American history, love eating incredible Italian and seafood, and enjoy sipping an ale or two in some of the most interesting, oldest pubs in the country).  The rental process could not have been simpler, and Dror provided plenty of helpful tips and ideas for his guests. Can't wait to come back :-)"
4573388,51022404,2015-10-17,12364341,Elizabeth,"The host was very proactive is sending us useful information on the neighbourhood and how to access the apartment before our stay, unfortunately the wrong keys had been left for us but this was fairly quickly resolved after a couple of phone calls."
The apartment was perfect for our stay,"in a great neighbourhood with lots of restaurants and walking distance to all we wanted to do in Boston. There was enough equipment in the kitchen for the limited cooking that we did. The rooms are fairly small but that it to be expected in a city apartment and the lounge area accommodated four of us comfortably. Overall this was a great base for a couple of days exploring the city.\"",,,,
4573388,51423187,2015-10-20,15327540,Kathy,"We absolutely loved staying in the apartment on Moon Street.  It was clean and welcoming, plenty of room for the four of us.  The location in the North End is perfect.  There is so much to see and do as you walk the streets and smell the aromas of Italy in the heart of Boston."
4573388,51889149,2015-10-25,38824786,Karen,"Great location, right in the middle of Little Italy so plenty of restaurants (recommend North Street Grill for breakfast - just around the corner) and walking distance to the harbour and Fanueil Hall Marketplace (great for dinner& shopping!). Train station just 5 minutes walk away and only 10 minutes taxi ride from airport. And it was surprisingly quiet for a city location - even with the windows open."
Apartment was comfortable,fast wifi,good TV,beds good to sleep on (my 13YO son slept on the sofa bed in the living room area and found it very comfortable for the 2 nights he slept on it),fresh linen and towels,really appreciated the complimentary soaps
"Only negative is to be aware that this apartment is on the third floor and the last lot of steps are especially steep (my mum stayed with us and in her 70's she found the stairs do-able but challenging - I certainly wouldn't have been happy with her walking up by herself if we weren't there to help) but if you are fine with stairs then I would definitely recommend this place. \"",,,,,
4573388,53145529,2015-11-05,47206918,Wade,Listing was great. Was there for a business trip and would pick this place going forward over a hotel. Super convenient and close to downtown

4573388,53605433,2015-11-10,932830,Heather,"This charming apartment is in a great location--just a couple blocks from the waterfront, ample restaurants nearby, and only a few minutes walk to the train station so you can hop to any other of Boston's neighborhoods. There were some miscommunications with the real estate office (who sends the confirmation/instruction emails) and the super (who is the one on hand if you have an immediate concern while there), as well as a problem with the offsite lockbox where you retrieve the keys. Other than that, it was a pleasant stay."

Dror and company communicated everything very thoroughly to us prior to our arrival and the key pick up was super easy. Dror's place is a cozy nest up three flights of stairs in a fantastic little Italy neighborhood with tons of great restaurants, cafes and pastry bakeries nearby. Walking distance to the Aquarium, which is why we were there! Would come again for sure!"
4573388,55566613,2015-12-02,1109035,Alexander,"Place was nice; looks as advertised. The apartment, and all others in at the address except for one, are rented out through Airbnb."
On the 3rd floor,and stairs are a bit narrow,so be ready to carry your stuff up!,,,
Good location; close to the main street in the North End and to Downtown Boston.,,,,,
There's an elementary school across the street,"so it gets a little loud around 8 or 9am.\"",,,,

Walkable distance from Quincy Market,TD Garden,and so many restaurants.,,,
The whole process,from booking to departure,was very,very organized,and Dror (or his helpers) were easily joinable.,
"Getting there by car might prove tricky; (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) map your directions as most streets are one way and there are several Y junctions.  I recommend finding a long term parking in the area and leave your vehicle there for your whole stay.  You can literally walk anywhere from there (or take public transportation).\"",,,,,

"My wife and Kids LOVED staying in this apartment!\"",,,,,
4573388,69269227,2016-04-10,36154814,Zach,This apartment was a great location in the North End/Little Italy area of Boston. The apartment is down the street from Paul Revere's house with many restaurants and shops near by. I suggest getting Canoli's from one of the many pastry shops. The hall of the apartment building does not smell the best however inside the apartment smells fine. This would not be a good location for anyone who struggles with steep stairs.
4573388,70886493,2016-04-21,3611129,Jayaram,It was very easy to reserve. The checkin (and checkout) is handled by a third party real estate company through a lockbox. Very easy and painless. Third floor of a building without an elevator. The apartment is small but very nice. The best part is it us right in the middle of North End and downtown and Boston common are all within 5-15 minute walk. Really enjoyed our stay and highly recommended!
4573388,72917938,2016-05-05,37085961,Stephen,Wonderful experience.  Run by professional prop management so key retrieval and available hotline make checkin easy.  Clean and simple apartment perfect for a short business stay in Boston.

Mike's Pastry, Modern Pastry, Ernesto's Pizza, Anthony's by the Waterfront (GREAT breakfast), Villa Francesca; Going Bananas (groceries) all within walking distance.  My family and I walked to our destinations 90% of the time. Beds are comfortable.  My family of 4 fit perfectly but we could have squeezed in one more easily.  Dror was accessible for even mundane questions.  Thank you, Dror for opening your home to us.  Awesome!"

4573388,90699325,2016-08-01,10418591,Laurie,The neighborhood is great.  We liked the proximity of the Boston (URL HIDDEN) need to go to Whole Foods for fresh vegetables and meats. We walked almost everywhere and used the MBTA when we wanted to go to Cambridge and the Museum of Fine Arts.
For those who don't want to drive into Boston,"we recommend taking the ferry from Hingham or Salem. We parked in the Hingham Wharf parking for $4 a day for three days.  Certainly beats parking in the North End!\"",,,,

The location is simply great, your near to some really good restaurants, not far from the harbour and whale watching, not far from the airport and not far to explore the city itaelf. The only negativ poibt was, that the appartment was not yet ready at 2pm when we arrived and the cleaning was still going on. everything else was fine. But be aware, that the appartment is not huge in size and on the 3rd floor, with all our luggage it was quite cramped."

13753007,88389344,2016-07-24,62785130,Rahman,I start with the good things. Ann (owner/manager) was extremely responsive to my messages. I had a private room in a unit shared with three others who were polite and friendly and helped me when I asked for. The location is really good in terms of access to transportation. A bus stop is within a few minutes walking distance and a subway station is 15 minutes walk.
I was happy with my room,although it was a little dusty,but the bathroom,shower,and kitchen needed extreme cleaning. I especially had problem with the mold all over the shower curtain,and the bathroom floor that was not clean at all. There was also a bad smell in the lobby of the building.

It fit the four of us (and our 2 infants) very comfortably.  The beds were so comfortable, which was very important to me before and after running the Boston Marathon. The fully stocked kitchen made it easy for us to cook meals at home rather than needing to eat out. We loved the great assortment of books in the living room, as well. I think each of us picked up a book to read while on our stay. Anne (the caretaker) was able to let us in right when we arrived and gave us the run down of the building and neighborhood. The apartment is very near to the B, C, and D trains on the green line which made getting around very easy."

It's about a 5-10 min walk to the nearest T stop, and there was also a very convenient bus that stops about 2 mins away that will bring you right to downtown Boston.

Tricia was very prompt in communication and even let me stop by and have a tour of the place before my family arrived. My uncle had to arrive earlier than we anticipated (a few hours before the check in time), and Tricia made sure he was able to have a place to rest. She was so friendly and kind. My family will definitely remember her fondly."
The house is beautiful - a great place to stay in the summer (or any season). It is well furnished and inviting. The kitchen and dining area are highly functional,and overlook her lovely backyard. Abundant windows let in so much natural light. It was a great place to stay. Highly recommend!,,,,

We were on her front porch and were concerned when she didn't answer the door. I left her a phone message and then looked at the reservation and realized my error. Just then she called and said she would be there in 15 minuted to brainstorm. While waiting we checked for nearby motels and most were booked or very expensive. She offered us her daughter's room in the basement (she was out of state) and the four of us, me, my wife and 2 adult children were lucky to have a place to stay. The next morning the people staying in the apartment left and Tricia had our room ready quickly. She had juice, bacon, eggs, muffins and fruit stocked up for us in refrigerator. Everything was as we had imagined, very nice, just as we had seen in the reviews and pictures. Thank you Tricia for an amazing stay and for saving us the first night."

We loved our stay. Thanks for everything!"

Tricia is a kind host who is happy to chat and answer any questions guests might have. She has a cool cat named Zeke, who popped in for a couple visits, and a lovable old dog Reina. A vacation rental this spacious is rare in the city, and particularly at such an affordable price! It was worth it for us, but guests should expect some inconveniences. For one, without a rental car, we had to walk a LOT and navigate many stairs--a number of steep steps up to the 2-story flat, & a long cement stairway between houses that functions as a short-cut toward the town center, a 15- to 18- minute walk away. This is the place to stroll, have dinner, a beer, or an ice cream at one-of-a-kind pubs, parlors, and eateries. The market is in the opposite direction and is also a 15-20-minute walk from the house. The Jamaica Plain area is about a half-hour subway ride from Boston proper; it's at the end of the orange line at the Forest Hills stop, which is about a 10-minute walk to the flat. With luggage, it's impossible, so best to grab a cab or Uber to the house. None of this was a huge deal for us, as we took our time and were in no hurry, hanging around the house many mornings. The apt. has no air-conditioning, so we were lucky in having weather in the 80s (fahrenheit) for our week in August; we enjoyed the breezes through the open windows &--being from parched Southern Calif.--reveled when a day of rain came. We enjoyed the beautiful green woodsy view out back through a wall of windows in the wonderful, large kitchen overlooking the backyard. However, if the temp. slides into the 90s, the place gets too hot. On our last night after a 90+ degree day, our daughter needed to move down from the top floor. We liked the gorgeous, bright kitchen & the delightful Spanish-style bathroom, though the beds were a bit too firm for us and all were doubles, no queens. But there were 4 to choose from! We essentially had all we needed, plus the charm of residing in someone's vintage, well-lived-in home. Thanks Tricia! (I even read one of the books on her shelves.) We were content to give up TV-viewing for the week, as the one TV had very limited programming. It appeared, however, that we could have run DVDs, but we chose to spend our down-time cooking, eating, and reading, while our daughter went online in the front living room, where the wifi worked best. Finally, we were amazed at the generous supply of whole, unprocessed breakfast foods that Tricia supplied for our first couple of mornings in Boston. That was over and above anything we'd had in our many other rentals. It was indeed a personal, unique, and..."

One suggestion tricia..maybe some blinds in the upstairs bedrooms..they have no curtains.  It gets quite bright in the early mornings.,,,,,
Fantastic stay and would defo come back to Boston again in the future.  Great city.,,,,,
Thanks again tricia,,,,,

There was plenty of space to sit and socialize in the living room area, and the kitchen was well supplied to make meals during our stay. The location was excellent. It was very close to a T station and there are lots of great restaurants within easy walking distance. Tricia was friendly and provided us with help when we needed it, but also a sense of privacy and independence. Highly recommended."

4583526,57248591,2015-12-23,2612897,Jason,Amazing place! To be honest 200 times better than the picture! Super welcoming host and really convince location. Best Airbnb place ever period.
4583526,67830004,2016-03-31,46172712,Gregory,I stayed at Tricia's home in JP for several months in the winter of 2016. The place exceeded expectations and was very lager and accommodating for me and 3 other colleagues who I shared the house with during this time. Any issues that we had - which were extremely rare and minor - were promptly addressed. In addition the area was very nice and we had easy and quick access to where we were all working at the time in downtown Boston.
I would definitely recommend again to someone interested in Boston,"especially for a long term stay.\"",,,,
4583526,68630248,2016-04-05,50657359,Justine,Tricia was wonderful and very helpful throughout our entire stay. We had to leave a bit later than expected and she was very accommodating and understanding. The house was very spacious and cozy at the same time. It has washer and dryer which was a very big help for us. My friends and I fell in love with the big windows and lounge sofas in the living room as we would chill together over there.  We greatly enjoyed our stay in Tricia's home and look forward to coming back to Boston.
4583526,69304278,2016-04-10,1795393,Jeff,"Perfect location, quiet residential street but right by downtown JP, arboretum, pond, etc.  The apartment itself is very nice too - tons of space!  We stayed with two young kids and there was lots of space to play, etc. (and great neighborhood to walk around with kids, too)."
4583526,70468148,2016-04-18,50447179,Cori,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and I'm so glad it was with Tricia! She answered all of my questions before we arrived (I had plenty!), and was super friendly and accommodating. The house was huge! Plenty of room for the six of us, plus we were able to host meals for friends in Boston in the spacious kitchen without a problem. Tricia left us some breakfast staples upon our arrival- SO appreciated! Very close walking distance to the T station, including some nearby restaurants (try the Dogwood!). Loved our experience with Tricia and her house, I only wish I had a reason to return to Boston soon!"
4583526,71321527,2016-04-24,7480215,Sarai,"Our stay at Tricia's home was fantastic. Not only was she very accommodating to our early check-in, but her space was clean, comfortable and spacious, and she even gifted us with breakfast ingredients. This house has four large bedrooms with comfortable beds, and is very close to public transit, which we used to commute to and from downtown Boston. This place is on the outskirts of Jamaica Plains, but only a few blocks walk from the all the action. Definitely recommend and would stay here again."
4583526,72779512,2016-05-04,23518407,Nancy,"This unit is very spacious, clean, quiet and uncluttered. There are lots of charming touches throughout and a newly renovated bathroom with wonderful tile work and accent tiles. The bedrooms are located on 2 floors which gives the sense of being in a single family unit. The kitchen and dining area are large and provide a great gathering place that opens to a deck overlooking the backyard. There is an extended bank of windows along one wall that shed lots of natural light and provide nice views of the backyard and surrounding area. There is a cozy living room to the front of the house that is a great place to cuddle up with a book or watch some TV. There is lots of natural light throughout. Tricia provided a nice variety of breakfast foods that was all ready and waiting upon my arrival and she was very responsive in meeting all my needs. The home is in a pleasant residential area on a quiet street and is within walking distance of everything that I needed. It is a great place to stay if you are without a car because it is very close to the Forest Hills T-Station and there are great restaurants and shops in walking distance. If you do have a car Tricia has off street parking which is very difficult to come by in this area. I had a very pleasant stay!"
4583526,73735882,2016-05-09,57771522,Don,"\"The home was lovely, well kept and very unique.  Tricia was a gracious host and was helpful in getting an Uber driver good directions!  We loved the neighborhood, the big houses and the quiet streets.  It was the perfect place for us to \"\"hang out\"\" when we weren't out seeing all that Boston has to offer.  With so many great Airbnb homes out there"
4583526,74436952,2016-05-15,56176078,Douglas,This was the perfect location.  The house was located in a quiet area while still being a short walk to the subway with access to Boston as a whole.  The house was spacious with 4 bedrooms and multiple communal areas to spread out.  We were visiting for graduation and my family of 4 and my parents had plenty of room.
Tricia was a very gracious host.  We were arriving a little early based on check in so I sent her a text her asking if we could drop off the vehicle there as she had off street parking before going into town she was more then accommodating by allowing us to get settled in early.  Tricia is quick to respond to questions,very welcoming,and to top it off left a wonderful breakfast in the fridge for us to enjoy.  The house was stocked with items to keep us and my kids busy.,,,
"This was our first experience with airbnb and it was a great one thanks in large part to Tricia\"",,,,,
4583526,75091136,2016-05-18,32784211,Khalid,"Tricia was welcoming and helpful. Very nice, clean and comfortable home. Convenient to the Metro, restaurants and grocery shopping. We would love to stay there again!"

4583526,76505389,2016-05-27,17758541,Joan M,"Our stay at Tricia's place was great. Big spacious kitchen well set up for cooking, four generous bedrooms , and (one) large whimsical bathroom. Entire space(floors 2&3 of Tricia's home) has separate entrance and tall ceilings . Tricia is a great host and easy to reach. I highly recommend this place; the pictures don't do justice to the actual offerings; the place is great."
4583526,78037210,2016-06-05,31315841,Yu,"People: Tricia was there to great us, and she brought us plenty of continental food and fresh milk. We felt really welcomed and at home. Her cat, Zik, is very cute!!"
Building: The building was divided into two halves: Host's family lives in the left half and guests live in the right half. Each half has 3 floors: in the basement are washer and dryer,the first floor has a living room,a bathroom,and two bedrooms,and the second floor has two bedrooms.,
One bathroom seems to be a little disproportional to the number of people this place can hold,but I'd still like to recommend it given the overall experience plus the spacious backyard + parking space.,,,,

4583526,80945928,2016-06-20,68747754,Paul,"Tricia was a wonderful host for my out of town family. Although I was unable to meet her personally, my parents and sister enjoyed speaking with her. She was easy to contact concerning any rental questions. Her house is large, quiet and beautiful. She even left some breakfast food in the unit! I live in the area and know that it is a quick walk to a subway and a large number of restaurants in JP."
4583526,81234369,2016-06-21,67804801,Adrienne,Gorgeous place! We had a great time.
4583526,81803036,2016-06-25,8799492,Zhaokang,We really enjoyed living in Tricia's house. It's well presented and with facilities easily accessible. Tricia is very nice and gave us valuable advice of touring Boston. The location is also very good. Close to large lake and park and within good distance to downtown. We definitely recommend the stay in her house.
4583526,83910744,2016-07-04,60819090,Kari,"We loved our stay with Tricia. We give her 5 stars! She has a very roomy, clean, private house. We had the 2nd and 3rd floors all to ourselves. Tricia gave us a starter breakfast and had everything we needed. We would definitely stay there in the future."
4583526,84444980,2016-07-07,78665655,John,Vores første Airbnb oplevelse. Perfekt oplevelse. Specielt denne lokation i udkanten af Boston.
Huset er perfekt. Det ville have været dejligt med aircon.,,,,,
Vi har altid tidligere boet på hotel. Det er slut nu !!,,,,,
"Det er sandsynligvis for dyrt at vælge Airbnb for enkelte nætter pga udgift til rengøring.\"",,,,,
4583526,86835439,2016-07-17,2334342,Cristina,Tricia's house is cozy and very beautiful and had everything my family needed. Tricia was a very welcoming and accommodating host.  She made sure we had extra fans since it was especially warm in mid-July. We enjoyed the starter breakfast she provided. The house is in a great location close to restaurants and a pond that is great for running.
4583526,89912232,2016-07-30,63392587,Laurie,"We wanted a location in Jamaica Plain and were very pleased with this apartment.  Tricia was gracious, warm and welcoming and was always very accessible if we had questions.  We loved the proximity both to the T and bus line, and had a great time exploring the many interesting shops and restaurants along South and Centre Streets.  The old homes in the neighborhood are beautiful,  if a little worn, and are full of Boston charm and history. This apartment is basic but is comfortable, private and very clean and has plenty of space to spread out."
Our stay coincided with a major hot spell so we were grateful for the bedroom window A/C units,newly installed.,,,,
The house and neighborhood are charming but,as in all urban areas,if we were out at night,we were cautious as we walked home from the T--or we used an Uber.,,
Having the option of preparing meals in the kitchen was a big plus.  The kitchen was not fancy but we had everything we needed to make a good meal.  Two grocery stores were close by.  We appreciated the starter breakfast that Tricia provided. Laundry facilities and off street parking also made life comfortable.,,,,,
"We unreservedly recommend this listing. It was truly a great home for our Boston vacation. \"",,,,,
4583526,90611728,2016-08-01,54873844,Helen,Tricia made us feel very welcome in her home. The location was perfect for easy access into downtown Boston. The house/apartment had all the things we needed to make our stay comfortable. We would definitely recommended it to our friends.
4583526,91556104,2016-08-05,31675168,Paul,"Tricia is a kind and considerate host with a fantastic home in the suburbs of Boston close to the Arboretum.  Her home is split into two with one side being her private accommodation and the other a 4 bed apartment on two floors. She left breakfast items for us and was there to meet and greet us. An excellent stay, which really felt like home from home. Would return if ever in Boston again.Thank you so much, Tricia."
4583526,93117498,2016-08-11,32831703,Ans,"Tricia's sfeervolle appartement voldeed helemaal aan de beschrijving en aan onze verwachtingen. Tricia was erg gastvrij en behulpzaam. Het was erg ruim en gezellig ingericht. De locatie in Jamaica Plain bleek ideaal, 5 minuten lopen naar het station en ook nog op loopafstand van gezellige restaurantjes."
4583526,95161022,2016-08-18,45878359,Ralf,"Tricias Haus ist riesig und gemütlich. Vier Schlafzimmer sind vorhanden, drei davon mit Klimaanlage, eines der oberen Schlafzimmer ist ein echt großer Raum. Die Küche ist ebenfalls sehr geräumig und mit Herd, Mikrowelle, Spülmaschine, Kaffeemaschine, Toaster etc. ausgestattet. Man kann an einem großen Tisch oder auch draußen auf einem kleinen Balkon sitzen. Das Haus ist sehr ruhig gelegen, ein toller Park (Arnold Arboretum) ist in der Nähe zum Spazierengehen oder Joggen. Internet und Fernseher funktionieren einwandfrei, ein großer Vorteil bei längeren USA-Aufenthalten: Waschmaschine und Trockner im Keller. Der Weg zur Forest Hill U-Bahnstation dauert etwa fünf Minuten, von dort ist man in zwanzig bis dreißig Minuten in der Innenstadt. Auf der Washington Street hinter der Station gibt es diverse Lokale, zwei Supermärkte sind fußläufig erreichbar. Tricia ist sehr nett und antwortete stets prompt auf unsere Emails. Wir können einen Aufenthalt in ihrem Haus nur empfehlen und würden selber bei unserem nächsten Aufenthalt dorthin zurückkehren."

4583526,97012196,2016-08-25,5314583,Yi Xiang,Tricia was responsive and friendly. We arrived late on the day of check in and she still met us to give us a short introduction of her place.
Her place was neat and clean as advertised. It's technically not an entire apartment as she lives on the first floor,but it totally feels like one. You have direct private access to the 2nd floor,and have the entire 2nd and 3rd storey to yourself,complete with a kitchen.,,
Location is great for the price. A short 5-7 min walk to the train station gets you to downtown in 25-30 min.,,,,,
Only con was that there's only 1 toilet. But that's something we already knew before booking the apartment.,,,,,

Easily able to handle all of us and there is lots of rooms for everyone. The kitchen is a perfect communal area. Tricia met us on our arrival and gave us the full run down and provided some info that we could refer to later. Very welcoming and we felt very comfortable during our stay.

Dans nos échanges de communication, nous avions demandé si c'était possible d'arriver plus tôt (13h) et ça semblait ok.

Nous avons réveillé Mekkin qui dormait puisqu'elle travaillait la nuit précédente."
En dehors de ce mal-entendu,"Mekkin a été très courtoise. Notre chambre était très spacieuse et très propre.  La maison est charmante avec son architecture impressionnante.  Le quartier n'offre pas beaucoup de services mais la maison est située à 5 minutes à pied des transport en commun qui sont très efficaces à Boston. C'est un bon rapport qualité prix pour Boston.\"",,,,

I didn't have a chance to meet Mekkin until my final day, however her husband checked me in and was very kind and welcoming.  The room was just as described in the listing!

The room was great, very comfortable bed, and was really impressed with what they are doing inside. (They have an old 3 story Victorian style home they are renovating. The bathrooms, kitchen, and some of the bedrooms have been redone and are beautiful, and the rest are sure to follow. Don't be fooled by the outside appearance of the house. The inside of the house is great, and only getting better!) Her husband, Rashiek (sp?)  is a great guy! Really friendly, and helpful with suggestions with transit  questions, places to eat, or things to do. (He is kind of the social one, and Mekkin is very nice, but she stays to herself a bit more.) They have a dog that looks imposing, but is a SWEETHEART, once she smells you, once you get introduced to her. (yeah, she is REALLY imposing the way she rolls on her back and wants you to rub her tummy :-)"
I was visiting my daughter,who is attending Northeastern. This place is perfectly located if you have a kid staying at NEU. The walk to Dudley bus station is 5 minutes,if that. The ride to Ruggles Station is 5 minutes,max. Super easy. Super quick. Super cheap.,,
So the house is great,they are great,the dog is great,everything is cool,and/but I want to tell you about the neighborhood,just so you're clear about what to expect.
The neighborhood used to be pretty rough,from what I was told,but has definitely turned the corner. It is a black neighborhood,and I am white,and I felt totally comfortable. I walked to and from the bus stop,and the bus station many times
In closing,if you want to stay in a nice home,with very nice down to earth,hard working people,then by all means,stay here. If you do not need to have places to walk to for entertainment

Only a 5 minute walk from the bus station, very easy to get public transport into the centre of Boston. Their dog was also lovely, very well trained, and didn't bother you if you told it to leave! They also had tea, a coffee machine, and a little fridge for the guests which was a nice extra. I would definitely recommend their place."

The room is huge and could have easily of fit all five of us in hindsight. Mekkin and the newest member of family greeted us upon arrival, and check in was effortless. The right amount of 'there if you need me, but gone if you don't'. The location is walking distance to public transit and you HAVE to try the Haley House Cafe which is close by.

The room had enough space to accommodate four or even five people. The mattress is so soft that we spent more time on bed then usual. The doggy is really cute but a little bit shy.  The bathroom is warm and shower is great.  Thanks to Mekkin, we had a great experience in Boston."
2473997,70787896,2016-04-20,65740584,Marius,Mekkin and her family were very welcoming and we enjoyed our stay. The room was exactly as described and the location is close to transportation. We would definitely stay there again.

2473997,74959385,2016-05-17,68716153,Hanna,Mekkin and her family were nice. We had a room on the second floor and a bathroom downstairs to use. Walking distance to the public transportation station but I recommend doing more research on the area/neighborhood.
2473997,77457927,2016-06-01,72398267,Kate,We had a great experience here! The house is adorable and the room was exactly what we were looking for. We would definitely recommend staying here!
2473997,80496955,2016-06-18,77687311,Tom,Great stay! I booked last minute to attend a work conference. Mekkin and her family were very accommodating and helpful. Beautiful old home and close to the city. Highly recommend.

3749523,18034674,2014-08-20,19219521,Rehan,Nicolo's home is like an art gallery. It's different and unique. He is very easy to deal with and was always flexible to ensure our comfort. We had a great time and highly recommend it. Thanks
3749523,18192816,2014-08-23,7601059,Shane,Booked this beautiful historical home as a 'home base' meeting point for myself and three colleagues during a recent visit to Boston.  The accommodations were perfect for our purposes and the host was fantastic in letting us arrive early and depart late.  I will definitely stay here again when circumstances permit.  Thanks Nicolo!
3749523,18951821,2014-09-03,9461307,Mayuree,The house is great. Very close to public transportation and Boston downtown. Wholefood is just a few minute walk. We had a very nice stay during our business trip.
3749523,19349038,2014-09-10,20985538,Melissa,"Nicolo was great to work with on booking and helped our group feel comfortable and welcomed at the property. We stayed on a business trip so did not spend a great deal of time at the home but the location was great. This is a quaint old home in the middle of everything in Boston, style is true to the historic Boston feel."
3749523,19826229,2014-09-19,6769949,Isa & Valeria,Nicolo's house is wonderful and unique! The rooms are very comfortable and the kitchen has everything you need. The location is very convenient and we really appreciated the possibility of using his bicycles. Nicolo was also very helpful! Thank you!
3749523,20152260,2014-09-24,12845489,Kaye,"We were met on arrival by Blaire, the property manager. He gave us all information on how everything ran at the property. Blaire was extremely helpful and accommodating. Nicolo the host was away on business, so we didn't get to meet him, but he kept in touch regularly, wishing us well on our trip and stay in Boston. We would definitely recommend Nicolo's home. Bautiful historic home, walking distance to Central Boston and historical sights. Thank you guys for letting us stay in your lovely home. Kaye, Tasmania Aust."

"The property itself is unbelievable! My father-in-law said it best....\"\"I feel like I am part of the history of Boston....not just staying in another hotel\"\".",,,,,
The location is perfect for walking the Freedom Trail from Bunker Hill. And just a quick walk over the Charles River and you are in Little Italy!,,,,,
Overall,"a BIG thumbs up to Nicolo and Blair!!\"",,,,
3749523,21160537,2014-10-12,21816532,Susie,Gorgeous home in super location - easy access to Boston or Cambridge.  Beautiful neighborhood. Easy parking. Lovely furnishings - totally lived unto our expectations. We were so happy to come home to a friendly kitchen  after an evening of celebrating - so much better than returning to a hotel room. We could gather in our pajamas and just relax. Best of all - the sheets were absolutley fantastic. A little bit of heaven. Perfect!
3749523,21259928,2014-10-13,10366571,Ann,A very lovely house. My friends and I had a good time there.
3749523,21757823,2014-10-23,5669262,Adele,"Nicolo's place was great! He gave clear communication for an easy key pickup, and there was a detailed house guide. There were three of us traveling for work, and it was nice to all be together in the charming kitchen and shared area, while having our own bedrooms and full bathrooms. The space heaters worked great on a cold night. There weren't full supplies (shampoo, etc) in every bathroom, so you may want to bring your own. This was such a lovely house in a quaint neighborhood, and a nice alternative to a hotel."
3749523,21841778,2014-10-25,20930460,Mark,This house is a wonderful piece of colonial Boston history - full of beautiful furniture and artworks. Gorgeous wooden floors throughout. Location is fantastic - a short walk over the bridge to Boston centre and easy access to the subway. Everything as described. Sadly we did not get to meet Nicolo during our short stay but he was extremely helpful and responsive via mail throughout the booking and stay and everything went according to plan.
3749523,22103014,2014-10-30,14511596,Juan,"La casa es increíble. Nos sentimos muy cómodos. Los espacios son amplios y muy acogedores, la decoración es excelente. Las recámaras son amplias y bien iluminadas. Las camas son excelentes. La cocina es el mejor espacio de la casa: cocinamos en familia y pasamos ratos muy alegres."
El barrio es muy tranquilo,se puede caminar por calles hermosas y apreciar edificios antiquísimos. Hay un súper mercado y una farmacia a un par de cuadras (10 minutos a pie). Es fácil caminar al centro de Boston o tomar el metro o un autobús para llegar a Cambridge o a cualquier parte de la ciudad.,,,,
El anfitrión fue muy atento y estuvo siempre al pendiente de nosotros.,,,,,
"¡Definitivamente recomendaría esta hermosa casa para quien quiera visitar Boston!\"",,,,,
3749523,22418034,2014-11-05,20321939,Carrie,"I booked this lovely place for 3 of my coworkers, who were in Boston for a day of meetings. They loved both the decor and the location, and generally had a great time. Thanks Nicolo!"
3749523,22489223,2014-11-08,812696,Phil,"Loved the house, Location was excellent, The house had everything that we needed, Nic emailed all instructions and nothing was a problem, Neighbourhood is a gem and just loved the architecture around the area, and the local pub just down the road was great. I would stay here again if we get a chance to travel from New Zealand."
3749523,22983859,2014-11-19,22539566,Bas,"\"Heerlijk herenhuis, in koloniale stijl! Fantastische lokatie, zeer goed uitgerust, warme en familiale sfeer. Dit is een geweldig \"\"thuis\"\" voor een weekje Boston"
3749523,23319819,2014-11-29,20451212,Ben,"Staying at the Grand Colonial was a mixed experience. The owner was incredibly helpful in getting us set up and helping us with all of our questions and access. The home itself was a little hard to get comfortable in considering there was no real space to relax (or at least no comfortable space) and the heating situation was hard to manage. But, we love the neighborhood and appreciated our time in Boston."
3749523,23582135,2014-12-05,23963734,Ed,"An excellent place to stay in the heart of Charlestown and just two minutes outside of downtown Boston.  Everything was exactly as advertised.  Beautifully appointed house with a parking spot, plenty of comfortable beds and hassle free coming and going.  I would definitely recommend Nicolo's home. A  first class experience all around!"
3749523,24672222,2015-01-01,4160838,Celie,"Nicolo was very prompt and responsive with all of our communication prior to visiting. While he wasn't there to greet us in person, the house was very easy to find and he provided very thorough instructions and a welcome guide ahead of time via email. We had no trouble getting in and found the accommodations to be even more charming than in the photos! The neighborhood is also historical and welcoming and a short walk to the Warren Tavern, where we had brunch. We stayed on New Year's Eve and were pleased that even on a busy night, the neighborhood was quiet and felt very safe."
3749523,26256345,2015-02-08,5180777,Deepak,"Nicolo was great - everything was easy to locate and the house was awesome. Particularly, it's proximity to downtown and local watering holes."
"Thanks Nicolo!\"",,,,,
3749523,27281212,2015-03-01,26556476,James,"Nicolo was very hospitable and generous, very on top of everything host."
3749523,27650276,2015-03-09,19549802,Rob,"I stayed in Nicolo’s house with 2 of my colleagues over a week while we attended an exhibition. The house was a pleasure to stay in and is absolutely unique in terms of décor and style. The house was clean and while Nicolo wasn’t available during the stay there was a great deal of information provided to us, both in terms of the house and the surrounding area. The house was clean and well equipped with modern appliances. The front door operates on an electronic security system and doesn’t require keys which is absolutely perfect if you’re staying with people who you might not always be with. The Charlestown area was picturesque and quiet, though there was a number of small restaurants and stores within walking distance. We walked about during the evening and felt safe. We also had no problem getting a cab using the company recommended by Nicolo and were in downtown Boston within 10 minutes."
3749523,27822175,2015-03-12,10023996,Stephen,Amazing house. Great host. Perfect location.
3749523,27992976,2015-03-16,25065496,Shalay,"Our stay was wonderful! We really enjoyed the convenience of being right across the bridge from the North End. Even though it was raining we were able to take a short walk to the sights we were interested in. The whole foods is very close and convenient, as well as some other restaurants. It was cold when we stayed but the electric heaters in each room definitely keep the house plenty warm! With 6 people staying in the house, we appreciated the fact that each room has its own bathroom! However, we did find we wished there had been a bathroom on the first floor. One of our guests had an injured foot, which made going up and down the stairs a little more difficult. All in all, we loved the home and location, we'd stay here again!"
3749523,28338185,2015-03-22,28655115,Yihua,"The house is gorgeous, and we really enjoyed staying there for three days. It is just along the freedom trail, which made us very convenient to take the trip. Moreover, there is a Whole Foods supermarket nearby, and we bought a lot of supplier there. Every bedroom is comfortable and spacious."
3749523,28928042,2015-04-01,23676630,Seongwoo,Absolutely gorgeous house. It was never forgettable memories in Boston. Markets and station were 5min distance. Convenient kitchen was also useful. Everything were good for us.
3749523,29166344,2015-04-05,15620976,Susie,"The house was wonderful, a unique experience and fantastic and lovely location in charming Charlestown, with the centre and various sites of interest being walking distance away. Perfect for two or three couples as we were, although the third room is twin beds so could also be good for a family with kids of various ages including younger ones sharing. Also good that two rooms have ensuites and there is the separare third bathroom too. We had to be a bit careful with hot water with six of us showering in the morning but I'm for saving water! The Welcome Guide was helpful and the owners seem relaxed but attentive - it was great to keep in touch before and when needed during our stay, such as when the oven wasn't working due to a tripped circuit from the last guests and Dorothy, the housekeeper, came in to fix it straight away which was great. I recommend this house as a perfect base for exploring Boston."
3749523,29725857,2015-04-12,9757918,Tim,"Nicolo was a great host - he always responded promptly to our requests, and gave us a detailed welcome guide that had answers to everything we could have asked."
The location of the house is ideal,it was a quick walk to the TD Garden and the North End,"as well as the Navy Yard. Things could not have been better.\"",,,
3749523,30140952,2015-04-18,21693931,Bonnie,Nicolo was an amazing host and we were very happy with this Airbnb experience!
We were looking for a place where we could fit myself and three other colleagues for a work conference. Nicolo's home was spacious,an easy walk or drive downtown and even came with a parking spot (!!  a must have for Boston). We enjoyed a number of nights walking to the North End for dinner and cannoli. It was a super plus that the door had a touchpad lock - saved us from bringing keys with us everywhere!,,,,
I tend to come with a lot of questions,"but Nicolo had everything covered in his Welcome Guide - very helpful! Would love to have the pleasure of staying there again sometime.\"",,,,
3749523,30373681,2015-04-21,21337759,Cory,This home is in a great neighborhood with excellent access to downtown Boston.  Our family of four was very comfortable in this historic home and will definitely stay here our next trip. This is a perfect home to experience the charm and history of Boston.
3749523,31022897,2015-04-30,917504,Reda,"The house was truly amazing, historic, and clean. Perfect location, right on the freedom trail. Highly recommend this house."
3749523,31188339,2015-05-03,8803692,Enrica,"Nicolo contacted me two days prior to arrival to give me details about the property. The house was easy to find, located within walking distance of some small pubs, places to find food and a grocery store. It sits back enough from the street that there is no noise from the very busy street next to it. The house was clean, beds comfortable, linens clean and numerous decorations throughout the house. The inside and outside are fairly depicted in the online posting. There were plenty of clean towels and the bathrooms each had one small liquid soap container. The kitchen had everything needed to cook and plenty of dishes. This is a charming older home but with a regal atmosphere. I would recommend it as well as stay here again."
3749523,32220821,2015-05-15,9273022,Joseph,Great stay. Perfect location. Easy to downtown and plenty of options near the house.
3749523,32984817,2015-05-24,6932704,Dominick,We could not have asked for a more seamless and easy experience. The home was exactly as described very comfortable and felt at home right away. We were in town for a conference and wished we stayed here the entire trip. The neighborhood of Charlestown is very well situated and close to nice little restaurants and taverns.
3749523,33642958,2015-05-31,6808366,Marcia,"Neighborhood is very quaint. You can walk to helpful places like CVS and Whole Foods. Also not too distant from a T station, and Uber drivers had no problem finding us. We did rent a car for our day trip to the Cape, but warning for out-of-towners that Boston traffic on the weekdays is not for the faint of heart. Kitchen is well equipped."
3749523,34278045,2015-06-07,28396073,Christopher,The house provided me and my family exactly what we wanted: nice accommodations in a nice neighborhood in Boston. Communication with Nicolo was smooth. Emails and questions were promptly answered. The house is very unique. I would recommend this house to anyone traveling to Boston in a similar situation as mine.
3749523,34944517,2015-06-14,6327676,Mike,"This beautiful old home in Charlestown was a wonderful place to stay! Our friends and colleagues filled out the rest of the home, and they all agreed. Charlestown is a beautiful neighborhood, and a quiet respite from the bustle of the city, while still being close enough to access the downtown area quickly. Still, we spent many an hour relaxing on the front patio, enjoying the evenings (and view of the Charles Bridge!)."
The house itself is clean and inviting. The beds are particularly comfortable,and the kitchen was easily spacious enough for the six of us.,,,,
Overall,this is a highly recommended property! When we return to Boston,we hope to stay again!,,,

He was accommodating and responses were immediate and much appreciated. The location was perfect for touring historical Boston. The neighhood felt safe and we felt comfortable walking everywhere. The beds were comfortable and the house was very clean. For a group of 5 the house was perfect! Thank you, Nicolo!"
3749523,36375686,2015-06-28,30569130,Diane,"We loved our stay!  Nicolo was incredibly responsive, both during the booking process and during our stay.  The Welcome Guide was thorough and the house matched the description - lots of charm.  We had 3 adults and 3 teens - we had plenty of room (3 bathrooms!!) and enjoyed cooking in the kitchen.  Plenty of good quality TVs which was nice.   Charlestown exceeded our expectations.  Such a cute area and we were easily able to take evening walks and enjoy the cute streets.   Thank you!"
3749523,37298501,2015-07-06,29239924,Ann,"We had a great vacation in this beautiful, historic home. As stated in other reviews, the location was ideal. We were a 5 minute walk from the Freedom Trail, 15 minutes from the Italian restaurants in the North End, and 25 minutes from the aquarium. The neighborhood was safe and very charming-close to public transportation, groceries, pubs and historic restaurants. The house was very comfortable for a family of five- our teens and preteen were happy to be able to spread out, not share beds and have TVs in their rooms. We were also very appreciative of the attentive housekeeper who helped with a minor alarm problem and had the house immaculately prepared for us.  Nicolo was wonderful to work with. He responded quickly to all of our questions, provided a lot of information about the neighborhood, including restaurant recommendations and maps to everything of interest. He made the trip very easy for us."
3749523,37631055,2015-07-08,37732974,Luigi,We Had a great time. Rooms Nd house was lean and great shape. Looking forward to go back again

3749523,38975536,2015-07-20,22035985,Alison,"Upon arriving at the house we were surprised how close we were to a major road but were quickly relieved when we found it really wasn't intrusive at all. It was easy to get to anywhere from this location via public transport. In addition we were able to stock up on food at a nearby supermarket. Location, house, cleanliness were all spot on although the bathrooms can be rather small. Nicolo was a very good host and provided a Welcome Guide that was very helpful. He always responded promptly to any questions I had and everything went very smoothly while we were there. If you love antiques and old houses this is a perfect place to stay."

3749523,40348769,2015-07-30,36906467,Bryan,The house was fantastic and in such a great location. Everything was exactly as described and the experience was perfect. The location is literally a block from the freedom train and blocks away from great restaurants and sites. Zero to complain about and having Whole Foods a five minute walk away was super helpful. Best was the bakery 4 minutes away for coffee in the morning. This was our first AirBnB experience and it was an A+ for our family of 5.
3749523,41643486,2015-08-08,37936232,Lynn,"Niccolos house was a wonderful experience!  The location was perfect, a short walk over the Carlestown bridge and we were in the North End.  The house is warm and inviting, and the outside patio was perfect for relaxing. Highly recommended!"

3749523,46586940,2015-09-12,3697699,Maria,"We really enjoyed our stay in the historic Grand Colonial. The house was bigger when we originally thought and the four of us had plenty of room. Very clean, nicely decorated with classic art, the property is located off the main highway in a quiet, up and coming Charlestown neighborhood with the gorgeous view of Bunker Hill Bridge. We will definitely be back next time we visit Boston. Thanks for making our stay memorable."
3749523,47029023,2015-09-15,22773915,Bill,Everything was just as described.  The location was within walking distance of historic Boston.  Had a wonderful time.  Highly recommended.

The only small issue is that there is no bathroom on the ground floor, necessitating the need to go upstairs. Otherwise a lovely, comfortable stay. Would recommend!"
3749523,49305331,2015-10-03,24159303,Nancy,Lovely historic home in a great location.  We had everything we needed and were given the privacy we desired.  Would stay again.
3749523,49542234,2015-10-04,45108792,Mary Alice,The house & location was exactly what we were looking for. Nicolo was very helpful prior to our stay with helping us with any concerns especially since this was our first time using AIrbnb. Our only regret was that we wish we stayed longer. Mary Alice

3749523,50439179,2015-10-12,38393382,Todd,We had a grand time in Boston and loved your house.  The location and setting was perfect for all the historic sites.  Ended every night at the Warren Tavern for a few pints.  Everyone thought the house was a much better choice than a hotel.

The heaters kept the house warm despite remarkably low temperatures outside. Our stay of 6 adults was very comfortable thanks to the space available and the presence of 3 bathrooms which made getting up and out very quick each morning. The area is historic, pretty and peaceful. Overall we have a fantastic stay."
3749523,51880071,2015-10-25,20178367,Debra,I appreciated being able to drop bags off a few hours prior to check in. Place was wonderful. Very convenient for a group of 6. Spacious kitchen great for cooking and hanging out. Quiet neighborhood 15 minute walk from subway and commuter trains.
3749523,52274218,2015-10-27,46648087,Josh,This place is amazing. Such a convenient location too... Walking distance to so much.  Staying here was a great experience.

3749523,52669944,2015-11-01,29537435,John,"We had a great time in the Admiral Wiley House!  My brother and his wife, my sister and her husband and my wife and I came to Boston to celebrate my 60th birthday.  We loved the house! It's in nice neighborhood, within walking distance of the North End.  The Warren Tavern - excellent food and write-ups on TripAdvisor - is a 5 minute walk.  Nice coffee shop 3 minutes further.  It's a 10-12 minute walk from the Community College T station - far better than trying to get around Boston in a car.  Kitchen comes with all the necessary equipment and is updated.  Whole foods grocery store is a 10 minute walk.  Really a nice setup.  The house is set up to be comfortable year round.  The pictures are accurate.  The air conditioners in the picture were stored in the basement for our October stay.  The windows are updated double pane and can be opened for wonderful fresh air.  When they are closed it is a very quiet house.  Strongly recommend this house!!!"
3749523,53056810,2015-11-04,14042536,Alli,Excellent host! Very accommodating. All information given in good time. Welcome folder contained everything you could possibly wish to know and more. Location was brilliant. We did not have long in Boston and walked the freedom trail which ends nearby. Lovely residential area. The house was so comfortable (amazing bed) and spacious......a home from home. Only sorry we couldn't stay longer!
3749523,54178281,2015-11-16,14891773,Andy,Great period house! Gives your visit to Boston a lot of atmosphere. Good location and easy to get to downtown Boston. Full and prompt communication from Nicolo made it easy. I would highly recommend this house.
3749523,54341857,2015-11-18,48337822,Jake,This house suited our trip perfectly! Such a beautiful Colonial home in a great neighborhood.
Nicolo was a very informative and communicative host. The house guide answered any questions we had and the house--from the space to the location--was more than accommodating.,,,,,
"Highly recommended. And thank you! \"",,,,,
3749523,54693910,2015-11-23,32377733,Dane,"\"The home is in a great neighborhood with excellent access to the North End, Fanuiel Hall, and downtown Boston.  Home is very clean and well maintained. This was a good value for our family that needed 3 bedrooms in the downtown Boston area.  The living room, large kitchen, and front porch are great socializing areas, which greatly enhanced our enjoyment of our 4 day Boston visit. Having a washer and dryer was also a plus as several in our group were on extended vacation/business trips. We were able to \"\"Uber\"\" everywhere on this trip"
3749523,55257044,2015-11-29,1928546,Seth,The house was fantastic for our family's Thanksgiving getaway!! Very clean and had all the facilities we needed.  The fireplace was a very welcome addition and made sitting and hanging out very enjoyable indeed!! The bedrooms were very comfortable and bathrooms great (so nice to have one each!).  Nicolo and their housekeeper were available to answer any questions immediately which was reassuring.  We'd definitely look to stay here again!!

3749523,56637506,2015-12-15,46648087,Josh,Nicolo is great. Super prompt with replies. This is my 2nd time staying at The Colonial. It's a fantastic place that is in a convenient location. I've had 2 great experiences staying here.
3749523,58040007,2015-12-31,3046434,Peter,"This is a stunning retreat, made all the warmer by the host and owner, Nicolo. The home is spacious, accommodating, as lovely in real time as it is in pictures."
The electronic security system made it easy to access home without managing logistics of a meeting.,,,,,
The neighbourhood was perfect was walking,accessing great shopping,restaurants and a ferry.,,,
We loved the place,"and our stay was sublime. \"",,,,
3749523,58358092,2016-01-02,10887544,Jeff,Great stay.  Location was convenient and the house was exactly as described.
3749523,59152151,2016-01-07,270148,Adam,This place was great for our business trip to Boston. The house has a lot of character and is pretty large.
3749523,60844678,2016-01-28,26190265,Fei,"这是一栋有年头的联体屋,内饰和家具很有历史意味,典型的新英格兰风格。位置紧靠市中心外围,步行一小时的距离,地铁不算很近,步行一刻钟,我后来都打车,十多分钟到市中心。毕竟是老房子,没有暖气,用电热油汀。每个房门和门把手都吱吱嘎嘎,楼梯也是,晚上走动很吵人。卫生间很小。厨房连着餐厅,很大,餐椅很好看,但太老,都摇摇晃晃,我二岁的孩子,从椅子上下来时因椅子不稳摔倒。答应的婴儿床没有出现,询问也没有回答,结果只好直接睡大人床,晚上几次滚下地板了。"
3749523,61369545,2016-02-03,6522860,Masa,"The building was amazing, and we had so great time staying at the house. I highly recommend to stay at the house."
3749523,62744079,2016-02-16,54921943,Fanny,"It was very nice experience to stay in this amazing apartment. Everything is good, just perhaps some light bulbs can be changed, and heating system could be improved (a bit cold in the evening). In general, very good experience to stay here and Nicolo is so helpful."
3749523,66176199,2016-03-20,52116978,William,"Nicolo - You were ultra efficient, quick to respond and made our stay and easy one. The house was just as described: very charming, conveniently located and civilised."
3749523,68278585,2016-04-04,27860859,Margaret,"This is a beautiful, well equipped house in a nice, quiet area in Charleston, on the Freedom Trail."
The kitchen was well set up with lots of non perishable food items in the cupboards. There were two large double rooms which were very comfortable,each with their own en suite bathrooms. The top room had two single beds and would probably be better for children as it is quite small for two adults. The property is very convenient for getting in to town and particularly convenient for us as we were walking to the TDGarden everyday for the World Figure Skating Championships. The taxi to town is between 8 to 15 dollars and 25 to the airport.,,,,
Charlestown is a very pretty and quiet neighbourhood with a small supermarket quite nearby.,,,,,
Nicolo was in regular contact with us by email when we had a question and was very helpful to us on our leaving day,"allowing us to stay longer because of an evening flight.\"",,,,
3749523,69189183,2016-04-10,44942065,Cindy,"This was a wonderful historic house in a great Boston neighborhood. It was exactly as described, beautifully decorated, very comfortable, and reasonably priced. The owner provided all the information necessary in a timely manner and responded to emails promptly. I highly recommend this property."
3749523,69905403,2016-04-14,53940744,Diane,"We throughly enjoyed our visit in the Grand Colonial home. It was spacious, and within walking distance to excellent restaurants and major attractions. I would highly recommend staying here with your family."
3749523,70682786,2016-04-19,11489660,Stephanie,"Nicolo's listing was exactly as described! It was very well organized from the welcome email I received 2 days prior, to the ease of getting in and out of the house with the pin pad entry."
The layout was perfect for me and my family with 3 seperate bedrooms all with our own bathrooms,and clean and perfectly equipped with everything we needed during our stay.,,,,
The location was great in Charlestown,close to transit and cute pubs and restaurants as well as an easy walk to the North end. We felt safe,"comfortable and instantly at home in this beautiful house! \"",,,
3749523,71152959,2016-04-24,11572552,Mary,We loved this house for our visit to Boston. The welcome guide provided is very complete. They even setup the pack and play for my son for our arrival. The 3 ensuite bathrooms worked out very well for our mix of people. I can speak for the king size master bed and say the bed was very comfortable with great linens. We very much enjoyed our stay and would definitely consider this option when we visit again!
3749523,72250396,2016-05-01,29493861,Eric,We enjoyed a great weekend in Nicolo's lovely colonial in Charlestown (essentially).  The house is spacious and decorated in traditional style.  Each bedroom has a bathroom. And you can't beat the location.
3749523,73952604,2016-05-11,52825810,Wendy,"\"Our family has been home from our stay for two weeks now and we still miss being at Nicolo's Grand Colonial!  It was a great mix of location and affordability for our family of 5 needing 3 separate full baths.  The house was as described and as clean as in the pictures.  One thing I do wish I would have known before booking is that the flight of stairs up to the third floor bedroom was a bit steeper than the first flight to the second floor.  This prevented us from assigning the rooms to our family members the way we had hoped (our 78 year old mother was traveling with us).  A few other notes:  there was plenty of hot water for 5 adults as long as you take them one at a time (back to back is fine, just not at the same time);  bring your own tissues - none were provided for us; the stairs to the basement are very steep and narrow - if you are old, large, or afraid of heights you won't be able to make it down them (you'll probably want to bring the ironing board upstairs if you will be needing it daily).  There were tons of dishes and silverware and a very nice coffee grinder and brewer, although the pots are very hard to reach since they hang from the ceiling - we're a family under 5'4\"\" so we could only reach a few of them.  The dining room chairs are wobbly"
3749523,75929876,2016-05-23,6117301,Rohini,"We stayed at this charming home for 4 days. The home is conveniently situated in Charlestown.  The parking space is right in front although a bit tight ( we had an SUV). The emails and communications were very good as well. There were all the basic amenities in the home so we did not need to run to the grocery store. There is however a nice whole foods located walking distance away. The few words of caution are that this being an old home, the floors are a little lopsided. Also the basement access to the laundry area was a little rickety and the lighting was a little dim in certain areas. Overall a very charming home!"
3749523,76455693,2016-05-27,40161568,June,Lovely vintage home that was just as described in the listing. Great location within walking distance from Whole Foods and The Warren Tavern....we took advantage of both. Great proximity to the Harvard University. Rooms were comfortable and kitchen was well stocked to meet our needs. The parking place was a definite plus for this area. We'd definitely stay again....looking at upcoming medical conferences in the Boston area and this home is a contender.
3749523,77170419,2016-05-30,9203125,Chen,"我们提前到了,当时Dee正在打扫房子,她非常热情的让我们把行李放在了客厅,并且留了我们的电话,等她打扫完就发了短信给我们,方便我们入住。"
房子非常非常干净整洁,可以看出屋主是一个非常有品位的人。入住前发给我们的房屋介绍也非常有帮助,很详细的介绍了整个房子以及我们可能遇到的问题。,,,
步行的距离你就可以找到whole food market,还有其他的一些商店,非常方便。住的小区也很安静舒适,"住了三天非常满意。\"",,
3749523,78740646,2016-06-08,14116074,Debbie,Nicolo's house was impressive. Upon entering we oohed-aahed from room to room. There were six of us and everyone had plenty of space.  It was clean and charming. The location can't be beat. Just a short walk over the Charles River to North End.
"My only recommendation would be to equip the living room with a nice quiet fan. No a/c unit and the fan that was there had a chipped blade and sounded like it was going to take off making it too noisy to talk. Also the king bed seemed to slope to the middle. All in all the Wiley house was perfect for our family trip. Thank you!\"",,,,,
3749523,79416026,2016-06-12,48877932,Nancy,"We absolutely loved our stay at home this charming historic colonial. It was exactly as the pictures show. The home is furnished with beautiful antiques and was very comfortable for six adults. Although we did not cook any meals during our stay, the kitchen is well stocked with anything you could possibly need. There was a very detailed Welcome Guide for our reference, which we really appreciated. The neighborhood is very quiet and within walking distance of Bunker Hill Monument, The Warren Tavern and restaurants. The parking space is very tight so we returned our SUV and was able to walk everywhere. Very close to the Freedom Trail just a walk across the Charles River. Be sure to take the Duck Boat tour as it is very fun and informative. We met a neighbor that lives across the street and watched the Bunker Hill Parade with them. We had been to the Cape for a few days before coming to Charlestown. I must say that our visit to this lovely home and city was the highlight of our trip. We would love to come back for a longer visit to this charming house and friendly neighborhood. By the way an Uber drive to the airport was under $15.00. Thank you for opening your beautiful home to us."
3749523,79937870,2016-06-15,12473503,Nicole,"We loved our stay here! A historic home in a terrific location. We were able to walk to the USS Constitution, the Aquarium, and then to the North End for dinner. So convenient to be able to ditch the car and explore the city on foot. The house is well set up, beds were comfortable. Communication was clear and easy. Thanks!"
3749523,80315995,2016-06-17,31887027,Trond,"House is in convenient location in Charlestown, with a nice ~15 minute walk to sights in Boston/downtown.  For guests with sensitivity to noise  the house is not ideal as there are a couple of busy roads very close by.   The house itself is charming for a very old structure and has an interesting decor that takes you back in time.   There is an outside space that is nice  on warm days but there is not much privacy as the house is surrounded by apartment buildings."
3749523,82663730,2016-06-28,64675494,Michelle,"Nicolo's home in Charlestown was the perfect landing pad for our Boston visit.  With our 2 kids, Mother-in-law and Brother-in-law with us, everyone had plenty of space to spread out.   The decor was charming and we really appreciated the outside dining table, bikes and well equipped kitchen.  The neighborhood was fantastic and an easy walk into downtown."
3749523,84920376,2016-07-09,55591559,Nels,Fantastic location in historic and period authentic Charlestown. Walking distance to many attractions including Bunker Hill and USS Constitution . Perfect for vacationing family who needs more space than a hotel can provide. Kitchen is great to have also.
3749523,85479228,2016-07-11,70064005,Alissa,"We loved this house!  It took us right back to the historic time period that the neighborhood is famous for.  It was a perfect place to stay while my family of 6 was in Boston for the weekend.  The house is very comfortable and the host was very helpful answering the questions we had during our stay.  Thanks for the detailed Welcome Guide, also.  I would recommend this house to future travelers."
3749523,86548258,2016-07-16,28998777,Jordan,"Nice place, and a nice refurbishment of the old house.  Not too far a walk from the downtown area of Bunker Hill, and not bad to drive to once you figured out how to get in and out of all the Boston one way streets. Quiet neighborhood for the most part. Individual rooms were nice and the beds were decent. All the amenities were there and the kitchen was well appointed. In the hottest days of the summer, the first floor was hard to keep cool, but the bedrooms were comfortable for sleeping."
3749523,87349237,2016-07-19,33605072,John,"Nicolo, you have a beautiful home in a great location.  We were close to all of the attractions and sights that Boston has to offer. Great amenities and plenty of space for my party of six. We would definitely book this home again."

This property was one of the first to pop up in our search and the quick response from the host, secured our lodging and allowed the rest of the business trip to go off without any issues."
The home was as described and very comfortable. It was HOT in Boston while we were there. A large fan provided on the ground floor help circulate air on that level,otherwise window AC units kept the sleeping rooms very comfortable.,,,,
There are a few nice restaurants walking distance from the home,including a nice coffee shop. A brief walk over the Charlestown Bridge and you'll be in Boston's North End (less than 10 minutes).,,,,

Her apartment is kept very tidy and cutely decorated, and the futon bed was very comfortable.  Pumpkin the cat was friendly enough to visit with me from time to time.

We had no problems getting to or getting in to the houseboat.  We found it very clean and neat.  The appliances and furniture were newish and in great condition. The coffeemaker was a challenge at first as there were no directions for it.  We looked it up online and were able to figure it out.  There were no coffee mugs or hair dryer - a call to JJ set that right.  The water draining in our bathroom sink was slow and that was tweaked as well.  The shower was very good. We spent one afternoon sitting on the topside deck watching the ships in the harbor - the view was awesome. The boat was in a wonderful location to access all of Boston - within five minutes were the North End, Faneuil Hall Marketplace, the aquarium, Rowes Wharf and all the ferries, whale watching boats and cruise boats. I wouldn't hesitate to rent from SleepAfloat again.  In fact, I'm looking forward to it."

1094599,8564556,2013-11-05,8684021,Pamela,A unique place to stay. The Capricornus had all the amenities of a hotel room. Would definitely stay again.
1094599,8817997,2013-11-19,9396959,Claire,Bateau très confortable et bien placé en plein centre ville. Le personnel d'administration disponible et efficace.

1094599,12851020,2014-05-12,10474194,Beth,We stayed on Capricornicus houseboat during a business trip to Boston and had a great experience.  The location was very convenient and we had everything we needed for our stay.
1094599,13367958,2014-05-26,6593898,Alexandra,I recommend it to anyone ! It's such a cool experience and very comfortable to sleep on a boat. We used the BBQ and had breakfast on the roof of the boat. The location is great and it was clean. Id go back there next time I go to Boston.
1094599,15997924,2014-07-20,8442245,Peter,"The location and atmosphere was great. As we had no car, we caught a water taxi from Logan Airport to Sargeants Wharf (which is adjacent to Lewis Wharf). Lewis Wharf, and our boat, Capricornia, was only a short walk to the Freedom Trail, Hanover Street Restaurants and Boston Common."
Our boat was very clean,"and we were pleasantly surprised with the size and spaciousness of the boat. \"",,,,
1094599,21936372,2014-10-27,4990659,Maggie,"We absolutely loved our stay on the boat and would choose it over a hotel anytime. It was clean, well equipped and more spacious than we expected. The beds were comfortable and we all slept really well. It was cosy inside and we loved the top deck too. The marina felt safe and it felt quite special staying there. It was also much closer than we thought to Quincy Market etc. John who met us was a great guy and so helpful. We really recommend this place to stay and hope to return one day."
1094599,29838802,2015-04-13,3869437,Jesus,We had a fantastic time on this house boat. Ther are 2 bedrooms and 1 pullout couch in living room. Boat sleeps up to 6 people pretty comfortably. Full bathroom and full shower. They are linked inside by sliding door so someone can use the bathroom while someone showers. Nice touch. Very clean. Huge couch with 2 arm chairs. Nice full kitchen. Definitely better than we expected. We will definitely be back this summer.
1094599,48593458,2015-09-27,13031565,Scott,Great place to spend time in Boston!  Close to many north end attractions.  Boat was clean and quite roomy.  Will come back if i'm ever returning to Boston.
1094599,52323230,2015-10-28,43503363,Peter,We came late on a Saturday night and let ourselves in.  The instructions were excellent and we had no problems.  The accommodation is very good and the location is next to everything in the old part of Boston (the North End).
"Bob was very responsive when we needed an extra towel and a lightbulb changed.  Having a living room and kitchen to come back to was really fun for the whole family and sure beats getting a couple of hotel rooms!\"",,,,,
1094599,73748537,2016-05-09,51716511,Sara,Very accommodating host who let us check in early.  Very comfortable boat in a convenient position for all the key sites of Boston
1094599,74568105,2016-05-15,6319740,Rachel Lillian,"Had a wonderful time on the Capricornus! The space was much larger than expected, very clean, and well appointed.  The location was excellent, right next to Little Italy and super quiet.  David was an excellent host, responding to all of our questions promptly and giving us a helpful tour when we arrived.  Highly recommend!"
1094599,76459633,2016-05-27,55780365,Cassie,"We loved staying on the house boat.  It was exactly as described and pictured.  Clean, comfortable, and fabulous location.  Perfect accommodations for our family of 5.  Just a few minutes walk to the Aquarium, North End, USS Constitution (well this is a little more than a few minutes but definitely walkable,) the T, and all sorts of Boston tours.  Our host was kind, helpful, respectful, and generous.  He directed us to a fabulous Italian market, just a few minutes walk from the boat, and we dined on delicious mouthwatering fresh pasta al fresco on the top deck of the boat each night.   This is where we plan to stay on all future trips to Boston."
1094599,91520050,2016-08-05,38315401,Henry,"This is a great place to stay. We were really pleased we chose this instead of a hotel. The boat is clean, comfortable and has loads of space, in a great location. We would recommend to anyone."
1094599,93233361,2016-08-12,65834078,Jean,This was a great place to stay and relax. It had what we needed and was very convenient.
3602379,20970812,2014-10-08,21819367,Jean,"I had a great visit to Boston.  The apartment is newly renovated in a quiet, pretty residential area.  Owner and family live in building.  Owner, Alex, is friendly and helpful.  T Orange Line stop: Roxbury Crossing is close by and takes you into the center of the city in a few stops.  Very easy ride."
3602379,21302941,2014-10-14,1536817,Amy,"Perfect place to explore Boston on a budget!  This place was beautifully adorned, luxurious and parking was a breeze.  Alex was the perfect host for me- made it easy to get in, relax and enjoy the weekend- would stay there anytime I go to Boston again."
3602379,21541576,2014-10-19,21864525,Tom,Alex was very accomodating and easy to get a hold of. The place has recently been renovated and everything was clean and tidy. The place was spacious and was a please to surprise. The place was located near a T line so getting in and out of the city was easy. I would thoroughly recommend this place to others. Thanks.
3602379,21687402,2014-10-21,10544729,Martin,"Alex did a great job of getting us settled in with no hassle. Access to the place was simple and it was very well maintained. He has done a great job renovating and restoring the house and it certainly shows, he did it with good taste. No IKEA stuff anywhere! It is well worth the stay if you appreciate quality. Close proximity to the T made getting in and out of the city very simple and straight forward."
3602379,22071872,2014-10-29,14374729,Jackie,"Enjoyed our stay very much! Alex's place is both comfortable and conveniently located to the T and  the Hub Way Bike shares. It was also a short walk to the Northeastern campus, which was a daily destination for us. Alex has his place tastefully decorated and all amenities that we needed. Alex was also available to answer questions and give us insight into the area. We will stay again, in the future."
3602379,22319437,2014-11-03,22287402,Linda,"I had a great experience at Alex long's apt. He was a great host! The apartment was very nice , beautiful kitchen and comfy couch with tv amd wireless. It was well furnished with everything you need. The jacuzzi tub was relaxing and the bed was very comfortable!"
The only drawback was its in Roxbury which is not the greatest of areas. It's quite a walk to the store! There is a t station not too far away,but not close enough when weather is bad! I took taxis the whole time!,,,,
"It is about 3 miles from downtown! I was so happy I had a kitchen and not a hotel room!\"",,,,,
3602379,22706599,2014-11-12,22651498,Laury,"Great place! Beautiful remodeled and decorated. Great appliances, well stocked kitchen. (And Whole Foods isn't too far away!) Close to all the places in Boston we wanted to go. Easy access to the T, but lots of parking on the street for a rental car as well. Why go with an expensive Boston hotel when you can have all this? Alex was the perfect blend of attentive and respectful. Will definitely come back the next time we are in Boston."
3602379,22954181,2014-11-18,22525052,Alex,The home was a beautiful place and the new renovations look amazing. It provided easy access the T and a short ride into the heart of the city. There was plenty of on street parking for the times we needed to drive.
Alex was a helpful host,answering any questions I had and making us feel welcome.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
3602379,25858009,2015-01-27,17472222,Rushita,My stay here was awesome! Alex was super accommodating and I have no complaints whatsoever.  In the pictures the apartment looked great but it's even better in person! Next time I'm in Boston I will be staying here definitely.
3602379,27252478,2015-03-01,24745175,Andrew,"Alex was a great host.  His unit is beautiful and located nearby the Convention Center, which made for easy commute each day."
3602379,27703380,2015-03-09,27497060,Joe,Alex was very accommodating and honest. There was a minor issue that he gave me advanced warning on. He was super helpful and understanding when I had a car issue when I was supposed to checkout.
3602379,27772065,2015-03-11,22562703,D Brent,"Very nice space in a comfortable neighborhood that has flavor (isn't the sterile, generic environment found around hotel chains)"
"Very accommodating and easy to communicate with.\"",,,,,
3602379,28427986,2015-03-23,19694150,Emilie,The apartment was beautiful and clean with wonderful amenities. Prefect area to explore Boston. Alex was a gracious and extremely helpful host and we would love to stay here again!
3602379,28901726,2015-03-31,230641,Charles,"This place is phenomenal. Spacious, 2 stories, everything is brand new. When compared to a hotel, well, I cannot understand why anyone would stay in a hotel. Alex' rental is more than $100 less, when including hotel's exorbitant taxes and parking charge. Great communication from Alex. We stayed for 2 days and had no issues. Met Alex and his feisty puppy when we were checking out. I would most definitely stay here again if I want to be in this area of Boston."
3602379,29132781,2015-04-04,28646078,Jake,"We enjoyed the apartment; it was clean and comfortable. Not ideal for young kids (steep staircase without a handrail) but not terrible. Alex was a helpful host, and we especially appreciate his help coordinating our stay with another AirBnB host for a night when his place was booked."
3602379,29767272,2015-04-12,1849812,Jen,"We loved staying at Alex's apartment during our trip to Boston. The apartment was better than in pictures and exactly what we were looking for - quiet, comfortable, clean and spacious. It was so nice to have a fully equipped kitchen and we loved that the bedroom and bathroom were separate from the living area - a rarity in Boston!"
Alex was quick to respond to any questions we had and made us feel very welcome in his home. We loved the neighbourhood and free parking was a bonus.,,,,,
We will definately stay with Alex and his family when we are back in Boston.,,,,,
"Thanks for being such a gracious host!!\"",,,,,
3602379,30442395,2015-04-22,2797490,Nathan,"Alex's place was just as described by both Alex and many reviewers - clean, spacious and recently modernized. Very short walk to the T which was only about a 20-min ride into downtown (or 5 min over to Sam Adams Brewery in the other direction). We very much enjoyed the stay and will definitely stay again the next time we return. Alex was a great host too - stopped by to make sure everything was going well. We even took him up on buying his pair of tickets for one night at Fenway - AMAZING seats (do it if you have the chance). Would definitely recommend staying here!"
3602379,31392907,2015-05-04,5005938,Simon,The apartment Alex is incredible. It looks much better than in the picture with luxury amenities that make this place a very nice place to stay in Boston. I would highly recommend it to anyone. Location is very convenient both for parking and public transportation.
3602379,32680547,2015-05-20,12553958,Dara,"Alex is just lovely and the space is very nice - a little bit construction zone but otherwise very nice.  Very quiet and restful.  The neighborhood is fine - nothing really close to eat so bring it in or be prepared to walk, T, or drive.  The back porch is wonderful!"
3602379,32829338,2015-05-22,455325,Mark,"Alex provides a code to enter the dwelling so it's VERY convenient. Also, it's located less than a 1/2 mile from public transportation which is great!  The bedroom is almost subterranean so it's really quiet.  The apartment is really spacious and well appointed. It's down a quiet alley so not a lot of traffic noise, etc."
3602379,33151352,2015-05-25,797099,Louis-P,"Amazing place, we had a great time in Boston. Alex was a really good host. The apt. is close to the public transport in an quiet neighborhood."
3602379,33593586,2015-05-30,15527756,Ranjit,"Stayed at Alex's place in May 2015. Just as described in the listing. It was new, modern and very comfortable. Master bedroom in the basement also gave some privacy from the kids :) The space was fairly large and comfortable for a family of four. Parking was on the street but ample parking which was a big plus. I understand that the area is not the best if you speak to Boston folks but we thought the area was just fine - a short drive to anywhere in Boston. There was perhaps an issue that there were no eating places/grocery stores we could see within walking distance but since we had a rental, that was not an issue at all."
Overall,great stay. Alex was always available to help but we since everything was well set up,"we didn't need any help !!\"",,,
3602379,34103999,2015-06-04,30944804,Anthony,Nice comfortable accommodations with well done new modern renovations all at a great price.

3602379,35227309,2015-06-16,29445164,Chris,The space was wonderful. Very clean. Location was great.
3602379,35934736,2015-06-23,12388710,Amy,Alex was incredibly nice and very accommodating. The place was perfect for what we needed- a home base around Jamaica Plain to visit with family and friends. There was plenty of space to cook. The bedroom downstairs was a great set-up: we put our toddler to bed and were able to invite a few guests over for dinner.  It's a 5 minute walk to the orange line and was ideal for getting downtown or to Jamaica Plain.
3602379,36300560,2015-06-27,34469409,José,El departamento es tal como lo anunciado y Alex fue muy amable con nosotros.
Si uno no anda en automovil,"el barrio no es muy bueno.\"",,,,
3602379,36739983,2015-06-30,7124107,Ulrika,"Great place for a weekend stay, especially if you go to Boston by car. Free and safe parking on the street and only a few minutes walk to the subway. Only three stops from Back Bay and five from downtown."
Clean and neat apartment where we easily did some cooking. It all looks much better than the pictures.,,,,,
Comfortable bed for two downstairs next to the bathroom. On the ground floor an open space with kitchen,dining table for four and an armchair and a sofabed (not all that comfortable to sleep in for an adult) by the TV. And a porch to step out to in the back.,,,,
"Alex is easy to get in touch with and really helpful. I am not used to garbage disposals but Alex took care of the mess I made with that... Thanks!\"",,,,,
3602379,38145268,2015-07-13,23986843,Felipe,"Alex was a great host. The place was clean and very comfortable. The location is excellent, a short walk from the T and two stops away from the Sam Adams Brewery. Would definitely stay there again."
3602379,38940842,2015-07-19,38288399,Charles,"A terrific spot close-in to Fenway, Back Bay, and more. Enjoyed the comfort and convenience, as well as the distinctive design and neighborhood. Parking was easy as promised, which is very helpful when you are driving in an unfamiliar place.  And all at a reasonable price, especially for Greater Boston."
3602379,39964396,2015-07-27,27754044,Donna Rae,"Superlative accommodation, host and location. The quiet little dead-end street is like a little Shangri-la in the heart of Boston. (Really enjoyed relaxing on the back deck in the swing chair!) Easy access to Roxbury Stop on the T & a nice stroll on walking path to NEU. I'll be back Alex! Thank you!"
3602379,40336771,2015-07-30,6312704,Graciela,"Alex was attentive and responded quickly to all questions and concerns, before and during our stay. The apartment is beautiful, clean and in a great location."
3602379,41128299,2015-08-04,5420887,John Patrick,Overall great stay. The room was exactly as described. A little bit if a scare about the parking situation but got resolved. The wifi never did work during our whole stay though.
3602379,41458980,2015-08-07,4278302,Quentin,"l'accueil avec Alex, c'est plutôt bien passé, tout était décrit dans l'annonce. nous avons trouvé facilement. il faut savoir que c'est un quartier résidentiel avec peu de choses autour, mais il y a un metro à 7 min a pieds qui vous emmène dans le centre. L'appartement est agréable à vivre mais un peu sombre, j'ai fait aussi remarqué a Alex que la chambre était un peu humide, je lui souhaite de résoudre le problème. mis a part cela nous étions très bien dans son appartement."
3602379,41782885,2015-08-09,11453650,William,Alex was very responsive to our communications. He was helpful on the phone when our Uber driver had a little trouble finding the place. (The driver didn't have the zip code). The apartment was as described. Recently remodeled and very well done. Very close to the subway. Very easy and comfortable. A great way to see Boston.
3602379,43446232,2015-08-19,9410199,Greg,"Alex has created a wonderful opportunity for Airbnb guests.  The reservation process was quick and easy.  Alex met me on arrival.  We talked for several minutes ... like reacquainting with an ole friend.  Great guy and family!  Then, we toured the apartment.  It is new remodeled, beautifully furnished, and looks as pictured or better.   He deserves to be proud of his design and recent handiwork.  The first floor is an open concept space with a comfortable living room, full kitchen with stainless appliances and granite counter-tops, and a full-size dining table.  The large bedroom and bathroom are downstairs.  The bed and linens are very comfortable and tastefully selected.   The room has ample closet and dresser space for extended stays. The bath is nicely tiled with a combination jetted tub /shower and modern granite vanity.  The apartment is very private, but it was comforting to know that Alex and his family were nearby if needed.  They live on the upper floors of this Boston Brownstone.  Conveniently, this home is a five minute walk from a T station and within a few stops / 20 minutes of the Freedom Trail.   Truly, a lucky find!"
3602379,44033314,2015-08-23,20433233,Russell,Alex is a very nice and friendly person. He made sure our stay was comfortable and the apartment is very well maintained and a perfect place to live in Boston in that budget. Convenient parking on the street made my stay all the more easy.
3602379,45367957,2015-09-02,8514024,Clara,"Sono stata per 5 giorni a casa di Alex in agosto insieme a mio marito e mio figlio diciassettenne. La casa è molto spaziosa, soprattutto la zona giorno è molto bella con una grande cucina ben attrezzata che si affaccia su una veranda immersa nel verde. La zona è molto silenziosa e si dorme bene. Noi avevamo un'auto a noleggio che è stata molto comoda per raggiungere il centro e i negozi, anche se non indispensabile. Alex è stato molto gentile nel rispondere a tutte le mie domande a darmi suggerimenti sulle cose da fare in zona. Consiglio a tutti questa casa, la prossima volta che sarò a Boston ci tornerò sicuramente."
3602379,45570376,2015-09-04,12433207,Pam,Our stay was very enjoyable.  The apartment was really nice and we only wished we could of stayed longer.  We walked everywhere we wanted to go and it was really easy to get around.  Alex was helpful and responded to all of my requests quickly.  I would definitely recommend this place.
3602379,46503699,2015-09-11,26500716,Natalia,"This home was very comfortable, clean, and nicely decorated. My family felt right at home with the lovely kitchen and cozy living area, as well as a bedroom on a separate floor, which made for nice privacy with 4 adults. The home felt updated and luxurious inside with stylish finishes. Alex was very friendly and communicative before and after our stay. Although we didn't have any issues while we were there, it was good to know that in case we needed anything, he was accessible and lived inside the building. Definitely recommended!"
3602379,47255275,2015-09-17,38306253,Olga,"We rented this apartment in September. Alex was very nice to let us check in earlier, since nobody was staying there the day before. We really appreciate it."
Apartment is recently renovated. In fact,there's still  some ongoing constraction projects. Kitchen is very modern with granite counters,big dining table and plenty of storage. It has cozy living space and relaxing back porch.,,,
Bathroom and bedroom are downstairs in the basement. Although both of them are newly done,it's very humid there and has some musty smell. Also bathtub is very deep and if you are not a tall person or have some back issues it's quite challenging to get in and out. Speaking of bathroom,it would be good if there was some kind of hook on the bathroom door to hang your robe or other clothes.,,,
We were in Alex's apartment for 5 nights and since as I mentioned earlier it's very humid in the bathroom,towels stayed a bit damp constantly. So,I wish there was a dryer or we could get towels replacement at least once.,,,
"Alex's place is located at the end of the quiet street in Roxbury area of Boston. It's about 6 blocks from Roxbury crossing T station. It's very easy to get in and out of the  city.\"",,,,,
3602379,48709522,2015-09-28,39712272,Lindsay,Alex was great with answering all of our questions before our trip! We loved the apartment! It was perfect for a weekend away for four! Such a great location! Can't wait to come back!
3602379,49325085,2015-10-03,15259374,Mugdha,We stayed at Alex ' s charming two level boston home and it was perfectly convenient to move around from as the orange line station Roxbury crossing is closeby. Alex is a wonderful helpful guy who saved us from missing our connection when the Boston cab didn't send a cab as ordered though we had reserved one the night before. All in all we had a real good time and would go back anytime. Thanks Alex.
"P.S. He was very good about our early arrival. Pulled a rabbit out of his hat. \"",,,,,
3602379,49632801,2015-10-05,42470675,Jennifer,"Perfect apartment for a weekend getaway, a home away from home. Alex was very helpful and available for any issues that came up."

3602379,51042401,2015-10-17,36448001,Wesley,"What a find!!   Alex, your apartment is flawless.   You have an amazing taste in design.   We could not have asked for more in our home away from home.    Even for a senior, the trip to the train station was just a short walk away.   We greatly appreciated your availability when we had questions.  Thanks so much for accommodating this Seattle couple."
3602379,51607457,2015-10-22,35434440,Jennifer,My boyfriend and I stayed with Alex for 4 nights. The place was clean and beautifully updated. It was really easy to get around the city from this place.

3602379,54367588,2015-11-19,31947089,Eckhard,"Meine Frau und ich hatten eine sehr schöne Zeit in der Wohnung. Sie war groß, sehr sauber und bestens eingerichtet. Auch Besuch konnte empfangen werden. Alles funktionierte gut. Das Schlafzimmer im Untergeschoss war zweckmäßig und das Bett sehr bequem, lediglich die Heizung bzw. Klimaanlage störte etwas. Die Wohnung befindet sich in einer ruhigen Sackgasse, trotzdem ist man mit der TUBE rasch im Geschehen. Über die durch Codes gesicherten Eingangstüren konnte man selbständig die Wohnung betreten, sodass wir anfangs keinen Kontakt zu Alex hatten. Später konnten wir ihn jedoch als Gastgeber kennen lernen, der sich sicherlich auch bei Fragen um Antworten kümmern würde; wir hatten aber keine Fragen. Wenn wir mal wieder nach Boston kommen, werden wir gerne erneut bei Alex wohnen."
3602379,54750895,2015-11-23,16207000,Lise,"I was in Boston for a conference and stayed there for 3 nights, sharing with a colleague. It was close to the subway and reasonably quiet. Good value for money compared to hotels (which are ridiculously expensive in Boston). The flat is not very bright but that was not an issue for me."
3602379,57912852,2015-12-30,25805109,Michelle,"Alex's place was perfect, finding it was a little difficult but once I found the place and got inside I had no words. The apartment was stunning. The area was fairly quiet, either that or the apartment was isolated enough to drown out any noise from outside! I loved the feeling of being there, Alex was a great host, he even told me about 2 apps I've never even heard of before! I feel so in with technology now! The first snow of the season also arrived during my stay, which I gladly faced as I've never been in Boston when it snowed! The purpose of my trip ended well, and I'm so glad Alex was so accommodating and patient with my cluelessness! We even spoke of a potential extra night of me staying should the weather become severe, and he also called me at night to make sure I made it home safe, I've never had a more pleasant host than Alex, honestly. He's the best! I would 100% use his place again"
3602379,61102420,2016-01-31,39186204,Barbara,When you are searching for a place to call home for a stay in Boston you cannot go wrong with Alex's home. Everything is picture perfect. The home is centrally located and we found it very easy to find our way around... despite it being our first time in Boston. Alex was so easy to work with and was excellent at responding to any and all questions that I had. I look forward to a return trip to Boston and my next stay in the lovely home.
3602379,63365251,2016-02-22,55273460,Chen,Alex is a great person and his house is really good for family.
3602379,63640356,2016-02-25,28226273,Daniel,"Alex was very helpful with all the questions I had.  The apartment was very nice and clean just as described in the post. Although the location is very convenient, only two short blocks from the subway, the neighborhood wasn't the best.  However it's not the worst neighborhood either, as long as you're street smart, you should be fine. There was a binder full of things to do with maps and directions in the apartment that we found very helpful."
"The post says free parking on site however it's street parking with a two hour limit.\"",,,,,
3602379,64898653,2016-03-08,12030787,Franklin,I enjoyed my stay at Alex's place. Cozy and centrally located with easy access to restaurants and coffee shops. Recommend for business travelers.
3602379,67539242,2016-03-30,59817745,Matthew,We had decided to try AirBNB this time because a hotel stay would be too much for when we were in town for our sons open heart surgery. We couldn't have asked for a better host. Alex was amazing. We were there over Easter and Alex even went out of his way and got our son something!  The house was perfect. A few minute drive from Boston Children's and the neighborhood is great. The location keeps you just outside of all the Boston traffic. We highly recommend using Alex and we will from here on out.
3602379,68376541,2016-04-04,32517529,Ashley,"The house was great and it's exactly how it was pictured. I would recommend researching the neighborhood if you're not from a large city or have experience with them. The house is in a perfect location. We used uber the whole trip and it only cost from $6-$12 dollars each time. As for Alex, he was the best Airbnb host I've had so far. He is extremely accommodating and helpful."
3602379,69253402,2016-04-10,41256693,Helen,I came with my daughter to look at colleges. The weather was horrid but the apartment & all else great.
Alex was helpful & available. He checked in with us the day following arrival to make sure we were happy. He stored our bags before/ after check in/ out.,,,,,
The apartment was exactly what we expected and very clean.,,,,,
The transportation options were even better than expected. The T Orange line  is a 5m walk from the apartment. We had no trouble getting out even all the way to Tufts in less than 45m. The North End is right on the Orange line,where there are a ton of historic sites & food. I thought we'd need to Uber back at night but we didn't; the T is very safe,as is Alex's neighborhood. (To put that statement in context -- I grew up in a small farming community,still live in a small town,and pretty much suspect that everyone in and city is out to get my purse if not my life).,
The best thing to me is that I was terrified my daughter would love Boston and want to move all the way across the country. She did but its okay! I will enjoy visiting her,and I won't worry (too much) about her being in such a big place.,,,,
(Regarding parking,we did not have a car. There is parking by the apartment but nowhere else in Boston as far as I can tell. It's so easy to T or Uber around from Alex's that I would suggest that. ),,,,
"\"",,,,,
3602379,72505856,2016-05-03,27180286,Stephanie,"My husband and I loved everything about this place. It's in a very quiet, nice looking neighborhood, just far enough away from the city for some quiet, but only a 4 minute walk to the Orange Line to get where we needed to go. The place is beautiful, and the pictures show exactly what you're getting. We were so tired walking around Boston all day, and being able to come home and cook a meal in that amazing kitchen saved us some money and sanity. Oh, and that Jacuzzi. Such a godsend after walking all day in the cold Boston rain. Bed is super comfy. Alex gave us plenty of privacy and we much appreciated that, but it was still reachable via phone. I would book this place again in a heartbeat if I ever found myself in Boston again."
3602379,74042979,2016-05-12,59536268,Jennifer,"This is a very cute, quiet place to stay. Alex was a gracious host. If you need absolute dark to sleep, bring an eye mask because the downstairs bedroom isn't super dark. There's nice wispy curtains though, so it is very private. It's somewhat damp downstairs, but the bathroom is lovely!"
3602379,76596686,2016-05-28,8541708,Tiffany,The apt was just as pictured and easy to find. It was even more spacious than I thought it was going to be. The back patio was nice for enjoying a cup of coffee in the morning. It was also super convenient having free parking nearby. Definitely recommend staying here if you're going to be checking out Boston.
3602379,77284323,2016-05-31,44774016,David,"The house was just at looks in the pictures, very well put together and comfortable! We really appreciated the fact that it was so close to the Museum of Fine Arts Boston and the Prudential Center (where the duck tours departs from). The host made sure we were comfortable and was very easy to reach. Thank you for making our trip to Boston that much better!"
3602379,77822242,2016-06-03,39054184,Yin,"Great experience! Three of us were there for a conference. This place was exactly what we needed. The location was very close to the train station so the commute was easy. There are also plenty street parking around the area. The apartment itself was clean, spacious, and well decorated; so we all got to relax well."
3602379,78122739,2016-06-05,591745,Isaac,Alex was very welcoming to his home. He was very responsive to our questions leading up to the stay and was very responsive when we were there.
This is a beautiful home in the beautiful neighborhood of Fort Hill (close to T and great parking!),,,,,
"I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a true Boston experience! \"",,,,,
3602379,78727016,2016-06-08,3464981,Keith,Alex is a really awesome host.  He greeted me upon arrival and gave me the scoop on what I needed to know about the place and surrounding area.  He's a very friendly host and made me feel right at home -- in fact we ended up chatting for well over an hour after arrival.
The unit is most certainly not well represented by the photos -- as is the case with many images on ABNB,they just don't do the place justice!  The unit is spacious and well decorated,with a well-apportioned kitchen,should you want to get your Gordon Ramsay on.  The bedroom is tucked away downstairs and is quiet.  If you're looking to get some good sleep with a minimum of the typical distraction of a city (cars,subways,etc.) you will get that here.
The location is (as everyone says) within short 15m walk to the Longwood/HMS area -- just don't forget your umbrella as I did and suffer a late night rain shower.  The subway is less than a 6 minute walk and you can easily connect to the commuter line should you need to get a little further out into the adjacent communities without  a car.  If you're looking for a late night coffee or tea,try JP Licks -- a straight shot toward HMS.  There are other restaurants and bars,but in general the area is pretty quiet and low key after dark.,,,
Overall,this unit is a great value for someone looking to spend some time in Boston@,,,,

3602379,79248232,2016-06-12,24951014,Audrey,Alex was super friendly and helpful. We were very close to the T and had a nice clean space to relax after walking the city all day.
3602379,80024050,2016-06-15,34135498,Argiris,This was a phantastic stay. Alex gave very good information in advance. The house is 5 min walk from Roxbury Crossing therefore an easy ride with the T wherever u want to go in Boston. The house in 2 levels is very well designed. Modern kitchen with anything u need to cook. The place is much better than its photographs. The bedroom was in the basement with the bathroom and they are both really nice. We met Alex the last day. He is really friendly and knows what he is doing with his business. Fully recommend for a nice stay short or long in Boston.
3602379,80774162,2016-06-19,68734955,Elaine,"First Airbnb experience and it was terrific.  The place was great and the host attentive but not intrusive.  We would definitely come back. Boston is lovely, the street is lovely and the house was just right.  We cooked a few meals and spent some nice time on the back porch with coffee in the morning. Highly recommend this flat!"
3602379,81680291,2016-06-24,67976495,Katrina,"I'll just start off by saying that this place is amazing!...and now I'll tell you why. Alex is such a nice person, he made sure that we were settling in well and asked us if we needed anything, but other than that left us to our own adventure (which we didn't mind at all.) The apartment is gorgeous! I could go on and on about the kitchen for days. It looks just like the photos. I was so happy that we were able to have a few dinners in while we were on our trip. I was told when we got there that we weren't in the best of neighborhoods...but we didn't have any problems. Everyone we ran into on the street was nice, and I can honestly say I didn't ever feel like I was in danger. My friend even felt comfortable biking around at night. The place is about a 5 minute walk to the nearest T (URL HIDDEN) prepared for hills. There is wi-fi and cable, we did have an issue with the wi-fi our first night but I also have comcast and understand how annoying it can be...and as soon as we talked to Alex about it the next morning, he fixed it. I would just like to warn anyone that it is a split level... It's obvious when you look back at the pictures, but I just didn't think about it until we got there. So be aware that the bedroom and bathroom are downstairs (below the ground level floor). If you can manage stairs, this is the place for you! We've already recommended it to family, and if we return to Boston we hope that this place will be open!"
3602379,82566264,2016-06-28,32298348,Jennifer,"Alex was a very gracious host. Although we were able to get in on our own when we arrived, he met us and gave us some tips on getting around. He checked in on us a couple of times (he lives nearby), and fixed the cable on the tv. The space was just lovely, completely decked out with all you could need. The neighborhood was eclectic, filled with beautiful old homes and very near public transportation."
"We would return to this spot in a heartbeat!\"",,,,,
3602379,85827302,2016-07-13,16647787,Roberto,Everything was fine and as promised.
Alex house is very comfortable,quite and clean and there is a nice area outside where is possible to relax.,,,,
Alex was very precise and kind and provide us with many information about what to do in Boston.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
3602379,86469034,2016-07-16,56054166,Elizabeth,"We had a wonderful stay at Alex's.  He was very helpful and welcoming.  The apartment is spacious and well-stocked.  It has been renovated and updated and is charming.  It has a lovely little deck off the kitchen where we sat and had our morning coffee from the nearby Dunkin' Donuts each morning.  Our son also lives in Roxbury where he attends Northeastern University, and because Boston is so small and accessible, it was easy to get around either walking, on the T, or using an Uber.  We will definitely stay there again when we visit Boston!  Thanks, Alex!"
3602379,87083899,2016-07-18,8108319,Nicola,"Fantastic place! Just beautiful, and we loved the outdoor deck in the am for coffee/tea. Very comfortable bed and bedroom. Wonderful air-conditioning, which is great in the summer. Can't think of a thing to change. Keep up the good work!!"
3602379,88541568,2016-07-24,17040667,Olesya,"Alex was very helpful, during both the planning stage and the trip itself. The apartment was true to the listing and even better than expected. I wish we had more time to cook meals in the beautiful kitchen, and one of my favorite parts of the apartment is the hanging chair in the backyard. Location is comfortable for walking, taking the T, or getting an Uber. Great trip, would go back in a heartbeat and recommend to all."
3602379,89285243,2016-07-27,50824469,Siyi,This was the best Airbnb experience I've ever had! The easiest check in. The space was gorgeous and HUGE for two people. Everything was really clean and up to date. Loved the fully stocked kitchen and was able to cook breakfast in the mornings. The balcony was really nice to sit and relax after a long day. The bed was so comfy. The neighborhood isn't very central and not inconvenient either. We were able to get the subway or a $10 uber to most places. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!
3602379,90201392,2016-07-31,82662513,Francis,L'appartement est spacieux et très bien aménagé. Nous avons apprécié le balcon-terrasse intime à l'arrière. Tous les équipement requis pour la cuisine y étaient. La propreté des lieux était impeccable.

Alex was friendly & very accessible without being intrusive at all. neighborhood was quiet & deck was awesome to have! everything we could have possibly needed was there & everything was clean & comfortable. overall great experience!"

3602379,96587808,2016-08-23,11948110,Marcus,"Alex was a great host and accomodating, we had an early flight and were able to check in early which was really helpful because we were traveling with a toddler. The apartment is comfortable and has great finishes. There are two levels on the first floor is the living room, kitchen, and dining room and the bathroom and bedroom are down stairs. It is centrally located, we didn't use public transportation this trip but the bus is two blocks away. Which is great because parking in Back Bay, Faneuil Hall and tourist areas is expensive and difficult."
6993585,47047095,2015-09-15,35303055,Mrs,"Nicholas was VERY accommodating and helpful. It was out first experience with airbnb and he made it a fabulous one. Loft was exactly as described and more. Perfect location around the corner from T. Neighborhood was near everything and within walking distance to lots of restaraunts and historical places. We would definitely stay here again. Easily accessible with our luggage and private elevator made us feel safe. Ten minutes from airport was a plus. Has to be one of the best places in Boston to stay, hands down!!"

The rooms are very spacious, as is the house. Everything you need for an enjoyable stay is right there: wonderful beds (especially the one in the larger bedroom), nice and fully equiped kitchen, washing machine etc. Public transportation to downtown Boston is really close. Bus 34 brings you to the oranje line (downtown Boston). We left with happy memories and we would highly recommend staying with them! Thanks for having us!"

There was extra fans, extra toiletries, extra towels in case we needed some. The house was beautiful and Keith and Beth were both very welcoming and friendly.

As we are with five, we were provided with an extra bed for our youngest, which worked great. We used both public transport and a (rented) car to get around; the bus stop is really quite close to the house so both options work. Keith even advised us on the best place to go for a run around the neighborhood! This bungalow was a great starting point for our trip, and we would certainly stay here again."

91588,71233146,2016-04-24,59380080,Ian,"Don't stay here if you like to sleep. I don't expect much from Airbnb, but the ability to sleep past 5:30am is one of them. Unfortunately the room here has 3 huge windows that Dave decided were best served by completely transparent white lace whisps of fabric, as opposed to actual curtains. It's so bright once the sun rises, you can comfortably read a book without turning on any lights. As I was unable to sleep, I texted Dave at 6:30 asking if anything could be done. He offered me a cheap plastic sleep mask; clearly he'd been in this situation before but neglected to actually do anything about it. Because of lack of proper curtains I ended up getting 4 hours of sleep before my conference. Avoid."
91588,72669049,2016-05-04,932539,Karen,"Dave's home is amazing...like a fun museum with all manner of curiosities on top of dressers, shelves and even in artful corners of the floor. My stop was just overnight so I could have a quick and easy access to the airport (and it was)."

Barney the dog was a good personality and a big softie.,,,,,
The location and proximity to UMass / Boston Harbour,and bars,restaurants,and transport is extremely convenient (as someone who didn't know Boston at all).,,

Dave kept in touch with me prior to my arrival and he was there to greet me & ask if I needed anything or had any questions. The bed was so comfortable,I never wanted to het out of bed. He had PLENTY of high quality bath towels on hand,too. The housemates were gone for most of the weekend,so I had the place to myself. It was pretty darn luxurious!,,
The neighborhood is tops! So pretty & quaint & so quiet. Everything you could wish for! I felt right at home.,,,,,
"The \"\"T\"\" is only about a 5 minutes walk from the house & there's a great little café & restaurant right next to it. The heart of Boston is a short train ride away!

They left check in and check out time open and left a lock box with the key in it for more convenient check in and check out. The room is private and locked which I appreciated. The host checked in if we needed anything which we didn't since they provided everything in the room before hand. They even texted me afterwards for feedback. These are great people with a room that is located 10 minutes away from the heart of Boston. Stay here.

Nice bed, big couch, TV and Wifi, nice bathroom and shower. Felt safe in this part of town, it was peaceful and quiet. Only a 10 minute walk to the nearest subway station, you can hop on and be in downtown Boston very quickly. Very convenient for us, as we went downtown every day. The hosts were very helpful and friendly, providing us with clear directions and reliable communication.

The bed is comfortable and the neighborhood street is very quiet. There is a decent amount of places to eat on the main street as well as a Rite Aid within walking distance. I never saw the hosts as I was out early and coming back late but I never needed a reason to contact them so that was fine. If I did needed to contact them, I had their number to call."

Since driving into Boston is not recommended, we hopped the Red Line into Park Street Station from which point we were able explore much of what Boston has to offer.  Upon arrival, Stacy made sure we had everything we needed for our stay.  The room itself was spacious and very comfortable.  We had a very favourable first impression of airbnb."

It is a spacious room with bed, sofa, and TV. We came on a Sunday night, and because there's a TV, we didn't miss Game Of Throne! Bottled water is also provided in the room. Both the bedroom and restrooms were clean. We loved our stay :)"
5844314,78994606,2016-06-10,71541173,Guy,"We had a great time in Boston and piters place was a definitely a big part. Beds were really comfortable and clean, we were provided anything we would need and really close to the metro. Would definitely stay again"

5844314,79546167,2016-06-13,74477342,Peter,The beds were quite comfortable and afforded us a full night's sleep we found more restful than average.
Finding street parking close by can be a challenge,especially on weekends... but we managed... and in our experience many Boston,,,,
neighborhoods are just like that.,,,,,
The bonus for me was finding the Velocity channel on the cable TV,,,,,
so I didn't miss the final weekend's Isle of Man TT live broadcast...,,,,,
"which I've  never found in any chain hotel/motel to date.\"",,,,,
5844314,79948100,2016-06-15,71730784,Brianna,"My friends and I adored this place! It's reasonably close to the T and also only a few minutes walk from a couple of bars and a convenience store, and the room itself is spacious and charming. Can't wait to stay here again!"
5844314,80115018,2016-06-16,74696015,Elizabeth,Great room! It looks exactly like it does in the picture and is very clean. The host is very helpful and leaves bottled waters in the room for you. I would recommend it to anyone who is going to Boston!

The room and the bathroom were clean, the bed and the couch were comfortable, and the room is conveniently located to explore the city. Would stay there again!"
5844314,81266760,2016-06-22,28423940,Terri,"Our stay in a room at Piter's house was enjoyable.  We did not have a car, so the five-minute walk to the T was a bonus.  We did not see much of Piter, but the room was large and comfortable.  The bed was large and the internet and cable tv worked well.  The neighborhood seemed safe when we got back late at night.  He allowed us to leave our bags there early, and placed them in our room after it had been made ready.  Overall, a great stay."

5844314,83574134,2016-07-03,79273727,Vijay Ganapathy,"Piter had the apartment ready for us in the morning just to keep our bags and refresh before starting our long day of roaming the Boston city. Stacy helped us to our apartments. No hassle in accessing the apartment since we had a separate door on a different floor with a dedicated bathroom. The room was tidy and clean with all needed accessories including iron box, ironing pad, hangers, clean bath towels, water bottles and hand sanitizer.  The bath room was clean with paste, soap, body wash and shampoo. There is no dedicated parking but I was able to find a street parking and parked my car for couple of days without a problem. Overall I liked the stay for the price and would recommend this place."

Only issue was there was no street parking by the apt when we arrived (very crowded), so we parked around the corner and ended up getting towed (our mistake) so be careful!"

5844314,89155527,2016-07-27,74583671,Jennifer,The big bed was super comfy and the kids loved making a fort out of the sofa bed.
5844314,89227632,2016-07-27,82564097,Katie,Piter was very helpful with any questions I had.  He was even able to prepare the room for an earlier check-in.  The room was very spacious and clean.  This is a great bargain!
5844314,89898822,2016-07-30,36864912,Arang,Piter's house is bigger than I thought and It was clean and tidy. I really recommend his house.
5844314,90481192,2016-08-01,62749960,Evelyn,We didn't met Piter personally.
The room was not very big,a little too small for 5. You can find a microwave,toaster and fridge in the corridor,but there is no possibility to sit down.,,
Parking in front of the door,perfect.,,,,
Nice for one night,but not for longer. We paid 133 Euro,"which I think is too much for this room.\"",,,
5844314,92224649,2016-08-08,80775768,Mareeya,"Our experience here was in general good. The room was clean and big, with a great couch, tv, iron and all we needed for a 3 day stay. The apartment is about 20 mins from downtown by underground and there are a couple good places for breakfast around the neighborhood."
However,we missed a private bathroom. Sharing the bathroom took time in the mornings and one night we heard someone yelling and complaining about guests and having to clean the bathroom,while slamming doors.,,,
We also missed a sink out of the bathroom,forks,mugs..,,,
"We had bottled fresh water available though.\"",,,,,
5844314,92469686,2016-08-08,4079449,Ann,Room was clean. Really big room. Location was good.
5844314,93083575,2016-08-11,14378636,Steve And Melody,"We had an excellent time staying at Piter and Stacy's house.  Stacy met us at the house before check in so we could drop off our luggage and then later put it in our room.  This was a huge help to us since we did not have a car.  She gave us some tips for getting around also.  The house is conveniently located and in a safe neighborhood.  5 min walk to the train and walking distance to bars and restaurants.  The room and shared bath were also very clean(I'm picky!!)  The shower had plenty of hot water, the pressure could have been a little better, but was sufficient.  If we are ever in Boston, we would definitely stay again!"
5844314,93626117,2016-08-13,81215232,Peter,Really enjoyed our stay. Thanks for the accomodation
5844314,95093591,2016-08-18,3470332,Hielke,"The room is exactly as said. It was very clean. The toilet and bathroom (one room) is shared with others. A microwave, toaster and fridge are present in the corridor, but no further tools. There is no possibility to sit down somewhere (only on bed or sofa)."
5844314,95983635,2016-08-21,50766508,Joy,"A really home-y location, good for families and bigger groups. A bit far from everything in the city and the parking is a bit hard to find, especially later in the night, but not so bad because I still really enjoyed my stay. Overall pretty great place (:"

It is located very close to subway station as described. It is very convenient for us day-in day-out. Though no kitchen facility is available (as described), the host is kind enough to provide bottle water for us to enjoy. Thank you Piter. A very enjoyable stay."
5844314,97910738,2016-08-28,82556498,Sungchul,"My family of four stayed a night in a large room with a king bed and a sofa bed. The room was on a third floor. A room and a shared bathroom were clean but a house was old. Another family guests were quite.  There was a frig and a microwave in a shared alley. Some plastic plates and plastic utensils too. But there was no kitchen nor sink. A/C was in my room and worked well in a hot summer night. Free wifi and 40 inch cable TV. Given very expensive hotels in downtown Boston, it was a very affordable stay."
5844314,98922323,2016-09-02,84199127,Robi,"We arrived early nighttime and because we had no internet or telephone we could not contact Piter, but luckily one of the guys renovating the house was there and he was very hospitable. The neighbourhood looks unsympathetic at first (and at night) but when morning came around it wass more than pleasant. Its about 10 minutes with car from the city but its completely bearable. The beds were very comfortable, there was enough room for four people. I was lacking a small kitchen however, but we didnt seem to mind afterall. He was always quick to reply."

This address is close to the bike sharing system (Hubway),public transport,and a supermarket.,,,
"The experience of renters could be improved by a both a cleaner bathroom and kitchen.  \"",,,,,
4503393,38207110,2015-07-13,11735580,Frederick,"The place worked being that it was the cheapest airbnb in the neighborhood, but I would personally recommend spending an extra $10 to get a different place that is cleaner, has a functional wifi, has a fan/AC."
If you are on a tight budget,"this place will work just to sleep.\"",,,,
9237653,54645907,2015-11-22,47591621,Rose,"Vanessa was a great host! Her house was very clean and like new. She provided all the necessary utensils for us and was also kind enough to give us dumplings to eat when we were starved to death the first night we arrived.

She is easy to communicate with and since Vanessa lives one floor down, privacy issue was also not a problem at all. Overall a very comfortable stay :)"

She was careful to show me all of the amenities, then left me alone to settle in. This was a great stay in a quiet, peaceful home, with plenty of privacy (guest quarters upstairs, host quarters downstairs, with shared upstairs kitchen). One block from an amazing hilltop view of the city, and a short walk to Castle Island. The apartment is spotless and quite convenient. All bathroom amenities (soap, shampoo) are provided. Close to public transport, or a $5 Uber ride to downtown Boston (rush hour, rideshare). Definitely will stay here again!"

Both Jason and his roommate were very friendly and welcoming which was comforting. The apartment was slightly cluttered and the room was small, however the rooftop view and the overall space made up for this. Also they have a very cute dog."
14679817,98351227,2016-08-30,47880716,James,This flat is amazing and in a great location. Jason and his flatmate Jeff are great guys and made me feel welcome. They have a dog but don't let this out you off...I've never met a dog so placid and calm. The room is very small and is big enough for 2 people only. It's not a room you'll want to spend time in but was perfect for my needs. The rooftop area as well is incredible.
7106162,45382060,2015-09-02,37047488,Emma,"Mohsen was away for our trip but he was an excellent host, very easy to contact and answered all our questions quickly. He also set up a YouTube video making arrival very easy. The apartment was beautiful and so close to everything. The Red line was a 4 minute walk away making going into the Boston effortless. The shops and restaurants were also a short walk away. This was our first trip to Boston and using AirBnB, it was an perfect base for exploring. Thanks you :)"
7554801,64281565,2016-03-02,49550283,Laura,"Carey is a welcoming host. She offers a relaxed experience in a congenial space that is convenient to shopping, restaurants, and the MBTA (bus and train). Her home well-appointed and she is willing to accommodate guest requests. This place is a find!"
7554801,72005978,2016-04-30,48726345,Matías,"Carey es una excelente anfitriona, sentí que estaba en mi propia casa. La casa es muy linda y Carey está pendiente de cada detalle para que uno se sienta cómodo (una mañana tenía el desayuno esperándome!!!)El barrio es muy bonito y tranquilo y en bus estás a media hora próximamente del centro. Sin dudas lo recomiendo, espero poder volver algún día!!"
7554801,74280634,2016-05-14,1423181,Jenny,"My stay at Carey's place was perfect. The neighborhood and the house itself are gorgeous, very close to the T station and the bus stop. Carey was helpful from beginning to end with directions, provisions, suggestions and more. Carey and Tobias were even kind enough to share dinner with me one night, which made me truly feel at home away from home. I feel really lucky to have found this place and to have met Carey."
7554801,77962823,2016-06-04,1177057,Michelle,"Carey and her place were great.  She kindly accommodated an early arrival.   The room is spacious and private.  It's on the lower floor of the town home, so you need to be able to do stairs. The bed is comfortable and there is closet space to hang clothes. There is a desk/work area and a couple comfy lounging spaces in the room. Wifi works very well. There is access to a semi-private balcony just outside the room.  Carey shares the upstairs balcony and kitchen with her guest.  You get your own half bathroom and you share the shower with Carey, which are also on the lower floor a few steps from the bedroom.  Laundry is also available just outside of the room. The location of the town home couldn't be better.  It's close to everything in JP and just a 5-10 minute walk from the subway. Carey was great and super friendly.  I am staying with her again on my next trip to Boston.  Thanks Carey!"
7554801,80216328,2016-06-17,28044394,Javier,"The House of Carey is located in a very beautiful neighbourhood in Boston (Jamaica plain), with several bars and restaurants very close to it. Moreover, is very well connected, it only take about 30 minutes to get to the city center by metro or by bus, and bot stations are quite close to the house."
Carey is a very nice host,always willing to help,with very much information about what to do and what to visit. The room is super confortable,with a double-bed,desk,wardrobe and cabinet. There is also a very beautiful porch and backyard absolutely enjoyable in sunny days.
"I definitively would recommend this place to any single visitor or couple visiting the beautiful city of Boston. \"",,,,,
7554801,81907743,2016-06-25,1177057,Michelle,"This was my second stay with Carey! Great place, great location, great host.  See my earlier review for more info.  Will stay again next time I'm in town, if the room is available.  Thanks Carey!"

7596262,56536478,2015-12-14,300353,Marcio,"Very well located, but hard (or costly) to park. Enjoyed staying there, although the apartment we got did not have a river view."

7222349,51100114,2015-10-17,36789796,Kyeong-Hoon,"The house and the room were more than satisfying. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. It was not very close to the subway station Shawmut but it was a pleasant walk to it. Polly was so welcoming. She offers drinks other than just water. When I visit Boston again, I will certainly stay in Polly's place."
7222349,51248949,2015-10-18,39381951,Zhiyao,"it's a very nice place to stay in Boston. The room is very clean and comfortable, the host offers many food and drinks. By the way, Polly instructed me to get the house patiently after I arrived at Boston before the ordinary check in time."
7222349,51878847,2015-10-24,44870259,Severo,"Polly,"
You were incredibly accommodating and kind. The place itself was very comfortable and clean,and had plenty of space to stretch out,relax and have a glass of wine. Coffee in the morning was a great treat. Thanks Polly.,,,
"Severo\"",,,,,
7222349,51986431,2015-10-25,46500249,Ragen,"This was a good first Airbnb experience. The room was as described and there was a shared restroom for a few rooms on the floor. Snacks and drinks were available which was nice. Polly was helpful giving directions from the airport. She was able to pop over and accommodate me checking in early, which was very much appreciated. There wasn't alot to do in the immediate area, but the subway was about a 15 walk."
7222349,52946242,2015-11-02,47753078,Yihai,"房间非常不错,周边小区环境优美。Polly待人很好,楼下冰箱及厨房食物都可以自己拿来吃,也可以自做早餐。如果到波士顿游玩,住这里是不错的选择。"
7222349,53101857,2015-11-04,11430046,Bob,"Polly and her husband were awesome. The room was great, the house was quiet and it was in a quiet, nice neighborhood. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat."
7222349,54342919,2015-11-18,35906223,Barbara,"Lovely stay in a pleasant room and a quiet neighborhood made this a most enjoyable trip. My hostess was gracious and kindly kept a full supply of drinks and supplies for a continental breakfast at hand. I loved the smell of muffins baking in the morning. There was always room on the street to park (but I did tend to return with my car before 7:30 in the evening). There is a stop on the red line not too far away, which was very convenient for getting to Cambridge and downtown Boston. If you can climb stairs without any problem, I highly recommend this host.  You *must* be able to climb stairs to stay here!"
7222349,54528077,2015-11-21,47752410,Emiri,"The listing was super accurate, lots of snacks and drinks, and Polly even came to pick me up at the station after I got lost. There were also face cleansers, shampoos, etc. in the bathroom so that was extremely convenient. There was lots of privacy, and the neighborhood was safe too. Great experience, definitely recommend."
7222349,54958170,2015-11-25,11430046,Bob,Love this place. Great vibe.
7222349,55584266,2015-12-02,44376171,Stefan,"I stayed at the place for 3 nights and everything was exactly as described. When you book your stay here, you will get a really nice welcome and Polly really excels in making you feel welcome. Although I arrived late, everything was arranged perfectly. What is more, you will find a fridge full of beverages for your free usage. Add this to a nice breakfast that is freshly prepared every morning and a bathroom which is well stocked with everything necessary and you can't ask for a better Airbnb experience in my view. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there and would definitely recommend the place!"
7222349,63140370,2016-02-20,58380756,Baohong,"Polly is a very nice host. The place is clean and quite as described. She is nice and let me checked in early since I arrived earlier than my checkin time. The place is less than 2 miles away from Neponset trail, which is a plus for me to do morning run. It is a nice place so I am extending my stay right after."
7222349,63595967,2016-02-24,58380756,Baohong,Very nice experience staying at Polly's house. She is very nice. I continuously booked 3 times for my trip. Highly recommend for everyone.
7222349,70129540,2016-04-16,56828283,Heather,"I cannot say enough about my stay here. The Richters are perfect hosts! They were so welcoming, Minter even had coffee made for us so all we had to do was turn it on in the morning. The kitchen was stocked with breakfast fixings, including eggs, bacon, yogurt, and granola, and there were drinks and snacks as well. Even, much to my delight, chocolate!"
The room was lovely with plenty of storage and the bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was spacious,bright and pretty and stocked just as well as the kitchen. There was a hairdryer,linens and all the toiletries you can imagine. If you forgot something,they had it.,,
The Richters thought of everything.,,,,,
The house itself is delightful with all the charm that comes with an old well-loved home. I would stay here again in a flash,and hope to do just that next year.,,,,
"This was my first Airbnb experience and if they're all this wonderful I'll never stay in another hotel. \"",,,,,
7222349,71353635,2016-04-24,49758349,Tiffany,Nice and clean! Quiet and safe neighborhood. Minter was so thoughtful. Me and my boyfriend enjoyed our stay there.
7222349,74775094,2016-05-16,31168428,Crystal,"Polly was absolutely amazing. She was quick to respond with any questions we may of had. She was able to direct us toward great restaurants! House expectations were superb along with the wonderful blueberry muffins she made, for breakfast, before we were on our way! Super host is an understatement! Thanks Polly!"
7222349,76807748,2016-05-29,22765921,Heath,"A nice room with a friendly host and good transit access. Polly was very helpful with our late night arrival (near midnight) and gave good directions. The room was nicely done, and coffee (and often muffins!) were in the kitchen each day."
I was somewhat worried about the location,but both the Shawmut and Ashmont stations of the Red Line were really quite close--pro tip--if you're going to Ashmont station,"take St Mark's to Dorchester Ave and then go left--it will be mostly flat and avoid the hill that Adams to Ashmont has.\"",,,
7222349,84163122,2016-07-05,45330166,Glenn,I use AirBNB all of the time and this is always may favorite of them all. Polly is the most accommodating host and makes one feel at home in her house. The home is an 18 century mansion with tons of history. The furniture is very comfortable and the 6ft bathtub is super comfortable after a day of seeing the sights of Boston. There is a T station about a 5 minute walk away that will take you anywhere in the city. I highly recommend.
7222349,90753440,2016-08-02,73275098,Kat,Polly was an awesome host! From start to finish our trip was perfect. From the freshly made muffins and coffee in a morning to the beautiful room and porch and excellent location. Both my twin sister and I couldn't fault it! I highly recommend anyone to stay with Polly. It was our first ever Air BnB experience and it was one to remember. Thank you Polly!
7222349,93531583,2016-08-13,42941838,Lindsey,"We had a very comfortable stay here and it was a neat opportunity to be in such an old, historic feeling home! Very creaky floors to boot. Our room and the shared bathroom were spacious and clean. We loved sitting on the big front porch, both in the morning and late at night. If you like Vietnamese food, this is the neighborhood for you! I really appreciated the breakfast snacks that were available in the kitchen, it made us feel at home and our mornings a lot simpler to have that taken care of. Best granola I've ever eaten! Also, Polly was sweet enough to provide us with a bottle of champagne in our room!"
7222349,97899955,2016-08-28,12170855,Yunju,Everything is perfect! I strongly recommend this place!!
13062783,81068876,2016-06-20,22366970,Joshua,"The bed was the best part of my stay by far--huge, I think King-sized, and one of those compression mattresses. I slept so well. Unfortunately the rest of the space wasn't so great. It was more like crashing with friends (for free) in their spare room  than staying at an Airbnb. The room was weirdly decorated and there was a huge TV but I couldn't figure out how to watch anything on it. The bathroom wasn't foul, but needed a clean (stubble in the sink both days I was there). Michael was very available and responded to messages, and for that reason and for the amazing bed and the privacy of the room I give a three-star review, otherwise it's more of a 2, relative to other places I've stayed. Finally, I'll confirm that the room is close to a T stop, 5-10 minutes. It's also close to good restaurants, bars and a pharmacy."
13062783,91377107,2016-08-05,73333007,Shannon,Michael was very accommodating and easy to communicate with. His apartment is in a very convenient location on the green line. Very enjoyable experience.
13062783,92299212,2016-08-08,27957091,Justin,"Michael's place was perfect for crashing in Boston. Whilst I never met Michael himself, he was amazing at responding quickly to any enquiries and provided excellent recommendations for places to eat. The room was very handy for Green Line T (Brigham Circle stop was like a 4min walk) and a great base to explore beautiful Boston. Like the other reviewer said, it's not a glamourous or glitzy place but the bed was very comfy and all I needed was a reasonably priced place to crash during my 3 nights in Boston and this met that criteria perfectly."
13062783,98728297,2016-09-01,31264160,Marina,"Michael was extremely nice! From picking me up at the airport to being easy to contact at all times, he was overall a great host! He really helped make my move to Boston go smoothly!"
13586491,84087662,2016-07-05,80555010,Tara,Everything was as advertised. Brent was very helpful and was able to sort us out with a room. (after we tried to book one of his other properties) Location was brilliant and place was really modern and clean. We had no problems at all and would stay again.
13586491,93122269,2016-08-11,612416,Sally,Brent was very easy to communicate with and accommodated my special request because I was in quite a bind. I am grateful for that.

The Place is very kids friendly,there is a great kitchen and 2 bathrooms which make it a great Place to see with friends as well,even though there is 1 bed room. We slept in the kids room On area bed,and slept very well!,,

It was the perfect place for us to relax and it was an amazing neighborhood.  We love Italian food so to stay in the North End couldn't have been better.  Leslie had some great restaurant recommendations as well.  Thank you, Leslie, for sharing your apartment with us"

The appartment is children friendly, which we greatly appreciated since we travalled with our 3 children (6 month, 4 and 6 years old). We recommend this appartment if you are having a few days in Boston."
6197950,39946848,2015-07-27,23202678,Joshua,Leslie was extremely helpful with everything.  The apartment is perfectly located in the north end near everything you could need and very clean.  I will be staying here again in the future.

Leslie's house is lovely and she was immediately responsive when we had a question.  The location can't be beat as it's central to so many great sights and restaurants within walking distance.
6197950,51319686,2015-10-19,44378595,Tim,"House was great and Loved the Neighborhood.  Unfortunately, we were in Boston for just a couple days.  Very close to everything for anyone wanting to go to Boston and visit.  No need for a car.  We did use Uber, for first time, to get from the house to the airport.  Only cost $14 and arrived very quickly."

The building is outstanding, the 24hr concierge were really helpful and polite. The apatment was great in all aspects. The Gym was great. Location could  not be better."
The only thing  was T Mobile had no reception inside the building,"so I could not use  my mobile phone while i was inside the apartment\"",,,,

13393418,89011335,2016-07-26,24895350,Mary,"Our stay at Baljinder and Sarah's apartment was great. The apartment is bare but very clean. They kindly provided shampoo, conditioner, soap, toothpaste, and floss. They also provided fresh towels for us everyday! Although we were unfamiliar with this neighborhood, we felt very safe, and getting to Boston was very easy and quick -- ~8 minute walk to the Blue line train station, and then ~10 min train ride into downtown Boston. Similarly, it was about a 10 min Uber ride into the city."
The only downside of our stay was that the AC was not working,and this past weekend was very hot. Other than that,we had a very enjoyable stay here. We never met Baljinder or Sarah but they texted to ask if we needed anything,"and we felt very taken care of.

We were given fresh towels everyday, more than we could use. The apartment also had a Keurig, k-cups, and tea in the kitchen area. Uber to the North End was about $12. Overall an awesome experience!"

13393418,93846403,2016-08-14,38127916,Dayea,"This was an experience I couldn't wait to write a review about. Baljinder and Sandra's place was my fourth Airbnb experience, and it has simply been the best one so far. My parents and I stayed here only for one night, but we were treated like family friends."
Our flight from Buffalo to Boston on the check-in day got cancelled so we had to find another flight with a different airline at a later time. When we notified Baljinder and Snadra about the later check in time,they kindly offered to give us a ride from the airport to their house!! Not only that,they also offered to give my parents a ride the next day early morning at 3:50am. Giving rides are not part of their responsibility as a host,but they chose to do it because they know how exhausting and frustrating change in travel plans can be and because they believe in quality customer care. Their kind act allowed my parents to leave the country with a very good impression of the city.,,
As for the apartment itself,the place is accurately described (even better than the photos). It's really 5 minutes drive from the Logan airport,every basic necessities were provided,and I could smell the fresh laundry detergent on the pillow cases. The sheets and blankets were also very clean and fresh to the skin. They also have Keurig,paper towel,necessary kitchen supplies etc. The living room has a well functioning AC
"I would not hesitate to recommend this place to everyone who visits Boston. Both hosts and the apartment can't get any better than this. Thank you Baljinder and Sandra for a memorable stay at your place! I really hope more people would work with you in the future. \"",,,,,
13393418,93990295,2016-08-14,68554312,Chelsea,Staying here was such an easy experience. Baljinder was super helpful and very quick to communicate. Would definitely recommend.
13393418,94705905,2016-08-16,61844969,Eid,Super friendly and accommodating. Made sure we had everything we needed. Will definitely stay here again when we come back to Boston!
13393418,94911500,2016-08-17,70221428,Mehdi,"Everything as expected, nice clean and spacious space. Baljinder and Sandra were very reactive, even if we didn't meet but they responded very quickly to my mails providing information asked. They even arranged for an early check-in. This place is perfect if you're flying early as it is located very close to the airport..."
13393418,95139539,2016-08-18,18194995,Petr,"Nice apartment close to Logan Airport. We parked our car at Logan Economy Parking ($23/day) and walked from there (~15 mins). Sandra and Baljinder were really nice and responsive (e.g. offering to keep our luggage for the following day). We appreciated a big fridge and complimentary coffee. Somebody could mind missing AC in the kitchen (we did not). If you are looking for a short stay before you flight from Logan, this is a perfect match."
13393418,95491912,2016-08-20,65600440,Lorelei,"Honestly... I really wanted to like this place. However, it really wasn't my cup of tea. Upon arrival, the light that was in the corridor leading up to the apartment was not working, and it also smelled odd. The top light in the front bedroom also did not work, and so even though there was a side lamp in the room, it didn't help that much. I was not told where to find the wifi password or what it was until I asked, and the air conditioning in the room was so loud that it was impossible to sleep with it on. I understand that the owner most likely did all they could to make this a great place to stay, but personally I did not feel safe in the area or apartment, and wouldn't stay here again."
13393418,95652991,2016-08-20,60163191,Tyler,Worked out just fine
13393418,96187719,2016-08-22,28091904,Matt,"Nothing but good things to say about our stay. The unit was incredibly clean, and contained every amenity one could hope for. The newly-installed a/c worked wonderfully! We'll be back."
13393418,96371584,2016-08-22,90105635,John,Baljinder was extremely responsive in our communication. Room was more or less as described. Thanks for a great first airbnb experience!
13393418,97023444,2016-08-25,22399083,Christopher,"The apartment was just as described - it was clean, spacious enough for three people and there was a kitchen so we were able to cook. The apartment was quiet and the neighborhood okay; it was also not very far from downtown Boston."
13393418,97459953,2016-08-27,13187055,Jason,The place was exactly what we needed it to be. Affordable spot close to the airport and an easy Uber ride downtown. Would definitely recommend this to anyone spending a weekend in Boston.
13393418,97760203,2016-08-28,84366853,Emma,"Our stay was great! Baljinder actually met us outside the apartment- which wasn't supposed to happen but was super nice! He walked my husband and I inside and explained where everything was, where to leave the keys the next day, etc. and told us to be sure to contact him if we needed anything... Then gave us directions to where we wanted to go! He was super accommodating as well- I was in contact with him about two weeks before the trip letting him know about potential travel plans, as we fly stand-by and things aren't always set in stone; he made sure that we were taken care of! The apartment itself was clean and decorated nicely. There were several different amenities provided: coffee, tea, shampoo, conditioner, body wash; we didn't lack for anything. I wish we could've stayed longer! I highly recommend it!"
13393418,98358636,2016-08-30,13027284,Laura,"Very convenient, well equipped apartment.  Host was easy to work with and helpful."
13393418,98629153,2016-09-01,34233416,Nigel,Baljinder and his wife Sandra were extremely welcoming and accommodating. The place was very clean and ready when I arrived. They even went so far as to let me store my bags there the day that I checked out because I didn't have to fly out for 6 hours and wanted to go downtown. I would recommend this place and them to anyone!
13393418,98873309,2016-09-02,69718645,Xiayu,"I had a very nice stay at t this apartment. The host was extremely welcoming and accommodating, but also gave me all the privacy I needed."
13393418,98911328,2016-09-02,962709,John,Great location. Quite neighborhood. Place was nice and clean. Baljinder meet with me told me of some great places to eat
13393418,99180003,2016-09-03,60089051,Alyssa,"The host was very responsive, the place was clean, and easy to access. Had a great stay!"
13393418,99809079,2016-09-06,27846465,Rebecca,"Baljinder was a wonderful host. He was communicative, flexible, and easy to work with. The space was clean and comfortable. Great mattress!"
13393418,99958805,2016-09-06,38540913,Yixiang,Spacious indeed. A great place to stay and have a nice night before early flight to other place!
12874603,77844405,2016-06-04,47075148,Becky,One minute away from Jackson square t station. Room huge and comfortable although the bed on wheels was funny at times when trying to have a morning coffee in bed! Free on street parking. No noise. Thanks for the stay :-)
12874603,78251009,2016-06-06,7476780,Pierre,"The apartment is really close to the Jackson Square station and neighborhood is ok. The room was really big, clean and quiet (it looks exactly as the pictures), the bathroom was clean too. We have not seen Diego but his roomates and they were really friendly. Thank you for the stay !"
12874603,78498134,2016-06-07,55204753,Yi-Ting,"The room is really big and clean. The public space is clean as well. There is a subway station near the house, so it is really convenient for the tourist."
12874603,78952648,2016-06-10,76011928,Jessica,We had a wonderful stay at Diego's. The room was very spacious and clean as was the bathroom. Didn't get a chance to meet Diego but he responded to his messages in a timely manner. The only negative was that the bedroom door didn't have a lock and key.
12874603,79806529,2016-06-14,71050751,Arata,"This room is pretty clean and comfy. Although I didn't get to see Diego, the other housemates are nice and chill. The place is a bit far from the downtown Boston, but the train station is super close so it doesn't really matter. But the wifi is pretty weak and slow so it's kinda frustrating. Except for this, Diego's room is great:)"
12874603,80253377,2016-06-17,70592629,Steven,The room was great and the instructions were very clear. He has roommates and they were very respectful and understanding.
12874603,80769372,2016-06-19,28909470,Jérome,L'appartement est situé à deux pas du métro et lit confortable.
"Nous n'avons pas rencontré Diego lors de notre séjour à Boston.\"",,,,,
12874603,81201588,2016-06-21,76055180,Jonathan,"The place is alright. What I loved the most about the place was that it was close to the train. It was convenient. Also, I was disappointed how the room wasn't ready when got there. And the bed squeeked every time i moved, it also had wheels so it wouldnt stay in place. However, the overall I would give 4/5"
12874603,81626913,2016-06-24,48867569,Munroe,"Diego didn't respond to my initial request within the first 24 hours of the booking and only contacted me after that to tell me the place was still available. Given that I was arriving the following day at that point, I wasn't thrilled about the late response, but I resent the request and booked with him. I didn't meet Diego and only met one roommate briefly, but the listing is exactly as described and the instructions Diego provided were helpful. The location is very close to the Jackson Square T stop, and convenient to local shops and the grocery store. Street parking was easy and Diego even provided towels, which was great. The door to the bedroom can be locked from the inside, although it doesn't stay very well."
12874603,82281055,2016-06-27,62014657,Eleonora,"Staying at Diego's wasn't the best Airbnb experience I had: although the room was quite clean and just as it looks in the listing, the shared bathroom was extremely dirty, the water in the shower wasn't flowing down well and you were left in a pond of dirty and hair: nasty! another unhappy surprise was the rat that would cross your way in the backyard before getting to the entry door. As for this last detail which is probably something quite common in big cities , the condition of the bathroom is quite unacceptable...he wasn't there so I don't know if the other roommates had any responsibilities for leaving such a mess  but if you are hosting someone you need to make sure the place is in a decent condition plus all the hair around can't be left in a day only, meaning that the place hadn't been cleaned in a while. Besides this, which can be fixed by paying a little more attention I think the place has the potentials to be a nice Airbnb experience."
10295349,60797893,2016-01-27,38208223,Andi,"Place is in a prime location! 1 min to the mtba makes it easy to get in and out of downtown or the airport easy peasy. Rooms are basic as they come, but makes up in convenience. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a roof. Cheers!!"
10295349,69300609,2016-04-10,64143165,Eduard,Just fine. Useful as last choice.
"Can realy be improved.\"",,,,,
10295349,74355599,2016-05-15,5744982,Jie,"I didn't meet Rex in person but he was very understanding and helpful. The location is great. Super close to the train station and the revere beach.  The room is small and basic but clean and quiet. Overall, I had a very nice stay."
10295349,75532822,2016-05-22,71707412,Zhe,please fix the door
10295349,87048499,2016-07-18,56348095,Jared,Rex's place was a comfortable stay and the price was ideal. Although the location changed we made the best of it and being that it was located near public transportation getting around was not difficult not to mention the beach was literally a 5min walk!
3539510,21436126,2014-10-17,21938659,Gabriel,"Logement très bien organisé, agréable et dans un quartier joli. 15 minutes du métro à pied. Places de parking très facile à trouver."
3539510,34150386,2015-06-05,4586728,Hilary,"The Roseclair was a good fit for our needs - we were coworkers traveling for work, needing a place we could make some simple breakfasts (Stop & Shop is really closeby), and that would be a reasonable commute to our office and to the airport. Two bedrooms were big, with enough room to do some morning stretches, and one was smaller. The common room was a nice spot for post-work relaxing.  We all thought it would be a good place for future trips like this.  I'm a light sleeper, so I was bothered a couple nights by airplane and traffic noise, but Boston tends to be loud - that's just how it is.  The shower was great!"
3539510,35494574,2015-06-19,9258562,Rich,"Our Sales team had a really nice stay, the bedrooms were beautiful, and the apartment is very nice. Our hosts were friendly and able to assist with any questions/concerns they had."
3539510,38403556,2015-07-15,23943939,Melissa,"We had a lovely stay at the Roseclair. The space was great for our family of 6, and the place was beautiful. Definitely recommend."

3539510,43689933,2015-08-21,8445025,Mohammed,Thank you for an excellent option within Boston area at affordable price. The place is well maintained with easy access into and out of the city
3539510,44781842,2015-08-29,37622361,Francis,Apartment was clean and well equipped. Beds were comfortable and kitchen had all the basic necessities. The main problem was  traffic noise which was considerable from about 6 AM till midnight.   Also it would be convenient if host provided a resident parking pass to allow for side street parking.
3539510,46750935,2015-09-13,25326952,Ryan,"Beautiful and charming multi-unit home, perfectly maintained and 10-15min from everything I needed (conference center, Seaport, North End and Financial District). This a slick operation. Do not hesitate to work with these guys! I saved thousands vs. using a hotel this week. Thank you Mr. Swank and to everyone on the Swank team!"
3539510,52056339,2015-10-26,14433022,Veronique,Notre arrivée s'est passée avec beaucoup de facilités .
Après ces heures de voyage nous nous sommes sentis secure et confortables.,,,,,
Tout était prêt,l'appartement était parfait et chauffé. Tout à fait adapté à nos besoins.,,,,
Juste un peu trop bruyant pour nous.,,,,,
Nous avons apprécié le service de Lance. Il a été à notre écoute.,,,,,

3539510,71279582,2016-04-24,53619869,Khanh,"The unit was great, Very clean. Had just about everything i needed for my 3 night stay. Roomed my party of 5 perfectly. Very charming space and convenient location with a restaurant/bar right next door.  Everything within walking distance. Would recommend coming back."
3539510,76846364,2016-05-29,9486903,Korine,"This place was so great!! It was clean, easy to access from the highway, and close to everything you could want or need! I loved that it felt like a hotel and I felt safe arriving late at night. The street got a bit busy during the day, but the traffic moved along well and it never took long to access the highway during busy times. Parking close was never an issue and it was just an overall comfortable place to stay! We'll definitely be back when we visit again!"
3539510,77929186,2016-06-04,58958874,Wendy,"Lance and Swank were on top of everything. We arrived very late but had no problems getting in and getting settled. In the morning we explored the neighborhood and found it great. The information provided about the unit and Boston were all very helpful. We used the Uber link and discount so thanks for that! We had a problem resetting the temperature control when we got home late one evening, emailed Swank and within about 10 minutes it was fixed...they really are available 24/7 as advertised."
10611728,60983599,2016-01-30,21609921,Khe Ing,"Kara was professional and fast to response. We liked the place. It was as described and exactly like the pictures shown on the site. It was clean, tidy and nice. The neighborhood was also great, walking distance to the chinatown and downtown. Would come back again and contact Kara for our future long stay in Boston."
10611728,63727791,2016-02-26,21609921,Khe Ing,It was a pleasant stay. Customer service is available & requests are mostly completed in the next day.
14217967,91716844,2016-08-06,12833629,Amanda,"Danielle was an amazing hostess!!! She was very accommodating despite last minute arrangement and an extremely late arrival time. Her apartment is beyond stunning and belongs on a magazine cover and the area is great. Highly, highly recommend staying here!!!"
14217967,93681009,2016-08-13,34425607,Marion,Super nice and felt very comfortable.
14217967,96002875,2016-08-21,90517067,Lisa,It was such a cute place! Perfect for me and my fiancé and a long weekend getaway. We felt like we were right in the middle of everything! Couldn't get much better than that. The only thing that we wished we had known was that there wasn't air conditioning. It was tolerable with the fan she provided but still a little hot--it was cooler outside.
Other than that,the building is beautiful,the room cozy,"& clean! Overall great spot! Danielle was great!\"",,
14217967,97783957,2016-08-28,878399,David,"First, the location is ideal.  From it, we walked everywhere, and were able to run along the Charles just a  block away.  The neighborhood is charming.  But the best is the space. It is very cleverly organized and we enjoyed being there very much.  We wanted for nothing.  Danielle was also extremely accommodating when traffic did not cooperate with our planned arrival time.  We will recommend this flat to others."
13156872,78548065,2016-06-07,24983817,Justin,"Apartment is very clean, spacious, and in a prime location steps away from the B, C, and D T lines. Host is very nice and friendly."
13156872,79851563,2016-06-14,47673775,Prasad,"Everything about this listing is good: Location (Well connected with the local transport), Cleanliness, Spacious and a great host (Would respond to queries immediately). I just stayed here for a night but wouldn't have minded to stay here longer. Would definitely recommend anyone to stay here."
13156872,80583890,2016-06-19,76238927,Julia,"Comfortable 1-bedroom apartment was just what we were looking for! I was in town for one night with a friend, and we were mainly just looking for a place to crash after a concert. When I arrived, the host gave me the information we'd need while we were there: WiFi password, how to use the oven, etc. (even though we ended up not needing most of this). Overall a comfortable place to stay!"
13156872,80986097,2016-06-20,73245587,John,"Great apartment, clean,  convenient and spacious. Easy link up and friendly host.  We'll come back there for sure"

Communication was quick and clear. Apartment left clean for us and was a great, affordable option for my wife and I to see the expensive city of Boston. Felt safe the whole time...even when a police officer was in the hall to investigate a domestic disturbance next door...never once had a concern for safety. Honestly, I wont look to a hotel again for extended stays."

11740527,77804508,2016-06-03,2845391,Chris & Blake,Really great value and Jonathan was a great host! I didn't realize there was another room rented out via Airbnb in the unit too  (Jonathan and his family live in a separate unit downstairs) but the en suite bathroom and all the space offer plenty of privacy. Jonathan really thought of everything and the place is packed with all the amenities one could need. All around great place and great host!

The bed was comfortable, the kitchen had great appliances, bathrooms were clean and private. Instructions were clear. We would not hesitate to stay there again."
11740527,82572167,2016-06-28,6782029,Louis,Great clean home . I was pleasantly surprised to find such a nice place near the airport. Jonathan is a great host! Would definitely come back again!

11740527,86434764,2016-07-16,54601647,Airy,"It's my first time travel with Airbnb. I definitely will recommend Jonathan's place to any traveller who want to enjoy the city like home. The location is very good. Only 5 mins walk away from Andrew Station and we can easily take subway to Harvard University, South Station via Andrew Station. On our first day from NYC to Boston, Jonathan gave me very good advice on transportation and made every thing easy. We live on the 3rd floor and have a private bathroom in my bedroom. The room is lovely with mint-color wall. The host is considerate and get everything prepared including bathroom stuff. We didn't see Jonathan and his family through out the 4 nights. So the privacy is PERFECT!  However, I can feel Jonathan around as he always respond quickly whenever I drew up a question message through Airbnb. >< I use the kitchen to cook instant noodles and LOBSTER what we found in Star Market. Star market is 5mins driving away and you can find very good and cheap food there, like my favourite Cherry which is much cheaper than NYC!! All in a word, I would like to go back on my next trip to Boston! Thank you Jonathan!!"
11740527,87693558,2016-07-21,77824004,Cris,Jonathan's place is a great value for the location only two stops away from South Station! The room was clean and check-in was seamless. Jonathan was responsive to my questions and my stay was private and quiet. Great access to the T so everything is walk-able. Would recommend staying here especially if you want to be close to Downtown at a reasonable price!
11410652,70650326,2016-04-19,6985501,Michelle,Travis and his wife's triplex was absolutely perfect for our trip to Boston for the Boston Marathon. The location is close to cute cafes to eat brunch and close to the train/subway station (literally a 5 min walk!) it was also a quiet neighborhood for this runner to sleep good! He left very detailed instructions and they were very nice when we did the key exchange with the cutest puppy! They were also flexible with the key drop off since we had an early flight back home. I would definitely recommend this place to other Air BnB fans!
8014683,51493201,2015-10-20,4426066,Karla,"Communicating with Abhishek was very easy, he responded quickly and the condo was exactly as described.  He even left some sweets for us to enjoy when we arrived.  I stayed here with my husband and 2 year old daughter and had more than enough space.  The location was an easy walk to many of the the places we wanted to go; Faneuil Hall, the Children's Museum, Aquarium, etc.  It was wonderful having a comfortable and convenient home base for our weekend in Boston."
8014683,54905943,2015-11-25,48021418,Lisa,The host left us a really nice note and a bar of chocolate to welcome us into their home. It was so nice (and delicious). The neighborhood is great. Right by South Station which makes it easy to get to and from the airport and we felt safe the entire time.
2658094,14158286,2014-06-13,15469981,Elin,"Great (and pretty spacious) apartment in a lovely part of Boston - with fantastic restaurants nearby. Getting the keys was easy, and the building was easy to find. Would definitely stay here again!"
2658094,17138354,2014-08-07,7157116,Alyssa,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about this space and this company. I needed a place to stay at the very last minute, and Cara was extremely accommodating and friendly. She set everything up for me and got back to me within minutes of every message I sent."
The apartment itself is incredible! It has very high ceilings,so it feels much larger than it is. It has two cozy and comfy bedrooms,a spacious loving room with extremely comfy couches,and a surprisingly large kitchen. It's also in a wonderful and very safe neighborhood.,,

Keys were easy to get.  It was 95 degrees outside but they had 2 air conditioners running and it was nice and cold inside!  Everything was right there, you can walk to everything.  I can't wait to stay here again!"
2658094,19400445,2014-09-11,21135711,Alex,"Dror called very quickly and gave me friendly, thorough information.   The apartment needs some love.   The sofas appeared heavily used and discolored and I was not comfortable enough to sit on them, and the dinning table chairs were stiff and mismatched.   There was no place I was comfortable.  There was no interior lock on the front door and, being a woman staying alone, whenever people walked by in the hall I was a bit uncomfortable.  The bathroom was small but adequate and clean - there were no hand towels.  The kitchen was clean and much nicer than in the photo.  The location is great and this would be a nice place to stay if someone would make a trip to Ikea and spent $3-4k on new some furniture.     With additional fees I ended up spending $374 for one night."

2658094,23697650,2014-12-08,250072,Cassie,"\"By far the best thing about this apartment is the location. It really couldn't be better -- right in the middle of all the wonderful Italian restaurants and shops in the heart of the North End. It is also very spacious for the price -- two bedrooms and a large living room and kitchen/dining area. The beds were comfortable and there were sufficient essentials (kitchenware, towels, etc) for our stay. Overall, it was worth the price and I would stay here again. That said, there were some negatives. The heat was an issue. Apparently, the thermostat to this apartment (which we never actually found) controls the whole floor of the building and can't be adjusted. It was uncomfortably hot in the bedrooms at night. Luckily, we found a fan in one of the closets, but only one. The other problem was that my traveling companion is very allergic to cats. Although the apartment is listed \"\"no pets"

2658094,26617456,2015-02-16,7666916,Jack,"The apartment was very nice and comfortable. We stayed there during the crazy Boston blizzard so it was good to have somewhere warm to bunker down. It's located in a good spot to go to the shops for groceries and alcohol, and close to the harbour which no doubt would be very enjoyable during less of a cold snap. Fantastic location, the North End of Boston is excellent for Italian food and culture. High ceilings and nice furniture make the place feel very homely. Had good sleeps with very comfortable bedding. Free internet was a bonus. Also the real estate agent is right next door which is helpful if there are any major problems (which we thankfully did not have). The television wouldn't work for us though we played around with it a lot and followed the written instructions, and the couches were a bit dirty. Minor gripes though, for the most part we had a great time and would stay again."

Only complaint was that it was SO hot inside and there are no heat controls in the unit. We had the windows open the whole 4/5 days.  Had pots, pans, playes, cutlery, etc. which was great. Location was perfect for us! Lots of restaurants, close to quincey market, the T, could walk to TD gardens and along the trail to Boston commons park.

Very nice kitchen and bathroom. Furniture is definitely worn, but sufficient. The main issue was that the heat is controlled for the whole floor, so you can't adjust it.

Pros: This is a big bright apartment on a great street in a lively historic part of Boston.  The beds are comfortable and the apartment is clean.  The neighbourhood is friendly,feels safe and is in easy reach of all Boston's highlights.  If that's what you are looking for that's great.,,,,
Cons:  As a seasoned user of Airbnb,I found that this owner does not offer service of a standard I'm used to. This is a letting agency which means that all the personal touches and keen to please hospitality is not offered.,,,,
3 glasses,1 plastic for 4 guests.  No wine glasses,mismatched mugs and tired furniture more suited to student accommodation.  No coffee or welcoming supplies for your first morning.  No little bits and pieces - so if you do want to cook in the really good kitchen you have to buy everything.,,,
No local dining recommendations. In an area with over 100 restaurants some personal favourites of the owner would be appreciated.,,,,,
Lots of phone numbers to call if you need somebody,although the ones in the welcome pack did not match the updated ones in the broken stand on the coffee table.,,,,
"As a European traveller I had to use my cell phone to call the phone number to collect the code for the door and to call \"\"hot line\"\" at the cost of an International call.",,,,,

2658094,36512357,2015-06-29,21564136,Claire,Dror's apartment is lovely and the location is convenient. The room with the bunkbed is very small and there is quite a bit of street noise given the apartment's central location. The apartment provided everything we needed for a weekend stay. We had a great experience.
2658094,37280120,2015-07-06,13023192,Jon,We enjoyed our stay at Dror's immensely. It is perfectly situated in Little Italy which is wonderfully central to the tourist parts of Boston. The  apartment was well equipped and clean and highly recommended.
2658094,37658968,2015-07-09,33396666,Jim,Apt. Located just steps away from The Freedom Trail in the North End. Great Location - Tons of Italian Restaurants near by.  Boston is a very walkable city - Host was nice - communication prior to arrival great - Keys left for us in Lock box.  Apartment is spacious and clean.  New Kitchen.  Couple of minor things: the furniture is showing a bit of wear and they could use a few more fans.  The Window  AC units are great for the Living/Dining area but the cool air doesn't reach the bedrooms so much.
2658094,37943650,2015-07-12,26323390,Gary,"This apartment is in an amazing location. You are just steps away from the Freedom Trail as it passes through Paul Revere Mall to the Old North Church. Plus, there are dozens of Italian restaurants and cafes on Hanover Street."

2658094,38978434,2015-07-20,17875622,Brian,The check in process was seamless - Dror gave detailed instruction and they were easy to follow. The apartment was as advertised - no problems at all and the location was fabulous - I would recommend.

2658094,43223439,2015-08-18,10916437,Sarah,Great lcation! We had to relocate across the hall during our stay and unfortunately the second apartment was not as clean as the first. Dror sent someone over to take care of that though.
2658094,44550983,2015-08-27,27467846,Curt,"This place is good and bad. It's the first time I've ever had anything but the most positive things to say and, before this I've only left 5 stars in every category."
The good: It's pretty clean and the location is awesome.,,,,,
The bad: this place lacks that air bnb home feel. It's very expensive and Is Run by an agency so I don't feel at all like Dror was ever in there. The Parking is super expensive.,,,,,
First,you get emails saying you have to print this thing and bring it with you. There are a lot of rules about checking in. I was on a long trip with over 5 air bnbs and none I worried about checking into like this one. When I called to verify my check in,it was an agency and after a long hold the girl asked me what time I would be there. I said,"\"\"how about around 12:00?\"\" She said check in is at 2:00 I said so","\"\"I'll come at 2:00?\"\" She said that was when check in was. Ok",not bad just not normal air bnb coolness.
There is no food in there. I'm writing this review on the same trip from another air bnb. The fridge has some food in it and there are some essentials here like oil and salt. When I leave I'll leave (real:) maple syrup I bought and some other things I bought. That's normal air bnb goodness. Not at drors place it's just kind of cold. Every cupboard is bare. There is only ice.,,,,,
"They recommend the warf parking for \"\"$9-$12) a day. I pulled in at 3:30pm and out at 10:00am the next morning. That cost me $43.00. A day starts at 6pm and ends at 12:00 wow. It was a scam.",,,,,
Again,it's no a terrible place,just kind of a hassle to get into and you might be better just staying at a hotel.,,,
The pictures are taken very well and make the place look better than it is,it's not bad,just not as nice as those pictures.,,,

The location was great for our needs. Easy walk to Boston Commons. In hind sight using Uber would have cost far less than me renting a car and paying for parking. The mattress on the top bunk is too short for the average adult but could easily handle two small children.

We enjoyed staying there although there are a few points to bear in mind.,,,,,
What we were not aware of was just how expensive the parking would be. The other thing to bear in mind is that there is quite a lot to arrange around keys pick up and you are obliged to ring the office the day before arrival to get a code for the key pick up box.,,,,,
Also note that the bunk bed in the second bedroom is very short so is probably more suitable for kids than adults.,,,,,
Overall,whilst this apartment is a bit pricey and possibly not as straight-forward in terms of checkin,"it is worth it for the location.\"",,,

Access to all parts of Boston were available. Follow Dror's advice on where to park if you have a car. Be prepared for a fairly big parking fee...but cheaper then the tows, boots and tickets we witnessed in the residence parking areas. BTW...we are big firemen fans. Feel free to support the BFD and buy a great looking t-shirt at the station across the street. If you enjoy dealing with professionalism you will enjoy working with Dror and his team. All you need to do for a good stay is follow his instructions in his initial e-mail. When we come back to Boston we will look forward to trying out another, new Dror offering."

Parking is a little tough though I found a parking garage a few blocks away. The space is exactly as pictured, perfect for a couple or even with extra traveler if they are ok with a cozy couch. Super comfy bed and extremely hot water. Rob was flexible enough to allow us some extra time to check out in the morning which was such a great help!  We had more time to check out the neighborhood, so many great restaurants, shops, bars and music venues right at your fingertips. . You got to check out the best ice cream shop in Boston which is at your front doorstep.  I'll definitely be back again!"
12154934,70283352,2016-04-17,43540433,Jack,"First thing, the location is FANTASTIC. I don't think you can find another place at the same location for a price like this. It's basically the center of Boston. There are restaurants all around and it's 5 minutes from Apple Store, Trader Joe's, the Prudential Center(a huge mall) and close to colleges like Berklee School of Music, Boston University and Northeastern University. I came to Boston for college visits, so it was super convenient for me."
Also,Rob is THE best host I've ever met. He came to give me the key personally when I arrived. I lost the key during a tour and he was able to make a new key in a few hours and gave it to me. I also happened to have a friend who wanted to stay over that I didn't mention before the trip,and Rob was okay with it. When I left,Rob gave me a ride to the train station and asked my opinions about the apartment.,,
There can be more blankets and the apartment can use a new shower head,but those are the minor things that can be easily fixed in a short amount of time.,,,,
Overall,"it's definitely worth the price!\"",,,,
12154934,70509808,2016-04-18,11404669,Keila,Had a good stay at Rob's place. He was super flexible in meeting time to get keys. I stayed for the Boston Marathon weekend which is super hectic and he was super great in not making it more complicated. Super convenient location.
12154934,71032915,2016-04-23,30549770,Dinesh,Great stay . Robs place is very central and Rob was very kind to accommodate small requests like an extra blanket and finding a place for the bags while we visited the city. The place is cosy and big enough for a small family. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wishes to be in the heart of the city amidst all its history and the hub bub.
12154934,71678351,2016-04-27,2689291,David,"We had a one major problem with the apartment: we did not understand from the description that the bed is not located on the floor.  It is on a platform about 4' off the ground, accessed by a narrow ladder.  When in the double bed, there is maybe 3' of clearance to the ceiling.  This may not be a problem for a younger users, or one without a disability.  It was not a good experience for us, either going to bed or getting out of bed or getting up in the night.  There was no light by the led. The location is on a third floor with a narrow staircase was not convenient.  The bathroom was clean but in need to repairs."
If there is already a warning about this in the description,it is our error and we missed it.  Our rating would then go to a 3*.,,,,
In every other way,the flat is excellent: clean,basics provided and Rob was timely,"welcoming and responsive.  The location is perfect with so many good things to do just nearby. \"",,
12154934,72235241,2016-05-01,65973990,Ashley,"This was our first time traveling with Airbnb. From the beginning Rob was very accommodating and was quick to responding to any questions I had. Rob did let me know that we could set up for transportation from the airport for 50 dollars. I did not know that the host would be picking us up and we did have to wait almost an hour for our pick up. I guess I would just recommend taking a taxi or the bus because you will pay a lot less. The place was nice and looked just like the pictures. We did have 3 people staying in the apartment which I wouldn't recommend because one will be staying on a pull out couch. Bring blankets and pillows! Rob was very kind and brought us pillows and blankets when we requested but no pillow cases and no sheets. The place was clean and perfect for a small family. The location of the apartment was amazing! We were right in the middle of everything. I went there for a conference at Hynes conventional center. It would literally take me three minutes to get to my classes. I do have to say it is very loud in the back ally. We woke up every morning at 3:30 am to load noises like garbage pick up or something. It was pretty bad. There is some construction going on which also made it difficult to sleep but I am sure that will be done soon. One little thing that kind of made me a little mad was the fact there was a television but the internet did not connect to it to watch any type of tv. This wasn't a big deal but its annoying having a tv in the living room and not being able to do anything with it. Overall, this place is perfect for a short trip and very clothes to basically everything. There is a ice cream and coffee right below the apartment."
12154934,72988516,2016-05-06,18280385,Gus,"Great place, with great space, and the location it's in is fantastic! Literally in the middle of a very neat & decorative area."
Rob is a great communicator,and is the type of host that will make accommodations for you to make your stay as comfortable as can be.,,,,
I appreciated the snacks in the refrigerator and the multiple kitchen utensils and cutleries.,,,,,
Shower gives nice and warm water,comfortable to the touch with good pressure.,,,,
Coffee,ice cream,restaurants,and pharmacy within feet!,,
Does get a little loud in the back alley at night,but ear buds will fix that. Would recommend,would likely return :-),,,
"\"",,,,,
12154934,73883463,2016-05-11,3794317,Jennifer,Rob was very accommodating to us when one of our flights was delayed many hours. He met us to let us into the condo and was very accommodating. The location was fantastic!! The back alley does get noisy early in the morning with the arrival of the garbage trucks but the street is full of shopping and restaurants and is walkable to Fenway! We tried to turn the tv on but it didn't seem to be connected. After a long day of being tourists it would have been nice to come back and be able to watch the baseball games on tv and unwind. Highly recommend this place!!
12154934,74389523,2016-05-15,64360894,Brian,Overall it was a good experience with Rob. He showed up timely with the key and even let us store our luggage for several hours after our check out time.
The studio looks just like the photos and is in an incredible location.,,,,,
I want to mention a few things that have not been previously noted: The apartment is on the 3rd floor and there is no elevator.  There is no microwave,but there is an oven and George Forman grill.  Lastly,there is no air conditioning. It was very warm being on the third floor and the bed being up high in the room. We stayed there in mid May and it was the warmest days of the year. Mid seventies. We had trouble sleeping a few nights due to the heat. I'm assuming previous reviews didn't address it because it was chilly.  I'm sure as it gets warmer,Rob will add a window AC unit.  That being said,"I would most definitely stay here if I visit Boston again.\"",
12154934,75862928,2016-05-23,49410793,Chase,Rob made Check-in and check-out very easy.  And the room was nice and clean when we arrived. The room was located in the perfect location on Newbury St. with great shops and restaurants all within walking distance. Highly recommended!
12154934,77947741,2016-06-04,41606419,Peter,"Rob easy to contact initially. The place is in a great location on newberry street round the corner from the convention centre. However there was no air conditioning for a 3rd floor apartment in Boston and the first night was hot and the bedroom does not have a fan above the bed so had to move the mattress into the lounge to be under the fan. The kitchen has a simple stove with no microwave. The TV is brand new it not connected to regular TV or cable and to watch TV you need a computer with an HDMI cable which I did not have, thus unable to watch TV. The Internet connection was great and could use around Boston not only in the apartment. There was no iron so had to buy one - should be one there now. The bed was comfy but only a bottom sheet provided and a thin blanket for covering. there was no hot water over the kitchen sink as the tap was broken. The bathroom was good with nice shower and hot water there!"
Rob responded to my questions but did not provide aircon when asked. Was very aloof when I arrived. He did meet me late in evening when I arrived however. He was very quick to leave and I had to find most things myself,,,,,
"Overall the stay was just ok. Would need to improve before I stayed there again for the price. \"",,,,,
12154934,78895484,2016-06-10,5945379,Kristofer,"My host made me feel welcome, and the neighborhood was very nice.  I felt safe."
Even though I feel my stay was good,I think there were a few things that might have made my stay even better.  I was able to still have a good time without a microwave,coffee maker,and TV system,but I think these would probably have made my stay better.  However,the lack of these did not create any real problem for me since I was able to use my laptop with the free wifi (which was a great feature) and boil water with Starbucks singles for coffee without any problems.
However,the problems were more in the lack of sheets and towels.  Once again I did OK with only one bottom sheet and bedspread but an additional top sheet would have been better.,,,,
Even having only 2 bath towels was OK except for the fact that there was nothing for the bottom of the shower.  Either a rubber shower mat or an additional towel would have made my showers more stable.  I worried a bit about slipping in the shower though I had little trouble keeping this from happening to me.  I worry though that other people who may stay in 290 Newbury St. could slip and fall in the shower causing perhaps bad results for them but also they could very well end up suing the landlords.  I think a wise thing would be to make a relatively inexpensive purchase for a rubber shower mat to make available or at least additional towels.  These are very inexpensive compared to a possible lawsuit.  If I were a landlord,I would definitely consider this.,,,,
Apart from these criticisms,"my stay was very good.\"",,,,
12154934,78992190,2016-06-10,66242899,Qiyun,"The location is really convenient to get to everything you need, the place is warm and cute"
12154934,79475582,2016-06-13,72790216,Jessica,Robs place was exactly as expected. Clean and tidy. Excellent location for exploring Boston. He was also extremely flexible with us in terms of check in and check out. Thanks for a great stay!
12154934,80032302,2016-06-15,74835607,Julia,Rob was an excellent host!  Met us  at the door  and made us feel welcome!  Nice clean unit in fabulous location.
12154934,80154854,2016-06-16,66235810,Greg,"First off I just have to say that the location of this place is AMAZING, right in the middle of a very active and bustling street with sidewalk cafes, restaurants and stores. Rob was a gracious host meeting us in person and also allowing us to check out a little later than was stated in order to accommodate our next day's plans. Our stay was just one night but I would love to have stayed and enjoyed this place for longer."
12154934,80715016,2016-06-19,32016131,Karl,"My trip to Boston was one of the best I've had recently, and a significant part of it was because of my accommodation. Rob met me personally on the afternoon of my arrival and he was very gracious to have allowed me to check in 30 mins earlier than scheduled. The place was as described. It wasn't a palace by any measure but it will fit 4 comfortably. The main bed is on a loft so if you have issues climbing a ladder, maybe you'll need to pull out the sofa bed. The thing that makes Rob's place a jewel find was the location. It's on the tail end of Newbury St. Newbury is a quaint tree-lined street with shops and restaurants and the architecture is amazing. It runs parallel to two major streets: Commonwealth (think Boston's version of a Parisian avenue) and Boylton (shopping). It's a bit of a walk to the nearest T station but that didn't really bother me. This place is perfect if you're on a budget but still would like to stay in the happening part of town. Boston's a pretty expensive city so Rob's apartment is a great find."
12154934,82941319,2016-06-30,10720060,Jon,Exactly as advertised.
12154934,85975951,2016-07-14,35200054,Dan,Good place for budget traveler - small and basic but has what you need and is well kept. Great coffee nearby. One thing to bear in mind: The alley the bedroom faces can be noisy late at night.
12154934,87013413,2016-07-18,33036099,Emilie,"For this price, get a hotel room. While the location of Rob's apartment is good, the actual place was not. It was quite dirty and provides guest with the bare minimum. For two beds, there was only one set of sheets so you were forced to sleep with the blankets right against your skin (probably not washed after each guest). The toilet paper provided was one-tier only . The wall paper in the shower is falling apart. We even had to remove the excess water from the air-conditioner in order for it to work properly. In addition to the condition of the place, check-in was very inflexible and Rob didn't show up for the check out at 10 (we left at 11 without actually seeing him)."
12154934,87612831,2016-07-21,74152066,Eric,Great location. A lot of space. Rob was easy to communicate with.
12154934,88023861,2016-07-22,38390780,Deb,"Great location, but not a great experience. Host was friendly and helpful upon arrival, but due to travel, unable to help during our stay."
While the property was clean,we were only able to use one of the two beds due to lack of sheets,and even that bed only had a bottom sheet. The main bed is in a low-ceilinged loft and accessible by a ladder,so not great for anyone with physical challenges or older travelers. Also,A/C was insufficient during very hot weather.,
Might be a good pick if you don't mind giving up a bit of comfort,"as the location was fantastic.\"",,,,
12154934,88644440,2016-07-25,24842495,Mark,"Rob was timely and communicated well. The place is very well located. That was our main concern, and was generally not out of the range of what I was expecting. However, our original request to the host via airbnb made clear we were a party of three (I just verified this). It had, as advertised, a loft bed and a hide-a-bed. When we came back for bedtime after the 4.5 hr. Red Sox game, we realized that the loft had only a cover sheet and the hide-a-bed had no bedding at all. It seemed unreasonable to call the host to drive over bedding at midnight, and I wasn't really that mad about it. I volunteered to sleep on the hide-a-bed on top of two towels and a tiny airline blanket (the closest thing to spare bedding around). When we contacted the host the next morning to say he might do better with bedding next time, he responded by saying he'd only wished he'd known we were a party of three. Aside from the fact he had this information, why would a host assume everyone would use one bed when two are advertised? I wasn't planning on posting anything about this, but the response made me feel like the host was stretching to blame us--after I'd just spent the night on towels for $300--instead of just apologizing and thanking for the feedback."
12154934,88989023,2016-07-26,42601667,Gina,"Host made it very easy for us to check in on our time.  The apartment was way to hot.  We only chose this apartment for location and for sleeping, which was not even possible due to poor air conditioning."
12154934,89414778,2016-07-28,80369954,Dru,"Rob was wonderful. Quick to reply, throughly asked if everything was okay, and made sure it was comfortable. If you are looking for a nice place in Boston for around 3 people or less, I would not pass this up. Very convient location and easy to find restaurants and stops for the T. I highly recommend staying through Rob!"
12154934,90254168,2016-07-31,24338358,Mireille,"The apartment was as advertised.  The location is fabulous, around the corner from the Hynes convention center and from Trader Joe's.  However, it was extremely hot, being on the top floor.  In addition, the bed is on a loft and does not get cooled by the bedroom's fan.  We slept on the couch in the living room, under a fan and adjacent to the AC that the host provided."
12154934,92127344,2016-08-07,29497076,Sven,"Location is perfect for the price. Host (Rob) was very friendly altough I was a bit late with check-in. Also, Rob allowed me to stay for couple for hours for late check out."
12154934,92660423,2016-08-09,37100390,Eric,"\"Perfect host. Only \"\"complaint\"\" would be price as this is more expensive than other locations for an older unit. Overall"
12154934,92923659,2016-08-10,27812401,Katharin,Rob met us promptly and the apt was clean and nicely set up. Great location for a trip to Fenway. Easy walk with all the fans!
12154934,95697273,2016-08-20,43501934,Angela,"Rob was very accommodating and extremely responsive. Anytime I needed to ask a question he responded within 15 minutes! That sets him apart from most hosts. The location was in a safe neighborhood with plenty of amenities within walking distance. Location was key for me as a single woman walking to classes at my school down the street. It was warm the first day, but Rob has provided a wonderful AC unit that kept the place very comfortable for the remainder of the trip. I had a little problem getting and staying connected to the internet, but I was at least able to access occasionally. It was a whirlwind week in Boston, but having a safe place so close to where I needed to be was wonderful!"
12154934,98732514,2016-09-01,45929826,Vinamre,"Rob's house was good, but not exactly as advertised. I had to carry four huge suitcases up 3 flights of stairs and that really took a toll on me. Most of the food in the apartment looked it had already been opened. The wifi too, was really slow and laggy. The only upside was the neighbouring area as there was proximity to the best of Boston's shopping and culture."
7513906,51914877,2015-10-25,18615416,Zinnia,"Alicia was wonderfully responsive and attentive to our needs before and during our stay. The apartment was clean and comfy with all the amenities we could ask for. The neighborhood is safe and quiet, but centrally located to public transit and many cultural and tourist attractions. There are great restaurants and cafes in the area, along with a nice grocery store just a few minutes away. Check in and out was a breeze. Overall this was the perfect place!"

I was always more than comfortable and had the best shower experience of my life. The host is amazing (friendly, approachable, and just plain great!) and she truly made the whole experience easy and memorable. I definitely was never in need of anything. Overall, she went over and above my expectations and I can't imagine anyone being unhappy here. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in the area!"
1301500,51772856,2015-10-24,4779599,Daniela,"Karen is the most wonderful and warmest host you can ever imagine. The moment I walked in I very much felt at home. The apartment is lovely, very clean, and it is conveniently located close to a T stop. The room has everything you need, even for an extended stay. The bed is really comfortable. Karen’s attention to details in order to make your stay as comfortable as possible is just great: There were flowers on my bedside table when I arrived, fresh towls were ready for me (and changed during my stay, as well as the linens). Communication before and during the stay was very easy and supernice. Jamaica Plain is a residential neighborhood, just a 15 min. train ride away from downtown Boston/Massachusetts Avenue, with cafés, shops, and laundry facilities close by, but nevertheless it’s calm and laid-back. I would most definitely stay there again! Thanks so much!"

If you had any questions she was very responsive to them and always had a positive attitude.  The summer in Boston is very warm and the place has no AC but she provided me with a couple fans which helped.  Her description is very accurate and I had no issues with this stay.  If staying near the T is also important for you then this is a perfect place to stay.

705919,5982668,2013-07-25,5079204,Paula,"Richard and Victoria were terrific hosts. The instructions were clear and everything went so smoothly. The Studio was in a perfect location -walking distance to shopping, restaurants, Fenway, etc. We look forward to returning."
705919,6140742,2013-07-31,7679804,Linda,"This is a studio apartment, so it is small. But the furnishings are lovely, the kitchen and bathroom appear to be recently renovated, and the fold out bed gives you extra room during the day. The apartment has everything you would need for a short or extended stay and was in immaculate condition when we arrived."
The location is great - a beautiful neighbourhood,easy walk to at least 3 train stations,and fantastic coffee very close by. Hot tip - try Render Coffee. We felt very safe wandering around both day and night.,,,
Richard was a great host,making sure we had all we needed. The cleaning fee was more than we had expected,but since we chose to self-clean it wasn't an issue.,,,
Should we return to Boston,"I'd happily stay here again.\"",,,,
705919,6957811,2013-09-01,6058637,Kate,This is a beautifully appointed studio situated in a lovely street in a great neighborhood. Although the apartment is on the small side (which Richard makes a point of emphasising) everything is provided and the apartment has been very well designed to make the most of the space available.  All the furnishings & fittings are of high quality and the flat is immaculately clean.
All our dealings with Richard were very straight forward & professional,"and any emails we sent received an immediate response.  Richard says that he is trying to run a five star operation & I think he is certainly succeeding!  We would have no hesitation in renting this flat again & will certainly be recommending it to our friends.\"",,,,

We ended up having it shipped to their office, and we found it in our apartment when we arrived. They definitely saved the day."
705919,11116344,2014-03-21,12845015,Lynnell,"Our stay at the South End Studio was seamless - the suite is small, but cleaner than any hotel we've been too.  It was stylish, comfortable and just perfect for what we needed!  Richard helped us through our first stay through Airbnb and answered questions quickly.  The location was perfect for traveling on the T and walking around Boston.  We will definitely return again!"
705919,11531869,2014-04-07,11389877,Lori,"We had an excellent stay at this apartment.  Richard is a terrific host.  Everything from the reservation process to check-in/check-out was very organized and professional.  Helpful instructions and information about the apartment and area were provided, just like a hotel.  The apartment is beautifully furnished and updated, is very clean and has all the amenities you would need."
The South End is one of the best neighbourhoods to stay in Boston.  The apartment is in a great location on a nice quiet street that is in walking distance to the T,shopping and excellent restaurants.,,,,
"We hope to stay here again on our future visits to Boston!\"",,,,,
705919,12823365,2014-05-12,13161087,Rhonda,"We spent 5 evenings at Victoria and Richards' South End Studio, while attending various recitals, programs, and commencement at nearby Berklee College of Music.  We were uncertain about how to check in, but a quick call to Richard took care of all of our questions."
The Studio was clean,comfortable,and peaceful.  It was conveniently located to public transportation. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. This was our first air bnb experience,but will not be our last!,,

705919,14427103,2014-06-19,13307729,Paula,"My husband and I found Studio 3 to be clean, well set up and in a lovely neighborhood.  Before our arrival we were contacted by Richard's assistant Juan, who promptly responded to each and every one of my questions.  We were very pleased with our first experience with Airbnb."
705919,16292445,2014-07-25,7885184,Fiona,"Richard was a fantastic host. He gave us all the information to find the apartment easily and get settled in the area. The apartment itself was fabulous, extremely clean and very well equipped. I would recommend any of his listings, everything was thought about and taken care of. A better experience than many hotels."
705919,17612393,2014-08-15,14537927,Cheryl,"The apartment and locality were as described. The Boston T was easilyly accessible making getting around the city and to and from the airport very easy. As an extra touch the host left us two bottles of wine which was lovely. When we arrived the apartment was very clean and well presented, being well stocked with all the things needed to make it an enjoyable stay."
705919,22882468,2014-11-17,6565982,Kait,"\"Richard was very communicative and prompt in replying to my questions. The place was exactly as described, super clean, and easy to check into. The attention to detail was much appreciated, including a helpful list of phone numbers, services, and nearby attractions. I stayed there for five days while I was on a business trip at the Hynes Convention Center, and the location couldn't have been more perfect. The flat had all the necessities one could need, and was the perfect size for a single person or a couple. It's on a beautiful tree lined street - quiet, atmospheric, and picturesque - and just a minutes away from restaurants and other amenities. I opted for the professional cleaning as I was quite busy with work; I thought $150 was a bit high, but the place was so clean and tidy upon my arrival that it was worth it. And it's nice that they offer a \"\"self-clean\"\" option for those who are budget minded. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for a clean"
705919,25163751,2015-01-08,16709586,Etienne,"Very professional and timely communication ; the apartment is very nice, very clean, in a nice area, very conveniently located next to the Convention Center. I particularly appreciated the detailed instructions and the welcome gift. I highly recommend."
705919,29594949,2015-04-10,21109599,Melissa,"This studio was clean and beautifully presented. It has everything you could need as a base to explore Boston, in particular the shared laundry (once we found it) was a godsend. Also, while I was apprehensive about the fold away bed it proved to be quite comfortable. The communication from Richard was great, and the little extra touches throughout the apartment were definitely appreciated. The only real negative for this studio is the upstairs neighbour who has a tendency to stomp and play semi-loud music. However this never caused us any great disturbance. Overall I was very impressed with the studio and wouldn't hesitate recommending it to others."
705919,39597636,2015-07-25,4415321,Alison,"We loved Richard's studio in South End. Although small it had everything you could possibly need and appliances etc had a bit of class. We loved the area - walk to everything. A short stroll down the park path from Back Bay station and restaurants, shops etc just around the corner in any direction. Richard was very professional to deal with and communication was very good. We also loved staying in a traditional brownstone."
705919,52679259,2015-11-01,8209268,Daniel,"Very cute place in a secluded previously-unknown-to-me mini-neighborhood of Boston!  Leafy street of picture-perfect brownstones.  Close to Mass Ave T, Symphony Hall and great dining on Tremont.  Love that it's a little bit tucked away from the major thoroughfares in the South End, which gives it a much quieter feel than most other places you could stay."
Early check-in and late check-out are available for an extra fee (2 hours on each end).,,,,,
Be sure you keep track of which 'cleaning' you chose when booking as you have to do different things depending on your choice,on checkout.  We found it a bit confusing.,,,,
"Also avoid bringing a car as the only public parking in the area is very expensive ($33/day) and a ~10 minute walk away.\"",,,,,
705919,54850035,2015-11-25,37354002,Sierra,"Our studio in Boston was everything it was supposed to be.  clean, bright, and warm with all the amenities needed, plus little extras like wine and fluffy towels to make us feel welcome.  Richard was communicative and helpful when needed.  I would recommend this listing to anyone who wants to stay in a neighborhood and who is looking for a friendly home base in a fun city!"

705919,62187795,2016-02-12,22823792,Jacob,"This apartment is as advertised, it's incredibly clean and feels like a hotel experience. Richard provided a guide with every possible question and was very responsive upon further inquiries. Would rent again."

705919,74023403,2016-05-12,63557979,Karen,"This was a perfect place for us to stay while visiting Boston for 5 nights. We were welcomed with 2 bottles of wine that our hosts left for us and a darling, spotless studio apt. This apt is in a great neighborhood in the South End, only a few blocks from the Orange Line which takes you everywhere. We were also walking distance from almost everything including Fenway Park. I highly recommend this listing and would stay there again."
705919,75302070,2016-05-20,22630636,Jing,Great location. Mum loved the bed. Easy check-in. Richard was real helpful answering my questions. Gotta be lucky to find a parking spot tho.
225979,558459,2011-09-22,239323,Dawn,A great visit.  Duane and his home are very comfortable and welcoming.  The fresh roasted coffee and conversation were great.  I look forward to another visit!
225979,567070,2011-09-25,1102700,André,"Duane was an incredibly gracious host, making my first AirBnB experience both relaxing and memorable. The space was comfortable and a nice getaway from the insanity of the conference I was attending."
The bus than ran closest to his place stopped running early in the evening which would have made been an issue because of when the conference day ended. Luckily Duane offered to come and get me at the station in the evening - a welcome solution!,,,,,
I enjoyed the coffee,"his suggestions and the conversations and hope our paths will cross again.\"",,,,
225979,582218,2011-09-29,812255,Stephanie,Duane was a great host especially since my travel plans changed three times on short notice and he was willing to accomodate each time. And who can complain about a good cup of joe waiting for you in the morning.
As long as you're not uptight and overly particular,"Duane's quaint apartment will get the job done.\"",,,,
225979,632228,2011-10-16,1164899,Nicole,"Duane's place is lovely and homey. I really enjoyed his delicious fresh roasted coffee too. Everything was very clean and tidy. Roslindale is a really cute eclectic neighborhood with a lot of great shops and restaurants. I enjoyed wandering around the neighborhood. There is also a beautiful park and arboretum at the top of the hill. Roslindale is a little bit of a trek from downtown, but I found the bus and T to be very convenient."
225979,665283,2011-10-25,1319153,Ashley,"Duane was a delightful host! He was very accommodating in every sense of the word. He is quite a wonderful conversationalist, who was a real pleasure to be around. The bedroom was a perfect size and had all the fixings a traveler could ask for. I highly recommend this destination!"
225979,676150,2011-10-30,1278330,Yang,"I strong recommend this place for people who want to stay in Boston. Duane is super nice and helpful. He picked me up, printed out the map for me and showed me around the nearest Chinese restaurant."
The house is located in a quite and safe neighborhood suburban Boston. But it is easily access to anywhere in Boston by public transportation.,,,,,
The room is cosy. There was an unusual early snow when i was there. And Duane is very concerned about it and keeps asking me about it. Actually,it is very fine for me.,,,,
Btw,the breakfast made by Duane is also good.,,,,
You really need to go and  try this local B&B.,,,,,

225979,699039,2011-11-07,212496,Jodi,Very pleasant stay.  Duane was accomodating in ground transportation and getting around.  Would definitely stay here again!
225979,724043,2011-11-16,609478,Seng Kiat,"Duane has been one of the most warm and helpful hosts that I'd met.  It was very thoughtful of him to give me a lift to and from the train station on the first and last day of my stay, considering that I had a very heavy luggage. Before the trip, he already gave me tips on the best way to get around in Boston. When in Boston, I found that most of the time I was able to get to the city center very easily, as there were frequent trains and buses. Duane was very efficient in getting things done, and I enjoyed the breakfast which he prepared for me every morning - he toasted his own bread, brewed his own coffee, one of the most heavenly I had. Whatever requests that I made, he would always do his best to help. I enjoyed the evening watching movies from his Netflix account too, but most of all I enjoyed the many conversations we had during my stay. I feel that I have found a new friend on my trip to Boston. Thank you, Duane ,for making my stay a memorable one. Will certainly recommend him to anyone who like to go to Boston for a holiday or work."
225979,729012,2011-11-18,1396769,Michael,I chose to stay with Duane after reading the glowing reviews of previous guests and must say that everything they say is 100% accurate.
Duane is a fantastic host with a very nice home. He took me in on short notice and had everything prepped when I arrived.  Knowledgable on a variety of topics,Duane is easy and enjoyable to talk to.  Since I was in the middle of an apartment hunt,he also was able to give me tips on areas to look at,which ones to avoid,and driving times to certain areas during rush hour and winter traffic.,
Should you find yourself in need of a place to stay,"I would recommend checking this place out.\"",,,,
225979,737326,2011-11-22,1278087,Eileen,"I tried clilcking on the stars...above, but nothing happened."
His is definitely a 5-star place....,,,,,
Duane is a computer programmer and a really nice guy...even schlepping me to the station a couple of times.,,,,,
"His apartment is cozy (and the dining room has a great view of downtown Boston...all glittery and glowing at night) and the \"\"quaint\"\" room is lovely and (and I admit I was a bit worried about this cuz of the huge window) toasty warm.",,,,,
If you are car-less,bus and train connec tions to-from the apartment are a snap.  The 50 is 2 mins from the doorstep while the 34 is just down the hill (maybe 6 mins' walk).  Duane suggested I get the Boston 7-Day Tranisit Card ($(URL HIDDEN) excellent value cuz I was there for 4 days and had to go into the city every day for a conf.,,,,
Duane roasts his own coffee...and every morning we had a different type!  He bakes bread,too!!!,,,,
Casa Duane is definitely on my short list of places to stay if/when I return to Boston.,,,,,

Whenever I stay else ware on Airbnb, I totally miss Duane's coffee and hospitality.  He's the only host I've stayed with that will get up with my early schedule and see me off in the morning.  I also love the Roku box!!...essentially it means that on-demand is at your finger tips...I was catching up on some rest and relaxation during my stay and Duane let me hog the TV the days that I was there and catch up with some (URL HIDDEN) how can I complain.  Highly recommended!"
225979,888333,2012-01-29,1463712,Linda,"Duane was a very generous host, he even picked me up from the airport even though my flight arrived around midnight. Throughout my stay, he was also available to pick me up from the station when bus times were not looking too good. Although the house itself is not very close to the city centre, transport is quite convenient."
The room is small,but cosy and comfortable. Duane also provides excellent coffee and bread which is a nice start to the day.,,,,
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay\"",,,,,
225979,987984,2012-03-11,1460208,Sanne,"I felt so lucky that I had chosen Duane's place every day of the two weeks I stayed at his place. From before I came till after I had left Duane was the most helpful host I could ever imagine, making my stay in Boston so much easier and more fun. I also felt at home at his place right away, hanging in his lovely sofa everyday after a long day. Everyday would start with his friendly question if I was ready for coffee and home baked bread and I would sit and look out his window looking at the beatiful view out at Boston from his window enjoying my breakfast greatly. With Duane's interest in how I was doing and all his help we became friends and I will remember my stay at Duane's as a wonderful thing about Boston. Also don't worry about the transportation into downtown, I stayed at Duane's place for almost two weeks and went into downtown everyday and it was really no problem. One last thing.. I always felt secure in the neighborhood, it was a cozy area. I would choose Duane's place if I should ever come back to Boston and I would highly recommend Staying at Duane's to anybody going to Boston. The bottom line is that I would wish that a review like this could express how happy I was about staying at Duane's."
225979,1010847,2012-03-17,239323,Dawn,"I stayed in the front room this visit and Loved waking up to the amazing view of downtown Boston.

225979,1015675,2012-03-18,1930372,Kate,Duane was a thoughtful and hospitable host with a lovely apartment. He's  full of helpful information and ready to make your stay easier and more enjoyable. Thoroughly recommended.
225979,1042439,2012-03-26,1023569,Bau,"Duane is a fantastic host--knowledgeable, friendly and extremely helpful.  The bed is comfortable, the room is private, the place is quiet, and the location is conveniently accessible via public transportation.  In short, I couldn't have hoped for better accommodation, and would absolutely stay there again.  The fact that there was a fresh, delicious, home-roasted cup of coffee every morning was just the icing on the cake.  Highly, highly recommended!"
225979,1097970,2012-04-08,1909629,Sky,Duane was great!  He's super friendly and accommodating.  He makes a mean cup of joe as well.  Staying with him has the felling of staying with an old friend.
He's a little far from the city center but I dare you to find a better deal this close to the subway.,,,,,
"Highly recommended.\"",,,,,
225979,1122383,2012-04-13,1994904,Melissa,Duane is a very nice host. He provides very detail information for transportation. He also pick me up and gave me a ride to the Forest Hill Subway station. The place is nice and clean.
225979,1149465,2012-04-18,1723994,Joel,Duane was an outstanding host. I was in Boston for the Boston Marathon weekend and stayed 3 nights. He gave me a few rides to the Forest Hills station and made sure I knew the transit schedules. He took time out of his day to drive me downtown to catch the athletes bus to the start. He had coffee ready every morning. The place was nice and clean and the bed was very comfortable. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the Boston area.
225979,1198746,2012-04-29,907220,Gabriel,"Duane was a great host with great communication, that kept me informed of how to contact him, when to arrive and how to get there.  He even picked me up from nearby subway station. Once at place he made sure I was comfortable and had home made bread and fresh ground and brewed coffee ready in morning."
Room was just what I needed to rest after a long day of exploring city.,,,,,
"Great price and a short subway ride from downtown.\"",,,,,
225979,2227707,2012-09-08,2122334,Alexandre,"I had a very nice stay at Duane's house where I stayed 3 months this summer. Duane is outstanding host, very friendly, and very accommodating. He often picked me up at the subway station in the evening when I was coming back from work, and we had great times sharing meals, movies, etc. ! The room is private, the bed is comfortable and the house is really nice, in a very quiet neighborhood. I highly recommend this place!"
225979,2527832,2012-10-07,2764880,Christian,"Had an extended stay, and Duane was very gracious and accommodating!   I'm a bit of a coffee snob, and his is excellent.  He knows the city very well, and was quick to help with travel and recommendations. Roslindale's a nice, safe neighborhood, and the house is about a 40 minute commute to downtown.  The room's cozy, and charming."
225979,3324311,2013-01-10,544458,Nicolle,"Duane is a gracious host that goes above and beyond to provide a comfortable visit for his guests. The home is adorable, the coffee is killer, and the bread is better than your mom's. Thank you again for such a warm welcome to your amazing city."
225979,4194476,2013-04-17,1355058,Kate,I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Duane and my stay with him.  I happened to be there this weekend for the Boston Marathon and the bombings.
To start,I got in very late on Saturday night and Duane picked me up from the airport.  The next morning he had freshly baked bread and coffee ready for me.  He drove me to the subway station so I could easily get downtown (which takes about 20 mins via subway).  It was so helpful!,,,,
The day of the marathon,Duane woke up at 5:30 AM and had coffee and breakfast ready for me yet again.  He drove me to the shuttle buses downtown which was a total lifesaver!,,,,
Immediately after I finished the race and the bombs went off,Duane was there to pick me up and get me safely out of there.  We sat and watched the news together for awhile after.  It was a scary experience and I am so grateful that Duane was there to rescue me.,,,,
The room itself is clean and cozy.  The bed is comfortable with a great down comforter. The bathroom is shared with the others in the home but it was always available when I needed it.,,,,,
Duane was incredibly helpful with guiding me on public  transit and even let me use his extra Charlie card.,,,,,
The home is in a really neat part of Boston with a great view of downtown.  My experience was excellent and couldn't have been any better.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
225979,5588289,2013-07-07,4425408,Charlie,"Duane's hospitality was simply incredible.  The cozy room was cute and just right for my stay.  The first night it was a little warm for my taste—I'm from Florida where air conditioning is a religion.  I mentioned it to Duane, and when I came back the next evening, there was a new fan for my room.  This is just one example of the many lovely things he did to make my stay awesome, from transit information to fetching me from the airport after my flight was massively delayed."
The coffee and breakfast bread were lovely touches and made my mornings.,,,,,
To sum it all up,I would totally stay with Duane next time I visit Boston.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
225979,5837668,2013-07-18,2429825,Jennifer,I ended up canceling my reservation unexpectedly so I cannot comment in my stay. I did appreciate Duane's compassionate nature in dealing with the situation.
225979,5875560,2013-07-20,7453444,Susannah,"I enjoyed my stay with Duane! He did everything possible to make me feel comfortable and at home. For me, the availability of free parking was really a huge plus, since parking in Boston can be a bear, and I liked the pleasant, quiet neighborhood. Also, I'll  add that traveling as a single woman I was totally comfortable the whole time. A thumbs-up experience!"
Comments: The apartment's location relative to public transit might make it a little inconvenient for tourists dependent on public transit,especially in summer heat or winter cold. For someone with a car,though,the ample free parking is a huge plus. Also,the room itself is separated from the living room -- which is always empty and peaceful during my stay -- by a heavy curtain,not a wall
225979,5929686,2013-07-22,7490403,Claire,Duane was a great host. The space was clean and sweet and Duane made me feel comfortable and welcome to move around the shared space. He was very informative and we had a good exchange. I would recommend this place for any solo who was visiting the area and I would return should it be available.

225979,5991788,2013-07-25,7366372,Amelia,"Duane is a wonderful host!  He made me feel right at home from the moment he picked me up at the bus station!  The room is cozy, bright, and quiet, the bed is comfortable, the whole apartment is clean and welcoming.  The balcony is awesome, with a really cool view!  The coffee is excellent, and the homemade bread is delicious!  I wish I could have stayed longer...staying at Duane's Coffee Roaster BnB is a totally positive experience!  Ten Stars!"
225979,9098416,2013-12-07,6761536,Lesley,"\"Duane is a very nice guy.  He was more than happy to take me to the \"\"good\"\" market on his runs and I was delighted to watch him roast his coffee beans.  The large vessel of coffee left for me to tank up during my day was greatly appreciated."
I stayed long term - 90+ days while I did my thesis semester at Emerson College. I got my work done and was able to enjoy a bit of Roslindale Village as well.  I managed the bus/T into Boston - with a bit of planning when I stayed into the evening. I never resorted to taking a cab from the T station but did come close once or twice.,,,,,
All said - a couple of things that worked out okay for me but that a guest should be aware of:  What is in the photo is basically all there is to the room. I would characterize the area as a sleeping alcove since it is partitioned by a curtain not a door. There is about a one foot leeway to either side of the bed.   I put my computer on a TV tray in the arch of the alcove and that worked for me.  The living room beyond was 99% vacant so no problems there.  The only warning is that your sound/privacy is as open to the house as it is to you.  For instance: I was glad to have earplugs when a cold broke out and I wanted to escape the sound of coughing and stuffy noses.  I also tried to time personal calls and internet chats with my husband when the house was vacant.  There were times I watched TV on my Ipad to unwind - sometimes late into the night and had to remind myself to keep the volume low.,,,,,
The house is on a fairly steep hill and there are a set of steep stairs up to the apartment.  All this gives it a neat airy view of the village and downtown Boston - especially without the tree leaves.  But this also means there is a hill to walk up from the bus - thought it is a safe neighborhood. The bus right at the corner near the house has a limited schedule and does not run at night.,,,,,
Lastly - I am wheat free and didn't get to share in the daily bread and bagels but Duane did make me several breakfasts of arapas - egg/cheese in a cornmeal shell  - that were great.,,,,,
At the end of my stay Duane got me to the airport like a champ.  He also gave me a box to pile in all my extra books and papers I had acquired during the semester,"which was a great help.\"",,,,
225979,15439617,2014-07-09,9785052,Matthias,"\"I don't know where to begin while writing this short review of my stay with Duane. After very friendly and timely e-mails with Duane I decided to book the \"\"coffee roaster's single-room\"\" for half a year during my study-related stay in the Boston area."
It was a bitterly cold winter when I arrived and Duane made me feel like home from the very first day on with delicious coffee and all kinds of self-made bread variations every (!) morning and nice conversations in the evenings. After the first days,where Duane assisted me with the rental car organization and other work related preparations,"we established a certain \"\"series-watching tradition\"\" and he was so kind to introduce me to some friends. This should just show you that Duane really takes care of his guests in an extraordinary and helpful way. Despite that we went to the movies a couple of times and to restaurants and groceries and",looking back,we had way too much ice cream at J.P. Licks (I won't forget the taste of the legendary Rum Raisins). As soon as the weather got better we even did a bicycling tour at Cape Cod and watched baseball games in Roslindale.,
First I was concerned if the small room allowed appropriate working on my Master's Thesis,but Duane provided a couple of small tables that made comfortable working in the TV room possible and additionally the great table in the living room was available at all times. I never had the impression that Duane felt disturbed by my (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) calls or when I watched TV - he is mostly listening with headphones to the radio while working next-door.,,,,
The location of the appartment is fantastic! You have access to several bus lines within a minute's walk range and can get into downtown Boston within approx. only 25 minutes! You can borrow Duane's Public Transportation Card,which makes commute even more comfortable. At night the view of the Boston skyline is marvelous and you can relax on the broad balcony. However,I went often to a beautiful nearby park (Roslindale Arboretum) for a walk or jogging and Duane even picked me up once when I got stuck at heavy rain due to a sudden thunderstorm. For the sake of completeness,the steep hill the house is located on and the apartment's stairs should be no unpleasant issue for an individual of good health...,,
If one room is not occupied you might expect some other guests from time to time (mostly during weekends),which I appreciated as a lot of interesting discussions developed with people all over the world (Canada,France,South Africa,...) during dinner or breakfast. Finally,the kitchen has everything you need to prepare delicious meals and the refrigerator and freezer are available for you
All in all,"I highly recommend Duane's appartment and will keep the time I could spend together with him in and around Boston in very good memory.\"",,,,
225979,15888784,2014-07-17,17694076,Paraskevi,"I stayed at Duane's house for five nights and it was a really enjoyable experience. It was the first time I used airbnb and Duane was very helpful all along, from the reservation stage to the very last minute of my stay there."
The area is a bit far from the centre,you need to take the subway to the last station and then a bus to get to Duane's house but the connections are good and Duane explained everything in his e mails. The house was very clean and well-ordered. It was peaceful and quiet,a very nice place to relax after spending the day downtown. The room is a bit small and is divided from the living room with a curtain,but Duane is very discreet,so I never felt lack of privacy.,
Duane knows Boston really well and was always ready to share his knowledge with me and answer any questions I had. His coffee and bread in the morning are great! You feel like being at home!,,,,,
On my last day I had to catch an early bus from Boston and Duane was polite enough to drive me to the subway station,which made things much easier for me.,,,,
All in all,it was a very nice experience. I was travelling on my own and I felt really safe there,"so I would recommend it to any woman traveller. A big \"\"Thank you","Duane\"\" for making this first airbnb experience so pleasant! \"",,
225979,16369011,2014-07-26,9908439,Ziggy,I was in Boston for a week and decided to stay with Duane because his room is relatively cheap. The room is small but was perfect for me; apart from the occasional big city siren you'll only hear sounds of nature (mostly chirping birds). The room is clean and has a nice bed. I slept really well. My days started perfectly because Duane makes great breakfast and coffee (I even got to taste real American pancakes!). During the day this is a quiet house with plenty of room to work.
Roslindale is a nice little town,with good restaurants (which Duane pointed out to me or even took me to). It is very easy to get to downtown Boston from here: it costed me only 20-30 minutes by public transport. Buses leave from around the corner every 5 minutes or so. Riding the train gave great time to observe the Bostonians and felt safe.,,,,
Being used to travel by bike I couldn't resist to rent one for a couple of days. Boston proved to be a great city for biking. I biked both into the city (very easy to follow route from Duane's house) and into nature. My favourite place in the direct neighborhood was the Arnold Arboretum,where I spent quite some time. Jamaica Plains is also a nice closeby area.,,,,
It was nice to talk with Duane,and he was more than helpful with directions and pointing out cool things to do in Boston. He took me to a famous pizza place on the last day of my stay and dropped me of at my terminal afterwards; perfect service.,,,,
Before staying with Duane I spent a night in one of the better reviewed Boston hostels,"but I would definitely recommend to save some bucks and have a way better experience by staying at Duane's house.\"",,,,
225979,16842117,2014-08-03,4615093,Tiago,"It's the second time that I stay at Duane's house. As always, Duane provided a great experience. Every morning he set up the breakfast with fresh coffee and homemade bread. He also made delicious pancakes on Saturday. Everything was perfect. On this trip, I had a lot of luggage, and Duane kindly gave me a ride to his house. I highly recommend again Duane's house to anyone needing a nice and friendly place to stay in Boston."
"\"",,,,,
225979,17768815,2014-08-17,17891998,Jaffer,"Duane was extremely gracious. I found his place well connected to downtown Boston through the metro and buses. At all the important points during my stay, Duane provided useful information about the city of Boston, transportation, and history. I always felt safe in Rosindale and surrounding neighborhoods.  There are some good restaurants and fast food places near Duane's place."
225979,21375040,2014-10-16,16956999,Zac,"I stayed with Duane while on a two-month clinical rotation and his living arrangement fit my needs perfectly. Duane's place is pretty much exactly how his description on here says. He is very quick to share information about goings-on around Boston and is very knowledgeable of the surrounding area and getting around. He will bend over backwards to make your stay a welcome one and even throws in a never-ending supply of freshly baked bread to boot! The neighborhood is nice and quiet and very culturally diverse. There are a few bus routes that routinely stop by at nearby locations that can take you to the Forest Hills train stop. Duane can give you more information about the routes to and from Roslindale and may even assist you in getting around as he did with me a few times. I highly recommend at least contacting him and seeing if he's the right fit for your stay in Boston, but be quick because it appears that he has quite a popular place!"
225979,21615886,2014-10-20,21875479,William,This was my first air bnb booking Duane was an excellent host very helpful on getting around town and the history of Boston you will have everything you need I suggest you book this room and get on with your visit !!!!

225979,22796548,2014-11-15,22257723,Aaron,"My stay with Duane was pleasant and very helpful, since I was in the process of relocating and fairly new to the city. Duane made me feel at home and was very knowledgeable about Boston. I enjoyed his stories about Boston and his company in general.  Duane gave me a lot of good advice as to how I can get settled in Boston.The apartment is very clean and comfortable. If you are looking to stay in Boston Duane's is the place to go!"
225979,23301939,2014-11-28,20034211,Anarie,This was my first Airbnb and I had a great experience. Duane was a really nice guy and made you feel at home. He was very knowledgeable about Boston and always gave me tips about the city.  He's really friendly and willing to answer any questions you have. He even offers fresh coffee and homemade bread in the morning.
In regards to the location,his house is really close to a bus that connects straight to the t-station. It's really easy to navigate and Duane explains it very well.,,,,
I was there for a week. My last day,"Duane offered to give me a ride to my next Airbnb. He's that nice! I hope all my Airbnb experiences are like this one. \"",,,,
225979,24115437,2014-12-20,1234683,Fatos,Duane is an excellent host! I would recommend him to anyone traveling to Boston. His place is located in a good neighborhood and is very well kept and clean. Not to mention that Duane roasts some outstanding coffee. I look forward to staying here again on my next trip to Boston.
225979,28294332,2015-03-21,3333872,Dale,"I had a last minute change of itinerary and needed a place in the Boston area for the night between business appointments. Duane was nice enough to accept a same-day booking. The room is great, there was street parking right out front, and Roslindale is a cool area. Duane is a super host, and his homemade toast and coffee is outstanding!"
225979,28687288,2015-03-28,13757288,David,"Duane's home is clean, quiet, comfortable and very pleasant. He is a very nice,  helpful and available host, and the coffee is indeed good. Public transport into Boston was very easy. I would definitely stay there again."

225979,29956709,2015-04-14,2456661,Cristian,"Duane is very kind person, he hosted me in his apartment even I came just for one day in Boston. He helped me with info about Boston, took me with his car from the subway to his house and the most important,    wrote me about a precious sd card full of photos from my trip which i lost in front of his house and sent me the files which are very important to me. I appreciate a lot what he did and I am sure he can help in  other ways the people who decide to stay in his cozy house. Highly recommended!"
225979,30395035,2015-04-21,29141413,Lars,"Mahtava isäntä. Hyvät keskustelut aina aamiaisella ja välillä muulloinkin. Duane osasi neuvoa reitit paikkoihin joihin olin menossa ja ehdotti muutamia kohteita, joita en edes tiennyt olevan. Hyvin pohjoismaalaisen ajattelutavan omaava amerikkalainen. Ei ollut tungettelevainen, mutta oli aina valmis auttamaan."
Huone oli pienehkö,mutta riittävä,koska se yhdistyi suoraan olohuoneeseen,joka oli käytännössä yksityisessä käytössäni. Talo on vanha hyvällä tunnelmalla,ja näköala upea. Pysäköinti kadun varressa ilmaista,mikä on Bostonissa arvokas asia. Monikulttuurinen turvallinen naapurusto. Todella hiljainen katu. Wifi toimii.
Itse olin liikkeellä vuokra-autolla,mutta paikallisbussi kulki ihan lähikadulla. Etelä-Boston on melko sokkeloinen,"joten suosittelen autoilijalle navigaattorin käyttöä.\"",,,
225979,31593861,2015-05-07,30944027,Chih-Hung,"Duane is a super nice host. He is so kind and always willing to help me anything during my relocation.  Every morning, Duane prepared nice coffee and breakfast, which makes me feel like home. He allowed me to move in with several boxes and park my car in the driveway."
The place is very clean,quite and in a safe neighborhood. It is a few minutes walk to bus stops,which take you to Forest Hills T station. Overall,it is a comfortable place and I really enjoy my stay here.,,
I highly recommended Duane's place,"especially for those relocating to Boston. \"",,,,

Host:  Duane is the best. Friendly,considerate,professional,going above and beyond to help answer any questions related to Boston,and provided advice (apps on bus times,etc).  Really loved talking with Duane on all topics Boston related or not.
Location/Room:  Neighborhood was very safe,and loved the ample and safe parking. Easy to get to by Orange Line/Bus 50 or 34.  Shared apt was very clean,comfortable; fresh towels,and clean bathroom.,,
Picture and description is very accurate; exactly as described and photos; No surprises.,,,,,
Also no need for a car unless you have other needs for it. As they say,when in Rome; do as Romans or Bostonians.  I really felt like I relocated to Boston!,,,,
Overall: Five Stars!  Highly recommend staying with Duane. Will stay again without a doubt. You truly get another dimension of getting real Bostonian perspective staying with Duane vs Hotel. ...save a bundle vs hotel,and is so much better.  Loved it!  Can’t say thank you enough to the hospitality of Duane,and his very friendly and accommodating approach.  Hope to be in Boston again in the future.,,,

Duane not only helped explain the transit system and set me up with a Charlie card, he gave me an awesome discount promo code for Fasten (uber type of service) and gave me a lift into downtown a couple times and helped me get groceries.

NO - Edana provides a real apartment with everything you could want. Fully furnished. A wonderful kitchen with pots,pans,cutlery,knives,even lots of spices and oils,
I am absolutely staying here again.,,,,,
This is not a tourist area. When you stay at Edana's you are in REAL Boston. Not something designed for the tourist. The neighborhood is a wonderful mixed area with gorgeous Boston houses & 3-deckers from the 1870's and after.  This is the real thing.,,,,,
The neighborhood has neighborhood restaurants - and yes,a WholeFoods within a mile.,,,,
You are a block from the Orange Line that takes you to all the Boston tourist activities in 20 minutes.,,,,,

Paige is great with communication and check-in arrangement. She also has access to overnight parking nearby at a reasonable price. The spit is a little tight but our Chrysler minivan fit perfectly.,,,,,
The apartment unit however,is very basic. An older building that is not updated,so don't expect anything fancy. Everything is there,everything works,but unlike some airbnb's where they really fluff things up like a luxury hotel,this is more like a European 3 star hotel.
We were in unit #4,It is upstairs 3 flights of narrow stairs. Keep in mind If you have big suitcases or trouble carrying things.,,,,
4 star rating not related to Paige,"the missing star is solely due to the unit itself which is not something she can do about. \"",,,,

The apartment is on the top floor, so be prepared for a lot of stairs (especially, if like us, you are bringing up a lot of suitcases and a cooler full of food and ice!). The apartment had great views of other brownstones and the city, being up so high. It was cozy and was perfectly accommodating for 7 women staying there on the first night, and even more comfortable when it was down to just 5 women.

The garage parking space was also very helpful as parking can be challenging in the area.  We arrived late (~1 AM) and Michael left a key and garage door opener for us to enter the apartment.
One issue was that there was a car parked in the driveway blocking the garage when we arrived.  We were able to back the car in around it and afterword Michael came down to move it.  I would have called but it was late and didn't want to wake him since we already had the garage opener and key to the room.  The only other issue was that the listing shows washer and dryer upon request but when we asked about doing laundry,"he said he sends his out.  So that was a no go.\"",,,,

12593295,80431348,2016-06-18,44376207,Kaliyah,"I never actually met Rachel or her roommates but the stay was great. We got in really late due to our bus and she was such a doll about it. The room was clean, the house was clean. This was my first stay with anyone through Air Bnb and it was the perfect opener. I only wish my fiancee and I could have met her because from her house and hospitality she's a great person."
12593295,83922180,2016-07-04,125114,Jessica,"Very friendly group of individuals with a perfect sized room & bed for two. My boyfriend and I had a fantastic stay, and enjoyed the neighborhood. Just a few blocks from the T / coffee / food and more."
12593295,85086114,2016-07-10,79933639,Darryl,This place is located close by to the T and bus station making it very convenient to get around. The room was very cozy. It's great for travellers who are out often to explore and just need a place to sleep and shower. Overall a pleasant stay.
12593295,87084453,2016-07-18,50600356,Maribel,"Rachel solo nos dio las llaves de la casa cuando llegamos porque ella se marchaba unos días con familiares, permanecieron allí compañeras de piso, no tuvimos sensación de sentirnos como en casa, aunque la localización era buena con respecto a la parada de metro y cercanía al parque. La habitación estaba bien, pero la limpieza de zonas comunes dejaba mucho que desear, sobre todo en baño . La limpieza no era generalizada."
12593295,91469518,2016-08-05,41894890,Edward,"\"Rachel was  an exceptionally very good host, the room was very clean and she was very welcoming, her dogs are absolutely adorable \"\"bronco & whiskey\"\" very cozy and comfortable bed along with much needed air conditioner in the room to cool us down from our visit to the downtown Boston. The trip was amazing and the experience was even better! There's good food at the corner from her house for breakfast and dinner and right across there's the train station that directly takes you to the very heart of downtown Boston! Rachel we will definitely stay with you again when we visit if you permit us to! Thank you again for making this vacation so much better and making us feel at home. \""
12593295,92412864,2016-08-08,81314307,Marie-Line,Quartier assez excentré mais la maison est située à quelques minutes à pieds du métro (terminus) : 20 minutes suffisent pour se rendre dans le centre de Boston. Très bon plan pour les petits budgets ! Le lit est très confortable en plus :)
12593295,93633227,2016-08-13,76621410,Holly,"Rachel was an excellent host we really enjoyed our stay, the bed was really comfortable and it's a good location as it's just across the road from the subway! Thanks so much"
12593295,96577505,2016-08-23,33132368,Tj,"My girlfriend and I really enjoyed staying in Rachel's apartment.  The bed was extremely comfortable and made it hard to get up in the mornings. We had a private AC unit that made the room wonderful to sleep in. Her two dogs, Whiskey and Bronco, were very sweet, and we rarely encountered any roommates."
The apartment is about 5-7 minutes from the Forest Hills Orange Line T station so getting into and around town was easy. There were plenty of food options around the station as well. You are also a short walk from the Sam Adams Brewery through some really cool neighborhoods.,,,,,
We felt welcomed by both the roommates and the dogs. We highly recommend staying here if you are looking to save money and still feel safe and comfortable.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
12593295,99415768,2016-09-04,44172210,Steph,"This was my first time staying at an Airbnb and Rachel was an amazing host! She was very friendly and was flexible with us when we were delayed in getting in because of traffic. The room was well laid out and the bed especially comfortable. My friend and I felt right at home as she introduced us to her roommate and dogs (both who are very sweet) and even offered up her french press for us to use for coffee in the morning. We only stayed for a night, but found that the location was pretty great, close to a T stop and a quick car/Uber ride from TD Garden and downtown Boston areas. Overall, a great stay and would recommend to anyone visiting the Boston area."
11553697,66254843,2016-03-20,47657978,Fern,Toni was an accommodating and friendly host who provided us with info about the area and was easily available by cell. The house was spacious and very clean. The area is quiet and is ~15min walk from the nearest T that was a quick ride into Boston city centre. I would highly recommend this for those who want to explore Boston fully without paying an excessive amount to be right in the city centre.
11553697,68470757,2016-04-05,34110421,세광,"My family loved our stay in JP at Toni's lovely house. The second floor is adorable real life in Boston, and everything you could need. It's a perfect location to walk to main street in JP and beautiful pond. Our host were gracious; we appreciated her sincere efforts to share information. I would stay here again on next trip."
11553697,70517637,2016-04-18,15912326,Adam,"Great host with a nice space in a great location. Very close to Boston but still a quiet, quaint neighborhood. As long as your OK sharing 1 bathroom with your group, this place is lovely."

9813223,57326171,2015-12-24,48191931,Marie-Christine,Our stay at Victor's place was amazing!
As said,the apartment is tiny,but it is fully functional and really pleasant to live in. It was clean and Victor leaved us some food in the fridge in case we were hungry when we arrive.,,,
Also,it is really greatly situated with the subway at 2 minutes by foot. The neighbourhood is cute and is not too far from Harvard if you want to visit it (walk of 25 minutes).,,,,
Check in and check out were easy to do and Victor is really a cool and sympathetic host! He was also easy to reach by email during our stay.,,,,,
We'll certainly stay again in Victor's apartment if we return in Boston.,,,,,
"Thanks again for your kindness!\"",,,,,
9813223,57724845,2015-12-28,22984694,Junior,"I met Victor and it was really nice from him to wait for us since we arrived late at night. Really nice guy. I stayed in Victor's apartment for 4 nights and it's very cosy and warm. Really nice apartment. Well located and you have everything you need. It's very stylish and artistic, well put together and very original. Highly recommended. Just as described on the listing."
9813223,58922266,2016-01-05,43540507,Xinyi,Our stay at Victor’s place was wonderful.
Although the apartment is tiny,it is really sweet and functional. He left us some food and water and other essential supplies.,,,,
This apartment is really close to the subway and some really good Korean restaurants.,,,,,
We had really good time and will definitely choose his apartment if we return.,,,,,
"Thanks again.\"",,,,,
9813223,59584443,2016-01-12,51112520,Shelby,"Victor's place  well designed. The space is great for one person and is a little tight for two people, but its no problem if you are close with the other person. My favorite snacks and drinks were ready when I arrived as well as plenty of water. Great space for the price and you can't beat that its a 2 minute walk from the T drop off/ pick up station."
9813223,60824621,2016-01-28,13040999,Amy,"Victor was very attentive, flexible and welcoming. I truly appreciated his availability to show the apt prior to my mother arriving and flexibility in changing the dates to meet our needs. He had fruit and beverages available as a welcome gift. There was an issue with the plumbing, which was efficiently dealt with and Victor quickly offered a partial refund for the inconvenience of work men in the apt to fix the issue. The place itself is clean, warm and very accessible to many restaurants, supermarkets, transportation. The only minor annoyances were the noise level of at night of people coming in and out of the building (easily dealt with using ear plugs) and the key when entering the building would sometimes require several minutes to get it to open. Otherwise, wonderful stay."
9813223,62699606,2016-02-16,51072198,Darcie,"Close to the T and everything Boston has to offer!Vic is a great host, making sure we had personalized drinks and snacks and that we we felt comfortable in his space :) we had a fantastic stay!!! Bed is very comfy too!"
9813223,80497454,2016-06-18,998088,Mindy,"VJ's place was the perfect place for us. We weren't spending a bunch of time in, and it was a great location to grab an Uber or the T just steps away."
VJ was awesome! I've been doing Airbnb for a long time,and he's been one of the best hosts so far. The place is exactly as it looks in the pics. It's super efficient with space and quirky.,,,,
One thing to note is the bathroom is super small. It was totally perfect for my partner and I,but I would definitely say,if you aren't already,be prepared to get very comfortable with the other person. And finally,I would mention that the building is old,and to not be put off by the entrance
"We'd definitely recommend VJ's and stay again.\"",,,,,
716245,2625225,2012-10-15,1173880,Deborah,"Superb hostess. Excellent location. Very homey apartment in a safe neighborhood with a pond nearby. Shops/restaurants within healthy walking distance. Concerns for me were minor. There was no elevator to the second floor and walls were a bit thin, otherwise I certainly recommend Jane's residence."
716245,2779811,2012-11-01,3780524,Lina,Jane was very friendly and she was always there when we needed her!
The apartment was good,but under modern I mean something else !,,,,
It was reasonably cleaned !,,,,,
The parking situation was sometimes difficult,because after 4 nights you have to search after a parking lot on the street! And when you come later than 9 pm,you have to park farther away!,,,
Our visit was good !,,,,,
"Jane is a very friendly and nice person!\"",,,,,
716245,3321479,2013-01-10,4218619,Kfir,"We relocated to Boston and looked for a nice place to stay in until we find a place of our own. Jane's apartment was everything we looked for. It is nice, located in a quiet and safe neighborhood. Jane was very helpful and  friendly and did everything she could to help us. Recommended!"
716245,4180602,2013-04-16,4122303,Jackie,"Three of us stayed at Jane's place for 3 days in April 2013.  We had plenty of space and felt very safe the whole time there.  The train station was within walking distance, but it was a 35-45 minute trip to downtown. Jane was such a gracious hostess and made sure we had everything we needed."
716245,4871431,2013-05-30,3938483,Alexander,"Great location. Spacy apartment that was everything but modern. Some essentials were missing: no coffee maker, no microwave, no pots, and the TV didn't work. Also, we had to clean some of  the dishes before we used them for the first time. If you are only looking for a place to sleep and not much luxury the apartment will do."
716245,4963270,2013-06-04,5656453,Vadim,"Pleasure renting this 2 bedroom from Jane. She was very friendly and always there when we had questions. Also very convenient that she lives in the same building in-case you have any emergency like locking yourself out, etc."

The placement of the apt is apx 5-10 min. to the Boston Collage T station and T-57 bus station. So you can manage without car... The house is shiny,lovely and comfortable. If you looking for a language school,EF is around 3-4 minutes by walk.,,,
"We strongly suggest this house and family.\"",,,,,
716245,5382785,2013-06-27,780349,Maria Eugenia,Great experience!  Jane was really nice and the location was conveniently close to Boston College.  I would stay there again.

716245,7112176,2013-09-07,5804752,Didem,Jane is a perfect host! She is so friendly and ready to help every time. The apartment was super clean and we loved the balcony!!! Everything was great! I would  highly recommend  you all if you are searching for an apartment in Boston.
716245,7414723,2013-09-19,2986453,Dani,"Staying at Jane's apartment was nice. It had everything we needed The beds were o.k. and we were able to do laundry with Jane's laundry card and later reimbursed her for it. The kitchen has all the equipment you need for cooking, breakfast etc. There is guest parking available up to 4 days and Jane will give you the sticker for you car. The 'Boston College' T station is approx. a 10 min walk away and you can use a shortcut there. From here it will take you at least 30-40 mins to downtown! So plan in some more time. The apartment lies within a larger housing complex and is very quiet which is nice. In the morning you will hear the upstairs neighbors walking around. The apartment could have been a tiny bit tidier."
716245,7507517,2013-09-23,2307093,Claus,"I stayed a few days and although it is completely out of town, there is a tramway that takes you there in 30 minutes. Nights where calm and the appartment clean although pretty used."
716245,7627266,2013-09-27,437593,Cynthia (& Luke),"Jane's apartment was a great fit for myself, my husband and our three children. It's relatively clean and spacious enough. The kitchen is pretty small, but we never used it to make any meals so it was fine for us. Jane let us use her laundry card, which was super gracious of her. Jane was a great host and super easy to get ahold of."
716245,7742093,2013-10-01,2662572,Adele,"The apartment is located in a nice lakeside residential area also near the golf course. The apartment is conveniently located to BC and the T.  It was a pleasant 7 minute  walk to the T. There is a short cut to take which is easy to find in the day, Jane was helpful with pointing it out.  I suggest taking a cab from the BC stop,  if traveling at night, it costs less than $7. Jane and her husband were both helpful at check in/out. I arrived before 8am, and they were able to accommodated my check in time"
716245,7893685,2013-10-07,8921235,Kerrie,I was very thankful that jane rented her place last minute and was regularly in touch with me.  the place was clean and we had everything we needed.
716245,8041698,2013-10-14,8067562,Thomas,"My parents were visiting the country and I needed a clean, comfortable, affordable place for them to stay. Jane's place was this and more."
From the pictures I was expecting the wonderful decor and clean space but couldn't have predicted her hospitality. My sister had to take over communication with Jane towards the end as my work schedule had me tied up cross country; our parents flights were  delayed multiple times and we were in and out of the apartment multiple times. Through all this Jane remained courteous and understanding and put my parents at ease which meant the world.,,,,,
Thanks,"Jane!!!\"",,,,

It is definitely spacious and cozy enough for three adults (two friends and myself were running races around the Boston College area for a weekend) whose main mission is to run, eat, rest and repeat. The kitchen is equipped with necessary utensils for serving meals - we didn't cook but saw basic spices and herbs on the shelves. Jane replies to emails, calls and texts promptly and was very helpful with information regarding the area. Highly recommended!"

The apartment is beautiful, very clean with lots of space and very comfortable beds & a sofa bed. Jane is very warm and waited to receive us when we arrived. She also checked in with us everyday to ensure we were enjoying our stay in Boston. When our travel plans changed, she let our mom stay with us for a complimentary night! I'm very glad we chose to stay here. We now prefer staying at an apartment rather than a hotel! Thank you very much Jane! I'll definitely recommend this listing to others."

When I researched a place for the 4th of July weekend,"I saw this for $100 (or as AirBnB stated \"\"from $100\"\") which I didn't realize would turn into $185 per night by the time all the extra fees were heaped on.  At $100 to $125 or so this would have been fine.  When I saw the actual fees",I should have kept looking. In any event,AirBnB should be more transparent about fees.,,

Jane was very accommodating - she gave me the keys to the apartment early since she was leaving on vacation at the beginning of our stay, was easy to get in touch with, and even offered to mail us a charger that we accidentally left behind when vacating the apartment. I would highly recommend staying with Jane!"

Jane was very easy to deal with and responded promptly to questions. For parents there are two playgrounds within an easy walk and a grassy field and pond right outside the door!"

She was warm and welcoming and helpful with anything I asked for. We had an extended stay and it was nice to have a friendly face across the hall when our paths crossed.
The apartment was exactly as described and fully outfitted with all that we needed,including pots and pans,ice trays,plenty of sheets and towels,and a bunch of various shampoos and lotions that have accumulated.,

716245,45603135,2015-09-04,29891517,Luke,We enjoyed our stay in Boston and Jane and her husband Alex made it even more enjoyable.
Jane was very flexible to accommodate our weird tourist schedule the day we came into Boston. She had asked us to be there to pick up the key at 11 but we weren't able to come until 3. That flexibility allowed us to enjoy Boston a bit more as we were already in town.,,,,,

This was my first Airbnb and I was somewhat concerned about what to expect,but everything worked out just perfect. Couldn't have asked for a better first host than Jane!,,,,

The location was great, out of the hustle and bustle of the city, but still easy to get to! A quick 10 minute walk to the subway, or an easy 15-20 minute drive in."
Neighborhood was very quiet and calm,didn't have any troubles sleeping.,,,,
Jane was extremely accommodating and pleasure to work with! She was very communicative leading up to the trip,make sure I was squared away and all set. She even checked in during my stay,while she was out on vacation herself!,,,

She was very flexible about check-in time, met us personally at check-in, and answered all of our questions.  Of several Airbnb apartments where we have stayed, Jane's place was one of the most complete and best appointed with everything we needed.  Very spacious rooms and nice balcony patio.  Complex is quiet and the surrounding neighborhood is very nice.  Short (pretty) walk to Boston College and the T stop.   We would definitely stay here again."

Her unit is clean, spacious and located in a very nice area of Boston. The unit is furnished with everything you need for a comfortable stay. The WiFi worked very well. The building is a little old and noisy. You can hear residents in units above and below converse and walk around. Parking was a tad inconvenient."
716245,74396501,2016-05-15,12325861,Carlo,Our stay in Jane's condo was a great experience.  The beds were comfortable and there was access to a balcony from both bedrooms and the living room.  It was very close to Boston College and Boston University and the neighborhood was quiet and safe.
The hosts were so welcoming,"they even offered to drive us to BU's graduation ceremony when we said we were concerned about the parking!  We would definitely stay there again!  Thanks Jane and Alex! \"",,,,

The unit was clean and the WiFi worked well. Note that the unit does have A/C in the living room but not in the bedrooms. However, Jane does have 2 very nice large modern fans that we placed in each room that worked fine in keeping us cool."
716245,78073419,2016-06-05,48799205,Swarun,We had a pleasant stay in Jane's apartment. The apartment was well maintained and comfortable. Jane was very helpful and a great host.
716245,81294683,2016-06-22,8739887,Matthew Do,The apartment is as described.  Old but very clean and have everything you need. The host is very attentive and does everything to make sure you feel like home. The location is in a nice neighborhood right next to Boston College. Very residential and far from the city. Public transportation is about less than mile walking. Can be difficult if you travel with with the elderly.  We had a good stay and Jane had been great and responsive since we booked the apartment. Great internet access is a plus too!
716245,82205576,2016-06-26,74147155,(EMAIL HIDDEN),Jane was a brilliant host from start to finish she was always there to help if we had any questions. She was very accommodating. The apartment itself was very clean and spacious. It was also in an appropriate location as we were only a ten minute walk from the metro into the city. Overall we throughly enjoyed our experience and would highly recommend it.
716245,82913136,2016-06-30,10034885,Tyehimba,Jane's place was great.  Had to fly in for a funeral and her place was right near the neighborhood we needed to be in.

The bedrooms and living room all opened onto the deck,which was nice. Everything was just as represented on the Airbnb site. The kitchen was small,but provided all we needed. The living area was large enough for all of us to relax comfortably.,,,
Jane was very helpful. She took us to the laundry area,and showed us how to use the washer & dryer,and even gave us her pass card with $11 on it to use when we did our laundry.,,,

13218729,83061237,2016-07-01,34129447,Dennis,"The listing description was accurate and the place was exactly as expected.  Nice plus was the availability of grills on the third floor.  Only marked as 3 stars because 1) we had a day without electricity in the building and the next day there was no water, followed by very dirty hot water that had to be run out for 45 minutes or more.  Not the host fault, but the building.  I would not expect others to have the same problems."
10208321,82940290,2016-06-30,79738137,Jamie,"A hidden gem! Hongjin was a lovely host, and it was a pleasure staying with her. The downstairs room was cool in the humid weather and the house in a quaint, safe neighbourhood. Would love to stay with/host Hongjin again"

11896394,83368049,2016-07-02,13183826,Wen Chuen,Definitely not fit for 3 people to stay long term. Overall a decent place to stay for a short period of time and the photos are accurate.
11896394,84601097,2016-07-08,51116430,Devi,"In the beginning we run into problems in finding the keys and the apartment. Overall, the apartment was comfortable and pretty clean. The apartment is located on the 4th floor and there are no elevator"
11896394,87986553,2016-07-22,72563134,Alina,"The host responded fairly quickly to every inquiry that I had.  I particularly liked the location, just a one-minute walk to the train.  If you are on a budget travelling around Boston, I would recommend staying at this place to save money on a rental car."
11896394,91011463,2016-08-03,70123324,Francis,Good size room with hot water shower near to train station. A bit hot in the summer since it is on the top floor of a walk up apartment. Our experience could have been a lot better if the host could be more responsive and provide clearer instruction to find the key to the apartment.
11896394,91407535,2016-08-05,79566737,Haley,"It was perfect for our one night stay. good space, nice location. Host kept great contact with us and answered every question we had."

Pluses.,,,,,
-great location,,,,,
-good price,,,,,
-thank you for accommodating my early checkin,,,,,
Cons,,,,,
-lock didn't work and no one came to fix it until the next day. I notified the office well within normal business hours when the lock stopped working. Contacting me with what time the person was going to fix the lock would have been better than just having him barge into the apartment.,,,,,
-very dusty apartment,,,,,
-there was an odor that was unpleasant. Perhaps new carpet or none at all would help.,,,,,
-don't think it was mentioned in the listing that the property was a ground floor apartment.,,,,,
-some street noise and quite a bit of noise from remnants going in and out of the building.,,,,,
-the sheets need replacement. They are old.,,,,,
"-same goes for the pillows. They are terribly cheap. \"",,,,,
4020650,21664141,2014-10-21,5319091,Bob,"\"Very easy to work with and everything was as advertised.  Note that if you think you can stay in downtown Boston for $89 you aren't looking for 5-star accommodations.  Bernie's place worked well for me and I'd stay there again, but feel it appropriate to add some details to the description.  This is for one person, or two that need little room and have no modesty issues.  $89/nt should be the top price.  The furniture and condition is serviceable, nothing more, and it's clean.  The shower is small and the stall is about 18\"\" above the floor - you step up into it and the step down would present a challenge to a person with any limitations on mobility.  The apartment is street level next to the front entry to this brownstone"
4020650,21958829,2014-10-27,21063648,Kevin,I thought the place was great! Really easy to find and in an awesome location! The cost was fair although the place was a bit dirty.
4020650,22190118,2014-11-01,1700730,Wendell,Location is good.  About a 10 minute walk to the Prudential Center and a nice neighborhood though not convenient to public transportation or places frequented by visitors.
Please note the other reviews regarding the noise from other people who live in the building.  You can literally feel their foot steps as they walk by and haul their bags up the stairs.  Also,when the mailman slams the mailboxes shut as they are on the other side of the bed (loud noise made me jump).,,,,
Last note: there is no heating.  There is a hot water pipe that goes from floor to ceiling in one if the corners,but it was sufficient to overpower the draft coming in around the window-style air conditioner.,,,,
The place has clean sheets and towels as well as decent Wi-Fi.  Other than that,it was quite run down (mold in the shower door,missing on old dresser,cracks in the door jamb that you can see through,long blonde hair everywhere).,
In conclusion,as long as your expectations are properly set,the price is fair for the area.,,,

Fantastic,"safe location in a great neighborhood. I would definitely return.\"",,,,
4020650,22491349,2014-11-08,881066,Joseph,"Great location in Back Bay. It makes it easy to see the main sites in Boston and Cambridge. The place is as advertised. The only thing to be aware of is noise. This unit is beside the main entrance of the building and the walls don't offer much of a sound barrier. I'm a fairly deep sleeper but I was awoken both mornings I was there by the sound of the front door closing as people left the building. That said, at this price point (low) in this location (great), I'd still recommend the place to a single traveler that's looking for a no-frills option."
4020650,22752424,2014-11-13,21773644,Andrea,Sistemazione ideale per chi viaggia da solo e deve fermarsi pochi giorni a Boston!

La posizione è ottima: se vi piace camminare potete raggiungere comodamente tutto le attrazioni,"altrimenti le fermate della metropolitana sono poco distanti.\"",,,,
4020650,22886640,2014-11-17,3471761,Kevin & Yuan,This AirBnB is run by a fellow who also runs an actual B&B just down the road.  It is just about the best value you are likely to find in the Back Bay.
The place is very small but reasonably well appointed with a good shower,bathroom,and small kitchenette (no oven) but a fridge,counter,and cups.,
There were however a few drawbacks.  First,this place is street level and,although the street is quiet,it is very loud when people enter and leave the building.  The stairs go right over the room and it literally sounds like thunder when people climb them.  For sensitive sleepers,take caution.,
Also,its cold.  There is a pipe the provides heat,but it cannot compensate for the two large single pane windows behind the bed.  A space heater here would do wonders.,,,
There were a couple of other minor issues,two of which admittedly,had I brought up with the host would have been rectified.  First,the lock was broken and hard to use.  Second,the internet was very very slow - my cellular data was faster.  Third,parking in the Back Bay is VERY EXPENSIVE

It was very easy to pick up the key (the office is a few blocks down the street) and the staff was very accommodating (I arrived early and was able to store my luggage for the entire day until I was done with a conference).  The apartment itself is quite basic but had hot water and central heating - this was key as the outside temperature was in the 20's.  It was perfect for one person and is located within walking distance to many restaurants, cafes, shops, and museums."

4020650,25903855,2015-01-29,25346760,Carlton,"The description was for a very small studio.  With a studio I expected a cook stove, toaster, maybe a kitchen sink, and a fork, knife and a spoon.  None of those were included.  The description would  be more accurate stating a small room with 3/4 bath and a microwave and refrigerator.

Effortless arrival and departure. Bernie is a great host. I will stay here again when visiting this part of Boston."
4020650,28758857,2015-03-29,2043542,Judith,"Great location!! Walkable!  The place is small but the space is very usable.  Comfortable to sleep, eat and use the bathroom/shower.  The heat in the building went off at night (at about 9) and didn't come on till after 7 AM.  I believe this is not controlled by the host, but it was cold at night  (It was under 30 degrees F outside and snowy! ) I am guessing that Bernie would have been happy to supply an additional blanket had I asked.  He was responsive in general and answered e-mails in good time.  In the dead of winter, picking up the key could be inconvenient, but all in all, this apartment was a great deal, a big bargain, and was more than adequate, right in the middle of the city!  I would definitely stay here again!  Thanks!!"
4020650,29941892,2015-04-14,29188553,Pat,"The place was as advertised. It was very small, however, I didn't go to Boston to just sit inside all day. It was perfect for me. So if you don't plan on staying inside, this is the place for you. With in walking to some where as far as harpoon brewery but an even closer walk to some where like Fenway. It's in a great location. My only complaint is there is no way to control the temperature and the windows needed something to hold them up bc it got way to hot at night."
4020650,30107781,2015-04-17,6246018,Emmanuel,"The descriptions was perfectly accurate: small, clean room in a great location. The perfect crash pad!"
4020650,30459823,2015-04-22,24594014,Jon,"Well done! Clean, convenient, exactly as billed. Logistics of key pick up/drop off were easy. Would do this again."
4020650,30899474,2015-04-28,21063648,Kevin,This was my second time staying and it was just as good as before. Very reasonably priced and a good location. I would stay there again.
4020650,32003549,2015-05-12,14213106,Mark,It was located in an excellent neighborhood. Bernie was very quick in responding and very helpful.
4020650,32280526,2015-05-16,24551855,Matthew,Host was easy to deal with and apartment was in a great location.
4020650,33535336,2015-05-29,4046889,Nancy,"Studio was as described. Good location, easy to get around Boston."
4020650,33792037,2015-06-01,30381886,Mike,Description is accurate. Small space but in a great location. Good value if you aren't spending too much time in the room.
4020650,34791416,2015-06-12,33084704,Shai,"I stayed at Bernie's small studio for four nights during my visit to Boston. The studio was as Bernie described it, small but comfortable cozy and at an excellent location. My privacy was respected, and the interaction with Bernie was smooth through the app. I really enjoyed my stay at Boston."
4020650,39234911,2015-07-21,29334752,German,Es un cuarto pequeño en uno de los barrios más linds de Boston. Muy bien ubicado. El cuarto es un poco oscuro pero eso no importa si es que volves solo dormir. Cuenta con una heladera y un mínimo de vajilla.
4020650,39789015,2015-07-26,36178852,Tse Yuen,"I did not Bernie himself but we kept in touch through e-mail. The arrangements for check in and out went well. As the studio is associated with the Beacon St Guest House just down the road, I called in there first. On my last day, as my flight was late at night, I checked out early but left my luggage at the Guest House for the day. The staff at the Guest House were very helpful and obliging."
The studio is billed as 'very small' but I found it quite alright - I certainly did not find it cramped or claustrophobic. There is a big window - adequately screened from the road by plants.  I appreciated the bathroom and the airconditioning. The room is very quiet. The microwave and iron+ironing board also came in useful. The wifi is fast too.,,,,,
Excellent location - nice surroundings - about 10 minutes walk to Copley Station and the Back Bay stop for the bus to Logan airport outside the Hynes convention centre. Within about 5-10 minutes walk lots of restaurants,shops and cafes along Newbury Street. In the other direction,"one can easily get to the banks of the Charles River - pleasant to walk in the early morning or evening.\"",,,
4020650,43823431,2015-08-22,19106093,David,Second time I've stayed at Bernie's apartment. Definitely recommended (and will probably stay there again!).
4020650,45707692,2015-09-05,29712908,Timothy,"Bernie's place was great. A few blocks from the Copley and Hynes T stations. Great for short stays, and if you don't plan on doing any cooking."
4020650,46616641,2015-09-12,23371816,Shelley,Do not stay in this place.
My concerns started the first time I tried to contact Bernie after I booked. It usually took him more than one day to respond,but generally less than two. He would not give me information about how to get the key until a few days before I got there. He also did not answer all of my questions.,,,,
I had to get the key from a guest house,whose staff had never heard of him. It was a long walk with luggage.,,,,
The bottom sheet did not fit the mattress,there was long dark hair on the floor near the bathroom,the carpet had not been vacuumed,the shower head nearly broke off when I tried to adjust it,there was paint bubbling off the ceiling in the bathroom and when I went to use the towel,the towel rail fell off. It was very difficult to contact him about this - I went to the guest house to talk to him
When I eventually was able to talk to him,he became quite argumentative. I did not like his manner. His level of customer service was zero.,,,,
"The only thing this place had going for it was its location.\"",,,,,
4020650,47366111,2015-09-18,5316310,Aitana,"The apartment was tidy and exactly like the listing: a very small apartment, but an apartment in any case, not a small room with a microwave... it was perfect for my purpose.  The location is superb, next to the river and next to the center, in a quiet road. I arrived late and had to pick up the key from down the road, from the guest house. It is a short walk, but if you're carrying luggage and come by taxi I would advice to ask the taxi to take you there first, and maybe even wait for you and take you to the other place, especially if the luggage doesn't have wheels."
4020650,48417346,2015-09-26,3521149,Tony,"The description on airbnb is accurate, small stuido with essentials, comfortable for a good rest, boutique building with hige ceilig and wooden doors, keys pick-up at a guest house close to Mass Ave about three blocks from the studio. Steve at the guest house was really helpful in answering my enquiries and arranging check out. Had a nice stay in Boston"
4020650,48726287,2015-09-28,2270338,Hubert,"The keys were easy to pick up from down the street and the location of the apartment was ideal, central to Boston's main attractions. To me, it's important to point out that this apartment may not be for you if you are a bit more particular about the details of your temporary home. Everything in the apartment appears to be quite old and/or of low quality (i.e. a chair that feels like it's about to fall apart, a comforter that's noticeably worn, and sheets/pillows that are low-quality). I genuinely didn't mind any of these things given the low cost of the rental, but I'd like to warn inquirers because I know some people who would've been extremely uncomfortable staying at this apartment. If these types of details mean a lot to you and you can afford a slightly more expensive rental, you should probably stay away. Although I don't regret my decision, I'm disappointed that it seems like the owner doesn't believe in making small investments in the property to improve guests' experiences. It would cost less than $500 to make significant improvements which would go a long way for guests."
4020650,49234061,2015-10-02,42479941,Patricia,"la ubicación es muy buena, pero al departamento le falta inversión, no esta al nivel que pretende."
4020650,49643033,2015-10-05,27240057,Dan,"No problems at all.  Great location, very small, exactly as advertised.  I got in late, so I had to pick up the key about a half mile away.  Communication was just fine."
4020650,50109955,2015-10-09,17827592,Travis,Great location!
4020650,50635670,2015-10-13,41330988,Greg,"I enjoyed by stay at Bernie's studio.  Just as stated, it is a small studio really only suitable for one. Two individuals would fit but a little cramped.  As a single traveler it was perfect size for me and I didn't plan to spend lots of time inside.  The location is great! Walking distance to great selection of shopping and restaurants and to public transportation.  If you looking for shiny and new, this may not be the place for you.   If you are elderly or have accessibility issues be warned that there are several steps into the building (as lots of places in Boston do) and there is a funky step up into the shower."
4020650,52112933,2015-10-26,4272338,Tim,"The studio is small, but very well located in the lovely Back Bay. It was convenient and comfortable. As others have mentioned, it is as advertised and probably best for one person who is looking to get out and explore Boston. I look forward to my next stay. Communication with Bernie was easy, and when at the last minute I needed a late Check out - Bernie was able to accommodate me right away."
4020650,53894209,2015-11-14,10388239,Alexandra,"The studio is exactly as advertisd and it was just perfect for me - great location in Back Bay and only half an hour walking distance from MIT. It has all essentials that are needed. Just two minor issues: as it is an old house and the apartment is right next to the entrance, it sounds as if people are standing right next to your bed when they are entering or leaving the building; and I couldn't find anything to turn up the heating systems and felt a little cold most of the time (but I usually need it warmer than most people, so others shouldn't have much trouble with that). Would definitely stay there again next time!"
4020650,54162882,2015-11-16,6276808,Stuart,"The studio is definitely small, but clean and comfortable with nice add-ons, especially considering the size, including fridge, microwave, internet, and TV. The location is great and I would be happy to stay there again. Make sure to email/call ahead of time, since you may need to pick up your keys a couple of blocks away."
4020650,54875776,2015-11-25,46706180,Sidharth,"Decent small studio, exactly as described. Close to Hynes Convention Center, MIT and Copley. Keys are collected and dropped off two blocks away. Bernie's response is prompt and professional."
4020650,55728172,2015-12-05,4055496,Yijue,"Really nice location and convenient, clean, and cozy. For a single person stay in Backbay, this is the perfect choice."
4020650,67913426,2016-04-01,15224285,Manny,"As other reviews have mentioned, this unit is associated with a local guest house (where you check in/out). I never actually met Bernie, but he was prompt in email communication. Unit is small, and not the most fancy, but certainly comfortable enough for a short stay. It's more affordable than a hotel, and conveniently located for access to public transportation and interesting things in the city."
4020650,70682611,2016-04-19,25474623,Philip,The room is small as accurately described in the listing. the neighborhood (Brownstones) is killer.  5 minute stroll to shops and food. i had a great stay. thanks Bernie
4020650,72044129,2016-04-30,39311211,Matt,It's accurate that the place is very small essentially a single room with a very small shower room off one end but it fitted my needs well. It had basic appliances fridge microwave coffee machine enough to have some flexibility but not a full kitchen. It's in a great location in Back Bay within easy walking distance of the T with plenty of shops and restaurants nearby and an easy stroll out to the river. I enjoyed my stay.
4020650,75632875,2016-05-22,65515802,Tendai,The studio was a described in the listing and it is located in a very nice neighborhood in Boston. Check-in and check-out was smooth and host was willing to accommodate my schedule for the stay.
4020650,77888441,2016-06-04,41955161,Sarah,"The listing describes the apartment very accurately. The unit is small, but quite workable. The main reason to stay here is the neighborhood! It was absolutely adorable and tons of shopping and restaurants near by! Obviously you get what you pay for here, and while the unit has plenty of towels, cable TV, and internet, the connection is slow and the construction/furniture is a bit rickety. I also didn't notice if this was mentioned in the description but the unit is on the 1st floor with the large windows looking out to the street. There is a large hedge in front of the window for some privacy, but it still made me feel a bit uncomfortable. Overall quite satisfied with this unit though and the location is great."
4020650,78081480,2016-06-05,1676003,Patricio,"A little confusing on how to get the keys, apartment is enough, and location is perfect."
4020650,80106992,2016-06-16,27032790,Ben,"Accurate description - this is a smaller studio apartment, situated in a fantastic location minutes walk from the city hubs.  Grocery store is nearby, as are several excellent restaurants. Quiet area with minimal traffic so a restful nights sleep."
4020650,82336938,2016-06-27,4272338,Tim,A second great stay - very convenient location!
4020650,86211385,2016-07-15,3676701,Margo,"This little apartment was a good spot for my busy work travel in Back Bay. Bernie was responsive and easy to deal with. Note: the bathroom doesn't have a real door, so better for 1 guest or 2 very close guests."
4020650,86707188,2016-07-17,4763182,Michael,The listing descriptions accurate and the host was accommodating to last minute changes of my itinerary. I would gladly stay at this location again.
4020650,87926262,2016-07-22,37995936,Ingrid,"\"The apartment was pretty close to \"\"as advertised.\"\" Very small"
4020650,90972399,2016-08-03,50162416,Hector,"Todo es como describe el aviso. El check-in fue muy fácil. El apartamento está muy bien ubicado. Lo único que debe mejorar es la señal del WiFi, es muy débil."
4020650,91270272,2016-08-04,14498070,Mathew,"For budget stays close to Copley, this was a good choice.  It's a bit of a walk if you're carrying bags, especially if you need to pick up the keys, but otherwise the studio was definitely convenient, the space is perfect for one person, and I appreciated the free wifi.  It could use a little freshening up, but it worked for my little business trip. Thanks, Bernie!"
4020650,92140778,2016-08-07,55982342,Carina,Location was perfect! Would definitely recommend this place.

4020650,95132801,2016-08-18,1819540,Jessica,Good location for conference at the Sheraton in Boston.  The place looks a lot better than the photos provided on airbnb :)
4020650,97404324,2016-08-27,4027988,New,This studio is in a great neighborhood. Worked out really well for me with the local shopping and access to the T line so I could get over to the financial district for work. Bernie was very responsive to questions and providing details as to the key pickup/drop off
8422876,47595891,2015-09-20,4952923,Carlos,Gustavo is a great guest. He is very kind and allways disposed to help with recommendations about places to visit or restaurants. The place is well located and the room is comfortable. I will recommend anyone to stay at his place
8422876,48236705,2015-09-24,9228404,Ruben,Great Location and host. Gustavo was an amazing host.
8422876,48456843,2015-09-26,44357005,Rob,"Gustavo was great. Due to my schedule I was always in and out of the room at odd hours but Gustavo was very accommodating and  prompt in responding to emails as well as anticipating what I may need. The room was very nice, and the location was equally as so. You are about a 5 minute or less cab ride from the city itself."
8422876,48800909,2015-09-28,15391658,Ann,"Gustavo was a gracious & thoughtful host. He was happy to give dining recommendations, was timely responding to messages, & kindly helped us w/ public transportation questions. The room was quite comfortable & really is the perfect location for a stay in Boston near the heart of the city. We would most definitely stay again!!"
8422876,49512949,2015-10-04,44385362,Kevin,"Upon arrival, we were greeted by Gustavo who was very friendly and helpful. The accomodation was great. Large room in a very elegant home in a wonderful location. Just 10 minutes walk to downtown, we could not have asked for a better location. The continental breakfast of freshly baked scones (biscuits) was very welcome. We will definitely stay here again on our next visit to Boston!"
8422876,49834079,2015-10-06,29796748,Jess,He followed up multiple times to make sure I had all the info I needed. He responded very quickly and left an envelope with all other info I'd need while I was there on the desk in my room. He's very willing to help you out in any way he can. I ran into him one time and he was very nice.
8422876,51577142,2015-10-21,1768895,Ed,"Gustavo's house was really comfy, clean and tidy. Gustavo was really helpful on arrival, with eating suggestions for the evening, and although I didn't see him till I left, it was a very pleasant stay. The house is ideally located for everything in the city, and I was able to walk all around. If I come back to Boston, I'd definitely consider staying again."
8422876,52437788,2015-10-29,15349148,Reeves,"Although Gustavo and I missed each other having varying schedules, he was super flexible, helped me out with an ironing board when I needed it in a pinch, and definitely made me feel welcome. I'd highly recommend staying here. The place itself is awesome, lots of colonial character, really makes you feel like you've entered a portal into the 18th century."
8422876,53000424,2015-11-03,46619296,Louise,Perfect location in the middle of Boston and a lovely room. Gustavo is a great host - there only when you need him and a helpful source of useful information.
8422876,53518300,2015-11-09,31617272,Karen,"Our visit to Boston included a very nice, large clean room.  We shared a bathroom with the resident across the hall but that did not cause any problems whatsoever.  We never even saw each other. The sounds of the city were pretty quiet.  Gustavo, the owner, greeted us soon after we arrived and provided us with tips for local meals and gave us some historical background about the area. We kept in touch via texting and email as needed and Gustavo was always available if we had questions. Breakfast was self serve in the upstairs kitchen which was fully stocked.  We also had access to the living room area. This area of Boston was very convenient for us and the T stop was a few minutes walk.  We would be happy to return in the future."
Gustavo kept our luggage safe for us on the day of our departure and we were able to come back and retrieve it with ease on our own time schedule.  There is no television,(if that is an issue for you. It wasn't for us).,,,,

I was in Boston for the coldest weekend of the year, so it was so great that everything was within 1-3 blocks or 2-5 mins walking (bars, restaurants, theaters). Room was professionally clean but felt very homey. We met Gustavo twice and he gave good recommendations for nearby hot spots. Gustavo was also very responsive. I texted him a 10pm for a request and he replied right away.  Oh did I mention how nice it is to wake up with a continental breakfast prepared (coffee!) without having to venture out in the cold? Def recommend."
8422876,64637421,2016-03-06,39659461,Candy,"Gustavo's Inn was a wonderful place to stay. The location is great and very close to the T, restaurants and shops. Very happy we booked here and I would definitely stay here again if I come back to Boston. Gustavo was a great host and made us feel at home and comfortable and was very knowledgeable about the history of the house and the area and gave us recommendations of restaurants."

I would strongly recommend this listing to anybody hoping to see Boston. Very close to a T station and you can be downtown in no time at all. A great spot!"
8422876,65896796,2016-03-17,25111393,Helen,"Gustavo was very helpful giving us the history of his beautiful Victorian home & area and recommending sights to see. Provided us a list of great restaurants to try. Great location near Chinatown, theatre district, back bay train station and Boston Commons. The foam bed was fabulous and the place was very quiet! Nice to have a common living room and kitchen and continental breakfast."

Communication with him was super easy and quick! The room was perfect,  very comfortable, cute and clean.

Gustavo was easy to communicate with and made me feel welcome showing me around this narrow 4 story home reflecting the neighborhood's history and charm. My room was very comfortable with a clean bath in the hallway. This was my first time renting a room only. I also enjoyed having coffee and meeting other guests in the kitchen on the 4th floor. Highly recommended place!"
8422876,71030428,2016-04-23,17001057,Kevin,"Good place -- clean, very convenient location, nice people. Best if you don't mind stairs, since this is a Bay Village townhouse with four floors and you'll need to go up and down to get in/out and reach breakfast, which is on the top floor. Ask for the room with the private bath."
8422876,72544615,2016-05-03,47967461,Yiping,"Gustavo is very nice and the house is in a great location. He provides a lovely continental breakfast if you reserve in advance. The shared bathroom is very convenient because there is a bathroom every floor, so you will share it with few people actually. The only inconvenient thing is the laundry, we have to go to the public laundry room across the street."

8422876,89338548,2016-07-28,56424107,Simon,"What a beautiful & historic inn, and such a great neighborhood! This Bay Village neighborhood is perfectly located between Back Bay and Downtown, with a Charlie/Metro stop just minutes away."
Gustavo has a lovely 1800s brick house and his upgrades make it a great place to stay for modern travelers. Key pickup & dropoff was a breeze,as was wifi access and kitchen access. His top floor kitchen & sitting room were a nice perk! AC was great for the high 90s heat and high humidity of Boston.,,,,
"While it lists as a \"\"private room\"\" this felt closer to an inn than a house. We had direct access to the bathroom outside our door and with a full bathroom on all three guest floors",there was never a wait for toilet or shower.,,,,
I highly recommend Gustavo and his Bay Village Inn! He's an accommodating and kind host,"and his effort shows in the quality of experience! 6 Stars! \"",,,,
8422876,91472950,2016-08-05,16424794,Kevin,Great stay at Gustavo's. He was a considerate and friendly host and it was a well maintained older townhouse. Thanks!
8422876,92655495,2016-08-09,21104643,Gladi,"Gustavo's place at 11 Fayette was ideal -- a lovely room in the perfect location. Almost felt as though we were in Paris! We were comfortable walking everywhere. It was close to everything but located on a quiet, sweet street. Gustavo was responsive to our questions and needs."
8422876,99637458,2016-09-05,89775515,Jacqueline,"The room was what was depicted and more. Loved the decoration. It had a very nice, vintage, feel to it. Lots of travel books on the shelf to read. Bathroom was very clean, and everything in the house was very organized. The location is pretty much as good as you can get. Walk-able to distance to all the great sites, and close to subway lines. Gustavo was very thorough in explaining where to go, and we hit up many of the places he recommended. You can tell that he knows, and love Boston very well. Will definitely recommend!"

The night before we left I got a text checking in just to see how everything was and that was it.  Apartment was beautiful, roomy and very well stocked.  It was also convenient to everything.  I think everyone that stayed will go back next time they are in Boston.  Thanks so much for a fabulous weekend."

The apartment is spacious,bright and has everything to make the experience enjoyable. While there was a minor issue at the beginning of our stay,"Hamed was concerned and diligent to resolve it. 100% recommended.\"",,,
1551205,13747320,2014-06-03,9978034,Nicholas,"The host was great as was very responsive and also let us leave our luggage in the unit until 3PM on the day of checkout as we had a late flight out on the final day.  The host checked in via text message to make sure everything was ok and we didn't need anything.  As for the unit, it was very clean and well maintained.  There were towels waiting for us when we got there.  The only con to our group was the beds were very hard in which some people like that, we all prefer much less firm beds.  The master bedroom receives a lot of light in the bedroom in the mornings due to light colored blinds so if you are affected by this bring a sleeping mask.  The unit was great and would stay here again if make it back to boston.  Location was perfect walking distance to Fenway, great restaurants, and shopping.  The North End was also within walking distance (approx 40 min) on a nice day."
1551205,16068690,2014-07-21,13390570,Sean,"The spacious apartment is well appointed, and in a great location! On a practical basis, a number of supermarkets within walking distance allowed us to get the necessary supplies. Lots of shopping and restaurants nearby as well. It was very comfortable too for when the family felt like staying in and watching a movie. Not to mention that Hamed is a very gracious and accommodating host! As others have said, he followed up to make sure everything was OK soon after we had checked in."

1551205,17349258,2014-08-11,12736699,Jacqueline,"We are a family of 5 and were very comfortable at Hamed's listing.  The apt. is beautiful and very well situated to access all the touristic sites.  Very close to the subway, Fenway Park as well as all the wonderful shops and restaurants in the Back Bay area.  Hamed made it very easy to check in/out.  Thank you for an easy, relaxing, fun stay."

Strongly recommend!"

1551205,20491718,2014-09-30,14088940,Mariya,"First of all, the unit is absolutely gorgeous. When we walked in we could see all the across the unit to the floor to ceiling windows with a beautiful view of downtown Boston. There are dark hardwood floors throughout. It is very contemporary, which we look for whenever we travel. The building is at the west end of Back Bay so you are within easy walking distance of Fenway, as well as all the shopping and dining in Back Bay. There is a subway stop in the bottom of the building so it's super convenient to travel around Boston. Both bedrooms have queen size beds. We made ourselves right at home using the things in the kitchen and watching TV. The guest bedroom has no bedroom window. I didn't mind this as I like it as dark as possible when I sleep, but I didn't want to spend any time in there during the day. The living room was so comfortable, I didn't want to be in there anyway. Both bathrooms are roomy and the guest bathroom is right across the hall from the guest bedroom while the master bedroom has it's own bathroom. There is a washer & dryer in the unit. There is a secure entryway with concierge. We never asked for advice but most of them were very friendly. Hamed was in contact with us throughout our stay, making sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. We would definitely stay here again. We have absolutely no complaints and felt like this checked all of the boxes in what we look for in a vacation home."
1551205,20626026,2014-10-02,284147,Jordana,"We had a last minute business trip to book and Hamed could not have been more accommodating. He hustled to make sure the apt. was cleaned and ready in time on a very short turnaround. He checked in with us every step of the way to make sure we were comfortable and happy. The whole process was super easy! The apartment itself, WOW. VERY spacious, clean, comfortable,modern,  well equipped and the location was incredible. The layout was perfect for 2 people with ample private space for each of us. All around a fantastic apt. and location! I plan to stay here again and recommend it for both business and personal travel to Boston."
1551205,21228344,2014-10-13,5068093,Raul,"This apartment was amazing. The size was unbelievable and the finishes are very nice. The Back Bay neighborhood is great and the T, which is the Boston Subway line is pretty much in the same building downstairs, just amazing. The neighborhood has cute unique eateries and coffee shops, as well as your staples of Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks and also great shopping. If you are here for baseball, you can walk to Fenway Park in like 10 to 12 minutes. Hamed was out of town but kept in touch via text and was very helpful with any questions we had. I would recommend for anyone trying to find a place in Boston in a great area, walking distance to pretty much the whole city."

Hamed was incredibly accommodating for a last-minute request. The place is beautiful, clean, and in the perfect location. As an Airbnb host, Hamed is top notch. Made us feel as though we were staying at a friends house. I highly recommend and would absolutely stay here again!"
1551205,22632564,2014-11-10,23122249,Caressa,"Being right on Newbury street, This two bedroom apartment couldn't be in a better location. The apartment itself it so spacious and comfortable. I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay or a better host while I was in Boston! Hamed was wonderful, he was quick to respond and even worked with me on a last minute booking and delivering an item I left at his place after my stay. Hamed was very accommodating with cold refreshments upon our arrival in the fridge and follow up after we arrived to make sure everything was to my liking! Truly a great apartment to stay and Hamed was an amazing host!!"

The location is very central so we basically walked everywhere, and if you don't want to, the T is right there. The apartment itself is beautiful with nice views and a great kitchen."
1551205,23392202,2014-11-30,20894528,Diane,I'm from the area and lived in Boston for 6 years so I think I can say with some authority that Hamed's place is absolutely the best location in Boston. The view from the apartment is much better than what is shown in the photos.  I hosted my family at the condo for Thanksgiving dinner (I asked in advance if this would be okay) and everyone had a great time; not every host would allow their place to be used in this way and I really appreciate that Hamed agreed to it.  We really enjoyed our stay  here.
1551205,28027715,2015-03-16,28346512,Meghan,Hamed was a great host. He made everything about the stay easy. The location is very convenient to everything we wanted to do.  I would recommend his place to anyone staying in the Boston area. I will definitely be back.

1551205,29878882,2015-04-13,30352395,Eric,We enjoyed our first Airbnb stay at Hamed's place over a long weekend in Boston. Hamed was a great host. Open communication with Hamed made it easy to check in/out and ensured that we had everything we needed during our stay. He took genuine interest in making sure that we had a positive experience from the moment we booked with him. It is a beautiful and spacious 2 bed/2 bath with a great view and is located in a fantastic area of Boston. Everything we wanted to see was either an easy walk or short rail/taxi ride away. Thanks Hamed!
1551205,30377698,2015-04-21,525428,Sandra,"Hamed was a wonderful host. He was very responsive in our communication leading up to and during our stay. He was also very welcoming, stocking the fridge with beers for us to enjoy. He made check-in and check-out seamless. Best of all, he accommodated my late check-out request so I had time to get a shower and some down time in after finishing the marathon and before heading home!"
The apartment is as gorgeous as the photos suggest. Very modern but still quite cozy and comfortable. The space is large enough for two couples to enjoy with plenty of privacy.,,,,,
The location could not be better,the shops and restaurants of Newbury Street are literally at your doorstep. For our purposes,being there for Marathon weekend,we couldn't have been happier with the location. Steps from the Convention Center and five minutes from the finish line.,,

We had access to the whole apartment, which was awesome.  Very cool place to stay, nice amenities, very homely and chic.  Nice view of the city and pretty cool location - about a 10 min walk from shops in Charlestown, and a quick Uber/Lyft to downtown Boston.  Good parking on weekends in front of building."

Oak floors and natural light predominate. A tight oak spiral staircase descends to the large main bedroom, tiny single bedroom and bathroom. The dual french doors from the bedroom open to the courtyard. Two blocks away there are numerous restaurants, pubs and convenience stores. 3 blocks away is the subway, with Copley Square at 5 blocks.

The apartment is just beneath their first floor so you can hear the footsteps above but during the evening and throughout the nights, the place and surrounding neighborhood are very quiet.  Depending on where you want to go, it might take you awhile to get there (the closest bus stop is less than a 2 minute walk though).  It's at least 40 minutes by bus (have to take two buses) to downtown.  The heart of JP is a 25-30 minute or so walk away but there are restaurants and grocery stores within a 15 minute walking distance.  Kelly and her family are wonderful people and I enjoyed sharing a couple evening meals with them.  Kelly was very flexible with my checkout time.  I would definitely stay again and recommend it to others."

We felt from the very beginning that we were arriving to our home. Kelly and Jason made us feel welcome, comfortable, and free enough to enjoy the apartment with privacy. The place is great to rest and relax after a hectic day in the city, and big enough to enjoy its different areas. You can have the best granola with yogurt on the dining table, or taste 'Seattle's best coffee' on the couch. The bedroom has a comfy Queen bed with fairly new beddings, the restroom has a nice size, relatively new towels and the kitchen has new appliances as well."
I cooked a couple of times and I was pleased to see I had a functional kitchen just for myself! Taking into account other amenities,the Wifi worked pretty well for us during the time we stayed there,and the house is 10 minutes walking distance of the Forest Hills station.  Then you can take the orange line and go wherever you want in Boston. You can also take a short ride to the ponds and arboretums that are nearby the Jamaica Plain area.,,,
I definitely recommend Kelly's apartment. I have a feeling that not only I had the opportunity to spend some time with my airbnb host,but I had the opportunity to meet a new friend!,,,,
I'm very grateful to met such amazing people. Thank you guys,"and thanks airbnb!\"",,,,
1030500,5461815,2013-07-01,6567575,Brian,It was great to have our own space.  EXTREMELY comfortable bed.  Family very pleasant and accommodating.
1030500,5927959,2013-07-22,1648531,Charles,"I really can't think of a bad thing to say.  Kelly and her family were out of town when I stayed there, but we organized a good place for the key, and then I had a nice little place to hang my hat in Boston.  It's quite close to the Forest Hills T stop (10 min. walk), so you can get into the city just fine.  Really for the price, a private bathroom, it was a good deal at a time when all the Boston hotels were fully booked.  Would gladly stay there again when visiting Boston"
1030500,5936180,2013-07-22,1089634,Stuart,The reservation was canceled 27 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1030500,18782894,2014-09-01,13473074,Kristina,"We stayed in this apartment for a month while house-hunting in JP, and I would definitely recommend it to other AirB&B'ers!"
Pros: The hosts!  Kelly,Jason,and their son are a lovely family and very friendly.  They are great to hang out with,but also give you your privacy.  They definitely went above and beyond as hosts go,inviting us out with them and letting us borrow odds and ends when needed.,
More pros: The apartment is pretty spacious - you have your own entrance and bed/bath/kitchen/living areas.  The bed is large (queen) and very comfortable.  We stayed during the summer and even without AC it was never too hot.  The neighborhood is very quiet and friendly,and you can easily walk or bike to the bus or T to get around.  Street parking (no permit needed) was right outside and never a problem.,,,,
Cons: There aren't too many cons to think of,however,being a basement the space can get a little damp and musty.  The kitchen has all the basics,but if you are there long-term and planning on doing a lot of cooking you might need some extra supplies.,,
Overall our experience was really great.  This apartment is very centrally located,and a great value for a private one-bedroom.  Kelly and Jason,"thanks again for a great stay!\"",,,
1030500,19860295,2014-09-19,654864,Natalie,"This was a last minute same day booking. Kelly was extremely accommodating. I enjoyed having the entire basement apartment to myself. Place was spacious and very clean. Although the area is not commuter friendly, its only a short Uber/Taxi ride to downtown Boston. There are no eateries within walking distance however the host did provide a variety of delivery menu options which I was very thankful for."
1030500,19910056,2014-09-20,21299754,Pierre-Luc,The apartment was perfect for us. Very clean and nice bed. Nice basement suite with everything we needed. The neighbourhood was nice and quiet. Fairly close to the train station too.
1030500,20392849,2014-09-28,20057466,Nelli,Wir haben 2 Nächte bei Kelly übernachtet. Das Apartment ist recht groß und ist alles dabei was man benötigt. Die Verbindung ist auch machbar (ein 10-15 min Weg zur Metro oder man nimmt den Bus Nr. 32 zur Metro) Alles in allem ein super Aufenthalt.
1030500,20765766,2014-10-05,11248120,Bob,"We spent two days in Kelly's space during a recent trip to Boston. Kelly was wonderful, her apartment was private and comfortable and included it's own private entrance. Parking was safe and plentiful and the neighborhood was interesting and offered easy access to public transportation.  I highly recommend this space to fellow travelers."
1030500,22179692,2014-11-01,17594284,Vivian,"We really enjoyed staying at the apartment. It was cozy, especially the bed. The apt had everything we needed for our 3 weeks stay, e.g., cooking utensils, hair dryer, to make us feel like home. Bus to the T station (5min ride) is around the corner, so it is quite convenient. Would definitely stay there again next time."
1030500,89795852,2016-07-30,82495764,B.A.,The description was accurate. We had helpful advice from both Kelly and Jason.
1030500,90559629,2016-08-01,86415853,Michael,"A private apartment conjoined to the house. Private entrance, near a bus stop. Walking distance to some restaurants, bars, co-op, and the arboretum. Nice hosts. Would recommend."
1030500,99477716,2016-09-05,79524425,Larson,"Was great to spend a month at Kelly's while we were in between houses, quiet roomy and clean environment, also a great safe neighborhood."

14673441,98036414,2016-08-29,24875282,Josh,Jessica and Jacob were great hosts who were very accommodating. Their apartment is gorgeous and in a prime location.
6881541,42327187,2015-08-12,39710475,Tracy,My family and I enjoyed our weekend at this very clean and comfortable apartment.  The unit was stocked with necessary items and the porch was an added benefit that we didn't expect.  The host was very responsive anytime I reached out with a question.  I've stayed in other vacation rentals and this was by far the best experience I've ever had.
6881541,42938012,2015-08-16,39935049,Zizhao,The room is clean and comfortable. The location is about 10 min to the metro station.

It suited our needs perfectly, and Jenny was very responsive -- she made herself readily available before and during our stay.  The location was good, too.  We didn't use mass transit, but it was easy for us to jump on and off the highway headed into Boston/Cambridge."

The listing was as we expected and the description was detailed and accurate.   There were plenty of extra towels and bedsheets,the appliances were brand new,"the beds were comfortable and the kitchen was well equipped.  We would definitely stay there again if we visit Boston again.\"",,,
6881541,48571405,2015-09-27,42335439,Scott,"The home was exactly as describe. The downstairs apartment was so quaint, comfortable and beautiful. We really enjoyed our stay.  Having this place to relax and to retreat to after a long day of touring the wonder city of Boston was great. Ubering and the T line was our transportation of choice.  It was all so very convenient from our Dorchester location. We couldn't not of asked for a more amazing place to stay and really enjoy the historical feel of Boston."

6881541,56998721,2015-12-20,28640411,Chardline,Thomas and Jenny's home was amazing.
Although we did not get to meet them,they assured us they were a phone call way.,,,,
The neighborhood is very quiet but is surrounded by many amenities such as CVS,Chinese Food/Vietnamese Food/Italian Food/Stop and Shop/Bowling Alley's etc.,,,,
The home looks EXACTLY as described and is fully stocked with common household amenities. It was very spacious and had ample off-street parking for all 5 of us.,,,,,
Lastly,Jenny and Thomas were able to accommodate our late check out as we had to wait for our airport lift.,,,,
We are so grateful to Jenny and Thomas for allowing us to rent out their place. We would recommend this place to anyone!,,,,,

6881541,70705795,2016-04-19,27714847,Jess,My family and I had a great stay in Boston.  Jenny and Thomas sent us excellent information for the place and were more than willing to answer any questions.  We would definitely stay here again!
6881541,71466265,2016-04-25,49706007,Fahim,Thomas and Jenny made sure everything was perfect. They also emailed asking how everything was. It was great. The location is perfect! Close to the airport and Expo center which was the reason I was visiting.
A great place to stay.,,,,,

6881541,75637967,2016-05-22,7546328,Joanna,"This was a great place for a group. Very clean and nice, with a great porch. It is about 30 mins to take the t into Boston however, and there were no paper products. We had to buy our own toilet paper and paper towels. Other wise great!"
6881541,76496097,2016-05-27,17304947,Nancy,"Host was very welcoming. Willing to care for any issues that arose. Neighborhood was nice, busy street in front."
One issue- 6 of us overnighted two days and only 2 rolls of toilet paper provided. We ran out and had no access to purchase any nearby.,,,,,
Plenty of towels provided; clean house,except floors were dirty. Our white socks proved it.,,,,
We would return to house if visiting Boston,"but not Cambridge; traffic was terrible. \"",,,,
6881541,77285018,2016-05-31,60081911,Gerry,"What a lovely home!  Very well-appointed, comfortable, and clean.  Easy access to Boston (less than 10 minute drive).  We were in town for my niece's Christening in nearby Milton.  Thomas & Jenny's home was the perfect place to relax after a full day of events followed by a fun day of sightseeing in Boston.  Easy parking onsite was a HUGE bonus.  Street parking would have been a challenge for our large SUV."
6881541,80436417,2016-06-18,45545714,Troy,"My coworker and I really enjoyed staying at this house. Though it was 5-10 minutes out of Boston due to traffic, it was pretty perfect for what we needed and provided a quiet rural escape from the city after being there all day. The house was clean when we arrived and the bed sheets felt clean. There was some old fruit in the fridge that we promptly threw away. One thing we really appreciated though was how easy it was to park because it had its own parking area in the front of the property."
The gripes: the TV in the kitchen area didn't work when we got there (we didn't notify Jenny because we were at the house pretty rarely and because the TV in the living area worked fine; eventually we determined it was a mis-positioned IR emitter). The other gripe would be that when someone is staying in the upstairs unit,it can be VERY noisy since the floors are wood and aren't insulated from noise. That means that either late at night or early in the morning you'll get woken up by extremely loud footsteps,rolling suitcases,or whatever. Thirdly,we noticed pretty immediately that there was an odd smell in the living area of the house; we think it may have been the smell of natural gas.,
Other than that,the neighborhood is cozy and quiet. There's a really good ice cream place down the street called the Boston Ice Cream Factory that was tasty. Overall,I would recommend this house,but would hope they fix the odd gas smell,"which is gross as well as a little concerning. \"",
6881541,81040558,2016-06-20,15059695,David,Great experience! Everything was seamless and hosts were available if there were issues. There were none.

6881541,86722683,2016-07-17,43896611,"Angie, Thi Ngoc","two men who pretended they booked the apt in second floor with the host Jennifer. THey asked us to give them access to the main door because they have the secuty code for second apt. I checked the code number on their messages.  I refused to give access. I called and texted the host around 9:30-10:00pm. Two men stayed in front of the main door until 12:30 pm. The host said that the code that I mentioned was given to a another previous guests but he reset this code already. Around 12:30, a group of guests 12-15 persons came to the apt in second floor. I saw two men left the place. I messaged to the hosts about this between 10:00-12:30 pm. They didn't answer back.  Two young men tried to get into the main door. We didnt feel secure in this stay. The host give security code to main door and inside apart door to us. Safety is important to guests."
6881541,88003209,2016-07-22,39952032,Colleen,This vintage home in Dorchester was recently updated and the amenities were as described.  Thomas & Jenny were very responsive hosts and the stay was comfortable and perfect for our needs.

11758169,69849829,2016-04-14,64032637,Richard,Julie was great host and incredibly responsive! The place is clean and very recently updated. Beds were really comfortable. The common areas are a little small but it was a perfect place to stay while we were visiting colleges in Boston. The only downside to the area is it can be difficult to find overnight parking on the street without a resident sticker. Other than that everything with our stay was great.
11758169,70415027,2016-04-17,50374032,Kayla,I stayed at this listing for 2 nights with 5 of my girlfriends.  We came to Boston for a Bachelorette weekend and the house was amazing!

She also provided great recommendations for restaurants and shopping."
The location is quiet -- a good place to retreat after a long day exploring downtown and Cambridge,which are only a short uber ride away. It's also walkable to Boston Commons and the Freedom Trail; less than 2 miles.,,,,

The area was safe and an easy walk to the seaport district. The closest T station was around a 15 minute walk. You definitely get the taste of being more like a local in this area which I loved.  The space was clean, and the beds and twin fold out bed were very soft and comfortable. The space is accommodating but small for a larger group, but this is expected in such a popular area of an urban area. Perfect for coming home to at the end of a long day exploring the city!"

The kitchen was a little small, but we didn't really use it except to store a few things in the fridge.  Generally, the accommodations worked well for us."
The neighborhood is quiet and charming.  The location might be a little farther out for first-timers planning to catch all the regular tourist sights in the Back Bay etc. areas,but we Ubered practically everywhere and that worked out great for us.  We used the T once--about a 10-15 minute walk to the station. But for those who have seen all the usual sites,South Boston would be fun to explore further.  We didn't eat in the area,but there seemed to be many interesting places to try.  We did discover a couple of great places for coffee and pastries.  P.S Gourmet Coffee has an amazing selection of iced coffees and mochas,and Broadway Pastry and Coffee Shop had beautiful pastries.  Both good for a quick,light breakfast.
Julie was a wonderful,welcoming host,"allowing us to store our bags upon arrival and for a few hours after check-out.  She was extremely responsive and gave us plenty of tips and recommendations.  Thanks for helping to make our trip such a great one!\"",,,

The pictures are an excellent representation of what the house looks like. Plus, we found out the owners donate their profits to charity."
My only recommendation for anyone renting this house is do not come with a vehicle. Parking is virtually impossible in the area surrounding the house. We had a rental car that we ended up returning early because we could not find any place to park it. We ended up taking uber everywhere. Uber was cheap and really convenient.,,,,,
But other than that,"the house was great. We would definitely stay there again! \"",,,,
11758169,98587723,2016-08-31,53330232,M,Julie was really helpful and friendly all the way through and even helped by enabling us to leave luggage with her on check-out day as we had a late flight out. The place was exactly as described and in a good location with central Boston and transport hubs easily accessible. If you plan to stay in Boston and are a group of 4 or even more I'd be surprised if you find better quality and value elsewhere.
13391054,86007053,2016-07-14,72112661,Dave,The place was clean and presented exactly as listed. I enjoyed my short stay. Khuraam did everything he could've to help me - a great host.
13391054,88788014,2016-07-25,25042744,Edgar,The place was very clean and looked exactly as the pictures showed. The communication between myself and Khurram was impeccable.
13391054,91115386,2016-08-03,11130844,Martin,The apt was perfect and Khurram and Nadia were perfect host! We had a realy nice week and would totally recommend this appartement as it is comfortable and located in a great neighborhood!
13391054,91471245,2016-08-05,45378286,Drk,Very nice communications with the host. Good neighborhood. You can Eide a rental bike along Charles River to downtown and it is close to Harvard.
13391054,96372451,2016-08-22,10499496,Callen,"My parents were visiting from out of town, and this was the perfect place to stay! It's clean, comfortable, and close to everything we needed. I have to say I was especially impressed with Khurram and Nadia as hosts. They were easy to communicate with and were understanding and accommodating of last minute schedule changes. I would recommend this place without hesitation, or any other place Khurram and Nadia post. Thank you for everything!"

8814039,61380447,2016-02-03,6202515,Laura,"Great spot!!  Couldn't ask for more comfortable accommodations - it really is your 'home away from home'.  Add a killer location and the reasonable rate, especially for a group stay, and this was an amazing value.  Check in was super easy and we took advantage of every bell & whistle we had time for (the gym, patio, kitchen, huge closets, snacks and coffee, and more)"
8814039,88919927,2016-07-26,84985237,Thays,"\"This condo was ideal based upon the size and location.  The condo itself is spacious with spectacular views of the city.  It was accessible to a \"\"T\"\" stop and in walking distance to the North End.  Plus the on-site amenities such as the pool are great when you just want to relax and take a break from walking.  I would highly recommend for either a family or group of friends for either a family vacation or girls/guys long weekend.\""

9507164,80773033,2016-06-19,5694465,Luis,Unfortunately  the room did not look like in the picture. There was barely any space next to the bed. When we arrived the thermostat was set low (other guests were complaining too) and the sheets and towels were stained. No one was reachable so we had to wait until the next day. All our concerns were addressed but the stained towel was just replaced with another stained one.
"Other than that the place was clean and the common areas are organized quite nicely.\"",,,,,

13433317,88156574,2016-07-23,25842857,Charlie,"Lovely little flat that was clean and looks very much like the pictures with one double bed in one bedroom and a single bed in a second bedroom off a small study. Ana kindly left milk and cereal in the fridge so we didn't have to forage for food while jet lagged.  She also dropped us off an iron (we were travelling for work) at very short notice which was really helpful.   The flat is a  5-10 min walk to the T so we didn't have any trouble getting around, and if you're tired it's only 8-10 dollars to catch an uber from the centre of town."
The neighbourhood is very noisy since it is so close to the airport and there is also a fair bit of traffic noise from the road so it might not suit you if you are a light sleeper. There also isn't a lock to the front door of the building the flat is in (I don't know how standard that is in America),which means someone could come right up to the door of the flat on the top floor. This felt a bit exposed and might have worried me if I was travelling alone. Given there are only two bedrooms,one with a single bed,it would be quite a tight squeeze for 5 people.,,
"We also had a bit of trouble with the air conditioning but that should be all fixed by the time the next person visits. \"",,,,,
13433317,90578851,2016-08-01,43490893,Maureen,Ana was a very helpful host. Apartment is 10 minutes walk from the Blue Line which takes you into Boston. Good for a short city break.
13433317,91044040,2016-08-03,80303354,Adrian,"The apartement is located in a nice neighborhood very close to the airport, which was perfect in our case, because it was the last stop on our roadtrip. The apartement was very clean and we didn't miss a thing. Ana was very welcoming and always available if we had any questions."

11454728,76685278,2016-05-28,28751265,Zhihui,"The apartment is nice and clean. But the management was not as professional as I wished. I confirmed the arrival time with them, TWICE, before arriving; but still, we were standing at the front door for an hour before the concierge finally let us in. I called the company a dozen times but didn't get the problem solved (they offered a gift card to apologize during the conversation, which they never sent as well..) I was disappointed and hope that they could improve their services."

The reasons are simple - 1) Reservation made 8+ weeks in advance.  2) The day prior to arrival, I had to contact Beantown to request arrival details. 3) At that point I was notified the original place (near Fenway) was not available, and they had another place for us (2 couples, 4 adults) in a less desirable part of town (Seaport, far end).  4) after asking all the qualifying questions about the \"\"new location\"\" we reluctantly agreed to the move.  5) Upon arrival we found a nice place"
11454728,80988998,2016-06-20,64969295,Josh,Fantastic place to stay for a game (or two)!!!
Spent Father's Day weekend at the NE Suites with my old man and couldn't have hand picked a better locale,"better amenities and better \"\"crash pad\"\" for us!  Conveniently located next to practically everything from a CVS",a Whole Foods,a Target not to mention all the food and drink near Fenway.  Highly,"highly recommend!\"",

11454728,98800255,2016-09-01,29482112,Dawn,"The apartment was clean, the building nice.  The best part of this place is the location!  Especially if you are in town to watch some ball games.  Super close to restaurants, bars, and right at a T stop.  One possible negative, if you are on the side of the building with the T platform and the train running by, as we were, it can be noisy.  Didn't bother me but I could see it being a problem for some people."
13713713,84852159,2016-07-09,4175600,Sergio,Bret was really accommodating and very responsive. My flight came in really late and he was able to make it work. Great spot with amazing views.
13713713,86433179,2016-07-16,36352413,Andrea,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Bret's place! It was such an easy check in, Bret was very responsive and the place was absolutely stunning and very close to all of the restaurants in the seaport."
13713713,88671482,2016-07-25,53836201,Lauren,"Just spent the weekend in Boston with my husband and dog, and Bret's apartment was the perfect place! Very clean and tidy, a comfy bed, strong wi-fi, and enough space that it was a pleasure just to hang around during our downtime. The whole building is really nice and hotel-like and seems really new, and it was easy to find. Bret responded quickly to all my questions, and was super helpful with recommending parking garages (we went with Necco St Garage about a 10-15 min walk). The neighborhood is new so it's not nearly as busy or loud as downtown, and it was a great place to walk the dog in the morning. For fun, Harpoon Brewery is only a few blocks away, and there are seafood restaurants everywhere as well as a concert pavilion. Downtown was about a 30 minute walk. We would definitely stay here again!"
13713713,90273686,2016-07-31,39131430,Mónica,Bret was incredibly helpful. He was always available to answer to my questions and made sure that everything went well. The location of the apartment is amazing and the apartment is perfect. Will definitely stay here again.
13713713,92439865,2016-08-08,616965,M.H.,"This is a brand new building with terrific location.  It is steps from the Silver Line stop which, if you care arriving from airport, is free.  The building itself is very safe, with 24 hour front desk and security features.   The seaport district of Boston is a new trendy area of this great city.  It is a short walk to the convention center and quick metro ride to other parts of Boston.  If using Lyft or Uber, the cars all arrived in minutes and  were able to pull right up to the front door.   There are lots of new restaurants, at all price levels, near the waterfront and there will soon be more shops which are now being built.   Bret was a great communicator and is a new Airbnb host.  He was very flexible and since he was out of town, we were able to communicate closely by text thereby quickly answering all questions I had.    It would be great to stay at his place again."
13713713,94638048,2016-08-16,7184791,Matt,"Bret was a great host, the apartment was top notch. The location couldn't be better. It is right next to the subway stop and the convention center as well as many restaurants. I would recommend Bret's place to anyone. It's 5 stars in my opinion."

93505,274864,2011-05-22,353796,Suesan,"Owner is very sweet and helpful.  He was very open to our recommendations for changes.  There is one double bed and one twin, so realistically, it sleeps three.  There is also a twin air mattress, but there isn't really a carpeted spot to put it so it would be a hard night's sleep.  Apartment is part of a three story home, so access is to whole house, not apartment.  Cannot lock up your area, except from inside apartment.  Easy walk to the T (community college on the orange line), which takes 3 or 4 stops to get you to most of town and stations where you may change to other lines."
93505,279390,2011-05-24,565415,Barbara,"Joe is a gracious host and very accommodating. We had the whole second floor. It is an old Victorian, so if you enjoy history this is a great place to stay.  It is only a few blocks from the Bunker Hill Monument. It served our purpose of needing a place to stay near Boston for the weekend as it was college graduation weekend in Boston. We would stay there again."
93505,288604,2011-05-30,167243,Larissa,"My family loved staying in Charlestown, and Joe was a wonderful host. He is very friendly, and my parents, especially, got along with him especially well. Even though I lived in Cambridge for 4 years, I had never really seen Charlestown and think it was great to stay there and take public transportation to Boston (highly recommend the ferry ride) and Cambridge."
93505,304791,2011-06-08,670630,Maria,Joe was definitely a life saver. Arrived in Boston to find just about every hotel in the area fully booked. I had never been to Charlestown but both the area and the home were just wonderful-reminded me a little of East Providence. After regularly staying it hotel rooms it was nice to stay somewhere that felt homey. I didn't get a chance to connect with Joe much but he made himself available if I needed anything. Also the bed was incredibly comfortable. Would highly recommend to others.
93505,319477,2011-06-17,117954,Jonathon And Emily,"Joe was a fantastic host, very kind and generous. The place was lovely (flowers were an especially nice touch).

93505,323157,2011-06-19,709918,Navya,We really enjoyed staying in this cute apartment. Joe is an incredibly hospitable guy and even went out of his way to show us around Charlestown. The apartment is very homely and welcoming.

Joe has told us tons of stories about Charlestown and other local places, events, gave us a lot of recommendations etc. Joe is the person you need when visiting new city, he is insider and local. Joe is the man in Charlestown!"
93505,359544,2011-07-07,442833,Roberto,We had fun staying at Joe's traditional victorian house. Charlestown is a very quiet residential area nevertheless very convenient location for walking downtown. Joe is a very friendly host.
93505,364035,2011-07-10,193335,Danielle,"Joe was an extremely friendly and accommodating host. He was very helpful in allowing us to stay late on the final day and even offered up his parking space for us. He kept our fridge stocked throughout the stay and was full of local knowledge. The apartment itself is a lovely place to stay, very interesting and elegant and in a nice neighbourhood. It is conveniently located for visiting both Boston and Cambridge.  I would definitely recommend Joe and his apartment when visiting Boston."
93505,418993,2011-08-04,626144,Richard,"We really enjoyed our short stay in Joe's house and in Charlestown.  Joe made me, my wife and three children feel very welcome.  We'd had real trouble getting somewhere to stay for all five of us, even though the kids are all young, but Joe let us all squeeze in  - not that it really was a squeeze in this large apartment."
93505,428307,2011-08-08,683513,Juan,Joe seems to be a great guy and was very helpful the night that we arrived.

93505,439967,2011-08-12,601688,Bryant,"Joe's place was comfortable, beautiful, and in a nice neighborhood. Joe himself was also a great host -- he was friendly and helpful and he even showed us around the Charlestown area! Would highly recommend this property to other travelers. My only warning is that, although this property is close to the downtown area of Boston (called the North End), it is somewhat (but not overly difficult) to access the Harvard Campus by public transit. So if that is what you are looking for then perhaps you should try something closer to Cambridge proper."
93505,446669,2011-08-15,836934,Christopher,"Joe was a great host.  He was very accommodating and very knowledgeable about the area.  His apartment was spacious and inviting.  The fresh fruit and bagels were an excellent touch.  The place was a very short walk to an orange line T (the subway) stop and a local ferry.  Taxi rides were usually around 10 bucks from anywhere downtown.  Boston is a great city to visit, and Joe's apartment is a great place to stay."
93505,474238,2011-08-25,853910,Jennette,"Great location and great accommodations.  Location in Charlestown was within walking distance to Bunker (Breed's Hill), the Constitution, the ferry to downtown Boston and also to a grocery, post office and liquor store."
We were a little surprised at a couple things. We hadn't read the description carefully (or had read too many and were confused!) but had expected a kitchen. Also,"the description says it's an \"\"entire home apartment.\"\" Space-wise it is",but for each bedroom to have access to the bathroom,the doors must be open that lead to the middle stairwell used by the apartment above and below (front door of building secure).  Joe gave us a key to the front door. To lock the apartment,use the slide bolts on the inside of two doors and the master lock on the outside of the other.,
The rooms really are nice and comfortable - old and cool,,,,,
Joe was more than hospitable. He was very flexible with our unknown schedule for arrival and helped us find a parking space for our car (not easy!),,,,,
We had bought 3 lobster in Maine to cook for our dinner. When we realized our mistake in expecting a kitchen,Joe amazingly offered to let us use his kitchen. All 4 of us ate a wonderful dinner while hearing stories of Boston and Charlestown!,,,,
We very much enjoyed meeting Joe,"our visit and our stay - thanks to Joe for a great place and info of the area\"",,,,
93505,491801,2011-08-31,1029657,Norma Jean,Joe was very kind to accept my last minute booking request. The apartment is in a great location a short walk from the subway. {Community College stop}. Make sure you take the ferry over to the heart of Boston as Joe suggested $1.79 one way. Thanks to Joe we had a great short visit with plenty of room for the three of us. The personal touch of Joe makes the difference. I would deffinatly stay again'
93505,505789,2011-09-06,823531,Adriana,"Joe was a great host, very considerated, when we arrived with my friends he went to the harbor with us, to show us where to take the ferry downtown. Besides, his apartment is superbly located, just half an hour walk from downtown Boston, so in the evenings we just walked back. We had a great time in Boston."
93505,527098,2011-09-13,549371,Pablo,It is so simple to write a review of our stay at Joe Bianco's victorian house... It was WONDERFUL and you should stop looking for any other places.
Joe was a extremely caring host. He was genuinly interested in our affairs and was quick to point any useful info he could think of.  He is a real townie,so expect him to be proud of his neighbourhood and active in its preservation.,,,,
The house itself is a magnificent piece of 1875 and you can smell the old wood. You get the entire 2nd floor so it's like you own an apt up there with everything handy.,,,,,
Boston is just a 20 minute ferry trip away from this Charlestown house so the location is quite remarkable.,,,,,
We are a couple that likes safe,clean,quiet paces as our basecamp and this place met all of our requirements,plus we had a attentive host,Joe,who made us feel a bit like home.

On our check out day, our bus departed at 10pm at night, and Joe allowed us to stay around and leave our luggages in his house till 8pm. He spent time to talk with us; shared about Boston history, the surrounding, and his personal life experiences. What a great host! I highly recommend anyone who would like to travel to Boston, to stay in his place. If I were to choose, the cleanest and nicest city to roam around in USA is Boston (at least better than Washington DC, New York, Philadelphia, Miami)."

We had a great time and cannot wait to get back to Boston!  I went with my mom and sister - ages between 23 and 56 - we all were extremely happy with our accommodation,and what Boston and Charlestown had to offer.,,,,

The location was about 5 minutes walk to the Orange line T stop and the neighborhood seems very safe with a grocery and liquor store nearby.  The place was very roomy and comfortable.  It is an older place, but the beds were comfortable.  Joe was very gracious and he actually took us to the airport at the end of our stay.  The only down side of this place was that there was no wireless internet available on site and the TV was an older type with somewhat limited channel selection, but if you know that going in, it is not a big deal."
93505,653458,2011-10-22,658013,Eerik,Joe was a great host. His place is classic (very authentic Charlestown) in an excellent location!

I would happily recommend anyone stay with Joe.  He has said that he is about to renovate the kitchen area and add heating which will only improve what was already a great stay.
93505,692908,2011-11-05,999580,Sarah,The apartment was really big and Joe even bought fresh flowers. There was fruit and everything you needed for a good breakfast already in the fridge.

93505,1290984,2012-05-16,2208857,Steven,"Joe was an amazing host. He is really generous. He went out of his way to help us, even offered to drive us to the airport. My family had a great time staying in his place. Thank You"
93505,1333939,2012-05-23,738059,Jessica,"Joe was very nice and helpful. My family loved staying in his apartment. He provided us with tips on where to eat and was very thorough in answering questions. The apartment was cute, clean, and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this place to friends, family, and other airbnb travelers. Thanks so much, Joe!"
93505,1382229,2012-05-30,2058838,Alex,"This apartment is located near the finest portion of Bunker Hill residential area. It can be quickly and easily reached from Boston Intl airport by public transport, if your luggage is light and you are physically fit of walking for a short distance uphill. The apartment is charming and spacious. When you are there, do not forget to visit the famous Warren Tavern, it is just within a short walk. As a host, Joe is great! He knows Boston well and can tell you interesting stories about different parts of the city. On the day of our departure, Joe kindly offered us a ride to airport. All of us were satisfied for this stay."
93505,1426615,2012-06-06,2243476,Philip,"This is a great place to stay. We met up with another couple for a long weekend. There was plenty of room for the 4 of us and we felt like we got a much more thorough Boston experience than a hotel would have given us. Thanks to Joe's recommendations, we were able to live like locals. Totally relaxing space, excellent host, great location."
93505,1439880,2012-06-08,21948,Ritesh,"Fantastic stay in Charlestown. Joe is awesome.Perfect host. He lives up on the third floor. Genuine, helpful and kind. He stocked the fridge for me."
Apartment is near Bunker Hill,15 min ride by cab from Amtrak Back Bay. 2 bedrooms in a gorgeous old house that joe's Grandmother bought,and he is lovingly restoring. Kitchen Bathroom all clean.,,,
Just plain Awesome ! Wil book again during my next trip and hang out with joe to here his stories.,,,,,

93505,1465788,2012-06-12,1424675,Mark,"The host Joe is the true star of the show here rather than the accommodation. He goes out of his way to make your stay  a memorable one. From making sure we had bagels for breakfast to dropping us off downtown on our last day, Joe is the perfect host. The apt is good value for money if in need of a little updating. The living room is splendid especially when the sun comes pouring in in the morning and the bedrooms are quite acceptable. The diner/ kitchen area leaves a little to be desired. There is no sink so you have to wash all your crockery and cutlery in the bathroom sink. The bathroom itself is a little old- fashioned and we struggled to get a hot shower at any time during our 2-day stay. That said, we enjoyed our time at Joe's place and would have no qualms about booking the apt again. Charlestown is a lovely part of Boston even if it is some way to the downtown district with all its tourist attractions. On the other hand, it is close to Boston's North End district and its clutch of fun Italian restaurants - old- style Italian plenty of atmosphere. Mark"
93505,1507906,2012-06-18,2392891,Heath,"Absolutely fantastic stay. Unfortunately, it wasn't me, but my husband and my in laws, fresh off the plane from Italy, had such a wonderful time. They said the house was cozy and comfortable, the location amazing, and Joe a lovely host. Thank you! I am sure we will be back."
93505,1531072,2012-06-21,2549267,Nancy,"Joe is a kind and gregarious host who went out of his way to help us get where we needed to go when we came to town to take my son to his college orientation.  The space, the second floor of a rowhouse, is very clean and fitted with everything we needed; though it doesn't have a full kitchen, there was a small hotplate, a coffeemaker and a small refrigerator stocked with a few handy essentials, and a well-thought-out supply of utensils, dishcloths, etc.  The space opens on to a stairwell leading up to Joe's living space on the third floor--it's not possible to close it off 100% as if it were a completely separate apartment, and this might be an issue for some potential guests, but we were fine with it.  We loved staying in Charlestown, which was quiet, safe and very charming, and only a few minutes' walk across a bridge from the North End (in fact one end of the Liberty Trail was very close to the apartment).  A great stay, and Joe is a wonderful host!"
93505,1573530,2012-06-27,1991986,John,Had a great stay in a great neighborhood. Perfect place & perfect host. Highly recommend
93505,1628309,2012-07-04,1575683,Laura,"My parents and I stayed at Joe’s place while we were in Boston for a wedding.  Even though the house is older, the place was very clean and in a great location near to the T and to groceries, liquor store, pharmacy, restaurants, etc.  Joe was even kind enough to drive my parents to the wedding and also drive us all to the airport the day we left.  The only thing that didn’t work out for us was the lack of wifi, but I think Joe had mentioned that that was being fixed ASAP.  I would recommend this place for the ease of access to Boston and the great host!"
93505,1643722,2012-07-06,2672511,Andrea,"Setting the stage:  With two young teens visiting from Germany, we had a LOT to explore in a short period of time. Not only had we been invited to celebrate the 4th on the harbor... we wanted to get in some serious sightseeing the day before."
In a way,we have nothing with which to compare as this is our first AirBnB experience but Joe went out of his way to make it work for us: communication was easy,he provided walking maps and plenty of direction.... even walked with us in search of pizza one night and made sure the boys had car snacks for the way home.  Oh... and when he learned how we wanted to spend our day Joe also offered to let us drop our bags and pick up our key before check-in time. (He was still doing the changeover but this was a HUGE help to us.),,,
"The apartment is described accurately -- comfortable and homey but not \"\"plush\"\" -- much better than a hotel when traveling w 13-year-olds",,,,,
Also,"the location worked VERY well for us.  If you have the opportunity (and the weather) take the \"\"T\"\" ferry from the ship yard to the aquarium... although walking past the Bunker Hill monument and on through the North End is pretty awesome","too. \"",,,
93505,1764776,2012-07-21,2350632,Robert,"Joe went above and beyond for us.  In addition to being a gracious host, he offered to drop us off in town as he had to run an errand in that direction at the same time.  The house is lovely... spacious.  We had more room than we knew what to do with.  Would easily accommodate 4 people.  There's a kitchenette that he stocks with milk, water, bread, eggs, bagels, yogurt and fruit!  We couldn't have been more pleased and we've told everyone about it that we know."
93505,1787778,2012-07-24,371625,María,"Joe was an excellent host! I stayed with my family for three days and it was by far the best place where we could have stayed. The house is lovely and it fits perfectly 4 guests, it s very spacious. It has two rooms, a living room and bathroom. It also has a place to cook if you want to, and the best of all is that Joe keeps it stocked with milk, coffee, bagels and juice! Also, Joe gave us a ride to Harvard and then, on day we were leaving, to the train station very early in the morning. He was always ready to give us recommendations about where to go and telling us about Boston history."
The location is great too. The nearest T station is just few blocks away,the neighborhood it beautiful,it is very near to Bunker Hill Monument and there are a lot of restaurants and markets nearby.,,,
"Thank you for everything!\"",,,,,
93505,1811274,2012-07-27,2453447,Marie-Chritine,"Our experience at Joe's place exceed our expectations. We felt like we were part of Boston for a few days. Joe was a geart host, he made us feel comfortable right away.  We would recommande to anyone."
"\"",,,,,
93505,1835531,2012-07-30,2363714,Tara,Staying at Joe's place was a wonderful experience.  Joe goes the extra mile for his guests.  He is very friendly and fun to talk to.  It was great meeting a  Boston native who had great suggestions for our stay.  He even took us to Harvard and to the airport.  The accommodations were adequate and the location is awesome.  It was easy to walk to downtown Boston and convenient to the T line.  Also really appreciated the breakfast food he provided.  We would definitely stay here again if we make it back to Boston.
93505,1885627,2012-08-04,2947992,McKinnon,"We had a fantastic time in Charlestown.  Joe's comfortable, very clean, and roomy place was perfect for us.   Everything we needed was there, from fresh breakfast foods to a great collection of tour guide maps and books.  Just the right blend of comfort and down home relaxedness.  Joe was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed his insider tips on where to go.  (Really great location, within walking distance of the Freedom trail, Bunker hill, The Constitution,ferry, North end, and public transportation.)  We highly recommend staying here!"
93505,1990777,2012-08-15,2095870,Byron,"Not much to say to add to the great reviews listed here already.  We had a great time in Boston.  Joe was great.  The location is excellent.  We were there for seven days, so had a chance to explore the neighborhood, which is not tourist oriented.  Rather it is where people live.  We felt safe there, and there were enough shops to meet our needs. (A unique Morroccan restaurant was discovered, by accident - great food)  Access to the T and to the ferry was handy. Joe's description of his place is right on. He has provided a space that maintains the character of the housing's heritage.  The newly renovated one bedroom on the lower floor is beautiful!  Our group (two couples) occupied the two bedroom second floor.  While not quite as comfortably appointed, it was more than adequate and Joe was attentive to our needs.  I would highly recommend this place and this host.  Just be aware you are not  checking into the Hilton.  Then again, if you are looking for the Hilton you probably wouldn't be cruising this site looking for a bargain.  Charlestown is a good place to stay, and Joe is a host who cares about his clients.  His personality and his place contributed greatly to a memorable holiday.  The long term cost is going to be the annual price of a stamp, as we now have a new friend added to our Christmas card list.  See you again Joe - maybe for attendance at some college hockey games next time.  PS - loved the accent, eh!"

93505,2248490,2012-09-10,3067787,Patty,"Joe was the best host we've had with AirBNB so far.  He did everything possible to make us comfortable, including helping us find parking, suggesting transportation options and providing milk, juice, coffee (sorry we didn't eat the bagels, Joe!).  His place is very spacious and comfortable and was perfect for my husband and our two adult daughters."

The kitchen/dining room and separate sitting room were great places to relax and the bathroom was perfect for our needs. The location of the apartment was great - walking distance to several great pubs and restaurants, a nearby laundromat, and the start of the Freedom Trail. It was conveniently located a quick walk from the train station and several bus stops (not to mention the ferry). Joe himself was very warm and welcoming, and full of tips and advice on Boston. He lives on a separate floor of the same house but was always happy to pop in for a chat or to provide assistance or directions when needed!"
93505,2390647,2012-09-24,133835,Dell,"The apartment is in a good neighborhood and is conveniently located to Boston. Joe is interesting and pleasant. The pictures shown for the 2 br  unit are of the 1 bedroom unit downstairs,  The 1 bedroom unit has been redone and is nice.  The 2 br unit upstairs has not been redone and is very funky. Reminded me of my college living apartment.  Pictures are not shown for the 2 br unit. In summary, 2 stars for the 2 br unit.  I would give 5 stars to the 1 br unit"

He was going to take a break and not have anyone stay that week ( so he told us later) but felt for us as we had been in New York with no power for 4 days. Joe is an extremely welcoming, kind and generous host. He left us coffee, eggs, bagels and fruit to name a few. The house is lovely old world  charm and he has plenty things to look at around every corner. The beds were super comfy also and it was so quiet. Yet, it was so close to the North end which has great Italian restaurants. We LOVED our stay in Boston. Our only gripe. It wasn't long enough! We would definitely recommend for a short or long stay. Joe also dropped us to the airport. Which was a nice touch.  Come visit us down under Joe. We would love to have you stay with us.  You are a great conversationalist!"

Joe is a great conversationalist and we had so much fun chatting with him during our short stay. He also left us plenty of breakfast items so we didn't have to go out shopping for them, which was a really nice touch!

Nestled in a quaint and quiet little neighborhood, just a couple blocks from Bunker Hill, the place is also only a 15 minute walk or ferry ride to the lively North End.

The space was clean and well maintained plus the extra touch of a few toys and games were already in place for our little one as well.  Really enjoyed the building and our time there.
93505,7454134,2013-09-21,5456943,Beth,"We stayed at Joe's for two nights - two adults and our two teenage boys. Joe's place perfectly suited our needs. Great amount of space and an easy walk into town. Charlestown is a beautiful area. Safe and clean and a lovely community feel. Joe adds a very personal touch with bagels, milk, eggs and even a bottle of wine left for us. There are limited cooking facilities - enough for breakfast and simple meals. Great to have things like a hair dryer and soap provided. Joe was very friendly and is the type of Airbnb host  that makes the experience so much better than a hotel. I wish we'd stayed longer. We'd recommend at least three full days in Boston - fabulous city. Thanks Joe for your generosity."
93505,7767286,2013-10-02,6512803,Linda,"Joe was very accommodating!  He gave us directions and suggestions of places to go and how to get around from his place.  We were also surprised with a stocked small fridge and fresh bagels from a local place.  We weren't expecting this at all!  There was plenty of room and we felt this place was a good value, but it definitely seemed in need of a good deep cleaning."

93505,7847212,2013-10-06,7464409,Art & Marion,"Our accommodations were just what we were promised with a few surprises.  Joe left in our 'kitchen area' a bottle of wine, everything for coffee, fresh fruit and flowers.  He thought of ways to make our home away from home welcoming.  He took a sincere interest in us as guests by sharing as much with us about Boston and his neighborhood as we needed to make our stay easy and enjoyable.  We delighted in his story telling and always gave us personal space to be with each other.  Thank you , Joe.  You gave a personal feel to our Boston visit."

The location in Charlestown is perfect. Walking distance to Boston, a whole foods and CVS. If you have a car, your best bet is to park it in the Navy Yard Garage. $22 per day. It's staffed 24 hours per day. It's about 10 min from there to get to Joe's. We parked it and didn't use it until we left Boston."

93505,13063559,2014-05-19,11666565,Oliver,"This apartment was just perfect for us. The location right at the beginning of the freedom trail and close to the navy yard was ideal. We were two couples and a little baby and Joes place had enough room to hold us comfortable. There was a breakfast available with muffins, milk etc, which helped us to start the day. We were not missing anything. The neighborhood is really quite and on the weekend we even found a parking spot right in front of the door. Joe is a very nice guy who gave us lots of tips for Boston, starting with which way to drive best to where to find the best ice cream. To sum it up, we would go there again for our next visit in Boston."

The location is great for seeing Boston.  One bedroom has AC, the other is equipped with a large fan. We could visit Bunker Hill monument and USS Constitution easily. We took the ferry over from Charlestown to the downtown and used the subway there, all convenient.  A taxi from Back Bay was about $9.  There is a Whole Foods about 5-6 blocks away with other stores, drug store, liquor store etc.  Joe is a knowledgeable and friendly host who helped us with details like getting gas and parking and getting to the airport.

93505,16466091,2014-07-28,15952190,Priska,Joe's apartment is located near Bunkerhill Monument. It's a good starting point to walk into town or take the ferry . The place is quite spacious. For 4 people the  bathroom might be a bit small. And there is permanent access from the stairs to the kitchen and the bath which could be a bit uncomfortable. Joe is a very helpful host. He gave us good advice and even a lift to the airport:-)

The area was also peaceful with lots of transportation methods to get around. The orange line and Hubway bikes are just steps away as well as the ferry to downtown Boston.
Joe was a very kind host and really went the extra mile to help make my family stay enjoyable. Since he was going out of town on the day my family arrived,he allowed me to pick up the keys the night before so I can pick up my family and get to the apartment on our own. I bet every other guests who had stayed at Joe's place would agree that he is very welcoming and friendly. No wonder that his guests left so many warm greetings from all over the world to him in his place (Joe dedicates a whole wall by the stairs to allow guests to leave their marks). My younger sister left a greeting from Vietnam as well. Thanks for everything Joe.,,,,

In all respects, he took very very good care of the four of us. The host provides you with everything you need for breakfast, so that we prepared our breakfast whenever it suited us best. You can cook your own meals there. The upper floor apartment is perfect for a family, with 3 rooms, a kitchen and a bathroom. The first floor is perfect for two persons. The beautifully renovated Victorian home is in a quiet and safe residential area of Charlestown, which has two important points of interest on the famous Boston Freedom Trail. Legend  has it that a neighbor's house once was a station of the Underground Railroad... There are shopping centers and a historic tavern from the times of the Revolution, all within walking distance. You can easily walk across the bridge into Boston ( 15-20 minutes to the North End and further stops on the Freedom Trail) or take the T (subway) anywhere downtown. Absolutely great place to stay."

Joe was a pleasure to talk to. He really enhanced our stay and gave us a unique perspective on life in Boston.,,,,,
Charlestown is quiet and safe. It is a pleasant residential neighbourhood. The locals were friendly and always happy to help out as soon as I looked even slightly lost! Wholefoods supermarket is a 2 minute walk from the apartment and the centre of Boston is only a 20-30 minute walk. Perfect.,,,,,

The accommodation was comfortable and clean.  Joe was a great host - he left us a few basic breakfast essentials as well as a generous coffee assortment!

Charlestown is a lovely area; we really enjoyed getting to know it (Bunker Hill Monument, Navy Yard and Ferry to the Aquarium etc). We also walked to/from North End and Beacon Hill, and found it very easy, so it's a quiet but convenient location. The Victorian house is comfortable and we felt right at home. Thanks Joe!"
93505,76646199,2016-05-28,16667232,Sylvain,Très agréable séjour chez Joe à Boston!!! :)
Joe est une personne très sympathique,et envieuse de partager des moments de discussion avec ses invités.,,,,
Tout était prêt lorsque nous sommes arrivés. Le 1er étage était entièrement à notre disposition,et Joe avait même laissé de quoi prendre un petit déjeuner complet (fruits,café,pain,etc).,
La maison en elle même est située dans un quartier très sympa,tout proche du centre ville de Boston. Pour s'y rendre,deux solutions qui prennent environ 30 minutes : Soit à pieds entre traversant un petit pont. Soit en faisant une partie du chemin grâce à un ferry qui relie Charlestown à l'aquarium de Boston (plein centre). L'avantage du ferry est d'avoir une vue très jolie sur Boston depuis la mer.,,,
"Thanks for all Joe. ;)\"",,,,,
93505,78131175,2016-06-05,53477107,David,Joe met us at the door eventhough it was late night.
Joe provided food for the refrigerator so we did not have to go to grocery the night we arrived. Joe accommodated our needs,including getting us another DVD player when we couldn't get the first one to work correctly. Very hospitable,"clean and great location. \"",,,
93505,81092485,2016-06-20,15635548,Leonora,"I enjoyed my long weekend stay at Joe's house on the 2nd floor. It was a spacious 2 bedroom, plus living room with a private bathroom and kitchen. I stayed with 2 other family members and we had plenty of space. Joe was so warm and welcoming when we arrived a few hours later then expected. He stocked a mini fridge for us with breakfast essentials and even had a bottle of wine to welcome us. His house is full of stories, old photographs and Boston history. Charlestown is a very safe and quiet neighborhood, in great walking distance to the pier (great for the morning run) and a 25 min walk to North End where there's so much great food. I took an uber to JP to meet a friend and it was cheap and quick also. Parking was abundant on the weekend and easy to find a 2 hour spot during the weekday. I highly recommend this place if you want to see what Boston is really about!"
93505,82483606,2016-06-27,32736718,Jeanette,Fantastic location and delightful house. We had our 6 year old with us and the two bedrooms plus living space and kitchenette worked perfectly for all of us without feeling cramped. Joe is a great host and very helpful. He even provided all the makings for breakfast which was a great surprise.  No question we would go here again!
93505,84138996,2016-07-05,64461707,Kelly,"Want a charming, neighborhood feel within the City of Boston?  Then, this is place to rent.  Joe is very hospitable and accommodating to his guests.  2nd floor of this 1800's home is as advertised and more than adequate for a family of four. Loved the spaciousness of this floor and the quiet of the neighborhood FAR BETTER than being in a hotel where you never know who is going to be in the room next door.  My teenagers also enjoyed being in Joe's home over a hotel with a pool!!!"
Price over the 4th of July holiday weekend can't be beat,either:):),,,,
"Access center city Boston and the surrounding areas is great.  Joe will help you find off street parking for non-permit residents.  You can choose to walk into center city Boston to do all the \"\"tourist\"\" attractions or call a cab.  A cab will come to this street address within 10 minutes or less.",,,,,
Our family is hoping to return as soon as we are able.  For a first time Airbnb user,this was a fabulous experience.  Thanks,"again Joe!!!!\"",,,

Gave us an impromptu tour of the neighborhood our first evening, and was very helpful with recommendations for dining, activities, etc. Also provided bagels, fruit, coffee, milk, eggs, etc. for breakfast. Lovely, very spacious flat, and in a fabulous location! Good books, films, comfortable chairs, very comfy bed. I highly recommend this host, and plan to make a return visit in the fall."
93505,89477278,2016-07-28,47649973,Florian,"This apartment was great. Joe provided some breakfast food and juice for us and bottle of wine! We wish the air conditioning had been a bit better but for months of the year other than July, it probably would be fine. The location wasn't super central, but it was a close walk to grocery shopping, a few restaurants, a subway station and the bunker hill monument and the USS Constitution. We would definitely stay here again!"

It was very nice of him to fill the fridge with a full nice breakfast. Flat was nice and roomy for 4 people. Just at the beginning of the Freedom trail, flat is well situated. Thank you Joe once again for your hospitality. All the family was very happy. Of course we recommend Joe's flat."

The room and experience was everything we hoped for.  The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the sitting area was a perfect place to sit and relax.  Beth had a binder full of brochures and suggestions for touring as well as recommendations of places to eat.   The little amenities made a big difference.  We were glad for the mini fridge, microwave and coffee pot.  Beth and her husband allowed us to check in hours early and made us feel welcome. We would highly recommend Beth's place to anyone wanting to visit and explore Boston.  Thank you both for such a wonderful experience!"
11924459,68260301,2016-04-03,132992,Ellen,I loved staying st Beth's Place! I had a three day business trip to Boston and her lovely church guest room was in the perfect location for me to walk everywhere. The room was cozy and had all I needed and the church gathering room was available for sitting.  I am planning a return trip in a week or two and will look no further! A very historic area of Boston with tons of charm. Parking in that area is very scarce so plan to pot your car in the nearby lot which cost me $60 for three days. But you won't need your car at all if you stay at Beth's! The bathroom is a bit of a walk though the church lobby so bring a bathrobe! Perfect place.

It was clean and beautiful and had everything a traveler might need. The bathroom was spacious. I cannot say enough about Beth. She is a pure delight, kind and generous. This was a surprise weekend for my husband and she made the whole weekend extra special. She was helpful ever step of the way. She was understanding of our late arrival. I felt like family. We are looking to go back to Boston and will stay there again. You cannot go wrong staying here. Also her place is in walking distance to everything."

The room was clean and has plenty of amenities including snacks, wifi, a private restroom and use of a washer/dryer. The church is historic and quiet located in Little Italy close to tons of amazing restaurants, cafes, bars, and a short walk to the Haymarket metro and other historical landmarks.

I loved all the amenities,  like the bottled water in the fridge and a robe . Beth and  her husband were both super helpful and she was kind enough to loan me a jacket when the weather turned out colder and more blustery than expected .  I also  appreciated Beth moving some laundry for us. We loved being in the North End with lots of hustle and bustle but still being close enough to walk to the T to get to other neighborhoods ."

Check in and check out were easy, Beth was nice and accommodating to us. Room had Netflix to use. Boston is expensive so this had what we needed for a reasonable price."

I could go on and on about what a perfect location it was and close to everything we wanted to do, or how clean and pristine our accommodations were, or how reasonable the rate was, but what REALLY made our stay special was our hosts:  From the time we rounded the corner upon arrival and saw Dave outside BBQing and getting invited to dinner, to the moment we left, we were made to feel like family.  Where you stay can make or break a vacation, and Beth's definitely made our Boston vacation a success!  I have no reservation in highly recommending Beth's Place!"

It is located just off the Freedom Trail (a must-do in Boston) and literally just a 2 minute walk from the famous Old North Church!
The room is fully furnished with any amenities you might need and the bed is really comfortable! We were able to come and go at any time,including veeerrrry late one night after a soccer game at Gillette Stadium. The bathroom down the hall is very clean and might be shared with other guests.

It was very clear to us that Beth takes great pride and care in the accommodation that she provides. The location, in Boston's North End, is brilliant.

There is a shared bath with one other guest room. We did not have any issues using it when needed though. The space is located in a community center on a small street. We were not there during services, so we had no issues coming and going when needed. Beth gives you a key and you can feel free to come and go. The location was amazing to the north end. We were within minutes walking distance from everything in town. The only thing we had trouble with was parking. You will have to find a lot down by the harbor. Look to pay around $35-$40 per day.

We were in town for a Sox game and to meet friends (who grew up in Boston) and even they were impressed with the location and apartment.

6983246,38779374,2015-07-18,38041551,Jay,"\"Gerald had excellent communication via the website as well as a note in the apartment. Although I did not need to contact him, he left me his cell phone just in case. The instructions were clear and concise for entering the apartment. The description from the listing was very accurate. Once we entered the apartment, the look and feel met and exceeded our expectations. The apartment is nicely furnished with a combination of classic and modern interior design. It is clean, well kept and maintained. The location of this listing was excellent. We were able to walk within minutes to Boylston to shop and eat. The \"\"T\"\" station is also within a short walk. The neighborhood was beautiful"
6983246,40123855,2015-07-28,10109086,Katherine,"I had a wonderful stay of over a week at the apartment.  I chose the apartment because of its excellent location, price and appearance, and I couldn't have been happier."
When I arrived,the entry was extremely easy (lockbox,and a small building with only a few apartments) and the A/C was already going (very grateful for the good A/C since the week I was there it was in the high-90s!).  The apartment was very clean and comfortable,and exceptionally well-outfitted with everything one could need: more than enough dishes,cookware,glasses
The location is truly ideal: it's a lively yet quiet area with a lot of students,and a lot of restaurants to grab dinner or takeout.  There are a supermarket and drugstore just down the street,and you are a very short walk from Newbury St,Copley Square,Fenway Park,and the Esplanade.  To me
Lastly,Gerald was exceptionally responsive before and during my stay.  He replied to any questions immediately and kindly,and I felt very secure that should I run into any issues he would be available to help.,,,
"I truly enjoyed my stay and loved having a home in Boston for a week - I hope to return someday soon!\"",,,,,
6983246,41390112,2015-08-07,28501716,Robert,"We were extremely happy here. Communication was good, the apartment was very nice, and arrangements with the key were extremely convenient. The location was ideal for us. We enjoy walking and walked to North End, Boston Commons, Boylston St (extremely close), Fenway, and Cambridge. My event was at Hynes Convention Center, which is only 5 minutes or so walking. Subway is also easily accessible, as is an airport shuttle that goes to/from Hynes Conv Center. Internet connectivity is good."
6983246,42703041,2015-08-15,25285455,Russell,"The location was very convenient for getting around the city - we did lots of walking & found everything easy to reach. Whilst the apartment was comfortable we were disappointed with the bed which was creaky & seemed pretty old - every time one of us turned over the other was woken up. Also, outside the bedroom in the small laneway the opposite buildings have very loud airconditioning plants which run day & night creating a constant drone. To add to the noise there were garbage trucks in the laneway every morning between 6-7am which woke us up. Obviously the hosts have no control over this noise but guests should be aware of it. Key collection was very efficient & all email interaction with Gerald was very easy & concise."
6983246,53454027,2015-11-09,39664808,Allan,"We didn't actually meet Gerald but he explained where to access the keys and was available by phone for any queries. The apartment was beautifully decorated, warm and luxurious and a very safe neighbourhood close to restaurants, parks and shopping. Our only disappointment was that the TV was not connected as expected."
6983246,54844779,2015-11-25,4968991,Dana,"We were very pleased with this rental.  Not only was the apartment quite like its description, but it was also very well located for our purposes.  It was well equipped, convenient and pleasant.  We were able to walk almost everywhere that we wanted to go for culture and entertainment and it was close to a good super market.  Gerald was a perfect host, even checking in with us during our stay to see if we needed anything."
6983246,55782378,2015-12-06,8207251,Karen,"Gerald's apartment was in a great location for our week long visit to Boston. The apartment itself has a nice layout, a full refrigerator and kitchen for saving money while in Boston. Gerald was very responsive to our texts and helped us figure out the heating. We had a nice balance between having support and having privacy. Plus you can arrive and depart on a flexible schedule which removes much of the stress of travel and mass transit unknowns. We would definitely book with Gerald again when returning to Boston."
6983246,57422613,2015-12-26,23303674,Colby,"From the moment I requested to stay at Gerald's beautiful apartment the experience was wonderful!  He has great communication skills and had excellent tips about certain restaurants, tourist sites, etc.  The location couldn't have been better.  We quickly acclimated ourselves to the neighborhood and started to feel like locals.  There is a great grocery store nearby, I got my haircut at the local shop, pharmacy close, not to mention the wonderful string of bars and restaurants.  When we were tired of walking, we would take an  Uber to other parts of the city and never spent more than an $8.00 fare…  even the airport trip was only $19.00!  So, all in all, if you're gonna see Boston you can't go wrong with this charming, inviting, excellent rental!"
6983246,58768870,2016-01-05,30651994,Pascal,Hello

because very comfortable and very well located close to transport,restaurants and shops,,,,
"Gerald contacted our disosal to take news and to put at our disposal Thank again for its home a soon \"",,,,,
6983246,60875348,2016-01-29,38395451,Bruna,"Gerald's apartament is just like the pictures and the location is perfect! Just 6 minutes from the T and the BU bus station, 4 minutes from the Whole Foods and CVS, and 15 minutes from the Newbury Street and Boston Medical Center. I believe this is the best location in Boston, since it places you near to the Newbury (with its incredible stores and restaurants) but also near to the Medical Campus (if you are a student)."
The communication with Gerald was easy and he was available all the time that we needed to solve any problem,as the wifi connection that seemed not work in the beginning. The laundry is free at the basement. The kitchen is well equiped and utensils work pretty well.,,,,
When we arrived some of the dishes seemed dirty,so we had to wash most of them again. Beside that,I would suggest to change the mattress,because when you lay in the bed it kinds of swallows you (really bad for your spine). In addition,I would suggest new knives,since the existing ones don't cut.Moreover
But overall,"Gerald's apartament is really cozy and convenient and I would definitely come back!! \"",,,,
6983246,63167136,2016-02-21,38796365,Lillian,"The apartment was clean, pretty and definitely very cozy and convenient! It was close to the Hynes T stop on the Green Line as well as Newbury Street, Mass Ave, and all the nearby universities were within walking distance. The open kitchen was very nice. Checking in and out was a breeze, and Gerald answered all my questions very quickly. Thanks for a great stay!"
6983246,65221492,2016-03-12,24040826,Lindsey,"Very nice accommodation!  Perfect location for attending events at Berklee College.  Gerald was helpful and always responded right away to questions.  Parking garages are convenient.  All in all, it was a lovely experience.  Definitely want to return."
6983246,69312277,2016-04-10,64551666,Tina,"Very cozy and comfortable stay. Location is great! Thanks Gerald for the support and the welcome flower - it was beautiful. Parking is a little expensive but considering it's in the downtown area it is ok. Best without a car - Subway station is very close. Great neighbourhood, quiet, convenient and feels safe."
6983246,70692548,2016-04-19,39511910,Deborah,We enjoyed our stay here while visiting the Boston area. I agree with the previous comments that the home was exactly as described and the location was great for what we wanted to do. Gerald was quick to reply when I asked questions prior to arriving and even asked during our stay that he was available if we had questions. He was flexible and graciously honored a request we had. We have visited the city many times before so we're looking for different things to do and found a couple worth mentioning that are a quick 5 minute walk from the home- the Bodega and Mapparium. There is a T a short walk away however we used Uber and Lyft and they were readily available. The TV and Internet connection worked fine. Would recommend this place for your stay!
6983246,71228124,2016-04-24,26319536,Jim,Gerald did a great job giving me instructions.  He was quickntoneespond to questions.
The house is as described.bits really clean the bed is also very comfortable.  The location is great.  Really bear the T.,,,,,

6983246,72223742,2016-05-01,17035887,Valerie,"We had a fantastic experience staying at Gerald's home! The home itself was wonderfully kept, inviting and made a great home away from home for the weekend! The location was great, it was very easy to get to the different areas of the city and there were many shops and restaurants nearby. I would recommend this listing to anyone wanting to spend some time in Boston!"
6983246,80704781,2016-06-19,52983529,Caroline,"Staying at Gerald’s place was wonderful.  He was so responsive with great directions and immediately available for any concerns I had. It was easy to find and access with a key in the lock box outside.  The location is amazing! Everyday I rode a bike from the hubway rental company (2 of them just 1 block away in either direction) to my course at the Harvard medical school and got to bike along the park.  It is very central to all kinds of things and I even made it a POPs concert at the symphony hall around the corner.  Whole foods, starbucks and lots of other cute coffee shops/restaurants are close by.  Its easy to catch public transportation to head downtown or to the waterfront.  Also as a single woman, I felt very safe getting around.  The first night I was there, there was beeping noise from the smoke detectors/carbon monoxide detector and Gerald came right away and changed the batteries.  The apartment has great wifi, a lovely seating area, good sized kitchen and very comfort bed in the bedroom.  It was great to have air conditioning in the front room which fortunately I only needed for a few hours each day and a fun above the bed in the bedroom.  I would definitely come back and stay again!"

6983246,83800820,2016-07-04,26141265,Mary Jane,Excellent neighborhood - see earlier comments since I am a newcomer to Airbnb and I was unfamiliar with the script.
6983246,85672314,2016-07-12,8335120,Angel,Checkin was easy and the place was comfortable. Host is easy to contact and made things easy. The neighborhood is great walking distance to Fenway and coffee.
6983246,86788132,2016-07-17,60986530,Suzy,"Gerald pics were spot on, the images matched the apartment perfectly. The home is very quaint and it is on the best lil street that is hidden in the midst of everything. The bed is super soft and my husband whom is very picky loved it more than The Heavenly beds at some hotels and resorts. The kitchen was well stocked with any pot/pan/dish that we could ever need. Coffee and Teas as well. We walked to Fenway each day and it was incredible ( very short walk, 10 min max) There is a parking garage at both ends of the street. However if you tell the owner your address he has a lot literally steps away that is a small triangle and you can come and go as you please. Just ask the owner at the garage for the small triangle lot if you drive off of your street, it is so great. If I am ever in Boston again I would be so happy to stay here. Gerald was so gracious, I could contact them any time during my stay and I could have received help if needed. I never needed anything but it was a comfort to know that if I did I had a contact. Helped me with all my questions and concerns right away. SAFE beautiful neighborhood with a quite street and simply quirky and quaint decor that you find very relaxing as if you were staying with family."
6983246,87978744,2016-07-22,55042112,Carolyn,This apartment was beautiful!  The location was perfect to see all of Boston highlights by foot.  This is a delightful setting and comfortable for all your needs!!
6983246,90546404,2016-08-01,15656044,John,This cozy second floor walk-up apartment is easy to access and in a great location. My wife felt safe and liked the quick walk to coffee and shopping. And I appreciated the easy access to my clients' offices. Gerald was friendly and responsive. Highy recommend!
6983246,93952278,2016-08-14,28895639,Tracy,The area is perfect for walking everywhere around Boston especially good for Berklee college of music that our daughter was attending. The apartment is a good size exactly as it looks in the photos and great air-con which was good as it was extremely hot in Boston the week we stayed. Gerald was extremely helpful and answered any questions we had. Would deffinately stay here again
6983246,99345848,2016-09-04,32668172,Keeley,The host canceled this reservation 298 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8301926,47013538,2015-09-14,16971143,Kelly,Loved the apartment! Exactly as pictured and the location could not have been better! Nicole is an excellent hostess and her apartment is so clean and cute! Would definitely stay here again if I am ever back in the area!
8301926,48943430,2015-09-29,38699764,Lesley,Nicole was a fantastic host and her place was perfect! We were able to meet up so that I could get a key as she was heading out of town. Her place was perfectly located to do everything that we wanted to  while visiting.  Would definitely return and hope to soon!
8301926,49856269,2015-10-06,4175788,David,"Boston's South End is one of the best neighborhoods in the city, and Nicole's apartment is in an absolute ideal location. It's one of the man adorable brick Rowe houses that are iconic for the city. It's a short Lyft ride, or walk, from the Common and Theater District. The room is perfect. The bed was super soft and the apt. had nice views of Tremont St. There were a dozen restaurants within a block or two. I highly recommend if you want an authentic Boston experience."
8301926,51782967,2015-10-24,35212454,Valentin,Nicole gave us all information to feel like at home in her sweet well located apartment. Tremont St offered us a lot of opportunities to enjoy shopping and eating. We often biked with the Hubway bicycles located near her apartment which was very convenient and fun.
"The apartment was clean and nicely decorated. We enjoyed the nice views from all the windows located along Tremont St.\"",,,,,
8301926,59387601,2016-01-10,8609377,Jc,"This was a super cozy apartment along a bustling street in South Boston.  Nicole was extremely helpful and very willing to provide info on what to do, where to go and how to get there."
I walked around both day and night and felt completely at ease in this charming,trendy neighborhood. Chinatown was a ten minute walk,multiple food options here. Bus and metro are easily walkable from here,"lots of Ubers as well - this is a great place to call home as you visit and explore Boston!\"",,
8301926,70778993,2016-04-20,45832196,Matthew,"Traveling to Boston for the marathon, our primary criteria was proximity to the finish line. Nicole's apartment fit our needs perfectly! The apartment was organized, clean, and her roommate was very polite and helpful. We were pleased with the restaurant options nearby and enjoyed how quiet the room was, allowing quality sleep. The bed is very comfortable."

8301926,74129597,2016-05-13,40760957,Taylor,"Nicole's apartment was really nice, clean and in a great location! Right in the South End and what I needed and her roommate was really nice and it felt just like being at home. Only minor issue was Nicole wasn't very clear on the checking in process and getting the key and was a bit hard to get in touch with. In the end I figured it out on my own but would've been nicer/easier if it was more clear to begin with and if Nicole was more available to get a hold of. Other than that no complaints and would happily stay here again if I needed somewhere to stay in Boston!"
8301926,77382657,2016-05-31,4209005,Vanson,"We didn't have a chance to see Nicole, but the apt is extremely comfortable. We was enjoyed staying there and will come again when living in Boston!"
8301926,87153913,2016-07-18,37836198,Jeff,"This was easily one of the best experiences my girlfriend and I have had with Airbnb.  Nicole was an excellent host, always quick to respond to any messages/questions we had and really made sure we had everything we needed.  The place itself is gorgeous, very clean, and in a very nice neighborhood, there are tons of little restaurants, shops, bars, to keep us plenty busy.  We could've spent the few days we were in town solely exploring the neighborhood alone.  I highly recommend this listing for anyone staying in Boston for a brief period, I will definitely try to stay here again if/when I do return."
8301926,88973755,2016-07-26,33501152,Jeff,Great place to stay in Boston. Had the pleasure of meeting Nicole on our first night and she was very helpful throughout the entire stay. Very close to tons of restaurants and not too far from the Historic sites and Fenway.

13591607,82465197,2016-06-27,78734437,Lisa,"Nice neighborhood, I like to talk a walk in the morning/after dinner to feel the summer breeze of Boston. It locates in the center of boston, very convenient, with the walking distance to anything you need, or public transportation (save you $$ on the rental cars!) , yet you don't hear the noise at all.

Vera was extremely responsive leading up to the trip and left us detailed instructions that were spot on.  Her place was impeccable and decorated beautifully.   Vera is very detailed oriented in her amenities, if you forgot something she pretty much had it.  She was extremely responsive to suggestions for the area and constantly checked up on us to ensure that we were having a great experience.  Her place was centrally located and had easy access to anything that you could imagine in Boston.  I would definitely recommend staying with Vera on your trip to Boston.  I know the next time we travel to the area, I will be hoping she is not booked.  Thank you Vera for your hospitality,  we had an amazing time."

We weren't exactly sure which room/bathroom was ours at first, but as soon as I figured it out everything was fine. There were lots of snacks in the living room she welcomed us to. And she allowed us to use the TV in the 1/2 bedroom in the evening. The neighborhood is beautiful and close to the T. We enjoyed our stay very much!"

The neighborhood is quite lovely and the apartment was very comfortable and charming. We were 10 minutes away (walking distance) from Berklee, where my son was staying. As far as location, it can't get any better. Vera was also very welcoming and warm. We were surprised with sweet treats and infused cold water every day and we felt very comfortable and at ease sharing her space with her. The place looks exactly like the pictures.

13591607,86649781,2016-07-17,64686261,Tai,Vera was a great host. We added a 5th member onto our party last minute & she was more than accommodating to our situation. The location was easy to find & there was plenty to do around. Our group often split off from each other & she was more than happy to buzz in the group without the key & was very friendly the whole time. The place was clean & as advertised. She gave helpful advice for places to eat & visit. Would highly recommend to stay here when in Boston.

It's a nice modern style apartment.  Behind the curtains you can walk into a garden oasis.  Everything was clean and well thought out.  There is a a private parking spot in right in front of the place.  I would stay at her place any time I come back to Boston.
7330494,40012608,2015-07-27,5087937,Clarice,Katarzyna was an incredible host to us! :) We arrived late at night and she was so welcoming and showed us around the neighborhood. She took us for a drive by the beach to point out interesting places for us to see. The apt itself is actually way nicer than the pictures!! Everything is very new and convenient. It is the perfect size for a couple! She has a beautiful garden that we had access from our room. It was so nice to wake up and sit outside with a cup of coffee!
The area was perfect for us because we wanted to be relatively close to Logan Airport (only 15 min away perfect for early flights!) but also have easy access to the city. The T station is just 5 minutes walking and there are plenty of food options. There is a nice park about 10 min walk and a nice beach also walking distance. We felt very safe in the apt and around the area (she gives your own personal code for the door and your own key to the inside door).,,,,,
If you are looking for a quiet,yet convenient place in Boston,this is definitely the place to be.,,,
"Would definitely recommend for any length of stay! :)\"",,,,,
7330494,41692180,2015-08-08,11583722,Vinh,Katarzyna was there to greet us. Her place was exactly depicted in the pictures plus more.

Katarzyna is a great host who made me feel welcome. She even stocked the fridge with some basics. It was nice to sit in the garden at the end of they.

The flat itself is exactly as described, very nice and newly renovated."
My first night,they invited me to sit in the garden with them and they graciously provided me with a drink as we sat and chatted for about an hour. They gave me all sorts of insight on the area and I ended up eating at a very high end restraint the next night as they pointed out that it was restaurant week in Boston.,,,,

Kassia and Adrian had important information (wifi password,keypad code,contact information,etc) printed and waiting for us inside the apartment,which was extremely helpful during our stay.  There were also some basic food items available for us,we especially appreciated having easy access to coffee when we arrived after work and a flight on Friday night.
The apartment was neat and clean with plenty of storage space for personal items.  The backyard garden area is absolutely adorable and we enjoyed sitting outside in the mornings.,,,,,
This area of Southie was just okay.  Not too much to see or do,but the T was so close to the apartment and very easy for us to get downtown or anywhere else we wanted to go.,,,,

The apartment was clean and nicely decorated and less than a 5 minute walk to the metro which made it very convenient to get around Boston.  The only negative thing would be the limited restaurants and grocery options nearby - we ate in town, so no real problem there."

We used Uber and Lyft to get around Boston and no one had trouble finding her place. Many restaurants make deliveries in that area. We enjoyed our stay."
7330494,86232745,2016-07-15,10161739,Sean,"Great place... Perfect for 2 (and perhaps a third like small child). The unit was completely renovated... Like walking into Ikea... Super clean, very nice and the neighborhood is safe. I'd stay here again without hesitation. With one parking space for you, it truly is a great place."
"Katarzyna is a gracious host giving us great city advice and also offered her small backyard to relax and get away from the hustle and bustle of city life.\"",,,,,
7330494,87488381,2016-07-20,70688207,Patrick,"Katarzyna was a wonderful host. She made me feel welcome and her apartment was perfect. Clean, comfortable, and inviting- and Boston is an amazing city! I would definitely recommend staying here."
7330494,87693824,2016-07-21,53694478,Sara,"We stayed for two nights in Boston and we are so glad to stumble upon Katarzyna's place on airbnb! She was very accommodating and gave us tons of information on the surrounding area. She even accommodated an early check in time which was very helpful since we had arrived on red eye flight from California. Very charming, quiet, and private space. Perfect for two people and was a great place to come home to at the end of the day. I'm definitely looking forward to returning to Boston and staying here again!"
7330494,91012909,2016-08-03,34455106,Dale,"My wife and I recently returned from a five night stay in Boston. After a long drive, check in at Katarzyna's was easy and she quickly came to greet us and ensure we had everything we needed upon arrival. The electronic locks on the doors made access easy and secure without having to worry about keys. There is a parking space for a small car, which is a huge plus as parking is challenging to find in Boston."
The apartment was clean,and as shown in the pictures. There was clean bedding and towels prepared. The bed and linens were comfortable and of hotel quality. My wife loved the quilt on the bed. The bathroom was clean and nicely renovated.,,,,
The kitchen was clean and fully functional. The living room was comfortable,with netflix and cable TV included. The apartment has a window air conditioner that cools the apartment well,which was needed as it was very hot doing our stay.,,,
We felt safe in the neighbourhood. The apartment is a five minute walk to the Andrew red line T stop,which can have you into the city and surrounding area in less than 20 minutes. There are some excellent pizza restaurants close by,and a great Polish restaurant that is worth trying.,,,
While in the city our car was broken into,however nothing was stolen or damaged. I would not leave valuables in the vehicle and would ensure you lock your car. That being said,at no point did we feel unsafe or suspect that we were in an unsafe neighbourhood during our trip.,,,
Katarzyna responded to all communication promptly and was an inviting host.,,,,,
"We would stay at Katarzyna's again without hesitation. \"",,,,,
7330494,91724930,2016-08-06,67104914,Amanda,"We were greeted in person when we arrived. The space was bright, clean and lovely -- especially the backyard! Parking was easily accessible. We were a hop/skip/jump from the train station."
7330494,93041753,2016-08-11,81119202,Brenda,"Our stay at Kasia's place was wonderful. She was very accommodating to our arrival and departure time. Throughout our stay, she messaged us a few times and make sure we were well taken care of. The house is clean and cozy. The neighborhood is nice and only a few blocks away from restaurants, donuts, and the bus and subway station. We loved the place and look forward to returning one day."
7330494,94121625,2016-08-14,56114707,Michael,"Small and cozy apartment on a quiet street. Very nice owner. Perfect for our trip to Boston. Since we spent so much time exploring Boston, all we needed was an air-conditioned place to sleep. We'll definitely be staying there again!"
7330494,95594548,2016-08-20,87806844,Pascal,Bel appartment avec jolie cour à l'arrière. Idéal pour un couple. Situé à quelques pas du métro. Le quartier est cependant un peu moche donc soyez conscient que vous chercher sans doute à ne pas trop y passer de temps.
7330494,98109297,2016-08-29,9077487,James,Really nice place with plenty of room and a really nice garden in a good neighbourhood. 5 minute walk to to T and access to all of Boston. The public transport was really good and we found it very easy to get around the city.
Great communication from Katarzyna,"I would definitely recommend staying here.\"",,,,
6914622,38316760,2015-07-14,14122520,Christina,"Julie was amazing! Responded quickly and very pleasant to work with. Great neighborhood, clean/nice space and great price. Highly recommend!"
6914622,39103269,2015-07-20,18112725,Jessica,"I will try my best to capture in words the absolutely amazing experience my husband and I had.  We feel so lucky to have stayed in Julie's Treetop Haven, which lives up to its name with the nature we experienced right outside the windows!"
Julie was so kind and very easy to communicate with.  She quickly responded to all my messages and even checked to make sure all was well during our stay.  Julie went above and beyond to make our stay magical.  We were in town for our sister-in-law's wedding and we were also celebrating our 14th anniversary.  Julie left us a gorgeous handmade flower arrangement,a sweet card,delicious chocolates,wine,and little snacks.  She also gave us amazing coffee from her Keurig and even asked what kind of creamer I like,leaving organic nondairy creamer to accommodate my lactose intolerance.  So amazingly kind!
As far a location is concerned,Julie's home is in a super safe neighborhood where we felt comfortable walking around at night.  It's a 5 minute walk to a gorgeous arboretum,a 10 minute walk to the  Green St. T station (it's about a 20 minute ride into downtown Boston),and a 10 minute walk to all the downtown JP goodness.  We loved spending time in JP with all the great places to eat.  Our favorites were Fiore's for breakfast,City Feed and Supply for groceries and lunch,and JP Licks for dessert.  Everything you need is walking distance in town
Julie's home is clean and comfortable,"with beautiful artifacts from all her world travels.  I loved coming \"\"home\"\" from our daily adventures.  The air conditioning works very well",the claw foot bathtub is to die for,and the bed is extremely comfortable!  We appreciated the awesome closet unit in the bedroom,with tons of drawer space and room to hang our nice clothes.  Julie's relaxation room is heaven and there is so much beautiful natural light in every room.  You will love the tree in the front yard.  In the mornings,I took my coffee to the living room windows and just watched all the squirrels and birds frolic and eat.  Being on the second floor was perfect for observing the nature.
When I'm back in Boston,I will definitely stay at Julie's Treetop Haven!,,,,

6914622,40770975,2015-08-02,36748900,Emily,"This was a clean, comfortable, and relaxing place to stay. The apartment was walking distance from great shops and restaurants, as well as nice outdoor green spaces. Julie was a fantastic host and was very thoughtful and accommodating with our needs. We loved the thoughtful touches like the flowers and the welcome basket. The small TV room was big enough to use as a second bedroom for our 1-year old's travel crib, so there was more than enough space. We thoroughly enjoyed or stay and would highly recommend this place to others!"
6914622,45086717,2015-08-31,35064674,Jason,"Julie's place was fantastic.  She had wine, coffee and chocolates waiting for me on my arrival.  Clean doesn't cover how spotless her place was...better than any 5 star hotel I have stayed in.  Her part of Jamaica Plains is fantastic...kind of a hipper area.  Plenty of cool restaurants nearby within walking distance and the T is only about a 10-15 minute walk.  Street is very quiet and neighbors didn't make a peep.  Would definitely stay again."
6914622,70060729,2016-04-15,23518407,Nancy,"This was a true find! Julie is a warm and attentive host. I arrived to fresh flowers, a card and welcome basket of delicious goodies. Julie made herself accessible at all times to meet any needs and answer any questions. She made a point of making sure that I was comfortable and had everything that I needed. Her home is beautiful, bright, spotless and uncluttered. Each unit in the building has its own set of clothes washers and dryers located in the basement which was wonderful since I was there for 10 nights with a limited wardrobe. The kitchen is fully equipped and really well organized. Her home provided me a wonderful sanctuary to return to at the end of each day. Each morning I woke to the sounds of birds singing and a sense of tranquility. The location is very accessible. Shopping and restaurants are within a couple of blocks. The arboretum and Jamaica Pond are also just blocks away. I had a car which I parked in Julie's driveway, off street parking is a very nice perk. That said I could get just about everywhere I wanted to go without having to drive. It was a truly lovely find!"
6914622,74998307,2016-05-18,69408975,Patrick,"Our first Airbnb experience at Julie’s home was perfect! My wife and I have lived in Jamaica Plain for many years and we recently needed a short term housing solution while renovation work took place in our home. We wanted a quiet, private place right near the center of JP. Julie’s home was perfect and the process was seamless from start to finish. Julie is a terrific host, very kind and responsive. We arrived to a beautiful and extremely clean apartment, and she’d left behind a gift basket with flowers, chocolate and other goodies. We felt comfortable and at home during our twelve night stay, which we extended part way through. The home is on a very nice, quiet street close to restaurants, shops, the Arnold Arboretum and public transportation. Access to laundry and off street parking was a huge bonus. As other reviews have mentioned, it is very quiet, which was great. We were kind of dreading living in a temporary situation for two full weeks, but I don’t think it could have been any better. I would give Julie and her home the highest recommendation and will tell out-of- town visitors about it moving forward."
6914622,89758437,2016-07-30,72785759,Ana,"We stayed at Julie's place for a month, and couldn't have been more content with our experience with her, her place, and her location."
We were traveling with a baby and she helped us by making sure the baby had a crib to sleep in and a booster seat for eating.,,,,,
The house was perfectly comfortable and the neighbors were always incredibly friendly.,,,,,
Also,if you are into cooking,this place had absolutely everything one might ever need for cooking. Seriously,one of the most complete kitchens I have ever seen!,,
When we got there she had her signature flowers and a basketful of treats for us and the baby (even bubbles for him to play with!),and was incredibly supportive throughout our stay. At one point the microwave there died,and she helped us get a new one in no time.,,,
Overall we fell in love with her place and came to have it feel very much like home. When we visit Boston again we hope to go back to her haven!,,,,,
Also,my son took his first steps in her apartment! We will love it forever because of this :).,,,,

1038465,4198594,2013-04-17,908720,Fabrizio,I was very happy in my stay.
- the location is extremely convenient,close to subway and short walking distances to very nice and central areas such as Copley Square,Back Bay,Tremont St. etc.,,
- the room I had was very large,comfortable and charming,,,,
- the silence,the view from the room,the historical house could make me feel v.peaceful and relaxed.,,,
- Robert has been v.much welcoming before I arrived (answers,directions),when I arrived (suggestions,information),during my stay and before I left (also suggestions and directions).,
- Robert is someone I loved to talk with: relaxed,curious and focused at the same time,ready to listen,"explain and deepen subjects. He shared with me his suffering for the event of the devastation occurred at the marathon finish line.\"",,
1038465,4407565,2013-05-03,2033778,Yair,"Great stay. Rober it a Super nice person- a teaching history professor who loves hosting people. He is such a nice person! full of stories and tremendous knolege of Boston. He will do everything he can to make sure you get the most out of the visit. Showing you places on the map, teaching you historical facts about different points of interest. Really warm welcome."
I stayed in the 3rd floor,a huge beautiful room with lots of sunlight and overlooking a beautiful street. Large and comfortable. Full size bed- which is ok- not bad but also not the most comfortable bed I've slept on.,,,,
I was a bit concerned about previous reviews that mentioned that the place was not clean. That was not my impression at all! the house,room,and bathroom are very clean,and Robert has a helper who helps him keep the place very clean.,,
The building itself is historical and beautiful.,,,,,
close to everything,public transportation,amtrak,subways,the bycicle hubway station,restaurants and bars.
Overall had a wonderful stay!,,,,,
"There's no way that you will find a better value for your money. I searched a lot before booking the place- no where even close in terms of what you get for what you payed. \"",,,,,
1038465,4577311,2013-05-13,5869794,Ewa,"I stayed with Robert at the beginning of May and truly enjoyed his great hospitality. Robert's place is all about location, you just can't beat it! The house is on a quiet street in a beautiful Victorian neighborhood located in the very center of Boston. Local attractions are within walking distance and it's a 3min walk to Back Bay T station and less than 10 min ride downtown. Restaurants, bars and a shopping mall are at your doorstep. Robert is an excellent host, very helpful and accommodative. Jackie helped me to carry bags up the staircase and when I was down in NYC Robert did store my bigger suitcase. Overall a great experience and I would definitely stay again."
1038465,4617647,2013-05-15,4450984,Chris,The room was clean and Robert was full of valuable information that helped me navigate the city. His home is located in a beautiful neighborhood and is surrounded by amazing food and drink.

1038465,4969453,2013-06-04,3770376,Kathryn,"Perfectly located, great host communication and a bargain! Would even stay here if rate slightly increased and a little more was invested in cleaning it like a hotel, they supplied a window a/c unit and got a new mattress. It wasn't dirty by any means, just a little dustier than a typical place you'd rent and hot when temps are above 70."
1038465,5062115,2013-06-10,2695816,Csongor,"I have been warm wellcomed by Jacky, who has showed me around and gave me good advices where to go. We talked a lot about music as well :)"

1038465,5108198,2013-06-12,6607074,Jack,Just in to Boston for one day - I had never been to Boston. It was a great place to stay. Perfect for what I needed.
1038465,5209721,2013-06-18,3839360,Michael,"Great communication before arrival, great hospitality, great room, great place to stay!"
1038465,5265620,2013-06-21,516347,Lillian,"The house was in a nice neighborhood very centrally located to the Back Bay Station. I felt very safe walking back home late at night. Jacky welcomed me and was very flexible about check in time, which made it much easier to plan. The room was clean and he provided a clean towel. He also was very helpful with providing a map and helping to explain how to get to my destination in town."
However,I was checked into a room that I did not book,but rather the ground level floor room.,,,
"The room described here is \"\"filled with light\"\" and on the \"\"third floor\"\". The room I was checked into was the ground floor room",which was very dark,even with the curtains open and smelled very musty,(since it was on the ground floor of a brownstone).,,
I would have preferred it if the hosts contacted me beforehand telling me the room was not available anymore and asking if i was ok to switch rooms.,,,,,
Jacky was apologetic,when I brought up the fact that I was not in the room that I booked and refunded me the difference in price of the two rooms,but if given the choice,I would have simply booked a room in another location.,,
"\"",,,,,
1038465,5594579,2013-07-07,7281988,Reana,"Robert's place was a real treat to stay in. You can tell you're in the home of a professor when the books are stacked from floor to ceiling, and follow you up the stairs. I loved checking out the interesting titles on the spines and seeing the great historical items all around the house. The room was exactly as pictured, you'd think he took the photo moments before I booked! The room was spacious and tidy, with a lovely view of the tree-lined street. Plenty of room to relax, write, or whatever else you might need. There is an AC in the room, though you have to keep the window open because its quite recessed into the window well, so it takes a few minutes to cool down (though once it did I was more than comfortable)."
There are other rooms for rent here,so you may run into other boarders,though I only caught a glimpse of a fellow traveller while I was there on my short stay. You will share a bathroom,which was large and clean,with any other boarders. Since I was there for such a short time,I only saw a little of Robert as well
1038465,5929823,2013-07-22,503083,Steve,Great location near the subway.  Large room.  Robert gave me a list of available things to do in Boston.
1038465,5997169,2013-07-25,7624874,Bea,Lovely furnishings as accurately pictured in the photos.
However,besides the bed and linens themselves,everything was dirty: the rugs,carpets,desk and horizontal surfaces dusty,visual brown stains on the couch and chairs - mold and mildew on the community shower/bath mat in the bathroom. If you are a teenager
1038465,6184560,2013-08-02,7686660,Miao,It was a great experience to live at Robert's place. His place is so close to the city center that everywhere is easily to reach by walking. Robert would give really good tourist guide around the city so you won't miss anything fantastic in Boston. It is also wonderful to get to stay in one of the oldest house in Boston downtown and get to see Robert's great collection of books. I would like to stay there again in my future trips.
1038465,6233714,2013-08-04,7890983,Vincent,"Nice room, very well located."

1038465,6304490,2013-08-07,6845860,Jane,"The place, the neighborhood is perfect, near Metro, supermarket, calm, beautiful, central..... The house is a little beat old, but very interesting. Jack and Robert were very friendly and kindly, thank you. Really only one bathroom to 4 rooms and without a key in the door is not so confortable (and the window is open direct to street too and only with a slim dark web). The bed in our big room was very noise and not so confortable, so we put the mattress on the floor and so we were able to sleep very well. All furniture is classic in the room, with carpet and with little spideweb in the ceiling - not good to allergic people. It was a pleasant sojourn. But the entrance, the bathroom (good water), the stairs (it`s not easy, a little hard, smal and high) and the bedroom, they were the house parts that we can see there. The door in entrance is very narrow - to us it was not a problem, but to big luggages or obese person it can be difficult. It`s a good place to stay."
1038465,6357650,2013-08-09,4338135,Lexington,"Excellent place to stay in Boston. Wonderfully quiet neighborhood, right by the financial district which means easy access to fine restaurants and shopping. Close to Back Bay station for the metro. The house has the wonderful smell of old books, and has a character few places possess. Room was fantastic, bed a bit creaky, but comfortable. Bathroom was great."

You are a block away from the subway, lots of shopping, cafes, the Boston Public Library, and everything you need.  Robert is an insightful, knowledgeable host, and he has so much information at his finger tips.  I learned a great deal from him about places to go, but also about the history of the area, how to get around, and so on.

1038465,7920152,2013-10-08,4275955,Annaliese,A beautiful room in a lovely and very full home! Robert gave me great information on what the city had to offer when I arrived and after that I didn't see anyone. The location was fantastic!

The home is ideally located in the lovely South End - convenient to public transportation, coffee shops, restaurants, etc.  The house is old and quaint, I found my bedroom and the bathroom clean.

I don't think it's even possible to find a better deal in that location. The room had a couple extra blankets, which helped a lot. Also, he was very flexible with check in/ check out dates, helpful with all of my questions. It was great. Thank you."
1038465,9079322,2013-12-05,9062548,Kelvin,It was a nice time at Robert's place during my stay in Boston. He and Jacky provided good tips in getting your way around Boston. The room was spacious and the place was located conveniently near the city center. Most of the places were accessible by foot. However hot showers may not be available whenever you want if someone has showered before you; you may have to wait an hour before the low pressure water tank warms up.
Other than that,"I would recommend this place.\"",,,,

1038465,10148864,2014-02-03,10715819,Stefan,"Initially I was confused about the location but that was more due to my unfamiliarity with Boston. To get there from Copley Place walk indoors through the mall to the Dartmouth St entrance to Back Bay transit station. Walk straight through the station and after walking out the other end, hang a right, and Chandler St is only a short block away."
Robert was teaching when I arrived,but his flatmate was able to let me in. His place is an eclectic little firetrap filled with books and various memorabilia from floor to ceiling. The accommodations were spare but comfortable and quiet. The wireless access worked fine. I only had a short chance to speak to Robert before I left the next day and wish I had had more time to talk about our shared experience in the teaching profession.,,,,

The room is great and comfortable,in particular for the price point. Its not a hotel stay (no private bathroom),bed is ok - but neither but the hosts have priced the room with that in consideration.,,,

1038465,11366755,2014-03-31,9138018,Mediko,I stayed at Robert's house while attending conference at Westin Copley hotel.
The location is amazing. It's on a quiet street,so room is very tranquil,yet - it's in the heart of the city,with everything within short walking distance. I was getting to my conference in 6 minutes,8 if I stopped at Starbucks.,
The room has old charm/rustic/eclectic/hard to capture feel to it. It was a bit dusty from all the books in the house (they are EVERYWHERE:)),which I didn't mind.,,,,
The only substantial negative for me was that the internet,otherwise fast and reliable,is going out when someone is talking on the phone. If your work relies on uninterrupted access,make sure to warn Robert.,,
In my opinion,room is best suited for one guest,I had a good time there alone,although a young couple might find it also pretty attractive and convenient.,,
Overall,good value for the money. Fantastic option for those willing to explore Boston on a budget.,,,,
Thank you,Jackie and Robert.,,,,

1038465,11515416,2014-04-06,788076,Julie,"Excellent location.  I was able to walk almost everywhere I wanted to go.  If too far to travel on foot, I was close to mass transit.  Shopping, dining, entertainment...all right there.  Robert also took time my first night to share places I might like to visit, taking into consideration my tight schedule.  He was quite hospitable and helpful."
1038465,12109956,2014-04-23,9767315,Antonio,"Robert is a very kind and considerate host. I would definitely recommend staying with him if you visit Boston.  His home is truly an ideal location to enjoy everything Boston has to offer, and he can surely offer suggestions if you need them.  The room is spacious and comfortable, and you will not be short of reading material as there are more books in Robert's home than in most high school libraries."
"\"",,,,,
1038465,12324461,2014-04-28,561022,Mauricio,I'm glad Robert was able to accommodate me so last minute (an hour or so). The house itself is like a mix between old bookstore and antiquary: bookshelves and random sculptures/art in every nook and cranny (people with severe dust allergy might have some trouble; I'm mildly allergic but had no issue). The area is well located but also quiet (I stayed one Saturday night and heard no noise). I could not meet Robert but his roommate was friendly and helpful.
1038465,12491724,2014-05-04,2199215,Peter,"This room puts you in a great location for access to the Back Bay and South End neighborhoods of Boston. I stayed here while attending a conference at the nearby Marriott - a very close walk away. The room had wifi, a desk, and a beautiful view. I was rather busy, so my interactions with Robert and Jackie were sparse. But they seemed friendly and willing to be helpful and accommodating. There are a lot of books and statues in the stairwell leading up to the room, but the room itself is spacious. For the quality of location and low price point, it was worth the trade-off for other comforts I would have liked."
1038465,12576800,2014-05-05,14536348,Michael,"Robert ist ein sehr freundlicher und hilfsbereiter Gastgeber, die Kommunikation lief bestens. Sein Haus liegt sehr zentral, zahlreiche Restaurants und Läden sind problemlos zu Fuß erreichbar. Das Zimmer war in Ordnung, allerdings sollte man seine Erwartungen an Hygiene und Sauberkeit etwas zurückschrauben: im ganzen Haus werden unzählige Bücher und allerlei Nippes aufbewahrt, auch der eigentliche Hauseingang ist komplett zugestellt, so dass das Gebäude nur noch durch einen Nebeneingang betreten werden kann. Das mit anderen Gästen geteilte Badezimmer war ok, die spakige Gummimatte in der Wanne hat allerdings auch schon bessere Zeiten gesehen...Die drei Sterne also vor allem für die Lage und den freundlichen Gastgeber."
1038465,12873706,2014-05-12,5427827,Tim,"Didn't meet Robert, but Jackie was there to welcome me. Very nice stay in a lovely old room. Back Bay is a great area of the city. Close to the station and heaps of character in this area. Highly recommended."
1038465,13006813,2014-05-17,7316406,Christopher,Robert was very patient and understanding as we had to change our travel plans

1038465,13438214,2014-05-27,11904176,Mehdi,Robert was a fantastic host.
My bus had problems and I only arrived at 3:30am in Robert's apartment. Yet he was extremely understanding and caring and let me in without any issue,even if we were late at night.,,,,
In addition,he provided some very useful tips about the city,restaurants and places to visit.,,,
The apartment is very well located in Boston and you can reach the metro station by walking 5 minutes and go Downtown by walking 20 minutes. The bedroom was clean and lovely. The bed was comfortable.,,,,,
"It's place I definitely recommend.\"",,,,,

1038465,14433566,2014-06-19,4044288,Dan,"Location was great.  Very close to the Back Bay subway station and there were some great restaurants around (My personal favorite was BGood, a super healthy farm fresh place).  Within walking distance to the Boston Public Garden and Commons.  Robert is super nice.  I would recommend bringing earplugs since there is an antique clock in the hallway that chimes every 15 minutes throughout the night."
1038465,14915384,2014-06-29,15560790,Henry,"Great room just as pictured. You will share a bathroom with any other guests in a couple of different rooms, but I never experienced any problems or crowding even with others occupants present. There is quick access to the T metro system, as well as a convenient store (City Convenience?) that stocked any supplies you might need as well as lots of drinks, food, and snacks. Copley Square and mall are just up the road. This home's location is unbeatable!"
"Robert was informative and gave me a quick overview of the city as it was my first time there.  \"",,,,,
1038465,15394206,2014-07-08,1669571,Taryn,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in this lovely room.  My room was spacious, and well-appointed with a sofa, mirror, fan, and A/C unit.  I never saw any of the other guests, and never had a problem accessing the shared bathroom when needed.  Robert was a gracious and helpful host.  The neighborhood is lovely, and close to the wedding I was attending in the Copley area."
The only piece of critical feedback I have was the bed,which was too firm for my taste,"and the springs were a bit noisy.  But I slept quite well!\"",,,
1038465,15467458,2014-07-09,7960850,Laura,Roberts house is an absolute treasure. You will have a great stay here and it's in a great location. Robert is also very friendly and full of interesting stories and tips for sightseeing in Boston. I'm already planning another trip!

1038465,16507853,2014-07-28,10112201,Mike,"Robert's house is in an awesome area. Very quiet area and a very short walk to Back Bay station and Copley Square. There's two great pubs one block away, as well. The house itself is a sweet old brownstone, and filled with tons of interesting books lining every available wall. The room is everything you need for a short stay in Boston."
1038465,16638320,2014-07-30,15768913,Antonio,I'm a freelance hairstylist so finding a crash pad for two days it's hard to find. Robert was soft spoken and helpful and the best part was only walking distance from my gig.
1038465,16692017,2014-07-31,740769,Alistair,"it's a beautiful street and room off Copley/Back Bay, convenient to the T and everything was great. The building and room had lots of character and clean."

1038465,17700067,2014-08-16,5411929,Jessica,Perfect location - you could not ask for better. If you are Lucky enough to stumble upon this listing don't waste any more time the location at this price is a real steal. The room was lovely clean with AC and wifi. Shared bathroom with other guests but out of three days I only had to wait once. There are a couple of flights of steep stairs which wasn't a problem for me but just a warning for less mobile people. I was helped with my bags which was lovely! Happy to recommend this place to others and if I was to return to Boston I would certainly stay again. Thanks Robert!

1038465,18943147,2014-09-03,17389595,Kan,"It is pleasure stay with host. House is in a perfect location, short walking to metro station and plenty of restaurant in the house nearby. Host is so friendly, tell me lots of things that I never knows and recommend many attractions to me."

Besides, the location of the house, in the center of the city makes it very convenient to move around. The room was nice and spacious, pretty cool and the bed was comfortable."

1038465,19707908,2014-09-16,264981,Joe,What a lovely welcoming Host! I arrived after 4 schedule changes and Robert adjusted meeting me to a mutual time. I was delighted with the quiet and very clean space he showed me. Many art objects and scholarly books were there. Robert handed me a key and perfect directions to the meeting I had scheduled. I had room to sit and read and write to friends. Wi-fi access was immediately available. Good hot water and airy sleeping space.
"Saw Robert only twice - once to get the key and then to return it with my thanks for a very comfortable too short stay. He was gracious and had good suggestions on what to see and for dealing with the T lines.\"",,,,,
1038465,19820703,2014-09-19,9777004,Ian,"Robert was a very friendly host and asked what my interest were with regards to my stay.  He then provide in depth and knowledgeable information about Boston and recommended some locations and what to prioritize if I was short of time.  The room is as indicated in the photographs and was comfortable.  Robert was also flexible with arrival and departures times, which is handy."

1038465,20008686,2014-09-22,18032896,Whitney,Never actually met the host. One of the other residents let me in and gave me a key. The rest of the trip I came and went without hearing a peep or seeing anyone.
Overall,it was a positive experience. The bed was noisy and not the most comfortable,but passable for the price. The clock in the hall had chiming bells that went off every 15 minutes,which was a bit irritating for a light sleeper like myself. Again,though,not a major complaint.
"Clean and fairly peaceful. Worth the price relative to the typical hotel prices in this city.\"",,,,,

He and his assistant, Jacky, were extremely helpful; they kept in contact from the moment we made the reservation, answered any questions we had, and gave us useful information before and after we had arrived."
Robert's home is great--it's on a gorgeous street too--but most importantly it is in a GREAT location: we were able to walk virtually anywhere we wanted to go in downtown Boston.  Given that every other hotel in the area is extremely expensive (at least relative to my budget),"Robert's place is a no-brainer. Highly recommended if you're staying in the downtown area.\"",,,,

The house is charming and quiet with a central location in character filled neighbourhood. I'll be in touch anytime I come to Boston again.

If I ever come back to Boston, I will definitely try to get a bed in Robert's house."

1038465,27097911,2015-02-25,26475471,Tom,"We are sponsoring a young musician who had auditions in Boston and the issue of where to say came up.  A hotel didn't seem appropriate for this young man, and so we turned to AirBnB, discovering Robert's perfect Back Bay bnb.  We were excited because it was close to the audition sites and reasonably priced.   In early correspondence with Robert, we sensed how perfect the fit really was -- Robert is a professor at a nearby college.  We packed our young charge off to Boston and into the middle of a blizzard.  We had to extend the stay several days, and Robert was incredibly accommodating.  We knew our young student was warm and safe in Boston until we could get him a flight out.  Our student tells us that the room is wonderful, comfortably cozy and a great place to pass snowy days, though he would liked to have toured the area more.  We booked Robert's bnb for a subsequent visit and hope to stay there ourselves someday."

1038465,29995888,2015-04-15,2331662,Tony,"The host was welcoming and helpful, but the house was a disappointment.  The host seems to be a hoarder (of books at least), as almost every space, is stacked with books and nicknacks.  The floors and bathroom were not particularly clean and there was an unpleasant odour, throughout the house. My bed wasn't great either."
On the positive side,"the quiet location is great.\"",,,,

Room was spacious and included a desk, TV, couch, local maps/tourist info and wifi. Bathroom is modern and in good working order. During my stay I tried to imagine the history of this home and everyone who has passed through here. Definitely not a cookie-cutter hotel room. Staying here will make my visit to Boston even more memorable."

The room is comfortable and looks exactly like on the picture: a lot of decoration, a theme clearly centred on Titanic, but in a way that as soon as you enter you feel at home!"
Robert was really nice and easy-going: even though I was late due to my plane,I was still warmly welcomed,and even helped for my venue.,,,
The house is in a quiet neighbourhood (which is not the case everywhere in Boston),allowing quiet and restful nights (except maybe for the clock in the corridor,but when you are sleepy it does not matter that much).,,,

1038465,32216343,2015-05-15,33164284,Bennett,"Overall this all worked out pretty well. I stayed only for one night as a day trip for work. Location in Back Bay was fantastic, the room itself was sufficient. The host was accessible and knowledgable."
1038465,33100049,2015-05-25,666278,Todd,"Robert's home is in a central location of the Back Bay area, only a three minute walk to an underground station and the Boston Public Library, 10 minutes walk to Chinatown and Boston Commons, 20 minutes to Fenway or North End in either direction.  Also, a nice independent coffee shop is a block in one direction (Appleton) and an affordable bar with pretty good food is a block in another direction (Delux)."
Robert was very nice and hospitable.  While the home itself is cluttered with lots of books and accumulated stuff,my room was nice and the bathroom was clean.  For those who may have problems with stairs,"beware there are three flights of steep stairs.  Overall this was a very pleasant stay.\"",,,
1038465,33413094,2015-05-27,32023458,Michael,"Robert (and another long-term tenant, Jackie) made me very welcome with Jackie carrying my case up the several flights of stair in Robert's charming, very original, row house."
I was much assisted by Robert's tireless historical commentary on Boston and its environs. As a result I suspect I saw many highlights otherwise missed by visitors.,,,,,
There are many interesting eating houses,including a local café,excellent for breakfast,unchanged and unpolished,one suspects for many years.,
"My room was very large with a bay window offering views and fresh air. I was very comfortable.\"",,,,,
1038465,33567909,2015-05-30,3298940,Patrick,"Although I did not see Robert much during my stay, he was kind during our brief meetings.  I appreciated his flexibility with my check in and check out times.  I enjoyed chatting with the Chinese college student, Jiaqi, who is also living in Robert's house.  Although I would have appreciated having some closet space to hang my clothes and locks on the bedroom and bathroom doors, it was a pleasant stay all the same.  The room was spacious.  The location is fantastic and the price is very reasonable considering the location.  I would recommend staying here."
1038465,34222780,2015-06-06,26646492,Weidong,"Robert and Jacky (another guy who lives there) were being very helpful and friendly during my stay. Jacky offered to take my heavy luggage to my floor on third floor as I just arrived while Robert was waiting in my room , and we It's a old house, but the room is beautiful and cozy, and of course in a great location, only such steps from the heart of Back Bay and several T/Amtrak/commuter rail stations that you can go to almost anywhere from there. The neighborhood is very quiet too!"

1038465,35333403,2015-06-17,6934327,Mike,Robert wasn't initially around but his assistant Jaqui greeted me very courteously and showed me to the room.  Later I met Robert and he seemed like a nice person - when it rained he even offered me an umbrella to use - very thoughtful.
He also gave great directions to the home via the free airport to downtown rail service.,,,,,
Neighbourhood and location is absolutely first rate and beautiful.,,,,,
The room itself is exactly as pictured,however there were some issues:,,,,
- nowhere at all to hang clothes.  I had to live out of my case - not ideal for a pressed business suit.,,,,,
- Even though the room seemed clean,there was a very strong dusty or musty smell that I couldn't clear even by leaving the windows open all the time.,,,,
- Bed was noisy and creaky when climbing in.,,,,,
- Wifi was awful on the one night I needed it.  To be fair,this might have been a one-off,but I had an urgent need to prepare for a meeting the next day when speed decreased down to 0.01 MB/s and then shut off all together.,,,
On the plus side,the house is filled with beautiful prints and other artworks,though guests are only allowed access to the bedroom,a shared bathroom and the front door (no access to kitchen,dining,living or other room in the house)
I recommend the room for brief,simple,"non-business visits to the center of Boston.\"",,,

The location was brilliant, with easy transport to and from the airport, walking distance to several points of interest, good cafés and restaurants just around the corner. The bed and bathroom were both clean and comfortable. The house certainly has its eccentricities but it generally just added character!"
1038465,37324058,2015-07-06,9909735,Petri,"Viivyin yhteensä 8 yötä Robertin luona. En tavannut Robertia, hän oli matkoilla, mutta hänen assistenttinsa Jackie oli hyvin ystävällinen ja avulias. Kaikki sujui ongelmattomasti ja mutkattomasti. Huone oli kotoisa ja riittävän siisti, vaikkakin täynnä tavaraa. Myös kylpyhuone oli siisti. Ainoa ongelma oli, että huoneessa ei ollut vaatekaappia tai telinettä vaatteille, joten jouduin ripustelemaan vaatteitani sinne ja tänne, tai säilyttämään matkalaukussa. Myös sänky oli natiseva, mikä ei tosin haitannut nukkumista. Asunnon sijainti on loistava, se on aivan keskellä Bostonia ja hyvien kulkuyhteyksien päässä."
1038465,37766090,2015-07-10,11898947,Rachel,The location is brilliant with many sights within walking distance. Robert is very knowledgable on the history of Boston and gave me plenty of helpful tips. All in all a great place if you don't have a long time to spend (I was only in Boston 2 nights) and want to be right in the centre.
1038465,37873928,2015-07-11,6507926,Rachel,"Robert was very welcoming! My stay was very short, but I had a great experience and would definitely stay here again my next time in Boston."
1038465,38439798,2015-07-15,20369560,Becky,"Both Robert and JiaQ were home when I arrived, and were sure to show me the best places to go on my quick trip. I didn't get to interact too much with them as I was working, but both were very hospitable. I should add that they let me use their personal refrigerator . I am a working mom and it was great that they let me store some items in their refrigerator."
1038465,39764024,2015-07-26,30958084,Shlomit,"very welcoming, they gave me a full explanation on the house, suggested places to visit Boston. In general  - the location is just perfect, walking distance to the city centre and the South station. Few good restaurant just across the street and a safe neighbourhood to walk at night. The house itself is very unique and interesting with hundreds of  books - you don't want to leave our room."
"My only complain is the bed mattress - its old and uncomfortable and gave me  backpain. \"",,,,,
1038465,39959690,2015-07-27,36192688,Bobby,"Room is exactly as pictured.  Very old home, but just what I needed location wise.  Private room.  Shared bathroom on the floor above."
1038465,40492146,2015-07-31,23028027,Manuel,"I greatly enjoyed my time at Robert's home. Robert was very kind, the room was spacious and clean, and the house is located on a quiet, tree-lined street."
1038465,40951534,2015-08-03,35161313,Christopher,"\"Robert and JiaQ were excellent hosts. Very accomodating and flexible with my schedule. Their place is the coolest place around. If I were offered a nice room at the Westin, I would turn it down and stay at this place instead...again...and again.  Location, location, location. AND the style of the home gives it the perfect \"\"Boston experience.\"\" \""
1038465,42056383,2015-08-10,40101988,Mary,"We truly enjoyed our Boston experience with Robert's accommodations. The room was nicely decorated and clean. Location was great, quiet street, and very close to the T so we could get around easily. Robert suggested excellent places to eat.  A gracious host!"
1038465,43107575,2015-08-17,1985993,Peter,Robert was welcoming and helpful.
1038465,43502791,2015-08-20,34913371,Peng,Robert is a nice host.  He responded promptly to my questions and requests.  I appreciate his help on finding the conference site and the bus stop of the airport express bus.  The room is nice and quite and well air-conditioned.
1038465,43735527,2015-08-21,15955943,Eleanor,"It was a completely depleting experience. What with no place to park, no house number or entrance visable I was grateful that someone finally appeared and let me in. Jackie went w/me to help me retrieve my car and squeez into a space up and around. But that's Boston as far as parking goes. The room was as expected and the bed OK. Would have appreciated a glass of water or even a glass. But after all I was glad to be there for that one night."

1038465,45349956,2015-09-01,19908242,Vincent,It is amazing for me to leave in Robert's house for a 3-day trip in boston.  It is a house with enough sunshine! And the host is very good!
1038465,45441128,2015-09-02,16416922,New,"Robert was friendly and easygoing. Room was comfortable, air conditioned, and conveniently located!"
1038465,45588317,2015-09-04,7361406,Peter,"Great location, really in the heart of the city and walkable from all of the key areas.  The room was clean and the house was really quiet.  Robert provided me with a key to come and go which was great, and gave me a run down of the area and some really useful local insider info."
1038465,46023502,2015-09-07,29295607,Maggie,"Overall Perfect! I texted Robert when I arrived and JaiQi came out to open the door for me. JaiQi was so nice, he showed me the house, explained how everything worked and he also gave me a map of the city and recommended me cool places and activities. He also surprised me with a free ticket to the art museum, which was great because I was planing to go, so I save money there to eat more lobster lol. My room was exactly as pictured. Room and bathroom were clean at all times. House and neighborhood were quiet. The location was so convenient, just a 4 minute walk to the T line.  I will stay here again :)"
1038465,46480375,2015-09-11,37838143,Ryan,Great place to stay. It's in a quite section of town that is within walking distance to all of the historical sites in town.
1038465,46638583,2015-09-12,873960,Amanda,"Robert's place is really cool - a neat old brownstone in the heart of Back Bay.  It's incredibly convenient to Back Bay and a great neighborhood for restaurants and shopping.  Getting into the house was simple, and everything was as described.  I'd definitely stay there again!"
1038465,47261152,2015-09-17,31838556,Jean-Yves,Logement ok dans l'ensemble.
1038465,47413979,2015-09-18,33556294,Monique,Very friendly! Would stay again.
1038465,47502784,2015-09-19,41170450,Naoko,"Excellent location for Back Bay Amtrak station. Big room, big shared bathroom, good shower water pressure, and decent wifi. Host and assistant were very nice, super responsive, and had a nice system set up."
1038465,48270021,2015-09-25,17813561,Peter,"Robert's brownstone is on a reasonably quiet residential street, well located three or four blocks from Copley Square. The room was large and quiet. Robert told me about the awesome Back Bay Logan Express, which runs between the airport and Copley Square for only $5. I borrowed a book during my visit called 'The Edwardians' that was pretty inteeresting. I was able to walk to Hynes Convention Center, even Fenway Park and downtown because everything is so compressed. Local eateries were a little high for my taste, I am more into hole-in-the-wall falafel joints, but there is a Star Market nearby. I would stay here again."
1038465,48684639,2015-09-28,10596752,Jamie,"We really enjoyed our stay.  The bedroom was beautiful, and we loved the windows in the room!  This bedroom is in a lovely brownstone in a wonderful neighborhood with lots of other beautiful homes, so it was a pleasure to stay here and walk back to our place after a day out and about.  It was also very convenient to most of the sight-seeing we did, so it was easy to pop back in mid-day to grab a sweater.  There are a couple of subway stations very nearby, so that was nice, but there was a lot of wonderful stuff to do within walking distance.  Couldn't have really chosen a better neighborhood for our stay!  Robert and Jackie were wonderful hosts, very accommodating and friendly.  Jackie carried our suitcase to and from room for us, and talked to us a little bit about the house.  Robert was helpful with suggestions of things to do while we were in town.  Our only regret is that we didn't have more time.  We were busy every second of our stay, and there was still so much more we wanted to do and see.  If you've never been to Boston, but are a student or just lover of architectural history, you'll feel like a kid in a candy store.  Make sure to check out the blocks-and-blocks-long park running along the center of Commonwealth Ave called the Commonwealth Mall, lined with the most magnificent houses, just a few blocks away.  You can start at the Boston Public Garden and continue along this stretch for a really lovely walk."
1038465,49616668,2015-10-05,40799316,Michael,Robert greeted me and gave a great orientation to the neighborhood and logistics of getting around.  Was a great location to launch into the activities we had going on around Copley area.
1038465,50285365,2015-10-11,15192658,Kate,This airbnb was perfect for me while I attended a medical convention. The photos and descriptions are right on target. It's in a great location. I would recommend.
1038465,51443909,2015-10-20,455331,Susan,"\"I was quite disappointed in my stay at Robert's home home. My bedroom had a comfy bed, but there were no drawers to put my clothes in both closets were stuffed with boxes and paper. There were 10\"\" of space but no hangers to hang clothing on. I did get hangers when I requested them from his assistant. The TV was 15\"\" square and the remote did not work. There were no locks on any of the five guest bedrooms and only one working smoke detector that I could find on the four floors of the home. No one could enter the front door because it was packed with stuff so everyone had to enter from the little door under the stairs. I was most dismayed with the kitchen which was filthy unusable"
1038465,51636083,2015-10-22,42926394,Claire,Great location and quiet neighborhood.
1038465,52134133,2015-10-26,8751266,Dietmar,"Robert was really kind! I got the best history lesson about a city especially Boston in this case ever. He recommended me a lot of nice places and how to get there. The room was perfect, quiet and also big. There's more than everything you will need in there. I will try to stay there again in the future. Great distance to shops, bars and as well the train station! Thanks Robert for the Boston experience and see you soon :)"
1038465,52488471,2015-10-30,42451505,Doug,"\"Great place!! The room was nice and quiet. Fast internet connection, which was nice for getting work done. Robert was very helpful with some \"\"logistic\"\" issues - on the first day"
1038465,54710712,2015-11-23,14791433,Seth,This was an absolutely lovely little room. I was in town for a conference and I really appreciated the small work space/desk. Neighborhood is quiet and was a great location. I'd definitely use this airbnb again.
1038465,55722942,2015-12-05,5629061,Costantino,"This room is an old traditional brick house with lots of character. There are two flights of steep stairs to reach it. it is very confortable and cosy, well adapted to not only sleep but also work (the table is big enough). Wi-fi is adequate if erratic but apparently this is the standard in Boston. Robert is very friendly and would have gladly given me lots of good advice, had I needed or wanted it. Location is great if you want to go to the Hynes convention center or Back Bay, which was my case."
1038465,55848651,2015-12-06,39780584,Hiroki,"This house is great! I like its atmosphere. I could not meet Robert, but he contacted me kindly and let me easily get into the house.(his roommate helped me) Neighber is quiet, so I could have a good sleep. I really recommend this house!"
1038465,56137529,2015-12-09,45777706,Chris,Pro.f Robert is a kind man. He likes to talk with his guests. He introduced a lot about the history of Boston and recommended which places should be visited. His house is very nice and the location is perfect. His assistant is also a kind man too. We became friend and drunk before I left. Thanks a lot!

1038465,68306346,2016-04-04,350679,Jennifer,"This is a great space full of books that is great for people who do not work at night--the internet goes on and off at night and was inconsistent even after I asked it to be left on. The bathroom is upstairs. If you are a neat freak, you might find it sort of dirty. I consider myself as having about average hygiene expectations, and was very comfortable."
1038465,70566459,2016-04-18,4034199,Didier,"A typical Bostonian house filled with history, conveniently located and with a cozy friendly atmosphere. I stayed there for the Boston marathon and it fully fulfilled my expectations."
1038465,70706770,2016-04-19,4400148,David,Robert's place is more hostel than airbnb. Good location and place to crash when in a pinch. Robert is very nice!

1038465,80097342,2016-06-16,12038901,Joshua,"This is a fantastic property in middle of a quiet neighborhood not far from anything I wanted to do while in Boston. I was in Boston for a conference at the Hynes Convention Center which was only about a 10 minute walk which was very convenient. The T stop (and Amtrak) is also only 2 blocks away so it was really easy getting there from the airport and leaving on the Amtrak to go to New York. The place was very clean and the all of the books made it feel very cozy. The posting is very accurate with its description and pictures. Unfortunately Robert was on vacation so I wasn't able to meet him, but his friend greeted me when I got there and provided me with a map of the city and recommendations for things to see. I felt very welcome. I highly recommend this for anyone visiting Boston!"

Brooke was very helpful and flexible.  She had her cleaner come early so we could get a few hours bit before check in.  She communicated and got back to us quickly with questions.  There was a bit of noise on Saturday night, but that is what you get with any location like this -- right in the heart of everything.  We would definitely stay at Brooke's again."

The location was great, as it was right in the middle of Newbury Street so we were within walking distance of many restaurant and shops.  The subway was a short walk.

The apartment is lovely and couldn't be in a better location - very central and near all sorts of nice cafes and restaurants and a 5 minute walk to the river front. Despite the central location, we didn't have any trouble with noise. If I go to Boston again, I will definitely be seeing if this place is available. Thanks Brooke!"
7804358,80727104,2016-06-19,61159331,Brittany,"Brooke was beyond accommodating. She arranged for us to have an early check-in, and then texted us on the first night to make sure we didn't need anything. The apartment itself lived up to the description online.

We did a little cooking in the well stocked kitchen but mostly ate at nearby restaurants (great Italian cuisine downstairs!). An easy walk to Boston Commons, downtown, North End and South End. I highly recommend a stay in Brooke's apartment. Compared to local hotels, this is a fantastic value."

A beautiful house and room to stay in with everything you need and spacious at that. Lorna was a great host, very kind and interactive. We loved the city and the games we went to (lucked out and were able to get front row green monster seats for the bosox/baseball fans) we definitely plan on making a longer trip to see more next time, and you can bet we'll be staying with Lorna again!"

6655012,70547867,2016-04-18,1663946,Debra,I had a very nice experience at Lorna's Retreat.  The room was clean and comfortable.  Lorna and her husband Rob were friendly and accommodating.  Rob is an Uber and Lyft driver so we were able to organize my pick up at the airport for a reasonable rate.   The location is away from downtown Boston but it is easy enough to go back and forth by public transportation.
6655012,72046495,2016-04-30,65234321,Mayra,Lorna was not very sensitive of our late arrival. We were traveling far and came to move my daughter out of her dorm room and I felt extremely pressured to arrive early due to the constant contact from her. In addition to this she was upset about us bringing more than two people despite us having rented both rooms and asked for specific permission to bring a blow up mattress which she had originally accepted.
6655012,72634930,2016-05-04,63115671,Rafael,Our experience was amazing! Lorna was very professional and caring. She responded to my messages in a timely manner. The home was clean and cozy. The room was organized and all amenities were in good condition. It was quiet and peaceful. I highly recommend this space to anyone who looking for a good Airbnb place.
6655012,75000921,2016-05-18,71749158,Zhang,Friendly host!Good experience!
6655012,75920759,2016-05-23,67047020,Andrea,"Lorna was a great host. There was no trouble getting into our accommodation, and when we arrived, we had a choice of which room we wanted! There was a kitchen and a porch too, and our room was nice, though a bit stuffy. The bathroom was clean and good too. There was also a cat! Anyway, we very greatly enjoyed our stay. One should note that it is a bit far from central Boston, though Uber is really cheap to the city center from here. Lorna was also very quick to respond to all my questions ever since I started asking her about her listing (even before booking with her). Great accommodation at a great price, would recommend!"
6655012,81144526,2016-06-21,77481737,Vignesh,Lorna was very sweet and welcomed me in warmly. The room was clean and well lit. I enjoyed the stay there and would definitely come back.
6655012,84092856,2016-07-05,25118098,Nishchint,Lorna was a very nice host to us. She was very communicative while I was inquiring about the property and extremely courteous when we were checking-in. We were driving down from Montreal and got delayed due to 4th of July traffic. I reached past midnight which most of the airbnb hosts won't be okay with (reaching at 8pm has been too late in some of thre Airbnbs I stayed in the past.) but she welcomed us with a smile.
"Parking was convenient on July 4th. I got a good nights sleep.\"",,,,,
6655012,87759744,2016-07-21,83818876,Matthew,Lorna was an excellent host. We decided to do a last minute trip to Boston and she was quick to respond and very accomadating. She provided everything we needed and even went above and beyond to make sure our stay was good. Thank you again Lorna.

6655012,94373160,2016-08-15,48573485,Rasheed,A really great place to stay. The hosts were amazingly hospitable to my girlfriend and me. Worth much more than every penny we spent.
6655012,96916595,2016-08-25,87099256,Fran,My hosts were both there to greet us and arrange for parking of two cars...which in itself is an amazing benefit in Boston.
They showed us around the house and revealed the amenities.,,,,,
The room was large and bathroom and kitchen had everything you could want.,,,,,
Sliding door from kitchen to the large backyard deck offered quiet and serene setting at night.,,,,,

Not only were they hospitable and accommodating, but they also made sure to educate me in regards to how to best prepare myself for my move to Boston. Literally every single question I had was answered and then some! Now, in regards to this house and its many amenities, I found both to be on par with what was described.

When she greeted us, she left muni pass, and magazines about Boston as well as she came up with some recommendations of what to do, where to eat and park the car. Her apartment  is very clean and close to public transportation, however, Lyft or Uber was only $8 from downtown."
10328539,88995567,2016-07-26,13928381,Rashmi,Well Giesel was nice host .She coordinated well. The only thing annoying was check out time was 11 and they have asked us to clean the rroomby 9 am morning and asked us to come in living room for that period so that was little bit annoying . Rest the location is great

They even offered us lemon bars for breakfast. We will definitely consider staying here again.
10328539,95828789,2016-08-21,82284522,Courtney,"Gisel and Craig were very welcoming and the room was very nice. I thought it would be difficult to stay in an apartment with another couple, but that was not the case.  I highly recommend staying with Gisel."

We had our own space and rarely ran in to each other or heard them.  The apartment was beautiful and very clean. Gisel offered us blueberry muffins one morning, which was a great treat. It was located about 20 min transit ride from downtown, but there were a few restaurants and shops near by as well. Parking was our main issue, but there was a pay parking down the street and Sundays were free on the street. Overall, we had a great time and I would recommend this place!"

The bed linens and towels were freshly laundered and crisp. There were plenty of toiletries for use in the shower. I slept wonderfully as the bed was comfortable and the neighborhood was quiet.
The subway is close to the house and it is an easy ride into the city. There are very few grocery options near to the house unfortunately. And the ones that are close are convenience stores selling junk food. Dunkin Donuts is nearby. If you won't have a car,plan for what you'd like to do for food if you want to have healthy options.,,,,
Steven offered to drive me to the airport for a fee. It was very nice to have this convenient option. I appreciated it.,,,,,

The apartment was very clean and quiet, just what we needed after 2 nights of camping. We really appreciated the air conditioning in our room as we arrived in Boston in a  really hot day. Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to know our host because we enjoyed the time we had to see a local band and explore the city. However, it has meant that he was available for advice on the city if we wanted. In short, thank you very much for staying with you Stevens, we enjoyed."

It's well furnished - we didn't cook but it would have been very easy to if we wished. He provides plenty of goodies for his guests (we took advantage of some airbnb beers on the first night). We had plenty of privacy while we were there. I would absolutely recommend staying with Steven - I know I will if I'm in Boston in the future. He's a great host and I enjoyed getting to know him.

If you're looking for a Boston location near transit,and walking just the couple minutes to get to the brightly lit Ashmont station on the red line is not an issue,you should absolutely check this out.  It's exactly as described,clean and modern,and you have wi fi so you can stay connected.  I especially enjoy the back porch overlooking the back yard.,

2794782,39353858,2015-07-22,17850606,Jj,"The pictures accurately reflected the interior. The neighborhood is sketchy with the Ashton stop off the subway. It was quite a hike up the hill in the heat with bags and than climbing many narrow, winding stairs to get to the third floor apartment. I had a hard time locating a lock box combo and the unit and was not sure if I was at the right place - host did text back to help navigate me through these (URL HIDDEN) was a bit of a scavenger hunt and also the living condition was 3 bedrooms with a single bathroom - reminded me of a hostel. It was a wait for shower and bathroom time."
A few suggestions to the future air bnb traveler to this site -plan accordingly:  this is a 30 minute subway ride to Harvard Square;  neighborhood is very limited to services and understood it has an active crime rate from locals; if looking for a place to crash - this unit is fine for cleanliness and is located close enough to the T transport. Be prepared for a hike to the house and the ability to conquer many flights of granite steps and interior narrow,"windy stairs with luggage. Be aware of the activity on the street when walking. \"",,,,

He was travelling by himself, but even though kept in touch with us to answer questions and to make sure that everything is alright  The apartment looked exactly as on the pictures, was very clean and there was everything you needed. We also used the washing machine in the basement which was great so we did not have to search for a laundry. I would stay at Stevens House again!"
2794782,95136948,2016-08-18,38802114,Ryan,"Steven was a splendid and accommodating host who did his finest in meeting my arguably demanding needs. Throughout our stay, he would constantly make an effort to check up on my mum and I - in order to see whether we feel comfortable or not."
As for his home,it was simply terrific. Location wise,it was a mere 5 minutes walk from the subway station. The neighborhood was calm,and quiet,and felt relatively safe. The room itself was quite spacious,"and the availability of an air con ensured that my mom and I wouldn't \"\"melt\"\" from the summer heat. Overall"
6377998,41748159,2015-08-09,24042718,Yakup,Lizz and Helder were great. Lizz was very friendly and welcoming. They were available all the time and helped us with all of our needs.  The house is well located 10-15 mins away from down town and other points of interest. The availability of a parking space was a plus for us. The back yard is very plesent for summer nights.  We highly recommend the house.
6377998,42366645,2015-08-12,39740556,Arthur,A comfortable house with lots of atmosphere and a well stocked kitchen.

6377998,66479504,2016-03-22,59724806,Nicklaus,Helder welcomed us warmly and showed us around her lovely house. Our party of 10 was able to sleep comfortably as there was enough rooms and beds. The location is very convenient and Helder was very willing to tell us how to get around town with public transportation.
6377998,68330493,2016-04-04,5212841,Adam,We loved staying in this house. The house is grand and sleeps 12 comfortably. Nice outdoor patio area. The host was very responsive and getting in/out was no problem. Kitchen was well-stocked with cookware and plates. Huge dining room and family room for big groups to convene. Would absolutely book again.
6377998,70770915,2016-04-20,41506415,Andrew,"This house made our trip to Boston to run the marathon very easy. The house was actually more spacious than I expected with enough bedroom space for all eight of us plus a large enough kitchen and living room for us all to hang out. The proximity to the orange line allowed us to easily get places like the Hynes Convention Center for the race expo, the Boston Commons race morning and all the sightseeing we wanted to do including getting to Fenway Park for a Red Sox game. Also, there was a small park down the street where we could get a little jogging in the days before the race. Helder allowed us to arrive before the official 2:00 P.M. check in and seemed very flexible. I would definitely consider staying in this house with a large group again."
6377998,71473905,2016-04-25,7158612,Michael,"The house was clean and well prepared for our group. We had plenty of space and the owners were extremely gracious with their accommodations.

Sam Adams brewery is a 5 min walk. Transit is super easy with either 10$ uber dt or subway which is 19$ for three days. Would recommend especially for large groups.

The house was great (perfect for our staff retreat - probably could have handled 15 people pretty easily other than beds)."
11067772,68520591,2016-04-05,10983337,Pierre,Renting with Kama was simply great and next time I will go to Boston I will be contacting Kama again.  The whole process from booking confirmation to check- out was smooth and Kama really made an effort to help us feel comfortable.
The apartment I originally booked had a water leak a couple of days before our arrival. Kama has thus set us up with an even better apartment closer to the city. The place we ended up staying at was wonderful and very well organized as well as practical.,,,,,
Also,Kama gave us extensive information and suggestions for neighborhoods to look at while in Boston. Kama is a real estate agent and therefore has a good overview of the city.,,,,
Thanks again Kama!,,,,,

11067772,75316237,2016-05-20,38766876,Kelly,"This was my first time using Airbnb.  Kama called to make sure we didn't have any trouble getting into the apartment, and also checked in during the week to make sure everything was going well.  She answered all my questions about the area.  The apartment was very clean.  It's in a great location with a bus stop right out front and within a 10 minute walk to the B,C,& D train lines. There's a coffee shop and restaurants right across the street."
11067772,76376284,2016-05-26,64834733,Soham,Our stay was comfortable and everything was as in the pictures on the site. The house was very clean and extra sheets and towels were provided.

The kitchen/dining area were very small, but complete with everything we wanted or needed."
While we didn't get a chance to meet with Kama during our trip because of our arrival and departure times,she was very communicative and left a very thorough guide to the apartment and the area. She checked in with us to make sure everything was going well,"and was quick to respond. \"",,,

11067772,87039661,2016-07-18,41251522,Sam,"Kama's description was everything to be hoped for.  The location was easily accessible and parking plentiful.  We had no trouble getting there, accessing the apartment and checking out.  We were late arrivers and early departers and the process was smooth and unobtrusive.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice quiet stay.  The only thing I would caution is that the apt is a bit small so if you have four people and do not share the bed it is a bit crowded."
11067772,88036834,2016-07-23,43227945,Ben,The apt on Chestnut Hill was the perfect location for our trip.  once I found street parking getting around via the T and Iber was so convenient.  The apt is not large (I'd say 3 adults with luggage for extended international travel is capacity) but it is clean and has all the conveniences of home.
"the neighborhood is quiet and safe.  Being close to BC and BU also means plenty of conveiences nearby.\"",,,,,

11067772,89031178,2016-07-26,34843071,Lauren,"Kama was very responsive and helpful throughout. Overall, the unit was small, but cozy as advertised. The bed was comfy, but the pull-out couch was difficult to use and its mattress was rather thin and uncomfortable for sleeping."
My biggest concern is that this unit is clearly a nice studio apartment that has been taken off the market and re-purposed for use as a full-time rental unit,which contributes to Boston's housing shortage. I didn't fully realize it when I booked the unit,"but it's not the model of AirBnB spaces that I personally wish to support. \"",,,
11067772,90535247,2016-08-01,70079439,Lauren,Perfect for a weekend stay in Boston.

We also had access to a fully equipped kitchen, a cozy living room, and a nice patio in the back. Overall, the house has a lot of character.

6425405,38610713,2015-07-17,4248287,Ruby,It was real pleasant from the get go renting this fenway studio. The communication with Victor was easy and that was really comforting especially when you are traveling from half way accross the world.
Victor's studio is nice and homey. It is equiped with a lift and a laundry facility,which is most helpful. A 24 hour supermarket is just a 2 minute walk and a row of small restaurants of authentic thai,persian and mexican is a 5 minute walk. What I enjoyed the most is the compact yet quite complete kitchen with a cute breakfast nook area.,,,
I travelled with my husband and 2 kids of 7 and 15 and 3 large luggages. The studio fit us quite comfortably,although we were in the studio mostly only to sleep and to eat breakfast.,,,,

She greeted us as soon as we arrived to the apartment, and even had refreshments waiting for us! The apartment is exactly as pictured, so there were no surprises there. What was surprising, was that it's on the 4th floor. There is an elevator in the building; it's a little frightening, but that's just because we are not used to old elevators."
The location was perfect. A block away is one of the busiest streets in Boston,and there was a ton of nightlife,and lots of great places to eat. It's also a stone's throw away from Fenway Park,and while we were there,the Foo Fighters were playing,so we were able to hear them while walking around.

7462268,39468374,2015-07-23,13413108,Daniel,"Yi was an excellent host and my experience at this property was great!  My travel plans changed a bit during transit but Yi was more than accommodating after I had to change check-in times twice.  Additionally, the bedroom was very comfortable and the bathroom is great.  Yi even helped me print something last minute the next morning!  I could not give this place a more positive review."
7462268,39879632,2015-07-26,36144277,Carlos,"Yi is a friendly guy. If I had any questions or if I had to contact him, he replied within minutes. He made the move in process really simple, and gave me a tour of the whole apartment. The apartment was perfectly clean, I don't think I could find a speck of dust if I tried."
The room was also spacious and clean. The AC in one window is perfect for hot nights but you could also sleep with the other window open. The bed was comfortable and had fresh sheets. The neighborhood itself is safe,and also super quiet over the weekend when I stayed. Overall,"a 10/10 stay! \"",,,
7462268,42736013,2015-08-15,39342838,Krysten,"Yi was a great host. He was responsive and helpful. The room was clean, spacious, and comfortable. My husband was in Cambridge for interviews, so we needed an iron. Yi made sure to have one ready in the closet on our arrival. The bathroom was very nice with a great shower. There's a bus stop nearby, making getting around pretty easy. We would come back again."
7462268,43471157,2015-08-19,37540760,Yi,The host canceled this reservation 13 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7462268,44007798,2015-08-23,39471312,Daniel,"Yi was a great host. My arrival, departure, and everything in between went very smoothly. Nice bedroom, modern bathroom, and an extra microwave and fridge for guest use."
7462268,61472266,2016-02-04,846598,Chandni,Joe our host was very welcoming. The house was clean. He gave us a house tour and provided us with clean towels. The room has a space heater which kept us very warm. Overall we enjoyed our stay. There is parking space which was a plus point.

7462268,61598874,2016-02-06,1397408,Jeremy,Joe was timely with communications.  The setup is great as a crash pad if you just need a place to lay your head down.  I was unclear on the fact the bathroom was communal between a few rooms—but it was no real problem as I saw no trace of other guests while I was there.  Everything was clean.
7462268,61706268,2016-02-07,30756012,Sandhya,The room was perfect for a one night stay before I moved on to the HBS campus. Joe was extremely cooperative and took time to answer all my queries. Location is excellent and I loved the short walk to the restaurants and stores (all of which Joe was happy to point me to). Thanks for laying out flip flops too!
7462268,62461186,2016-02-14,36145408,Liezel,Joe is an incredible host. He made me and my boyfriend feel very welcome and the description in 100% accurate.
7462268,63130976,2016-02-20,58629408,Faustino,"I have very good experience with Joe. He is really easy going. His house it is always clean. Marvelous to find such a beautiful place. Thanks Joe, his finance and Omar, just let me feellike home"
7462268,63677628,2016-02-25,26872684,Osama,Joe has a really great system here! It has the coziness of a house with amenities of a hotel! And very clean!
7462268,65429234,2016-03-13,61270625,James,"Joe is nice. The house is close to Harvard and the room is comfortable. But my neighbor sometimes made some noise by talking to his phone loudly after 10:30 pm. Another thing I have to mention is the trash bin had never been emptied in the bathroom, though it was already full, since I moved in. Fortunately, except that, the bathroom was clean. Overall, the experience is good."
7462268,65851635,2016-03-17,60824925,Abigail,Joe was very nice. The heater is the room was wonderful as it was cold when my friend and I visited. It is a very pretty room that was perfect for our trip. Very happy with choosing Joe and would 100% recommend him.
7462268,65926599,2016-03-18,49736620,Arthur,"Joe was a great host. He was there at the agreed time, showed me the house and the room, answered any questions, and then left me to my own devices. I was only there for one night so I didn't see much of him after that, but it was a good bed in a comfortable room."
7462268,68356377,2016-04-04,57762312,Matteo,Joe was a very nice host! The bedroom and the flat were great and clean. It was very easy to go to central Boston and to Harvard University.  It was just excellent! I was completely satisfied with this accommodation.
7462268,68801999,2016-04-06,64536972,Bob,The place was exactly as described and Joe was there to meet / greet me and explain everything. Super comfy and convenient for a quick trip in and out.
7462268,70218772,2016-04-17,4700495,Maja,"Staying at Joe's for a short period of time was great. It is out of busy downtown Boston, but luckily we got a T-pass to get around. Access to public transportation in Boston is great, and from the house to the bus is only a short walk. The listing is accurate, however, one thing I'd want to note is that the common areas in the house are cool (i.e. washrooms, kitchen, halls). We had a heater in our room, which kept us warm, but pack some slippers and extra sweaters if you're the type of person who gets cold. Other than that, staying here was good. Although there were other guests, we never had an issue with using the bathroom or kitchen area- it's as if we were on our own."
7462268,70477592,2016-04-18,57937006,John,Joe did a great job. Truly hospitable. Did exactly what he said he would. Texted from the airport which isn't far away and he was waiting for us when we arrived to show us around and get us settled in. We were in town for the Boston Marathon and a little nervous but thanks to Joe our accomadations were no reason to worry. Above and beyond at a a bargain price.
7462268,71584418,2016-04-26,63582779,Joy,Wauw what a nice place!
So easy to have your own parking spot next to the house. The location was great. The room was exactly like the pictures and was very clean,neat and useful. It was really quit in the house.,,,,
"We really enjoyed staying here.\"",,,,,
7462268,74210266,2016-05-14,44530649,Sarah,"Joe was very welcoming and showed me around the house. The place and the room was clean and quiet.  I liked how there's a parking lot, so no street parking!"
7462268,76093660,2016-05-24,60469842,Pratik,The host precontacted us about our arrival and everything was coordinated spot on.
The room was exactly as per the listing.,,,,,
"The neighbourhood was very nice and extremely safe. We could come and go as we required and at all or any time.\"",,,,,
7462268,76947634,2016-05-29,55816348,Margarita,"Un lugar limpio y seguro, con un anfitrión amable. Excelente opción para familiares que ocupaban estar cerca de Harvard para la graduación."
7462268,77462545,2016-06-01,39288324,Morgan,"Joe was a great host. The room was clean and welcoming. Bed was very comfortable. It's a nice space to have to yourself as well, since this has more a feel of a boarding house with others there who are renting rooms or using Airbnb. The location was pretty good as well, with easy bus access to Cambridge and the train to get around the city."
7462268,77862161,2016-06-04,11366671,Ben,"Quiet, clean, and convenient. The place is as described. Roommates are friendly and considerate. A great home base to knock out a bit of work and attend meetings near Harvard. Joe made it easy for me to check in even though I arrived after midnight."
7462268,78042805,2016-06-05,20150719,Yuki,Joe is a flexible and helpful host. His place is clean and quiet. It was awesome to stay there.
"Highly recommended :)\"",,,,,
7462268,78098935,2016-06-05,35720173,Kriti,The room D was clean and neat. As was the bathroom. Joe was very responsive regards to check in and check out. We never really met him as we just came in late at night and left early in the morning.
7462268,79199165,2016-06-11,66618882,Darci,Wonderful location. Bus stop right at the corner.  (Bus 66 gets you to where you need to go) Nice restaurants within walking distance.  (Loved Allston Cafe for breakfast) Good internet.  We really enjoyed our stay.
7462268,80537457,2016-06-18,22034145,Antonio,"Joe y su mujer son encantadores. La habitación es cómoda y limpia y su ubicación es perfecta para la HBS. También está muy bien conectada con Harvard Square. Además, si lo pides Joe te puede recoger y llevar al aeropuerto a un precio muy razonable. Lo recomiendo totalmente."
7462268,83640094,2016-07-03,40052513,Steve,"Joe was on his way to Jamaica to be married! on the last day of my three-day stay, and he still made sure that I was comfortable and asked if I needed anything. I attended a conference in Cambridge and walked the mile down and back on N. Harvard St. to the campus each day--no problems whatsoever. I could have taken the bus if I had needed to. Joe's AirBNB is clean, secure, and properly fitted with kitchen and bathroom facilities--all fine. I agree with the other reviewers that for the price and location you are getting a bargain. The neighborhood is an old one, but I always felt safe, with a lot of students, tourists, and working class families. Parking at Joe's is plentiful. Congratulations on your marriage!"
7462268,85797088,2016-07-13,77129134,Nick,The room was very clean as were the bathrooms and kitchen. The bed was also very comfortable. Bathrooms featured shampoo and body was for public use which was a plus along with good wifi and air conditioning. The neighborhood was safe and populated with many students. Conveniently located about a mile from Harvard and Boston University. Many great places too eat are also a 10~ minute walk from the room. Joe was also very helpful in returning an earring to me that I had left in the room. Would definitely stay again.
7462268,97264637,2016-08-26,15799803,Vid,"Staying in Lower Allston at Joe and Nancy's place was fantastic! I am a medical student and was studying at the Massachusetts General Hospital for 6 weeks so it was really important for me to find a place that was clean, private, comfortable, safe and friendly with easy access to Harvard Square/ the red line/ the hospital. Joe's place provided all of this and more!"
The room was spacious and clean with air conditioning and a heater. I had easy access to all the facilities I needed including a fully equipped kitchen,laundry facilities and 2 bathrooms. Joe went above and beyond to make sure I had everything I needed and went out and bought an ironing board when I asked if one was available for me to iron my shirts with! All the guests that stayed during my 6 weeks were also respectful and friendly which made my trip even better.,,,,
The house is in a pleasant residential area which is quiet at night time but close to all important amenities. The nearest supermarket was only 10 minutes walk away and the number 66 bus route had a stop at the top of the road and had a regular service every 5-10 minutes which took me into Harvard Square within 10 minutes.,,,,,
"Between my excellent hosts and the fantastic location I felt completely at home during my stay and would recommend Joe's place to anyone looking visit Boston without paying the ridiculous price of downtown hotels. It was an absolute pleasure to get to know him and his wife Nancy and I hope they stay in touch in the future. I wish you both all the best! \"",,,,,
7462268,98550693,2016-08-31,90128094,Arianna,The room itself and the aprtment were very clean. Joe provided many amenities such as shampoo and towels. Overall I'm very pleased!
