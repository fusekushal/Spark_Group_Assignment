Im Dezember 2014 wohnte ich (53,erste Erfahrung mit airbnb) zweimal für mehrere Tage in der Wohnung von Yosef und James. Yosef war in dieser Zeit bei seinen Eltern und ich wohnte in seinem Zimmer,was,wie die gesamte Wohnung,sehr sauber und komfortabel war. Die Lage nahe Mission Hill und die kurze Entfernung zur nächsten Straßenbahnhaltestelle (green line) waren perfekt,auch für Ausflüge in das Stadtzentrum.
Die Kommunikation vorab war schnell und ausführlich und das Einchecken absolut unproblematisch. Yosef und sein Mitbewohner James waren perfekte,freundliche und angenehme Gastgeber.,,,,
Bei meinem nächsten Aufenthalt in Boston würde ich diese Wohngelegenheit auf jeden Fall einem Hotel vorziehen und würde gerne wieder bei Yosef und James wohnen.,,,,,

4687499,25366311,2015-01-13,10825332,Xin,"Amazing apartment, clean and cozy ! Yosef and his flat mate James are super nice host. Highly recommended this apartment."
4687499,27821750,2015-03-12,5928854,Tarek,"Yosefs room was exactly as advertised. Very comfortable and his housemate James who hosted me was very courteous and welcoming. The location is perfect because of proximity to the green line train and the conference I was attending. I recommend this to anyone visiting Boston and wants an affordable, clean place to stay with easy mobility by train."
4687499,28017287,2015-03-16,27604755,Jonathan,"This place was great! Yosef was really helpful and accomodating. James is one of most down to earth guys. These guys really made our stay enjoyable. The flat is down the street from a T stop which made traveling around very easy. If you get the chance, I recommend trying to stay here."
4687499,32115676,2015-05-14,3124355,Nektaria,"Yosef is a wonderful host!  He went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable in his home and was easy to get a hold of before and during our stay.  The space was clean, spacious and exactly as pictured in the posting.  The main floor of the unit houses the living room, kitchen and bathroom, with the bedrooms and full bathroom on the lower floor-very convenient setup.  Felt right at home and had plenty of uninterrupted time to unwind.  Highly recommend this place!"
4687499,32377268,2015-05-17,31098287,Jamielyn,"This place was awesome. Super trendy and well kept! Yosef and his flat mate James were extremely hospitable. Even though Yosef was out of town, he made sure to keep in touch. Thanks for a wonderful experience:)"
4687499,34444573,2015-06-08,15297345,Ida,"Bel accueil, facile d'accès à Boston, près d'une ligne de tramway: super!"
4687499,35097664,2015-06-15,13811569,Severine,"This was such a perfect room for the type of trip we were taking! We really only needed a place to crash, and Josef's room was more than adequate (even if we had needed to spend more time there it would have been great). It was nicely decorated, the bed was super comfortable with a nice big TV and the wifi was super fast. Another huge perk is that this room has its own private door to enter and exit out of, so you don't ever need to go through the main door if you don't feel like it. The bathroom is shared with Josef's roommate but it's a big  (well lit, for the ladies) bathroom and we were never in each others way. The neighborhood was very centrally located, which made it extremely convenient to get on the train or bus to get anywhere in the city. I will definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Boston."
4687499,35401704,2015-06-18,34199892,Rekha,"We were received by James who made us feel very welcome and at home.  The place was comfortable and relaxing.  We spent most of the time sight seeing, and getting transportation was a breeze, the green line.  The food options were also many and within walking distance.  Loved watching Netflix and HBO."
4687499,49980003,2015-10-08,10231384,Connie,"Although the location is not in downtown, it's very closed to green line, within 1 min walk.and u can go anywhere by the green line. We didn't met the host during our stay but jimmy helped us to move in , he is really a nice guy."
4687499,50203105,2015-10-10,41613425,Doris,"We had a great time in Yosef's apartment and enjoyed it a lot to stay there. His wife and roommate were very friendly and welcoming and were very flexible about the time we arrived and left. The apartment is really comfortable, the bed is cozy and more than big enough for the two of us. Public transportation was just accross the street and it took us only 40 minutes to get to the airport and downtown can be reached in a short time without even changing the train."
"It was defintely a good choice to stay with Yosef.\"",,,,,
4687499,50848068,2015-10-15,42834133,Gwijde,De advertentie geeft niet duidelijk aan of de huurders alleen beschikten over het appartement. De badkamer en de living moeten delen met enkel vrienden van de eigenaar is onvoldoende in de aankondiging opgenomen.
4687499,51299956,2015-10-19,7016616,Kimberly,My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Yousef's flat over a recent weekend. The accomodations were as described. The bed was super comfortable (something you don't often find when staying away from home)! We loved the super-convenient location for easy access to public transportion - a T and bus stop a short walk down the street.
4687499,55627528,2015-12-03,49026075,Véronique,Yosef has been a great host! The room is nice and big and well located just in front of bus and metro stop. I got a chance to go for runs in the morning in the park close by so that was convenient. I experienced 2 little problems with the accommodation and Yosef dealt very promptly with them even from a distance (Yosef wasn't there when I stayed at his place). Great experience.
4687499,57497817,2015-12-26,6834149,Ya,The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4687499,61686892,2016-02-07,5081917,Nicolas,I had a wonderful stay in Yosef's appartment. Everything as decribed - thank you.
4687499,63980857,2016-02-28,59816766,Kenneth,Great host overall!
4687499,66776450,2016-03-24,60681748,Alvaro,"La casa es muy cómoda y acogedora, adicional mente esta muy bien ubicada, cerca de las de las lineas E y D lo que lo hace un lugar bastante conveniente. James quien es el roommate de Yosef es una persona muy atenta y esta dispuesto a ayudarlo a uno con lo que se necesite."
4687499,68355153,2016-04-04,44893199,Colin,"The place is very charming just as advertised. Yosef was very accommodating, had great suggestions for things to do near by and in Boston in general. Very close to public transportation so its really easy to get around. We had a great time in Boston, and calling this place home for a few days made it even better. Highly recommended."
4687499,69338901,2016-04-10,10010239,Jan,"Big apartment. Yosef let us in and was caring for everything. Even ordered new towels. Enjoyed our stay. Clean, comfy and a lot of space. Thanks."
4687499,70676072,2016-04-19,45283305,Gibson,Yosef was great. He made us feel at home right away. With all the planning prior to the trip he was very helpful. All his help and feedback with our stay in Boston was invaluable: transportation direction restaurants recommendations and running routes were great. His place was nice and clean and a perfect location for our stay. The neighborhood was good. very diverse which we love with great restaurants and grocery shopping close by. Saturday night was a little loud in the outside alley but that did not last too long.
4687499,71153247,2016-04-24,66130759,Christian,"Yosef and James are excellent hosts! They were very welcoming that we felt we were part of the household as well. Very accommodating and provided great suggestions for not only food and drinks, but also for activities and living (I am moving to Boston). Excellent roommates and very responsive. Glad we stayed and met new friends!"
4687499,71692901,2016-04-27,66486042,Melissa,"I would definitely stay here again. I stayed with my 23-year-old son. And while we had bus & traffic issues trying to get to Boston from NYC, I stayed in contact with Yosef and he happily waited for us until we arrived at 10:30 PM, hours later than expected.  Yosef  lives elsewhere but his roommate, Jimmy, was also very nice and hospitable.  We had the place to ourselves most of the time since Jimmy worked and had full access to everything in the kitchen, living room, and bathrooms. The bedroom was perfect with a queen-size bed and even fit the air mattress he provided for my son."
"We felt safe in the neighborhood and it was right in front of the \"\"T\"\"",a subway (streetcar?) stop,so highly convenient to anywhere you want to go. There is a Chinese place and a pizza place half a block away,both open until 3 AM.,,
"Everything was clean and comfortable and Yosef was always available for questions.  Felt like home.\"",,,,,

They made us feel comfortable and free in their home, were flexible with check-in/check-out times, and provided us with just about everything we could want or need: towels, coffee, their hubway key (Boston bike share membership), extra keys, a list of recommended restaurants in town, etc. I highly recommend them!"

1252289,13674440,2014-06-02,14493433,Carl,"Chris and Claire are lovely hosts, who went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and welcome in their home. They provided a ton of local knowledge and were very helpful whenever we had questions. They're located on a quiet street, close to a lot of restaurants and amenities. We really enjoyed the exceptionally comfortable bed, and the newly renovated kitchen and bathroom. It was a wonderful experience."
1252289,16249087,2014-07-24,14147368,Nina,Chris and Claire are wonderful hosts. They are very friendly and helpful. They answered any question I had. I felt very comfortable in their home the all month I spent there. They give a lot of good informations about Boston and the neighborhood.
The location of the apartment is great. There is a very close bus stop and Southend is a really nice Boston area with a lot of good restaurants.The apartment is very cosy and the kitchen and bathroom just renovated are really perfect.,,,,,

1252289,18525477,2014-08-28,3351447,Ana Maria,"We rented this perfect room for my mother for a month and the experience was great. Chris and Claire are very organized and their home is very clean.

The neighborhood is awesome too, very quiet and safe; there are several good restaurants within walking distances. Overall, it was a very nice stay and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a short visit to the City of Boston."
1252289,22750851,2014-11-13,934195,Marie-Claire,This was my first Airbnb experience and Claire and Chris made sure that it was a good one.

To add to that, Claire and Chris are excellent hosts and treat you more like a friend than a house guest.  If you stay there, remember to take time to enjoy all the wonderful prints."

It's conveniently located in a beautiful neighborhood, very close to bus stops, great coffee shops and restaurants. Claire and Chris are accommodating, friendly and easygoing hosts that make you feel welcome at once. They gave us great recommendations for restaurants, breweries and other things to do in the area. Let us know in case you ever come to Munich, so that we can return the favor. ;) We highly recommend staying with Claire and Chris!"
1252289,34979207,2015-06-14,6249699,David,"Small but comfortable place to stay. House is kept nice and clean. Very friendly hosts, in a quiet, convenient location. Close to public transit and the Hynes convention center. Chris and Claire went above and beyond in making me feel welcome!"
1252289,35369028,2015-06-18,28769972,Gill,"Chis & Claire are very welcoming and great hosts.  Helpful regarding transport options, restaurants and things to do locally. I definitely recommend this accommodation & hosts."
1252289,35921214,2015-06-23,13728344,Herman,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and I really like the concept. Chris and Claire are very nice and respectful hosts. They helped me very well in discovering the beautfiul city of Boston. Finally, they were very flexible. Thank you very much Chris and Claire for providing this experience to me!"
1252289,36291359,2015-06-27,33362396,Heather,"Chris and Claire were very accommodating on our arrival time. I had asked before booking if we would be able to arrive later than the check-in and there were no issues. However, we were certainly later than our original time due to traffic on our way to Boston. Chris was extremely understanding and he waited up to let us in the first night. The neighborhood was quiet, safe and not heavily trafficked from what we saw. We didn't really see Chris after our check-in and weren't able to meet Claire due to our opposite schedules but they were quick to respond to any communication through the messenger here. The room was a good size for all of our stuff. If you go without a plan Chris and Claire have a bunch of brochures for you to use during your stay. We felt very comfortable there and enjoyed our stay in Boston."

1252289,36883686,2015-07-02,4690589,Stefanie,"We were originally booked with another AirBnb in Boston and they had gotten some bad reviews after we'd booked, so I cancelled and found Chris & Claire - SO glad I did because we loved our stay in their apartment."
Claire & Chris were great with communication before and during our stay.  They were very welcoming when we first arrived and my husband and I both had wonderful conversations with Chris after our days of exploring the city.,,,,,
The apartment is on the ground floor which made it easy bringing in luggage.  It is beautifully decorated and quite clean - obviously C & C take pride in their home.,,,,,
The bed was very comfy.  Extra blankets were available which was  great the first night and a window cooling fan unit was also available if needed.  Plenty of space in the closet to hang clothes and store suitcase.  You do share a bathroom with C&C but their schedule had them out of the house before we were getting ready so this was no issue,and like the rest of the home,the bathroom was very clean.,,,
The apartment is in a perfect location in the South End.   It was very convenient (about 2-3 minutes walk) to the Silver Line bus routes which got us to and from Logan Airport in about 35-40 minutes each way.  Besides getting to the airport,we were able to walk everywhere with no problem,but if you don't feel like walking the Silver Line can get you right in the middle of things quick and cheap.,,,
Would highly recommend staying at Chris & Claire's South End Brownstone and plan to stay there again next time we're in Boston!,,,,,

Extremely clean, comfy bed, and their place is beautiful situated on a shaded square.

The locks are complicated but easy to remember which one is for which. I lived there for three days and only Clair was living in the place. She was helpful and gave me lists of restaurants around.

Came here for a residency interview at BMC and location was excellent as it was within walking distance to the hospital. Lots of warm personal touches to the space. And for someone like me who always runs cold, I very much appreciated an apartment with adjustable thermostats, space heaters, and warm soft fleece blankets!"

Chris was at the apartment at my arrival and gave me a tour of the place. The apartment and room were very clean. Amenities such as toiletries and towels were made available. There was a heater in the room to control the temperature (useful for the Boston winter). The neighborhood is quaint and located near many trendy restaurants and coffee shops. It is less than a five minute walk from Boston Medical Center, 20 minute walk from Back Bay. It is also a 5 minute walk from the Silver line to the airport and the 1 which goes into Back Bay and Cambridge. Overall, I highly recommend this place and enjoyed my stay with these friendly hosts!"
1252289,57502585,2015-12-27,25087302,Laura,Chris and Claire were our first ever air BnB experience. It was fantastic. The room was spacious with plenty of room to store our things and the empty cupboard with hangers made living out of a bag much nicer. Chris and Claire had a range of maps available for use and also a great knowledge of the area. No questions were too much and they also gave us space but were also very friendly. We enjoyed the area and found public transport was easy to access. We would definitely stay again!

The flat itself is a beautiful ground-level brownstone. I found the room to be extremely comfortable (especially the bed --- not sure if it's a memory foam mattress but seems like one) and well decorated (cool guitars on the wall). The shared bathroom is also quite nice with a rain shower head. Now I'm going to have to get one for myself at my house!,,,,,

Their apartment is very nice, very well located in South End area, close to many restaurants and a bus stop to Downtown (15 minutes) is just round the corner.

It was our first time using Airbnb and they made my experience a positive, so I know I will continue using it.  The location of the house was very easy to get to many places around Boston.

The room is very quiet and calm, and only the sounds that you hear from the hosts remind me of the existence of other humans. It's a fantastic place to do meditation and exercises in the early morning. You can stroll along the lake or take a train nearby"

It was in a great location for us, within walking distance to many places and in close proximity to the Boston College T. We would definitely say here on another trip to Boston."
9896713,60373577,2016-01-22,55057855,Selena,"A perfect place for a day or more. Very comfortable. A lovely setup. Clean. She provided water, juice and soda which I was surprised.

9896713,63931589,2016-02-28,46704519,Stacy,"I had to o clean the place (counter tops, floor) by myself before AND after. The plant by the corner of the living room continuously shed its leaves and i had to clean that to clean that up and it would get stuck to myhands and finger nails. I also had to clean the fridge of old food and drinks and salt spilt on the table top. I did all the dishes as well because the wine glasses were extremely dirty."
I also had to wait outside the house for  her arrival for well over 45 minutes. When i finally came into the house,the place was neither clean nor ready for accommodation. the heater also made extremely loud ticking noise. we could not sleep deepily because of that. ironically,heater didnt even work. the floors were cold and so was the air,especially the room,,
the explanation of the place is also extremely misleading. I rented it because the description said the whole apartment. however,your place have absolutely NO privacy whatsoever. What is beyond me is that there is a single door between your place and our bedroom. the description absolutely is  misleading. To make things worse,the door to the bathroom doesnt even have a lock. who has a privacy in this sort of space?,,,
"She alsp tried making me pay for 5 people when only 2 people stayed. she also said it is community and food id suppose to be in the fridge. it is NOT community when the milk in the fridge has already expired! \"",,,,,

Things to note:,,,,,
Travelling into the city with the T-Line (tram) takes an hour - 15 minute walk to the tram stop and about 45 minutes on the tram,which is very slow.,,,,
The apartment is situated at basement level,only 2 small windows at ceiling height and a larger one in the bedroom,"so there is not much natural light.\"",,,

The directions for entry were accurate and despite our late arrival we were able to enter and relax easily.

My sister and I were in town for a conference at Harvard Medical School, it was super quick and easy to get to where we needed to go; the area was great! We sat out on the porch drinking wine and eating food we got from Whole Foods which was only 10 minutes away. Erin was very nice and made checking in a breeze! Would definitely book again if we head back to Boston!"
9896713,69689932,2016-04-12,62286650,Vincent,"Erin was very accommodating and welcoming. Erin kept in contact with us the days and moments leading up to our trip to Boston. Then when she found out that my girlfriend and I were getting into Boston a bit earlier than expected, Erin got the place ready, despite having guests check out an hour before, to make sure we didn't have to wait around. So all we had to do was get the keys and settle in."
The place itself is great. Very quaint. It really feels like you're in Erin's home. The decor is lovely and feels personal. Very Pinterest based. She even has directions and information about the place worked into the decoration of the place.,,,,,
Even though we were there for one night,the fridge and the microwave came in handy. Had we been there for a few more nights,we would have certainly taken advantage of the rest of the kitchen.,,,
The location of the place itself is great as well. You're in a located in a nice residential neighborhood,so that means no city noise and craziness. You wake up to the calm of the area. Erin's place is also,literally,a few minutes walk from the Oak Square area where there are plenty of places to get food and coffee. The location also has PLENTY of street parking should you decide to rent a car.,,
Overall,Erin was an amazing host and her place was equally as amazing.,,,,
Thank you,Erin,for making our stay in Boston very welcoming and amazing.,,,

9896713,72879447,2016-05-05,447387,Ann,"This is a well appointed mini apartment in the basemen of an older home in an older neighborhood.  It met all our needs comfortably at a good price.  Guests should know a bit of a steep staircase is involved.  Besides providing a full set of excellent appliances and a comfortable and well functioning bathroom, the renovated space has many charming artistic touches.  It took us awhile but we did figure out how close we were to Brighton, Alston, Harvard etc.  Erin was a cordial and responsive host."
9896713,73384888,2016-05-08,16064685,Noely,"My stay at Erin's was short but extremely pleasant! The location is very quiet but easy to find, the studio is so beautifully decorated and incredibly cozy. I was able to utilize the kitchenette to bake muffins so that also came in handy. Erin is also hospitable, responsive and very timely. Definitely would stay again!"

Erin was incredibly responsive and was able to get the place ready for us very quickly despite a small check-out hiccup with the previous guest. Overall, a great stay!"
9896713,74861876,2016-05-17,65574956,Brynne,The place was very nice and clean. Perfect for a quick trip down to Boston. Thanks!

9896713,75465114,2016-05-21,17344773,Justin & Rachel,The basement space was spacious and clean.  Access to the house and parking out front were a breeze!  And the walk to the Green Line could not have been simpler or more convenient.  Erin and Ryan were great hosts and made communication quite easy.  Thanks again!!!
9896713,75749875,2016-05-22,53434642,Rob,"Listing was easy to Find and perfect for what we need. A clean, quiet place to stay. Parking was easy and access to Downtown Boston was very quick on mass turnpike.  We were on the waterfront in less than 15 minutes from the apartment."
9896713,75933532,2016-05-23,52360778,Marc,Erin and Ryan's place was very comfortable and clean. The space was tastefully decorated and well equipped. Erin was very accommodating and was flexible with our arrival and departure times. I'd say more great things but they've all been mentioned in previous reviews.

9896713,76514803,2016-05-27,53359834,Chin,This place is nice and clean.  Free parking on the street is a big plus. Erin is quick to respond to our requests.  We have enjoyed our stay very much.

9896713,79094021,2016-06-11,20845563,Miranda,"The place is beautiful. For our needs as there were 3 of us traveling. 1 queen size bed and 1 bedroom with two pull out couches. 1 in a living room and the other in the kitchen. Fridge , toaster over and microwave. Sink and shower. It's a basement suite situation."
You have to park on the street so a little miscommunication there. Erin was very responsive but only through text. So it was a bummer to us that we never met once.,,,,,
"The location is a 15 minute walk to Boston college T ( it's there version of the metro but it more closely resembles a mix of street cars with some metro so its extremely slow and it took us an hour to an hour and a half to get to the downtown Boston and Cambridge areas. The buses are faster and it can take anywhere from 30 minutes if you take the highway bus to 45 minutes with the regular bus system. But the metro card work for both the buses and t system just not the highway bus. So if it important to you to be more in a hub area the location is the best but if you don't mind the commute or have more stuff going on at the Boston college area it's perfect. \"",,,,,
9896713,80924876,2016-06-20,58841430,Catherine,"Erin's place was great! Great location, easy access, spacious, clean and we'll decorated. She provided everything we needed! I definitely recommend staying here!"

9896713,81548073,2016-06-23,61707584,James,Erin's place is really nice!  The stairs are very steep down to the apt so people should know that. Also the pull out couch/bed is not very functional. For two people this is a perfect place. We enjoyed staying here and highly recommend it. The area is great and apt had everything you need. Thanks Erin. We enjoyed our stay.
9896713,82365137,2016-06-27,29033810,Ben,The description was accurate and the location was very convenient to get the the surrounding areas. A very good value for the area.
9896713,83013226,2016-06-30,6138079,Melissa,"Our stay at this location was wonderful! Erin was the sweetest and that back porch was so relaxing. My husband and I enjoyed a glass of wine every night on the back porch, while my 2 young boys played in the yard and looked at her amazing vegetable garden. The location was quiet and we felt very safe. There was plenty of on street parking at all times. I highly recommend this place."

Since it is located in a quite neighbourhood, It was nice to wake up and listen to the birds instead to the traffic. The place is a bit tight for a family of four but it would be perfect for a couple or a family of three. Erin was always responsive to our questions and communication was easy. We enjoyed staying here for the long weekend."
9896713,84136404,2016-07-05,31153466,Jose,Great little place to stay. Has everything you need for your stay.
9896713,84738496,2016-07-08,51052509,Tanisha,Lovely set up! Such a comfortable place to relax. Great amount of space for two people. Nice and quiet away from the city centre but still a quick drive away.

9896713,87415295,2016-07-20,57538760,Sharon,"Erin's place was perfect for me! I was within walking distance to Boston College, my reason for visiting Boston. I was also within walking distance to several restaurants. The apartment was clean, quaint, and as described. Erin was equal parts friendly and unassuming. She introduced herself and her very sweet pup, Velvet, who I hope to meet again! She communicated as needed, informed us of any pertinent details, and was responsive to my questions via text. She also gave us plenty of privacy. I hope to visit again soon."
9896713,87794029,2016-07-21,40068583,Kierstan,The basement apartment at Erin and Ryan's was a home away from home.  Quiet neighborhood about a 25 minute uber ride to downtown Boston.  The apartment really gave us a quiet place to relax after sight seeing.  Would definitely recommend if you don't need to been right downtown.
9896713,88911455,2016-07-26,15148316,Katerina,Erin is a great host. She is flexible and easy to communicate with. Her place is clean and cozy. It's located in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance from Boston College. Getting to downtown though takes almost an hour by public transportation.
9896713,89088569,2016-07-26,4383853,Maggie,Erin was a great host. Everything was as described.

9896713,89887887,2016-07-30,72153781,Jens,"Erin hat uns sehr nett aufgenommen. Das Appartement war ordentlich und sauber. Es ist etwas dunkel, da es sich im Tiefparterre befindet. Für 2 Personen bestens geeignet, das Bett ist bequem. Die beiden zusätzlichen Schlafsofas sind nicht besonders bequem, aber ok für kurzen Aufenthalt."
9896713,91269769,2016-08-04,7938766,Manuel,"Erin was a great host and very responsive to our questions. check-in and check-out was very easy. The apartment was just as featured, very clean and nicely decorated. Overall a great stay for my family who were visiting me in Boston."
9896713,91839722,2016-08-06,52533083,Joanna,"The bed freshly made, the towels and wash clothes had little seashells on them, nice touch. All around Erin had little notes letting you know the wifi password, how to use the futon, what to do with the key etc....the longer we stayed the more comfortable we became and saw how much care Erin puts into renting out her space. We loved Boston and we found it easy to navigate with (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps."

9896713,93045940,2016-08-11,78852017,Lexi,"This place exceeded our expectations. The city area was easily accessible (green line is a 15 minute walk, Uber is active here and fast). There are many solid food choices in the immediate area, often with free delivery. There is a queen bed, a small futon like couch, and a sofa chair with a a fold out padded sleeping surface (not quite a mattress but still comfortable). The bedding, pillows, towels, and decorative touches were of great quality. It has a nice view and is overall a clean, cozy, unique place to stay. Erin was comminucative and helpful, but also gave her guests space. The apartment is the bottom floor of her house, but it has a private entrance and private facilities."
9896713,93966900,2016-08-14,47859960,Ruoxi,"Erin is really friendly and easy to communicate. She's always patient for our questions. The place is really neat, clean and comfortable. If possible, we'd like to visit again!"

9896713,95481263,2016-08-19,69936731,Jean,"It was exactly what I was looking for. I needed a comfortable, homey place that would be appropriate for my parents, and this place fit the bill perfectly. It's not upscale living, but I definitely feel like it was worth my money. Nice bedroom for my parents, the extra fold out beds were perfect for me and my brother (who are both in our 20s), plenty of basic amenities (soap, etc.). No stove, but everything else is there. I would definitely book this place again if more guests arrive."
9896713,95654848,2016-08-20,15665364,Boaz,"Charming studio, excellent location. I only met Erin briefly but she was very kind and communicative. I highly recommend staying here!"

We will definitely look to stay here again whenever we come back to Boston."
9896713,99673240,2016-09-05,21502661,Michelle,"Erin's place was exactly what we were looking for while spending some time in Boston visiting our BU student.  Convenient location, private, comfortable, affordable, nice neighborhood and, as a bonus, no hassle parking!  Will definitely be back."

He was the ideal host with a warm personal welcome - not something which happens every time- and v useful info. The apartment is very well placed in Back Bay with easy access to all the other suburbs in Boston which one might like to visit. And, very importantly, almost beside Symphony Hall and the Museum of Fine Art. An excellent stay!"

The apartment is very spacious and very well-situated, convenient to public transport, shopping and food.  The view from the giant picture windows in both rooms was fantastic!  Lots of natural light during the day, even in winter."
The furnishings were reasonably comfortable,"and the kitchen reasonably well-stocked for cooking (though missing a few key albeit minor items that you'll want to bring if you are planning on doing a lot of cooking).\"",,,,

Only 1 block to the T, and a 5-10 minute walk to many great restaurants and shops.  There were snacks and beverages left for us and the place was very clean.  However, if you're a light sleeper, pack some earplugs as you can hear the traffic below. Nice place, nice host, you won't be disappointed if you book this place!"

2701124,37942741,2015-07-12,18888566,Angela,"We loved our stay at Charlesview Suites. The apartment is much larger than what the photos portray, so there was plenty of room for 4 women on our long weekend vacation. The location was perfect, close to shopping, restaurants and the T stop.  The building is very secure with doorman and key fob access. Varouj was very nice and accommodating. We arrived a little early so the apartment had not yet been cleaned from the previous guests. However, he allowed us to drop our luggage there and recommended lunch spots. When we arrived back there, he had left fresh fruit, eggs, juice, water, etc. for our use. The fresh flowers were also a very nice touch.  I would stay here again and do recommend this apartment. It's a great alternative to hotels in the area."

Excellent choice for a very fair price.  We will definitely come back and rent that same apartment next year, for a longer stay!  Thank you very much Varouj."

The condo was stocked with food staples,like milk,coffee,fresh fruit,eggs,water
We traveled with a 3 month old,and the space was large (much larger than picture makes it look),so we had ample room for the pack n' play,our luggage and baby stuff.,,
We also had access to the laundry room upstairs,which we utilized. It was clean,and we sat on the clean rooftop deck (overlooking city) while we did laundry.,,,

Close to the T, the Pru outside your window, and around the corner from my daughter!  It was very clean.  There was parking in the building which was a plus. The only issues were we had to check in later than agreed upon and the cable and wifi didn't work the first night.  Varouj had it fixed by the next morning.  I would definitely stay there again."

2701124,86797449,2016-07-17,60768599,Ronald,Great location and neighborhood. Very nice place. Made for a great trip!
2701124,92129554,2016-08-07,62252046,Dana,"Varouj was great!  He met us on the street and showed us in to the building personally.  The apartment was clean and spacious.  It met our needs well.  The pull out sofa bed was comfortable.  The apartment was centrally located.  We easily got to all the locations we desired by foot, subway, and Uber.  Although Varouj does provide a french press for coffee it would have been nice to have a full sized coffee maker since there were 4 of us.  Luckily there are many places near by to get coffee outside the building as well as a complimentary instant coffee machine in the lobby.  I also recommended he move the mirror in the bedroom to hang above the desk.  That would provide additional space for everyone to get ready since there was only one bathroom.  The shower was great, like a massage! The towels and linens provided were high quality!  We found a cart in the closet that we utilized for carrying our luggage to the car in the basement.  That was very helpful!  The free parking inside the basement garage was awesome!  The view from the apartment was great!  Us four ladies had a blast and were very satisfied with the apartment.  I highly recommend this listing!"
2701124,94782703,2016-08-17,26921854,Beth,"The location was fabulous.  Near lots of amenities, accessible to public transport and a beautiful view!  The apartment was very comfortable, the building was nice and my stay was great.  Varouj met us outside the apartment in spite of the heat and was available throughout our stay IF we needed (which we did not).  I hope to return to Boston and intend on staying in the same place if it is available.  Highly recommend."
2701124,98125117,2016-08-29,53565356,Charlie,"Gorgeous location, right on Massachusetts with a beautiful view of trees and garden.  Rooftop deck lovely during day and amazing view of Boston at night. Laundry on site and underground parking, convenient to food and shops."

2701124,99758743,2016-09-05,5593448,Alli,"Varouj was very accommodating during our stay. He was able to meet us following our flight and answered all of our questions. We enjoyed the view out the window the most. The street is very busy so sometimes traffic is a little loud, if this bothers you maybe pack earplugs for sleeping, I seemed to sleep just fine though."
11592154,66261058,2016-03-20,11770199,Matthew,The apartment was great. The beds were so comfortable and the space was really cool to relax in.

Nihala was quick to respond and although was not there in person,went out of her way to make sure everything went smoothly. Her friend who met us made sure to answer any questions and was very pleasant and helpful.,,,,
The apartment was cozy and accurately depicted with everything we needed right there.,,,,,

3303497,16111774,2014-07-22,16994813,Phoebe,"Our host Michelle, was very communicative and we really appreciated that. The apartment was stunning and VERY clean- especially the bathroom. It was nice to have the living and kitchen space to just hang out and relax/socialize. There were a lot of nice touches- a little note communicating some things about the apartment, a bottle of wine and a guest book to write little notes. The street was quiet and we slept very well. Boston is relatively small, so we felt like we could walk to most places, which was great. From picking up the keys from the lock box to leaving, the trip was seamless."
"Thank you again! I wish you much success in the future.\"",,,,,

3303497,17841530,2014-08-18,6837371,Maggie,We had a great stay at this (URL HIDDEN) was in a good location that made it easy to walk around. Right by a pretty park; close walk to Fenway. The apt was clean and perfect for 4 people. Host was great answering all questions and respond time was quick.
3303497,18317723,2014-08-25,17381720,Jennifer,We had a wonderful stay at this perfect location! Michelle answered my emails in a timely manner and getting the keys was very easy. the apartment is beautiful and there was plenty of room for 4 adults and 2 small children (2 children's air mattresses fit perfectly in the master bedroom). The students at the local University were moving in the weekend we visited so the street was busy but we found it very quiet with the windows closed at night. We took the T downtown and easily walked to the Prudential center. Thanks for a great stay!
3303497,18883695,2014-09-02,17817106,Rachel,"Michelle & Stevie's appartment was perfectly located for our group of four women in our mid-thirties to visit Boston and Cambridge mainly on foot during the day, come back to the appartment for the apéro before going out for supper in South End or Back Bay restaurants. The subway station, coffee shop, liquor store and the Wholefood market are also conveniently close."
The appartment is cozy and trendy. Since we were there during Labour Day weekend,all the students from Northeastern University were moving in or back in the neighbouring buildings bringing an excellent vibe in the whole area!,,,,
Michelle was helpful with the parking information and we suceeded in parking the car for free (!) in the street for the whole weekend! One last thing... I need to know where the sheets in the master bedroom were bought! They were so soft I want to get the same ones for my own bed!!,,,,,
Once again,thank you very much for this perfect weekend!,,,,

Getting the keys could not have been easier. It's located in a great area and getting around Boston was easy. Five of us stayed there and we were all comfortable.

3303497,20004703,2014-09-22,17055743,Paula,El departamento es muy cómodo y está muy bien ubicado. Las fotos reflejan fielmente lo que es. Tiene todo el confort necesario para pasar lindos días en Boston.
Fui con mi marido y mis 3 hijas y estuvimos bien.,,,,,
La única sugerencia para hacer es que los dueños deberían liberar espacio para que los huéspedes puedan acomodar sus pertenencias. Michelle,Stevie & Tyson no habían liberado ningún lugar para poder acomodar nuestra ropa.,,,,
De todas maneras,en caso de volver a Boston,"volveríamos a alquilar este departamento!!\"",,,
3303497,21216680,2014-10-13,20986838,Christine,"My parents, husband and I had a wonderful time staying here!  The accommodations were exactly as pictured and the location was perfect for us, as my son attends Berklee College of Music a few blocks away.  We did have one small issue when we arrived, as I was never given the lockbox code to access the keys.  The issue was resolved within an hour with the Airbnb customer service rep, but it was touch and go for a while and, this being our first Airbnb experience, made me quite nervous as we all sat on the front steps trying to figure out our next move!  Once we got in, all was well!  The apartment is a 3rd floor walkup, which is not mentioned in the listing.  It was ok for me and my husband, but a little difficult for my mom and dad.  The apartment itself is in a great neighborhood and the decor inside is very chic.  The entire apartment was super clean, which I truly appreciated!"
14093943,98155450,2016-08-29,88298036,Ian,"\"Host collected me from the airport which was a very positive start. However the apartment was disappointing as I was expecting something quite different. This was due to the fact that I had relied on the positive reviews which in fact related to another premises owned by the hosts. This may have been due to an anomaly in the Airbnb system. The apartment is well located but is still a \"\"work in progress\"\" project. With some work it could be nice but before booking I would recommend prospective tenants should ask for confirmation that renovations are complete. On a positive note the hosts were accepting of my criticism and have been in contact with Airbnb themselves to have the system for multiple reviews amended.\""
12125635,73157306,2016-05-07,56531071,Minshu,"I'm leaving this long review because I've had such an amazing experience during my month-long stay here. Alexia’s place is just beyond regular dwelling - it's a piece of art itself, charming at every corner, beautiful and unpretentious. It reminds me of those magical castles in Hayao Miyazaki's movies. I would mark this place itself a point of interest rather than a temporary crash spot - even though the comfort it offers definitely serves this purpose more than well."
If you got some time to stay home,you would have the chance to appreciate Alexia's amazing music collection - played on amazing home audio system - as well as all her crafts and art pieces. I literally spent my first afternoon here sitting in the beautiful space,sipping tea,listening to bossa nova and mid-eastern tunes,studying all the lovely items around the house,and stroking the cat. It's true beauty. Beats all hip coffee shops I’ve been to. The house cat Poochie is the softest and sweetest creature in the world! Completely melted my heart even though I was not a cat person before.
Onto more pragmatic concerns,Kitchen and bathroom got everything you need and are always sparkling clean. Bed is comfy and fresh. Both mine and the other guest bedrooms got lots of sunshine with two windows and nice views. Closets,hangers,towels… all the essentials are there. The surrounding area is peaceful and beautiful in a similar unpretentious manner,with lots of hidden gems. Good good is plenty. And if there is anything you urgently need,Alexia is always there for you. Shawmut station is one step away. Red line takes you straight to south station and downtown in 15 minutes
Alexia herself is the most endearing,sincere host you will ever encounter in the world. When she says she wants you to feel like home,she means it. I witnessed how obsessed she can be to make the space comfortable and pretty. More importantly she genuinely cares for others and treats her guests so well. “Inviting” is exactly the right word. I just love living with her and the other shorter-term guests.,,,
In summary,"my stay was a big pleasant surprise - possibly one of the best experiences in my life. I hope more people could come and experience the beauty and charm of this place :)\"",,,,
12125635,77284809,2016-05-31,51531368,Kaleb,"Alexia was an amazing host, even though we never met her (unfortunately)! She's s photographer and was out working a gig, but never neglected to check in on us every day we were there. The room was great, everything was clean, and the apt was decorated with photographs and things from her world travels. She even left personal notes for us to welcome us. Her roommates were also incredibly nice and charming. The subway (called the T in Boston) stop is literally around the corner, which made is super easy to get into Boston. Her cat was also super amazing and loving. My girlfriend and I enjoyed drinking tea and enjoying the morning talking with her roommate. Overall it was an awesome stay. Don't hesitate to stay here!"
12125635,78551736,2016-06-07,35912911,Katelin,"4 words: WE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!  I think what was so special about Alexia's place is not just her beautiful and artistically decorated home, but she as a wonderful person.  She genuinely cared about us, and did everything in her power to make our stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible.  Alexia is a joy to communicate with, from the beginning of our booking to the very end of our trip. She ensured that all questions were answered and made great suggestions to places to eat/visit/do in Boston.  Even though she was out of town, she checked in on us to make sure we were having a good time.  The living space was less of an apartment, but more of a little piece of heaven.  The moment we walked in, it felt like home.  Our room was perfect, the bed was comfortable, the TV nice and big, the aromatherapy was so relaxing, she even left welcome treats for us!  The kitchen has everything you need, and it opens to a spacious balcony where we enjoyed our daily breakfast while admiring the peaceful surrounding greenery.  The location was excellent with the metro just around the corner making our experience much more accessible. 15 mins from pretty much any main attraction in Boston. Alexia's roommates Minshu and Giulia are such sweethearts, we instantly became friends.  Poochie (the cat) is very cute and so well-behaved, we loved having him around."
We were so blessed to have found Alexia's place and it made our trip in Boston a very memorable one.  Thank you Alexia,Minshu,Giulia,"and Poochie!\"",,
12125635,97749753,2016-08-28,84903709,Damodar,Alexia is very welcoming.   I traveled from India and she went out of her way to make me feel comfortable and at home.  Highly recommend her place.  The location was great.  Walking distance from the T-station.

"I spent ten days at Scott's place while renovating my own apartment in Boston and I could not be happier with my little \"\"staycation\"\". The place was cozy",clean yet super chic and charming. It’s one of the most spacious one-bedroom I've seen in Boston and it even has a private room deck that offers amazing views of the city. The rooms are very nicely arranged and tastefully furnished. The apartment is situated on a quiet street in southend,just minutes away from some of the coolest restaurants and shops in town.,,,
Scott was an amazing host,"he made me feel truly at home. He explained everything in detail before I checked in and was always prompt to respond to my questions. I could not think of any better place to stay in Boston than Scott’s beautiful penthouse.\"",,,,
4549374,25467182,2015-01-17,12400132,Tyler,This apartment is as advertised.  Clean and cozy.  Quiet with just the right amount of city noise.  There are a couple great restaurants right around the corner.  The Silver Line is also right around the corner.  It comes frequently and it will take you to Downtown Crossing in about five minutes.
The apartment is a nice size for a single or a couple.  I didn't cook but the kitchen is well equipped and functional.  The bed was comfortable.  The bathroom was clean and well done (the shower is a very nice amenity).  I didn't try the roof deck since it was covered in snow but it would be a fun place to split a bottle of wine in the summer.,,,,,
I have been traveling to Boston for business for about 15 years.  I have stayed in just about every neighborhood.  I have stayed in many/most of the downtown hotels.  I don't really like hotel settings and I can't always stay with friends.  But this apartment feels like you are staying at a friend's place.  I had a friend over one evening and it felt like we were talking around my kitchen island back home.,,,,,
I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a change from the sterile hotel world.,,,,,

The space was perfectly comfortable for three people, and the kitchen was impeccable even for an Italian family as us. The environment around the apartment was relaxing and silent, but at the same time we found everything we needed very close to it. The bus stop was 1 minute away and it brought us directly downtown. A place we will never forget!"

4549374,29532674,2015-04-08,30504310,Frank,"We stayed in this south end penthouse in mid April, 2015.  We had a very good experience.  The penthouse is cozy, and in a fun neighborhood in the South End.  We were not able to take advantage of the roof deck due to the weather (still cold in New England!), but the deck is really nice, and would be great if the weather were cooperative.   Condo is well furnished and comfortable.  It is pretty small, but great for two, maybe three (we had our teenage son with us, and he slept on the couch, which was very comfortable).  Stairs up to the apartment are quite steep and narrow, so be thoughtful about how much luggage you want to haul up there!"
Nice place,"exactly as described.\"",,,,

It included restaurants, transportation and attraction recommendations in the area! He was able to reach as needed and responded immediately. His penthouse was perfect for our needs-very clean, organized and adorable. We loved the grill and rooftop patio for preparing our own meal prior to my marathon.

It's very homely and we loved it. Washer dryer worked well. Kitchen was perfect for cooking or baking, tho we didn't. Neighbors are quiet so we had great privacy and peace. Scott is perfect with communication. Recommend it!!"

He made sure we had great information about the unit and the neighborhood before and while we were in his darling apartment.  Staying in the South End was a new experience for me and I loved the opportunity to see Boston from this perspective.  Great restaurants close by and nice walk to Back Bay and all of my favorite Boston sites.  The apartment is up three flights of stairs, so be prepared to pack lightly but well worth the climb.  The penthouse is darling and access to the roof top deck is quintessential South End charm.  We did not have much time hanging in the apartment, but the kitchen is fabulous if you want to prepare your own meals.  All in all, this was a great place to stay during Graduation Weekend for my son.  Boston was packed and this apartment was a peaceful getaway from the craziness.  Especially LOVED the Tapas restaurant at the end of the street.  Uber was easy to access from the unit and cabs were available from either end of the street.  I would recommend the cost/value of this stay to anyone going to Boston and looking for a unique South End experience.  This was my first Airbnb stay and Scott is the perfect host!"

Lo único que sugiero es que se aclare que hay escaleras. Pienso que esto no le resta calidad al departamento, vale la pena subir."

We were at the end of our honeymoon and could not have asked for a more peaceful, comfortable, attractive place to stay. The view from the rooftop is fantastic, we enjoyed sipping on some complimentary drinks and watching the sunset. The shower was AWESOME! The place we well stocked with much more than we needed. The location is perfect, walking distance to many resteraunt and the silver line bus stop. We said that this is the kind of place we'd love to live in if we were to live in Boston."

4549374,36766878,2015-07-01,2588769,James,"Scott's penthouse was a perfect place to spend a few days in Boston. Located in the historic South End, as soon as you go out the front door, history is at your feet. As for the apartment, I can't decide what I enjoyed more: the massive shower or rooftop patio. It's a unique property that o highly recommend and Scott was an excellent host - I would surely stay here again."
4549374,37547046,2015-07-08,27385877,Justin,"We really enjoyed our stay at Scott's place. The listing description was very accurate and we made use of everything available to us. The shower was wonderful and we used the kitchen quite a bit, including the mini bar. We also spent a lot of time on the roof deck and cooked a meal on the electric grill. We never had any issues, but knew that Scott was available if necessary. Scott even sent us a welcome email a short time after we arrived to ensure we were all settled. We had a guest over one evening and he, too, was quite impressed with the Penthouse - I imagine it'd be perfect for light entertaining with a few friends. This is a great spot in the South End as long as you don't mind the typical emergency vehicle noise from the nearby hospital (we didn't mind). Although we walked most places, the Silver Line is great for getting to China Town/Theatre District & Whole Foods and we used Uber for less than $10 to the North End (and to/from the Airport - highly recommend over the Silver Line). We would stay here again and have already suggested the Penthouse to other friends!"
4549374,39264047,2015-07-22,6435305,Dennis,"Scott was an excellent host and although we did not meet personally, he kept in touch and offered suggestions as necessary (a nice set of information pages are in the apartment). The apartment was just as described - beautiful rooftop balcony and shower. Very clean and modern kitchen. The space certainly was more comfortable than any hotel would have provided for family of 3. Safe area and easily accessible to city (lovely 20 min. walk). Absolutely would recommend this apartment."
4549374,39623817,2015-07-25,6588400,Daniel,"We, a family of three, really enjoyed our stay in this lovely apparent. The roof top terrance was a great place to relax and take in Boston's skyline.

On our arrival date he contacted us to check that we had got into the flat okay. We arrived late but had not problem with access. Apartment was as nice as the pictures suggest, if not nicer! All the essentials were great....clean, lovely bed and shower, good aircon and well stocked kitchen. The interior decor, the bar and the roof deck were added bonuses! We really liked the area around the apartment, plenty of nice places for breakfast, lunch and dinner (for which Scott had useful recommendations). Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would gladly recommend to a friend!"
4549374,45563190,2015-09-04,29793473,Tammy,The place was easy to find and easy to get in.  We loved the area and the penthouse apartment! It was the perfect space for two people that was centrally located. I LOVED the roof top and the furnishings.  Thank you for making our trip so memorable!
4549374,46598629,2015-09-12,5335760,Brian,"Great apartment and host! Scott made the communication process really easy and seamless. The apartment is beautiful – whoever decorated it put a lot of time and effort into their work, and it really shows. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!"
4549374,46904393,2015-09-14,3437364,Rachel,"This South End abode was everything we hoped it would be. The decor and layout of the apartment is welcoming and comfortable. Scott made sure to communicate with us before, during, and after our stay. It was a lovely bnb experience."
4549374,47954372,2015-09-22,26033142,Jayne,"This was our first Airbnb experience so we were a little nervous, however we didn't have to worry.  From the time we booked to the time we left Scott's place we had a great experience. Scott was always very prompt in responding to our queries and communication was easy.  The apartment was clean and is exactly as the photos depict. Scott has thought of everything to make the stay comfortable and enjoyable.  The guide to restaurants, cafes and bars was very helpful and we were just disappointed we didn't have longer in Boston to try them all out. Definitely recommend Toro (worth queueing up for) and Mike's City Diner. Location is good and safe.  The T bus line is just around the corner and takes approx. 15 mins to get downtown and around 20/25 to walk. Going the opposite direction was only 2 stops to Back Bay.  Would recommend Scott's place for anyone who is visiting Boston. Just make sure you travel light if you don't want to carry bags up 3 flights of stairs...but worth it.  Thanks Scott. Loved your place and city."
4549374,49007439,2015-09-30,35023367,Colleen,"I dont think I can rave enough about this apartment, but i'll try! For our first visit to Boston it was the perfect location to be able to explore the city during the day and relax at night. Before entering the apartment I couldn't help but admire how beautiful the neighborhood was. Within steps to Boston Medical, long rows of brownstones and plenty of restaurants, bars and a few convenience stores within walking distance."
It is a penthouse apartment located on the top floor so get ready to walk up stairs. They really aren't that bad though! Very much worth the incredible view on the rooftop deck and true to how many buildings in Boston are; Plan on stairs everywhere  ... It is one of the oldest cities after all.,,,,,
The apartment itself was spotlessly clean and made us feel like we were home ( or wish we could have been!) The living room,dining area and kitchen are all one side of the apartment. For lovers of cooking,try not to drool over the Viking stove. My boyfriend and I are both bartenders and loved the bar cart set up they had! Have a drink on them ( replace anything you use more of - of course) and enjoy the cool bar trinkets/ memorabilia displayed. A comfy L shaped couch in the living area was great for naps and unwinding at the end of the day with a book or a movie.,,,
Bedroom had a very comfortable queen bed and also set up with a TV and cable. The bathroom had a wonderful large shower with two shower heads; a rain style one and one that can be pulled off its hook.   Plenty of extra blankets and towels. Also a washer and dryer which is great to have for longer stays or being able to pack lightly.,,,,,
The rooftop deck was where I started each day. A cup of coffee and a gorgeous view. I really never wanted to leave! There is also a grill available to use on the deck.,,,,,
Finally,the information the host left was a great started for exploring the city. We loved their food and drink suggestions and constantly used it as a reference when bouncing around town. He put a lot of care and consideration into making sure his guest has good options to pick from in a city with so many choices,"as well as a home away from home atmosphere to relax in. \"",,,
4549374,49230392,2015-10-02,3531201,Leanna,"Not enough positive things I can say about our stay at Scott's brownstone!  Even if we had been staying in a mediocre place, the area alone would have made it worth it and Scott's suggestions were all exceptional!  But the place far surpassed our expectations, with the perfect combination of comfort, unique and rustic touches, and all the modern amenities!  The first night we were there we had our 2 friends over who were getting married (the whole point of the trip) and the 4 of us enjoyed a tapas style dinner and drinks on the rooftop while the sun went down. We had walked down the street to a great local market to get the gourmet treats and marveled at the beautiful neighborhood all along the way.  The next night we had a fantastic dinner at a place on the corner, literally steps away... and it was a James Beard award winning chef!  We literally walked in after a long day out, put our names in, walked back to change and they called, so we walked back to our table!  Every night was perfect too, the sofa is hard to get up from, especially while being able to watch any movie imaginable on their flatscreen.  The kitchen had everything we needed to cook there but on the last night we used a local service Scott recommended and they delivered dinner to our door!  Perfect ending before having to fly home at 7am the next morning.  We walked mostly everywhere from this location but the bus was just a block away and every time we called Uber they showed up in less than 2 minutes... even at 4:30 in the morning!  Plus the shower was a dream!  I can't imagine staying anywhere else the next time we visit Boston!"
4549374,52402214,2015-10-29,35342219,Devjani,"Scott's apartment looked exactly as it was listed. It was spacious, very clean, comfortable and exactly what we needed for our stay. The location was ideal for us although street parking was limited. However, we were able to utilize the nearby BMC Hospital parking lot without any issues. We would recommend Scott's apartment for our friends looking for a place in Boston for the future."

Scott was really nice & clear about every info.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
4549374,58296281,2016-01-02,10036836,Cortney,This place is fantastic! We came here for a week to visit friends and family over the holidays and enjoyed staying in the city. The place is easily accessible to the T and a lot of fun restaurants. The rooftop was a plus as was the Viking range where we made a number of meals. Scott was an amazing host and was easily reached when we had a problem with the pots and pans. The prior guest had damaged the pots and pans beyond use and Scott immediately sent a friend to buy new ones the following day and left them in the lobby for us. He was so attentive to us. We will definitely be back and hopefully be able to make more use of the rooftop which has a nice view of the city skyline.
4549374,58732338,2016-01-03,29600172,Rachel,"Just, adorable!!!"
I'm finally getting the hang of this Airbnb thing,and staying in Boston.  I've used Airbnb a couple times,as well as rental agencies,hotels,and those other sites we don't speak of here :)  Scott was an outstanding host  - very prompt with replies despite his hectic schedule,and incredibly detailed and organized info was sent prior to my stay (which my OCD greatly appreciated).   As for the Unit - Adorable!  Exactly the kind of apt I would love to have in Boston!  Everything was done right... the kitchen (everything you may ever need
4549374,59646519,2016-01-13,51090041,Funda,The information packege provided was very comprehensive and satisfactory. The house was very well maintained and furnished properly. Our stay was uneventful and met our expectations.
4549374,60964066,2016-01-30,8081839,Gemma,"Scott is a fantastic host, I would recommend without hesitation his place in the South End. As someone who lived in the neighborhood for several years and now returns for business travel, his flat is very tastefully decorated, well-appointed, and well-situated. I will definitely go back!"
4549374,61779153,2016-02-08,30793282,Gabby,"Beautiful place filled with everything you could need. Scott was communicable and incredibly helpful when I had a scheduling conflict. We'll definitely be back, and hopefully for more than just a weekend!"
4549374,62725587,2016-02-16,21979161,Abdullah,"This was a great experience! Although we never met Scott he made sure we were fully accommodated and kept constant communication. The place itself is clean, comfortable, and in a great neighborhood. I would highly recommend staying here."
4549374,64086874,2016-02-29,23887632,Jennifer,"This is the perfect Boston retreat.  Location is great - close to shops, restaurants, and transportation.   The apartment is clean, comfortable and well equipped.  It really felt like a home away from home.  And Scott was wonderful to work with - very communicative and eager to see that we were settled in.  We could check in anytime to meet our own schedule.  Overall A+."
4549374,65101551,2016-03-10,50676434,Michael,Scott was an awesome host and the condo was perfect.  The location couldn't have been better and Scott made the entire experience easy.  I would definitely recommend this property and will stay again the next time in town.
4549374,65419317,2016-03-13,1448232,Heidi,Scott was an excellent host. He offered clear and helpful instructions ahead of time and checked in to make sure we got settled well. This is an excellent location! The historic neighborhood is lovely with lots of great restaurants and we found it easy to get around. Scott has put lots of thoughtful touches.
4549374,66808238,2016-03-24,63216159,Matt,The apartment was awesome! Everything was custom-made inside the home and there were so many cool touches. The neighborhood was quiet and a short walk/uber to everything that you'd want to see in town.
4549374,67292686,2016-03-28,47664862,Jasmine,"I really enjoyed my time at Scott's apartment. I stayed here while attending a conference at the waterfront and it was the perfect complement to my stay in Boston. It was exactly as described, and the location was great. Lots of places to eat nearby. I only wish I had the chance to grill out on the deck!"
4549374,69118440,2016-04-09,63117046,Kiera,"Can't recommend highly enough! Scott made it so easy to stay at his place, great information (and fantastic restaurant recommendations!), and really fast responses to any queries - it was all really simple. The place itself is incredible, better even than it looks in the photos and it is in a really nice area of boston with plenty of restaurants/bars walkable and easy bus ride to the centre. We had a great time and if we're ever back in boston we would definately stay here again!"
4549374,69437798,2016-04-11,27483765,Ashley,"I HIGHLY recommend Scott's South End Penthouse!!! Scott was great with communication and direction for the apartment arrival/stay. As soon as you walk in the door you feel like you are at home. The apartment is beautiful and has everything you may need! Two words: ROOF DECK! Such an awesome addition to the stay. It was my first time visiting Boston and the location couldn't have been more ideal. Close to everything, great neighborhood with endless things to do! I will 100% be back to visit and would even love to stay at this location again! Cannot even think of anything negative to say, as this Airbnb and everything about it was perfect!"
4549374,69778598,2016-04-13,14272176,Anja,"Fantastic! We loved staying at this place. Great neighborhood, easy to get around in Boston from there. The apartment was cool (the rooftop on a nice afternoon) and cosy (on a stormy afternoon). Great kitchen and enough neighborhood stores to shop. Pictures are very realistic. We did not meet Scott, but communication was great and instructions fool proof. If we can do it, you can do it. Five stars."
4549374,70723081,2016-04-20,45463862,Helen,We stayed at Scotts place for a week in total around the marathon weekend. Scott was very welcoming beforehand helping us plan our visit and helping with tourist visit recommendations.
The apartment was great,my 70 year old mother was with me and there are 3 flights of stairs but once we were up there it was fine - and all in all gave her some good exercise....,,,,
The aparment is home from home - we were able to do all our laundry whilst we were there and my daughter was happy with the TV......,,,,,
We walked everywhere in Boston and most things are within a mile or so of the apartment and we shopped at Foodies down the road for fresh groceries but there is a 7eleven at the end of the road if needed.,,,,,
Sitting on the rooftop was great and the view was lovely.,,,,,
"I would definitely recommend the apartment but be aware that there are 3 flight of stairs but its worth it once you get up there and bringing cases down was easier than carrying up .....\"",,,,,
4549374,73015752,2016-05-06,58570907,Claire,"The apartment was exactly as described - incredibly comfortable, stylish and well equipped with everything we needed for our short stay in Boston. We got in quite late and very tired from our flight from London but had no difficulty at all finding the apartment and the instructions were very clear for getting in. We loved the neighbourhood. Breakfast at Mike's on the corner of Washington was a treat on our first morning (we can also highly recommend Orinoco restaurant on Shawmut). We mostly walked to everything (downtown, half an hour. Museum of Fine Arts 25 mins) but also used the Silver Line bus which runs from the Washington end of the street. By day two, we felt well and truly at home! Would loved to have stayed longer, it really is a perfect little apartment."
4549374,73992818,2016-05-12,26367313,Julia,From the moment we contacted Scott he was helpful and accommodating.
Our arrival was easy - Upon entering the apartment we knew we had made a great decision.,,,,,
The apartment is light filled - a wonderful living space - The bathroom has a terrific shower - the bedroom is cozy and the bed is definitely comfy.,,,,,
The kitchen is well appointed (the host is in the restaurant business and it shows!),,,,,
The decoration is tasteful with a touch of whimsy.,,,,,
And the DECK!! Terrific views of the city.,,,,,
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.,,,,,
Some of the restaurants we enjoyed in the neighborhood were,,,,,
Petit Robert Bistro,,,,,
Café Madeleine (delicious coffee and croissants) - on Columbus,,,,,
Tremont 647,,,,,
"and El Centro on Shawmut and Concord\"",,,,,
4549374,74699460,2016-05-16,33066720,Susan,"Our experience at Scott's condo was a 10/10!  We were so impressed and highly recommend this Airbnb. From the seamless check in & informative details to the spotless, cozy atmosphere on a quiet top floor, fully-equipped kitchen & laundry, luxury shower & rooftop patio, we felt we were staying with a close friend. The South-end location was a convenient 10-min Uber ride for my daughter's graduation in Back Bay. Many thanks!"
4549374,76865095,2016-05-29,40142883,Eric,"I spent a weekend in Boston at this apartment and found it to be accurately described and managed by a professional, responsive host. The space is clean, nicely arranged, decorated and fully furnished with everything you might need. It really feels like a home, which is always welcome. Instead of repeating what's in all the reviews and the descriptions, I'll make note of some aspects that stood out to me."
The unit is three stories up and the building has no elevator. Not a problem for me,but could be for some. The rooftop deck is accessed by a narrow spiral staircase and using that staircase could also present a challenge to some with disabilities or impairments. Definitely worth the view,though.,,,
There is a comfortable couch,a foldout cot and a queen size bed for sleeping surfaces,but the apartment is on the cozier side — so more than 2-3 guests will feel very intimate pretty quickly. Also note that the only real bed is situated beneath a wall that angles inward sharply,making it a bit tedious to access one side of it.,,
The bathroom is nice,spacious and has a fantastic dual-head shower. One had is a ceiling-mounted rain style shower,while the other is a handheld head you can mount to the wall holder. The shower has a solid high-end feel and almost too much water pressure from the handheld (not a complaint.) The temperature is easy to adjust to your preference quickly. Plenty of towel hooks available if you are sharing the space with a few guests and want to keep things separated.,,,
We didn't cook whatsoever,but noticed that the kitchen has professional grade appliances such as a Viking stove and Bosch dishwasher; the owner of the AirBNB implied he worked in the restaurant industry,so that might explain the influence in the kitchen.,,,
In the living room,which is sort of an extension to the kitchen,there is a well-stocked bar with mixers and liquors to which you are welcome to help yourself in moderation. There is also a speaker system you can connect to an iPhone or other device,making it a great space for entertaining or hanging with friends.,,
The location was fantastic as well,in a beautiful tree-lined street with brick-faced rows of houses giving the area a particularly Boston charm. The area is very walkable with plenty of restaurants,bars and shops within a short distance or nearby public transit.,,,
Overall we enjoyed this penthouse very much and the host was responsive,"helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. Just wanted to mention some of the remarks above to give a clearer picture to potential future guests. Would definitely recommend to others or book for myself when returning to Boston. Thanks.\"",,,,
4549374,80004127,2016-06-15,67838082,Spencer,"I had an AMAZING experience at Scott's place. It was clean and cool when I first arrived, looked exactly as described. The penthouse is very luxurious and comfortable. Add that to the amount of spices and drinks provided in the apartment, and you'll have nothing else that you can think of asking for."
Scott is also very easy to contact and communicate with,and has a very quick response time.,,,,
One thing to be aware of is the amount of stairs you need to take to get to the penthouse. But it's all worth it once you get to the apartment.,,,,,
"I will definitely come back and stay at Scott's in the future!\"",,,,,
4549374,84887208,2016-07-09,27073221,Kelly,"I stayed in Scott's South End Luxury Penthouse for two weeks while my daughter attended a summer session at Berklee College of Music.  I really enjoyed everything about the penthouse.  It is beautifully decorated with all of the conveniences of home.  It is very clean, and there was room in the closet and the bathroom to put my own things.  The bathroom was like a spa bath, and the shower is big and relaxing.  One of my favorite places in the penthouse is the rooftop deck.  I spent a lot of time relaxing up there, and we could see the fireworks from the harbor on July 4th.  There is also a grill up there, which I used a few times.  The neighborhood is safe and quaint, and close to grocery stores, restaurants, transportation, and shops.   I could reach many of the historic landmarks in Boston in 20 to 30 minutes by foot, or easily access public transportation within a few minutes walk.  I loved being immersed in the culture of Boston by staying in Scott's place.  It allowed me to experience it as more that a tourist. I can't wait to go back again someday."
4549374,86150766,2016-07-15,11787427,Ryan,"Although we did not meet Scott from our first email he was very helpful, responsive and informative. He went above and beyond with his local recommendations on things to do and places to eat."
The apartment is very nice and in a great location in the south end.  The place is in great condition with all expected amenities plus some very nice extras.,,,,,
"Next time we are in Boston I hope to stay here again. \"",,,,,
4549374,87555136,2016-07-20,10031317,Ian,"Scott's place is much better than advertised, and truly a hidden gem in the heart of Boston. The apartment is impeccably clean, with all modern amenities that you could possibly need or desire. It is on a quiet street but close to public transportation to reach all parts of Boston.  The local South End neighborhood is great. The rooftop deck is simply awesome, with spectacular views of the Boston skyline and nice breezes in the evening - something not to miss."
Getting in and checking out was seamless,and although we never met Scott personally,he was easy to contact and communication was never an issue.,,,
We stayed as a family of three and there was plenty of space with a very comfy spare cot and mattress for our son,but you could easily fit another on the large couch in the living room.,,,,
The information packet from Scott included everything and anything you need to know about the place and the area. Honestly,this was probably one of the best Airbnb experiences we had,and we have been using Airbnb for our summer vacations for years.,,,
If you get the chance others down to Newport,RI,check out one of Scott's two restaurants,Diego's and the Wharf Pub. Great food,reasonable prices,"and you will not believe what he has done with tater tot!\""

The room was very comfortable and the building itself was more than I had expected as there were no problems with other tenants with regards to loud music or any other disturbances.

Basically did not really need to contact him for anything, but if we needed to, he was super easy to get in touch with as he responds within seconds or picks up the phone right away.

11590000,69266526,2016-04-10,51703133,Max,"Great place, clean."
I had problems getting the key when I arrived late in the night,but I called Flatbook and I could talk to someone who helped me to get the key. Excellent experience,"and excellent location.\"",,,
11590000,69896662,2016-04-14,4033503,John,Flatboat has a top notch staff available by phone 24/7 with also some local support (came by to fix the remote for the TV otherwise I would have binge watched CSI all weekend long ;).  The flat on Newbury is in the heart of Boston just above a wonderful Italian wine bar.  The property is immaculate - a studio with a dividing wall between the living room and bedroom areas - a small efficiency apartment - a wonderful good sized and beautiful bathroom.  This is a great place to spend a wonderful weekend with someone special.
11590000,71652991,2016-04-27,1878391,Lindi,"Great little home away from home, our swanky studio was perfectly situated and had pretty much everything we needed. Friendly, helpful and very responsive staff. Super clean, comfortable and tastefully decorated. We really appreciated the tea selection and the tea kettle to boil water that wasn't coffee tainted. Would definitely stay again and would highly recommend to anyone who wants as a nice as a hotel place to stay without having to stay in a large generic hotel."
"It should just be known that the alley that the apartment looks out over is rather noisy for those who are light sleepers. Overall a wonderful place to stay.\"",,,,,
11590000,74950569,2016-05-17,31800034,Kaitlyn,"The location was perfect. Easy access to the building via the lock box even though we arrived very early in the morning. Coffee and tea provided, with all the kitchen utensils you needed. Great experience."
11590000,76138456,2016-05-25,73093225,Jidong,"内环境可以,和图片一致。外环境不在靠街这一边,张乱差!特别是早晚噪音巨响且不停!"
11590000,76742521,2016-05-29,68028192,Sarita,"Denna lilla lägenhet var precis det vi sökte. Otroligt bra belägen på Newbury street, hade i princip allt vi behövde. Kan varmt rekommendera att bo med Flatbook. De hade otroligt hjälpsam personal och svarade snabbt på mail. Skulle definitivt bo med dem igen nästa gång jag ska ut och resa."
11590000,86207270,2016-07-15,8710451,Martina,"This cosy apartment is in a beautiful historic location. I was amazed how clean it was kept. The bed had a good mattress. It is nice to walk into the Victorian brownstone building, the hallways are renovated.  I had a few questions and the friendly, very responsive Flatbook staff took care of me. I could relax perfectly here after work. You have in close walking distance public transportation."

11590000,87777280,2016-07-21,79154621,Cynthia,It was overall really great. The location was amazing. They were very accommodating and let us check in early. It was smaller than it looked in the pictures but otherwise it was advertised accurately.
11590000,89436405,2016-07-28,42153384,Lindsay,It was a great experience in a great area of town.  Located near everything and walking to distance to all sites.
2848330,19393923,2014-09-11,15834735,Yuri,"\"My stay was very nice.  The building does not say \"\"luxury\"\" from outside"
2848330,19561004,2014-09-14,5348456,Jd,The space worked great for the group I brought to Boston for our weekend conference. Would recommend.
2848330,19793634,2014-09-18,484983,Greg,"Host did a great job. Very communicative prior to arrival. The place was in a convenient location and the unit interior was brand spanking new. It had everything we needed for a comfortable stay and was reasonably priced compared to other listings in the area. The bathroom was well stocked with towels, soap, shampoo, conditioner. Certainly a great BnB experience at a bargain compared with the hotels that I was looking at in the area. A++ would stay again."
2848330,19976027,2014-09-21,20950596,Justin,"The apartment was very clean and spacious. It is located right in between 2 different T public transit stations which makes access to the rest of the city quite easy. It was relatively simple to find, and the hosts directions to the unit as well as their instructions for checking in were easy to follow.  In addition to the location next to the transit stops, it is a short walking distance to several tourist locations throughout the city. Would stay again."
2848330,20447192,2014-09-29,21062743,Luis,Los anfitriones se mostraron atentos y a disposición .
La descripción  de la casa es correcta,prácticamente a estrenar y bien equipado.,,,,
Sería muy bueno  que se aclarara que es un tercer piso por escalera.,,,,,
Respecto al barrio,si bien  es relativamente céntrico,no nos pareció agradable. Con una gran obra vecina y sin lugares  de abastecimiento cercano. Se debe aclarar que es en medio  del barrio chino.,,,
"\"",,,,,
2848330,21532545,2014-10-19,12563674,Jorge,"The apartment was new, clean and even better than expected. Well located close Chintown and to the Boston South Station. Absolutly recommendable."
2848330,22707739,2014-11-12,20852746,Daniela,"L'appartamento è molto carino e molto pulito. E' esattamente come appare nelle fotografie. Si accede all'appartamento da una piccola scala (2 rampe). Il quartiere è tranquillo e i principali luoghi di interesse si raggiungono facilmente a piedi; vicino all'appartamento ci sono delle postazioni di bike sharing. Sue è stata molto disponibile, ed ha risposto rapidamente ad ogni domanda. Raccomando quest'appartamento per un soggiorno a Boston!"
2848330,26924380,2015-02-22,23678550,子文,That was a gorgeous apartment. The location was awesome. Everything inside the apartment was brand new. It's just so great.
2848330,27664387,2015-03-09,5875126,Jiri,"Did not meet the host in person, but they usually answered promptly to AirBnB messages. Apartment was recently renovated and well equipped, but had some water damage due to the heavy snowfall in Boston. Sounds from the neighbors were very audible, and unfortunately the neighbors really liked to party."
2848330,28138196,2015-03-18,6506512,David,"Stanley and Sue were quick to respond online and very easy to get to the apartment. This location is perfect for folks who need to be close to Tufts, downtown, or the convention center. Lots of great food and things to do in Chinatown."
Very clean inside the apartment and was perfect for my stay,where we spent most of our days out and then came home for a relaxing evening and get some rest.,,,,
"Thank you both!\"",,,,,
2848330,29750788,2015-04-12,372280,Carola,We had a great stay! Super central and the place is clean and has everything. We were in Boston for a conference and it was nice to have space to recollect.
2848330,30101306,2015-04-17,5740322,Brendan,Nice clean place in a convenient location.
2848330,32195006,2015-05-15,6442632,Justin,"Stanley and Sue's apartment is absolutely fantastic. It's impeccably clean, and it's got everything you need to feel at home for an extended stay. It's also in a great location, and in walking distance just to about anything you'd need."
Sue was super responsive,and even rushed over to install a new AC unit to help cool the place down. Overall,my stay was absolutely fantastic. It was conformable and stress free,and I've already booked another stay at one of their other properties. It doesn't get much better than this!,,
"\"",,,,,
2848330,32497606,2015-05-19,23407330,Roger,We found Stanley & Sue very helpful and whilst our taxi driver was struggling to find the address the extra advice provided by Sue solved the problem.
We found the flat spotlessly clean and delivered all that was promised,"for exploring Boston you could not have a better location.\"",,,,
2848330,33662578,2015-05-31,23810090,Olga,"Our stay in this Boston Downtown apartment was really great: clean, furnished as expected, close to the main attractions. We were very happy with the choice."
"Just a side note for next tenants: make sure your luggage is not too big and heavy since you have to climb up the narrow stairs without an elevator :)\"",,,,,
2848330,35294180,2015-06-17,17780670,Diana,"The stay at Stanley and Sue apartment was very pleasant. It really looked like the picture. For our purpose, a conference in a nearby hotel, the location was perfect. The only thing (but that is our European way of thinking) was that the builders of a new building were also at work during the night. Sometimes the noise was very present. But other than that I could recommend the place."
2848330,42959190,2015-08-16,11077180,Annette,"We had a great stay, the apartment was great and loved Boston!"
The location is really good,easy short walk to the T or easy to walk to other areas of the city. Finding the apartment and checking in was a breeze thanks to the detailed instructions.,,,,
"The apartment was lovely and clean and had everything we needed. \"",,,,,
2848330,47123915,2015-09-15,20495730,Rondo,"Good location, nice place, but problems with wifi!"
2848330,47331151,2015-09-17,20901206,Alexandra,The hosts were lovely.  There did everything they could to make my stay in their apartment as pleasant as possible.  The apartment was very clean and comfortably furnished.  Beds were very comfortable.
The apartment in conveniently located - lots of cool things within walking distance.  However I will say that the neighborhood can be a little intimidating for a single girl.  The apartment is located on the outskirts of town and feels a little sketchy at night.  The front gate does not lock but all the other doors are electronically secured.  I did not feel comfortable walking home at night - I took ubers.,,,,,
Highly recommend the host,"not so sure I would stay at this property again but I would definitely look at their other listings.  \"",,,,
2848330,48156563,2015-09-23,32838038,Abdo,Hard to find place but owner very helpful.
2848330,48258013,2015-09-24,7240789,Zack,The Apartment was very clean and exactly as advertised. Instructions to enter and leave were easy to follow. The location was also very convenient for downtown.
2848330,49184536,2015-10-01,2541822,Matt,"The place was very tidy and clean. They had heat and AC, modern appliances, etc. Very happy with my stay"
2848330,49586787,2015-10-05,5781775,Jan,"The apartment was well furnished, very clean and looked like on the pictures. A short walking distance to all that is needed (T, Restaurants ...). The conversations with our hosts were friendly and helpfully. The check in/out instructions were easy to follow. BUT !!! At our last morning the next guests entered the apartment during our breakfast !!! That was awful !!! And this could happened at any time !?!?! Apparantly the digit code was not modified and that is irresponsible."
2848330,50213088,2015-10-10,44857306,Andre,"Stanley and Sue were amazing hosts. They went out of their way to make sure that everything was perfect for our stay, going as far as offering to have an Amazon package shipped to their house (and offering to drop it off at a time of our convenience)! I could not recommend better hosts."
2848330,54037556,2015-11-15,140322,Amanda,"The place was really clean and exactly like the photos! It is a small space, but was perfect for just the two of us! Hosts were easy to connect with, we simply texted when we got there and left!"
The location is great,about a 10 minute walk from being in a central part of Boston,and lots of great pubs and restaurants nearby! The only thing the place needs is a tall,full length mirror outside of the only mirror in the bathroom! Great,"clean stay! \"",
2848330,69392486,2016-04-11,594933,Sam,"Stanley and Cue's appartement was well located, clean and very comfortable. It made our stay in Boston a lot more enjoyable, and would definitely rent it again for our next trip!"
2848330,70636727,2016-04-19,42424102,Cheryl,"Just got back from our stay in Boston.  Stanley and Sue's place is light, airy and very clean! The location was great with  most attractions within easy walking distance. Access to the apartment went very smoothly and the directions made it easy to locate. We would definitely come back!!  Thank you Stanley and Sue for a great marathon weekend!"
2848330,74305314,2016-05-14,3912993,Khinmien,"We stayed here in May and found the conveniently located to tour Boston but taxis seem to have a hard time finding this place, the one at the airport insisting on taking us to South Boston! Location near Chinatown/Downtown means getting good food was a piece of cake! Enough space for 4 pax, hot showers always available with new white goods, the apt is clean and compact. Reasonably comfortable. Did not see any neighbours during our stay there - very quiet street as far as people being around, despite being steps away from Chinatown - but that said, we did not feel unsafe in the neighbourhood."
A few points to note - it is on the 3rd floor up steep stairs,making luggage hard to transport. Central heating is available,Wall mounted AC is inefficiently noisy in one room & we didn't install the portable AC for the rest of apt. A cross breeze from hall into the main bedroom cooled the apt sufficiently in May,although we could hear background hum of traffic,white noise after a while. The high speed internet cuts in and out every now and then but manageable for mail,social media etc. Be frustrating for gaming and streaming.
Overall a convenient location to be based out of to visit Boston.,,,,,

2848330,78840853,2016-06-09,15177809,Michael,"This 2-bedroom walk up is right near the heart of downtown, on the edge of Chinatown. It was clean, convenient and very comfortable. Sue was easy to work with, prompt and amenable. I would definitely stay there again."
2848330,79564207,2016-06-13,30058539,Alida Stephanie,"It's a bit of a ways outside the center, the apartment itself was nice and clean and the wi-fi worked. The $100 charge for cleaning is too much considering how small the apartment is, with just one bathroom. Most of Boston is quite expensive, I found this place a bit expensive for where it is but still a better deal than most of the hotels you will find. Overall, good experience, if I were to go back I would go with something with a better location."
2848330,81354366,2016-06-22,42618848,Michael,We had a wonderful stay. Easy to find and close to South Station (and the bus hub). The flat is located in Chinatwon. The aparment was spotless cleaned and the kitchen is very well equiped. Very quiet neighbourhood but still central. A nice place to relax after a long day of sightseeing. After a very long trip the complementray water on the table was perfect. Fast Wifi.
2848330,93654836,2016-08-13,58201096,Suzy,"Great location, close to everything. Comfortable and well-equipped. There is air conditioning in the bedrooms but not the living area - it's probably all you need most of the time, but we hit a particularly hot couple of days."
2848330,94905928,2016-08-17,2706189,Christy,We were on a work trip and the place was very convenient location-wise.  It is sparsely decorated with the basic conveniences.
4032126,19250836,2014-09-08,17442227,Dorothea,"Had a great few days at Giuseppe's place. The location is very convenient, especially if you're planning to got to Harvard/MIT - it's just 2 mins from the metro stop and the journey there takes only about 20mins. The room is perfect with a big bed, air conditioning, lots of room to leave your stuff and very clean. Giuseppe couldn't have been a nicer host! Would come back any time!"
4032126,19703638,2014-09-16,20918496,Koichi,I had wonderful days in Giuseppe's place. I loved the room. I wish I could stay longer.
4032126,25975824,2015-01-31,26068649,Hakim,It was good stay at Guiseppe's place! he is an accommodating and flexible host. The bed is really comfortable and the train stops really close to his apartment!. I would recommend it to anyone in need of short term stay in the area.
4032126,27966172,2015-03-15,22532288,Erdenebayr,Hey.  You are friendly. And your apartment is quite and comfortable. I have good spring break at here. Last  thank you
4032126,39629192,2015-07-25,34354805,Nikita,"I had a long stay near 2 months in Giuseppe's apartment. Once I had contacted him, he said that the room listed is not available, but he had another one for me, with one window. I was very happy to hear this because I hadn't any other choices in this price range. Unfortunately, it turned out that this room were without air conditioning and had only a bed and a small glass table for lamp, nothing else. Oh, yes, and the only door for whole apartment to laundry. But later Giuseppe helped me to move a table from another room to mine, and this made last two weeks of my stay. But anyway, living room's feature a good chairs and table, so you can use them. Apartment itself is quite good except of always squeaky floor and HD sound system which enables you to hear any noises behind the walls. Bed in my room was good. Kitchen is very good and it has everything you may probably need. There is four other rooms in apartment and Giuseppe also rents some of them to other people. Neighborhood is full of students, that is nice. But sometimes (usually at Friday evenings) they turn on loud music, which luckily can be heard only from kitchen. Generally I am satisfied with my stay, it was OK, thank you Giuseppe for hosting me!"
4032126,64376941,2016-03-03,8161608,Taylor,"Guiseppe is easy-going and considerate and his apartment is well stocked, comfortable, and close to the T. That's pretty much all you need, ever."
4032126,67930135,2016-04-01,58293784,Adrià,I have to thank Giuseppe for helping me with all I needed and for his understanding. I had some issues to book the place but the experience there was great!
4032126,71830147,2016-04-29,5374346,Peter,"Giuseppe was an outstanding host and being a guest at his apartment was truly a pleasure! He was incredibly courteous, helpful and accommodating from the moment I booked the place through the entire stay."
The apartment itself was clean and in a convenient part of town. Being  between Cambridge and Brookline provided an ideal starting point for searching for a more permanent place to live. It's close to groceries,"live music and delicious food. Great place!\"",,,,
4032126,95861674,2016-08-21,79462871,Tewa,"It was really nice staying at Giuseppe's. My room was nice and spacious with AC. The apartment is in a great location with everything (food, metro, CVS, grocery) within walking distance."

"I've never experienced like this nice house so far.\"",,,,,
3628320,28735258,2015-03-29,12702848,Gaurav,"Since Michael was out of town, his housemate Chris welcomed us inside. Our room was clean and the bed was really comfortable. Chris provided us with clean towels and he also offered us bagels and coffee in the morning. He also recommended us different places to visit in Boston."
The nearest metro station is a quick 5 minutes walk away and it will take you all the way to downtown Boston and to Cambridge as well. There's also a coffee place,"a grocery store and other small restaurants and cafes around the corner.\"",,,,
3628320,31989878,2015-05-12,32125295,Louise,"Michael and his roommates were nice to my friends and I. The room was the same as the picture and the neighbourhood was quiet and quite near from downtown, great for a short stay."
3628320,32566408,2015-05-19,2643989,Manuel,"We didn't get to meet Michael as he was out of town but communicating with him was very smooth. His roommates are super friendly and made us feel welcomed. The room was as described and comfortable enough for three people. Plus, the house is a five-minute walk from the red line so getting downtown is really easy."
3628320,33016199,2015-05-24,32690763,Callum,"Michael was helpful when it came to organizing the trip and getting information, though he was on a trip so we met his roommate Mario instead. The neighborhood is said to be sketchy but we didn't have any problem there, it was calm and safe. The flat was also only 20 minutes away by public transport to the center of Boston and that was really nice. The room fits the description well (except the futon didn't have any blanket), the only problem was the host, we didn't really feel welcomed and he spent most evenings singing loudly in front of his computer next to our room so he wasn't really concerned by our stay."
Overall I would say that it is a good place to crash for students who want to discover Boston,"but you will be disappointed if you are looking for something quiet.\"",,,,
3628320,36676919,2015-06-30,32309047,Hai,Michael and his roommate are great hosts. They are very nice and helpful. I really enjoyed my stay at their apartment.

3628320,42266794,2015-08-12,11922076,Marina,"It was a great experience. The room had enough space and the dog was very friendly. Michael's flatmate, Mario, even made us breakfast!! The flat was really close to the train station."
3628320,43762974,2015-08-22,34313445,Sanjeeb,"It was a good feeling to stay in Michael apartment. He was out of station when we reached to Boston metro station but he sent his friend (Mario) for welcome. He has given complete freedom to stay in his apartment. He was also guided us for tourist places with cheaper price. If we will go Boston, we will prefer to stay his apartment."
3628320,44459501,2015-08-26,39762110,Brittany,Michael was nice and flexible about our arrival time. Convenient location near the T. Comfortable room!

8751275,50401187,2015-10-11,43619394,Fumi,We arrived late and left early.  I did not meet the host at all.  The place is enough for our purpose as we just needed a place to shower and sleep. The place is basic and clean. The host was very helpful in providing information on places where we can have our meal.
8751275,50808758,2015-10-14,28025295,Jerrold,This was a simple apartment with an extremely comfortable bed and a clean and well stocked toilet. Great place!

8751275,54545615,2015-11-21,35415827,Evan,"Stayed here for a Monday-Friday, very comfortable apartment.  I was not doing any big cooking, but the place had a kitchen with pots, pans, utensils.  Close to many restaurants and grocery stores, also very close to public transportation.  Hip seeming neighborhood in general.  Yu Chen was quick to respond to any Air Bnb messages."

8751275,57462410,2015-12-26,50244790,Laura,YuChen ist ein sehr unkomplizierter und freundlicher Gastgeber. Wir haben uns in der Wohnung sehr wohl gefühlt. Super Preis Leistungsverhältnis und eine gute Anbindung in die Stadt. Außerdem konnten wir jederzeit die Küche mitbenutzen. Vielen Dank!
8751275,57691881,2015-12-28,6927214,Philip,YuChen was a great host. We felt very welcome and he even allowed us to leave our luggage in the apartment for the day of our departure since our bus connection was late in the night. The location was very convenient and the room was nice.
8751275,58076230,2015-12-31,51605837,Mackenzie,"YuChen was great! The place that he provided was comfortable and private. He also was friendly, responsive, and respectful."
8751275,58482174,2016-01-02,52897350,Alex,"Yu Chen's place was the perfect conclusion to my partner and I's vacation.  After spending 10 days traveling through South America with friends and being laid over in Boston, it was a wonderful feeling to be in a place with a kitchen smack dab in the middle of one of the city's premier music neighborhoods.  Yu Chen was extremely responsive, very considerate to our need for privacy, and pleasant when we met him.  Highly recommended if you are a music fan and have an affinity for wandering around."
8751275,58988784,2016-01-05,49516079,Matt,Our room was small and simple but that's what we were looking for/expected. We never met the host but it was a good experience!
8751275,59339264,2016-01-09,11008463,Mark,"as described, easy to set up with good communication. recommend."
8751275,59443531,2016-01-10,39214998,Dinh,"NO SECURED BEDROOM DOOR! I will get back to that later. My girlfriend and I never met YuChen. However, the check-in process was seamless. He was responsive with all the information. The place was very clean with access to a full kitchen. The location is located really close to the subway station (Allston St, Green B Line). Bed is a queen size. A/C is manual, so you can adjust if it is too cold. He also provided  two Brita water filters, so you don't need to buy water. Fresh towels are there. HOWEVER, going back to the NON-SECURED BEDROOM DOOR, it is the ONLY CON of his place. There is no lock to the bedroom door, so you are at the mercy of whoever you stay with. Personally, I prefer having a door that I can lock and control my privacy. I really hope that he installs some sorts of locks for the bedrooms."
8751275,60711812,2016-01-26,53488668,Jesse,"Great place, I had a wonderful stay. YuChen is very respectful and a great host!"
8751275,60903888,2016-01-29,54012880,Natalie,The place is nice and very convenient to the T station. Many good restaurants near his place. Yet the lock is not functioning which it is quite low privacy.
8751275,61433093,2016-02-04,21248192,Vyacheslav,"Great place for a few days stay. The room is nice, clean and quiet. A lot of shops, restaurants nearby. The train and bus stop are in 5 minutes walk. It's a shared living space but the guys living there were very friendly and ready to help. Highly recommend."
8751275,64511466,2016-03-05,51179858,Adam,"I never had the chance to meet YuChen, but my stay there was nice. The door to the apartment was broken but fortunately there was someone there who let me in. The place was quiet. I would stay there again."
8751275,65046437,2016-03-10,13522182,Sofi,"The room was just as what it looked in the picture. A lock for the room would have been great, the bed was really comfy and the closet has enough space to put your stuff. The hosts were nice and kind."
8751275,65196628,2016-03-11,41562061,Roger,"This is a great place, located near the T station and close to Star Market. The room is clean and quiet, and the bed is comfortable. I would definitely stay there again."
8751275,69169967,2016-04-09,3109156,Sam,"Great room, great location, great price! Highly recommend it!"
8751275,69804352,2016-04-13,47353881,Sandy,"The room is as advertised. I didn't get to see Yuchen but he arranged everything nicely and the other tenant helped us too. The location is close to many attractions, 30 minutes to Harvard Square and Boston Common. Good for budget travel:-)"
8751275,70442084,2016-04-17,2473060,Scott,Check in was easy. Room is as described. Bathroom could use a clean.
8751275,70728690,2016-04-20,50011864,Mindi,"YuChen had everything ready when we arrived! It was a great location, very clean, and we enjoyed our stay!! My sister and I ran the Boston marathon and were so happy for such a nice location at a great price!"
8751275,70971344,2016-04-22,66066145,Jocelyn,"YuChen was very easy to get a hold of and made it easy for me to find and access the apartment, even with my late arrival. Room is a clean bedroom in a basement apartment, which is shared with another couple. Everything was as expected, and the couple in the apartment was also very welcoming. Plenty of closet space, and available space in the fridge for food storage. All in all, exactly as advertised, with easy access to the B green line T."
8751275,71116470,2016-04-23,39824932,Diana,"Aside from an initial miscommunication with the keys, I had a pleasant stay. The apartment is very clean and well-kept. The two other suitemates were friendly. It is very easy to get to the T and a number of restaurants."
8751275,71178125,2016-04-24,11153734,Rachel,Listing description is completely accurate - the room is comfortable and quiet with a nice bed and clean sheets and towels. The apartment has a shared kitchen and bathroom and both are clean. Although our visit was very short we felt welcome and appreciated YuChen's hospitality.
8751275,71902631,2016-04-29,56366608,Mariana,"El apartamento está muy bien ubicado, con facilidad de transporte público, la habitación es cómoda y Yu Chen es muy amable. Lo recomiendo."
8751275,72895593,2016-05-05,59457833,Alvin,"Very convenient location, just a 3 minute walk from the metro green line, which I took every day while I was in Boston. Within 10 minute radius there are convenience shops, supermarkets and restaurants, including Chinese cuisine and that's a plus. Room appears as in the photo. Host is warm and hospitable and so are his other roommates."
8751275,73536778,2016-05-08,604862,Hiram,"Apartment just as described. Small, cozy, in the basement. Easy access to subway B-Green line. Although I didn't meet YuChen in person, he arranged everything for us and he was helpful answering me some doubts by text message. The place is shared with a couple. Both of them really nice persons."
8751275,73987884,2016-05-12,64409823,Andrea,"The apartment is small but with all the necessary to spend some days Boston in a sufficient good way. It is near the subway and in a peaceful position with lots of restaurants. In the apartment also lives a couple: nice and very kind people. So, don't miss this chance !"
8751275,74578536,2016-05-15,4716869,Monica,"Communication was good; the room is as described and clean;  neighborhood quiet and nice, near public transportation, great pastry and wine shop very close by; although we did not cook there, kitchen seemed well equipped with a medium size refrigerator with plenty of room for you. The common areas could use a serious clean and are shared with a very nice couple."
8751275,75180335,2016-05-19,69116893,Emily,"YuChen made finding the place and getting settled in very easy. The room itself was exactly what you needed after a long day of exploring the city. It was simple but clean and comfortable. The shared bathroom could have been cleaner and a hand towel would be nice, but it was manageable. The location is really nice! We felt very comfortable walking around, the train stops are very convenient and allowed us to travel downtown to all of the sites with ease. We didn't have the opportunity to meet YuChen in person, but he made our stay really easy."
8751275,75486098,2016-05-21,22501483,Becky,Great location. Everything was labeled in the house. Comfortable bed. Good place to stay.
8751275,75709733,2016-05-22,14680906,Mark,YuChen's apartment worked out great for our weekend adventure to Boston. Is has a great location near Boston University. There were great restaurants near by and an amazing bakery right around the corner for breakfast. The description of the room is accurate and is perfect for anyone looking to travel simple.
8751275,77588946,2016-06-02,73879356,Ru,The room was in a basement apartment and it was very cozy. It was very close to transit which made getting around easy. Yuchen was a great host and I would definitely stay here again whenever I'm back in Boston.
8751275,78427984,2016-06-06,1827158,Uzoma,The listing was accurate. It is a small basement apartment with all the basic amenities. Perfect spot to lay your head after a day out in the city. Central location in the Boston University campus.
8751275,78880830,2016-06-09,28066167,Federico,"The apartment  is great. The neighborhood  is very quiet  and there are many stores for doing the groceries. It is close to the green line, so you can commute  without  any problem. We didn't  have many chances to talk with YuChen, but he seems a nice host. I recommend this place."
8751275,81003991,2016-06-20,56615389,Annaëlle,"Notre séjour s'est bien passé chez Yuchen.  Nous avons pu rencontrer d'autre Airbnb, cela n'as pas poser de problème. Cependant nous n'avons pas rencontrer l'hôte mais il est rester tres joignable."
8751275,82985170,2016-06-30,77355812,Mercedes,"Opción práctica, cerca de transporte público."
8751275,84710847,2016-07-08,29413747,Por,It was nice staying there. The place is very close to subway and room is nice. Yu-Chen responded me very fast when I need help. Only one thing that I don't like is the bathroom. I think It would be better if you have one bathroom per one guest room. We had to share bathroom with the other gust and It took a long time to wait. And I also felt bad when they had to wait us.
8751275,85651382,2016-07-12,12326388,Nora,"I didn't actually meet Yu Chen but my communication with him was great. He texted twice and emailed before I arrived with easy arrival instructions. Everything was clearly laid out. Yu Chen also let me stay an extra 30 mins past check out time no problem. The place was quiet - I only heard other guests when they arrived but the place was really quiet when I was there. The place is no frills, but I was only there for one night to see a show at the Paradise (only 10 mins away) so I didn't need much. The real deal with this place is the location. It really can't be beat! The Green B Line is one block away, there's tons of shops, restaurants, bars, a CVS, and I got my nails done down the street. The apartment itself is on a relatively quiet tree-lined street - I didn't hear anything inside. Here's where I really couldn't believe my luck - I got overnight street parking for free right down the block. I had planned on stashing my car at an overnight pay lot but I ended up finding street parking just down the block - no meter or anything! The only parking restriction was for street cleaning but that wasn't the night I stayed."
8751275,86269413,2016-07-15,1807445,Rodrigo,"El lugar está a unos 20 minutos en metro de la South Station y a unos 5 minutos caminando al bajarse del tram. Se trata de un subterráneo habilitado con 2 piezas. El lugar es limpio, cocina y baño compartidos y limpios. No tuvimos problema. No tiene AC pero sí un ventilador grande que ayuda, pero en verano es mucho el calor. En general todo bien, sin problemas. El lugar era tal cual había sido descrito."
8751275,87261484,2016-07-19,19637386,Evan,"We stayed during the summer and there is no AC, so it was pretty hot. Otherwise, great bang for your buck."
8751275,88101889,2016-07-23,76371496,Marcelo,"The room was very clean and comfortable, the location was excellent it was near everything, Yu-Chen was an awesome host."
8751275,88430656,2016-07-24,64996938,硯丞,"The place of the room was really good , it was quite and near the subway station."
Also the bed was too comfortable let me almost miss the check out time.,,,,,

8751275,95142276,2016-08-18,32446209,Austin,"This was a great room, and very convenient for the price. Though we didn't see him during our stay, Yu-Chen was extremely nice and answered every question we had. Parking was available on the street in front of the apartment. Access to the T was very close, and took us anywhere in Boston we wanted to go."
8751275,96001956,2016-08-21,50905447,Joey,Room was clean and lots of privacy. Great location -near many restaurants and college area. Yu Chen was very friendly and chill. Excellent value for its price
8751275,97719550,2016-08-28,44765595,Jens,"Yu Chen's Apartment had all essentials needed for our short stay in Boston! It was simple but a great location to start our tour of the city. Checking in and out was very easy, as well as our communication with Yu-Chen. I would definitely stay at his apartment again."

8272350,49499946,2015-10-04,8336376,Suraya,"My stay with Erin and Matt was great. Their home, including the room I stayed in, was very peaceful and well decorated. I cooked a few times and they had every utensil/dish I needed. The neighborhood is really nice and very close to public transit. And their dog is an absolute sweetheart. :)"
8272350,52164693,2015-10-26,14101568,Sean,Erin and Matt were fantastic hosts. They opened up the driveway for our rental car and were super generous with advice. They even let me borrow their card for the T system so that I can explore Boston without having to pay for transport or drive.
The house is a nice old house that has been subdivided. It was super clean,and we were welcome to coffee and to use the kitchen,which was nice. It is located a 5 minute walk from a T station and in a pleasant area. There are a couple of good bars and a whole foods nearby. The room and bed were quite comfortable and the bathroom was clean.,,,
Erin and Matt are great people,"with a great place and a wonderful dog. I would recommend staying with them!\"",,,,
13797162,88428728,2016-07-24,29246245,Sean,Beautiful space in a convenient location! We had everything we needed and were only a short bike ride into downtown.
13797162,91263635,2016-08-04,27488269,Meaghan,"Marla and Coe are friendly hosts that are obviously committed to making sure you have everything you need and that you are comfortable. The neighborhood is pretty cool, free street parking, close to some shops and restaurants in Roxbury and a short drive to anywhere in Boston. The apartment is exactly as shown in the photos, clean, safe, beautiful, and well appointed."
13797162,94506222,2016-08-16,83753660,Samantha,We had a wonderful experience! Marla and Coe are great hosts. They were there to welcome us and show us the space. The apartment is very comfortable and well kept. We felt right at home.
13797162,97656888,2016-08-28,79798534,Lydia,"This is a beautiful apartment a few miles outside of the city.  There are transport options which making getting in and out of Boston easy.  Marla and Coe were friendly and welcoming, communicating clearly and were really flexible with our arrival time (our train was delayed an hour)."
This apartment is luxurious,the kitchen is big with all you could need.  We cooked meals here and had no problem with any of the appliances.  The living area was spacious and comfortable.  The TV is little but they have an amazing array of channels that will never leave you without something to watch.,,,,
The bed was a bit hard and the blinds don't make the room dark,so if you need pitch black to sleep this isn't the place for you.,,,,
This area of Boston is definitely residential do if you're keen to explore the city you will need to travel in,but this was an easy process.  We used buses and uber,"both cheap and efficient ways of getting in and out of the city.\"",,,
13797162,98361128,2016-08-30,112332,Irene (And Jay),"We communicated with Marla, and Coe was there to greet us. This place is s beautiful gem and is wonderfully comfortable! Both Marla and Coe are very nice and great communicators. I wish I would've had the time to seek out some of their art in display in the city!!"
I would definitely stay here again; but given its location,I would be inclined to have a car at this place. Walking was nice,but about 3/4 of a mile to get to transportation. If weather was poor,it wouldn't have been a fun walk. There is always Uber or a cab,"but I felt safe enough to walk.\"",
13797162,99421879,2016-09-04,23935269,Isabella,"Beautiful, stylish apartment, we really enjoyed our time. Everything you may need is available (fully equipped kitchen, selection of tea & coffee, shampoo & conditioner, Netflix etc.). Marla was very friendly, relaxed and helpful (we had some issues with our luggage and she offered to help us out while we were waiting for it to arrive). The apartment is located in a quiet neighborhood which however also means it`s a 10 or more minutes walk to the nearest subway station. Wasn`t a problem for us but might be important to know for others. The nearest supermarket is within walking distance."
"All in all we loved it and we definitely would stay there again if we return to Boston. Thanks to Marla & Coe!\"",,,,,
8116523,46080158,2015-09-07,41902647,Matt,"Although I did not get to meet Frank in person, he was very quick to respond to my questions, very friendly, and did an amazing job making sure we had all the accommodations we needed. I did get a chance to meet Frank's brother and he was also incredibly kind and gave us some great recommendations for activities to do in the the city."
The condo was very nice. It was in an amazing neighborhood on the bottom floor (partially underground,which was cool) of a very nice complex,it was quiet and extremely clean. Very convenient walk to Newbury Street,the Public Garden,Fenway Park,and  Downtown Boston. This place is very well priced for the neighborhood it is in and I would highly recommended staying here. Next time I am in Boston
8116523,47522138,2015-09-20,23579653,Tucker,"Had an excellent stay here!  Apartment was clean and very spacious.

Would absolutely recommend staying here, and will likely try and do so again myself in the future!"
8116523,48311380,2015-09-25,43119009,Stephanie,"Location was absolutely perfect! We walked everywhere in Boston - Cambridge, North End, Waterfront - you name it, we walked there.  Cozy little place with just enough space for 2 people - we were rarely there anyway with so much to see in Boston. I never saw Frank, but met his Brother & handyman - nice people and always great response when we needed it.  I definitely recommend!"
8116523,48911015,2015-09-29,26629277,LaNae,"For using airbnb for the first time, Frank made it so easy for us!

8116523,49831568,2015-10-06,12753162,Danlei,"Location is perfect. When I went there, one guy who was living 20 years ago in this building came to revisiting.  He stood in front of the building and told me his stories with deep emotions. Lovely. Frank is very helpful for answering questions to support so much."
8116523,50007108,2015-10-08,44025565,Tim,"Very nice one bedroom garden apartment in a perfect Back Bay location.  Linens were top notch.  Easy check-in and out.  Would definatey book again.  Thank you, Frank!"

8116523,52231208,2015-10-27,5199537,Genesa,The flat is in a great location in Back Bay. Very easy to walk to shops abs dining and also the river.
The flat is comfortable and stylish and a nice place to stay.,,,,,
We had one issue when we arrived that the second bed was not set up. Frank was responsive and able to get someone to come and set it up but it did take some time so I recommend you inform him before your arrival if you need to have a second bed in the unit for your stay.,,,,,
"I would definitely stay again at this place. \"",,,,,
8116523,52360985,2015-10-28,46653672,Roy,Overall the neighborhood was nice and the description was very accurate. Definitely a nice place and would gladly stay there again.

8116523,53209797,2015-11-06,11871118,Matt,Frank made my trip extremely convenient by having the house instructions ready for me in a timely manner describing exactly how to get in the the house. Everything was as described. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and I had a perfect night's sleep. Very centrally located.
8116523,53628157,2015-11-10,41107373,Tina,"The lodging at 189 Beacon Street was a great location for anyone wanting to tour the city on foot! It is the perfect location to stay in Boston and this little apartment was so cute. It offers everything you need to stay comfortably with a great full kitchen, living room, full bath and bedroom with a full size bed. There were a couple of things that had not been mentioned in any previous reviews that I will mention and may only be personal preference."
1. The apartment is the basement of the brownstone and at night when we were trying to sleep in the bedroom we could here people walking around upstairs until after 1am. In addition  we could also hear muffled conversations through the ceiling. (As far as any noise from the street that was very minimal and very tolerable).,,,,,
2. The bedroom's bed linens were beautiful,but made from microfiber which can be very sweaty at night,but I think that's just personal preference.,,,
3. The cot that is offered is not very comfortable to sleep on.,,,,,
4. There was a slight sewer smell in the basement apartment.,,,,,
Overall,I would probably stay again,but if there was another bedroom in this area at a lower rate I would stay there instead.,,,
"\"",,,,,
8116523,53715496,2015-11-11,47898443,Ellen,"This was an amazing experience.  The location was so close to everything but yet the neighborhood friendly & quiet.

I  would definitely recommend this place!  Ellen"
8116523,54266156,2015-11-17,40441825,Andrea,"Staying at Frank's Brownstone in Back Bay was a great experience for my boyfriend and I. The town was so beautiful to look at and there was a lot of stores and things to do in the area. I highly recommend Frank's apartment over a hotel any day because it makes you feel at home and on vacation at the same time. The back bay common garage, where I parked my car, was only 12 minutes away by walking and I thought the rates were fair and cheaper than NYC. I hope to rent this apartment again in the future because a few days in Boston isn't enough time to see and do everything you want. Frank's apartment had clean linen and towels and had everything we needed. Overall I had a great stay and I'm sure Frank's future guests will also have a great experience as well."
8116523,54521554,2015-11-21,13831260,Uri,The apartment is just as advertised. It is in a great neighborhood and was within walking distance to everything.
"Thanks again for a great stay! \"",,,,,
8116523,54866278,2015-11-25,20107175,Howard,"Frank was a great host. He has a nice place and it's in a great location and close to Newbury Street, restaurants and stores. It was very clean and had everything you need. The bedroom is small and the bed is comfortable but you can only get into it from one side unless you climb over. There was a damp smell I think from being part on the lower level but it was fine. Overall it's a great place to stay!"
8116523,54947995,2015-11-25,12614753,Sean,"Loved this apartment! It was bright, clean and spacious. Very close to so many shops, restaurants and bars. Would love to come back!"
8116523,55423304,2015-12-01,40069297,Erin,"We stayed here for over Thanksgiving break and just loved it. Franklin was extremely helpful and very communicative with any questions we had. This was our first experience with AirBnB and we will definitely use Franklin again when we are in Boston. The property was in a perfect location. Close to shops, eateries, and transportation.  Quiet sleeps at night and very safe location."

8116523,56007005,2015-12-07,9738183,Nick,"Summary: nice host, great location, good quality furniture/decor/amenities, terrible smell"
I stayed in Frank's place with 2 friends and we fit comfortably. One in the full bed,one on the twin cot,one on the couch. You could fit another in the bed if you're okay getting cozy.,,,
It was very easy to get in and out. Frank gave us a code,which unlocked a box containing keys. He was very responsive with questions,and made an extra effort to help us when we lost a watch.,,,
The street is a main avenue with high traffic but all residential housing. Sound at night was not an issue. Parking was somewhat difficult.,,,,,
The apt is a basement unit. It has a separate entrance a few steps below the front entrance. Sunlight was fine. But the smell... The apt was dank and smelled like a sewer. The odor is noticeable as soon as you enter and Frank's scented sticks didn't totally cut it.,,,,,
As I understood,the apt had access to a patio. It does not.,,,,
"Would I return? Only if the smell was gone. Would I go to Frank if he had another place? Yes.\"",,,,,
8116523,56535708,2015-12-14,7599865,Raegan,The apartment is very cozy and exactly as listed.  Frank helped me do a last minute extension when my plans changed and everything was easy from start to finish.
8116523,57160485,2015-12-22,855723,Bridget,"\"My husband, daughter, and I stayed for a week, and we would not stay there again. The unit is EXTREMELY inaccurately represented in the listing. The listing describes a one-bedroom apartment with \"\"access to the entire unit"
8116523,58190567,2016-01-01,12734370,John,"The location was great.  The pictures were accurate.  The basement unit is small, but have everything one needs for 2-3 people.  The cleanliness was just ok.  The internet did not work and was an essential part of our stay, so, having given a day to resolve the problem, we had to vacate after the 1st night of a 5 night stay.  The Host refused to refund the unused nights, but Airbnb got involved and forced a refund.  If everything goes well during your stay, you will be fine. If not, good luck..."
8116523,58682718,2016-01-03,8992000,Addy,"Frank responded to all of our messages extremely quickly and was very patient when we were having problems with the Internet. He was a great, helpful host and the apartment is very nice. Great location."
8116523,60166417,2016-01-19,53967713,Elliot,"Overall great experience staying at Frank’s place for a weekend. The place was just as described and was a sweet little refuge from the cold weather and wet snow outside. Not to mention, great location! My girlfriend and I had a great stay."
And if you have a severe anxiety issue with bed linen and towel cleanliness as I do,this place gets a big thumbs up!,,,,

First the location is ideal being on a residential part of Beacon with a very short walk to excellent coffee shops, bars, restaurants, and points of interest. The apartment itself is very comfortable and has great charm precisely as described. Frank had fast and friendly communication throughout the process and could not have been better to deal with.

Right in Back Bay, beautiful brownstone building, tree lined street - doesnt get any more old Boston then that. Quiet, cozy and comfortable. This charming apartment is all those things. High ceilings, warm lighting, heavenly mattress. Perfect for catching up on sleep or a romantic getaway. Walk to Boston Common park or down Newbury street, take it a little further into South End or Beacon Hill. Everything is just minutes away.  Definitely reaching out to Frank when planning my next trip to the Bean."

8116523,66185813,2016-03-20,32196697,Heather,"We had a great experience at Frank's place. He went out of his way before our trip to provide recommendations for local dining/drinking and continued to check in with us to ensure we were settled and happy with the accommodations. The neighborhood couldn't be more beautiful. It was convenient to everything. The block is quiet and the unit is exactly as advertised. We found it to be very clean and comfortable and it contained everything we needed during our stay. We did run into a small snag with the wifi at one point, but this was quickly resolved by Frank. There is a wee bit of a smell being on the garden level, kind of a must, but it dissipates once you're in the unit and we only really noticed it when we first walked in after being out for a bit, so I don't consider it a major issue. This is a wonderful hideaway in Boston and I highly recommend it! If I ever go back, I'll definitely stay here again. It has all the modern conveniences you could want, while also have a very cool factor in terms of the space and neighborhood.  Also, there were three adults in our group and I slept on the blow up mattress, which was a very nice one (tall and with extra cushion) and the linens were perfect. Super cozy blankets for cuddling up and watching HBO on the big TV! Thanks so much, Frank!"

Frank was very kind and made sure to check in on us before we arrived. His place was exactly as described and looked like the pictures listed.

It was clean and Frank was a good host.  He stayed in touch during my brief stay to make sure that everything was OK.,,,,,
The neighborhood is lovely - peaceful yet convenient.  I was able to go to 2 gorgeous parks and walk to the T.  There is also shopping and restaurants nearby.,,,,,
Unfortunately I'm not able to give 4-5 stars because there was an unpleasant odor the whole time I was there.  It was dank,musty,and strong.  If that gets resolved,then I would be able to recommend the place.,,

The location is excellent not far from great walking parks and the bustling Newbury St where you can find everything from sidewalk cafes to fine dining and all kinds of stores. The interior was very cozy, clean and comfortable. The exterior (entrance) of the place could use some clean up however as it seems some birds have nested high above the door and leave a mess down below just as you come and go from the place. The surrounding buildings also have their nice flower gardens and gates which this one could use. However these are just a couple aesthetic observances but it is still an excellent place to experience all that the Back Bay has to offer. I would definitely recommend it to others."

Frank was very responsive to any questions I had. The extra bed was set up and ready as requested in advance of our arrival. Plenty of extra towels and sheets were available if needed. Would definitely recommend this place.,,,,,
The only (minor) issues were that the bar stools were too high for the counter,making it awkward for sitting at. Also,"part of the rug is curled up and should be taped down as it was a tripping hazard. Still an overall great place.\"",,,

3808557,18039764,2014-08-20,19781324,Dave,This was our first experience of airbnb and what a great way to start. Tom has a fantastic apartment with rooftop area giving great views. Everything was clean and tidy with many new appliances and a smart shower room.  Excellent amount of space. The stairs are a bit of a challenge with suitcases but it is well worth the climb. An up-and-coming area with quick and easy bus service into the centre. Tom is a great person to deal with. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Thanks Tom.
3808557,19978505,2014-09-21,21260782,Ruth,"Firstly, Tom was an excellent host. I appreciated his very prompt responses to any questions I had prior to the trip. Upon arrival, everything I needed to know about the apartment and the neighbourhood was very clearly defined in the detailed instructions and recommendations he provided. Thank you Tom! Secondly, the apartment was amazing and exactly what I had hoped to find: clean, comfortable, with something unique to set it apart. Situated in the trendy South End, it was far enough from downtown to enjoy a peaceful village feel, yet close enough to commute in minutes. Enjoying the entire city skyline from the roofdeck’s panoramic viewpoint was the cherry on top for me. I already know where I’ll be staying on my next trip to Boston."
3808557,20379774,2014-09-28,20038292,Robert,"Thomas was extremely accommodating and easy to deal with.  He was readily available to answer any questions I had via text message or call.

We had a few minor travel changes after booking the apartment and he was very responsive and accommodating. The information that was emailed regarding the apartment was very clear.  Information regarding the access to the keys was defined clearly and we had no problems at all.  As a first time airbnb customer, I found the entire process to be very easy and we would definitely book through airbnb again."
Tom's apartment is great.  The apartment and features are just as they are shown in the pictures provided.  The apartment was clean and the space was great.  We referred to the instructions several times throughout our stay and we were always able to find our answer by the instructions.,,,,,
My husband and I and our two children were visiting our oldest that attends college nearby Tom's apartment.  This was very convenient and we were able to comfortable visit with our college student...not to mention walk everywhere! It was so much nicer to have this great space to visit vs a small hotel room.,,,,,
The helpful tips of nearby coffee,restaurant and convenience stores in the instructions were very helpful as well.,,,,
The shower is amazing and the décor in general is very inviting and modern.  We loved it.,,,,,

While we did not spend a lot of time in the apartment, it fit our needs and was the perfect location as it was close to the campus in which we spent most of our time.  Its unfortunate that it was a cold time of year for our visit, because we really did want to utilize the rooftop.

9858828,67242956,2016-03-27,39232850,Chase,Host was great at communicating and very fast to respond. He provided a great recommendation for a breakfast spot. The apartment is in great walking distance for Quincy market and almost anywhere in the north end. I appreciated the professionalism he demonstrated with a printed itinerary left at the apartment at my arrival.

Also,the room was so clean and the bed was so good!,,,,
The location was perfect for us.,,,,,
We will definitely come back to his place when we go to Boston,"again. Thank you Sean.\"",,,,
9858828,70485520,2016-04-18,60844366,Victoria,Great location and overall pleasant experience. Sean was very responsive and quick with any inquiries.  Highly recommended.

9858828,73415596,2016-05-08,1427631,Pedro,"Sean's flat is very cozy and comfortable. The bed was nice, as well as the Shower.  There is also a full, modern kitchen, which we did not use, but definitely a plus. Oh, another bonus is the Chromecast on the tv."
Location is fantastic. A lot of nice restaurants and bars in the neighborhood. From the flat it's also possible to walk to downtown and to the Acquarium.,,,,,
As for Sean,he was very attentive. Messaged us to check if we made it ok to his place. He was also super fast in his responses and was ok with us checking out after 5pm.,,,,
We Didn't meet him in person,"but he left a very positive impression on us. \"",,,,
9858828,74579041,2016-05-15,53584519,Kara,"This was our first experience using airbnb, will definitely not be the last!  The apartment was even nicer than we expected, super clean but cozy- so much nicer than staying in a hotel.  The location was perfect, we were within walking distance to every place we wanted to go, in fact we should have booked a weeks stay- that would be the only way to have enough time to visit all the amazing restaurants, hit up the comedy club for some more shows.  Sean was an excellent host, we did not get a chance to meet but when I had to ask a couple questions he got back to me immediately.  We are already looking forward to booking another trip next year!"
9858828,75295537,2016-05-20,28155248,Vincent,"Sean could not be there when I came in but has been very helpful for any questions I had. The apartment is extremely well located (3 min walk from Haymarket, 10 min from Long Wharf or Quincy Market). It fits its description but you have to notice that the stairs are extremely tiny to get through."
Some noise early morning because of a man working in the backyard but nothing else to stay.,,,,,
"Definitely a place to stay in Boston.\"",,,,,

Sean was very accommodating to our early check-in needs, and the entire process was extremely hassle-free.  I would definitely recommend this place and hope to return."
9858828,79419561,2016-06-12,63751198,Ashley,"Sean's place is tidy and cozy, and in the perfect location for walking to great bars and restaurants. I doubt there's anywhere to stay that's closer to North End night life. We were in town for a wedding and were able to walk to all the events in under 15 min. It was great! Checking in was easy, and Sean was available whenever I texted him with questions. Overall a very easy and convenient experience! Highly recommended!"
9858828,80812999,2016-06-19,20622883,Steve,Very accommodating.   Had a beautiful weekend in Boston thanks to Sean.  The neighborhood is charming and close to any spot in the city you would want to go.

9858828,85372521,2016-07-11,24005220,Chung,"The host, Sean, was always available and prompt for questions we had before and during our stay. The room was very cozy, located at a great location nearby great restaurants and transportation. Markets and harbor were also very close by, yet the area around the apartment building was quiet. Overall it was a great stay. Thanks Sean for accommodating us!"
9858828,86717183,2016-07-17,58620076,Rudra,Amazing location and overall a great place to stay. The only inconvenience is that the sleeping area and bed are quite small. It should be fine for 1 person but it was a tight fit for 2 people.
9858828,88429777,2016-07-24,80770380,Barbara,The location was perfect and the apartment met our needs.

9858828,98282179,2016-08-30,45557974,Meghan,"Great location in the North End on a quiet street! The apartment needed a few small fixes that would have made our stay even better. As others have posted, the bed is quite small and directly next to the (mostly doorless) bathroom."
9349614,71009976,2016-04-22,41534120,Chloé,"Emily et Carl forment une belle famille avec leur petite fille Ivy, ils sont très sympathiques et accueillants, curieux et conviviaux."
Nous nous sommes tout de suite sentis bien avec nos deux filles dans leur grand appartement vraiment chaleureux et trés ensoleillé,à 2 minutes du Franklin Park,le plus grand de Boston.,,,
Le quartier est résidentiel,avec une aire de jeux pour enfants à 50m et la ligne orange du métro à 10mn à pied (20 mn de down town).,,,,
Ce logement est idéal pour une famille qui souhaite vivre au plus près d'une famille de Boston,à l'écart des hordes de touristes.,,,,
Merci à eux pour tout !!,,,,,

Everything is well-maintained and organized, including an amazing fullly functional kitchen, linens, beddings, etc. Tanya gave us a very comprehensive instruction about the condo and was also really responsive throughout our stay. The condo is very close to T and shops on Centre street yet sitting on a quiet street with parking. Perfect find for us!"

The apartment was very warm - a real home. It didn't just reflect the listing accurately, it was way better in person. Very well maintained, super clean, beautifully decorated and exceptionally comfortable. Especially my bed with those buttery soft sheets. Can't wait to find out the brand so I can order some as soon as I get home. Overall - lovely and super relaxing stay in Davids cozy apartment.  We also genuinely enjoyed getting to know the neighborhood. The area was very charming and quiet and very close to some pretty cool places to hang out and the city center. Definitely recommend!"
13190410,87078250,2016-07-18,80370263,Nekesha,My group and I visited from Toronto and had a great experience and we were all pleased with David's home and he was prompt with replies. Thanks again.
13190410,91468691,2016-08-05,83474036,Yang,David's place is very clean. The neighborhood is safe and convenient. The subway is about 10 minutes walk. I will recommend this place.
13190410,91881905,2016-08-07,21824048,Daisy,David is a very nice host and he is very helpful during our stay. The location is good and there have a lot of restaurants and stores close to the house. It's pity for us just stay for one night and if possible I hope we can stay for more nights:) will definitely choose this place again! Thank you David.

11907764,69132568,2016-04-09,40603819,Janete,"Fiquei a vontade porque fiquei abandonada a propria sorte. Apos o primeiro contato e as breves explicacoes de como chegar e como sair, nao houve mais contato, ate o ultimo dia, pois o Anfitriao queria saber o horario da partida, porque teria outro hospede pra chegar, assim mesmo fui abandonada na hora no segundo andar com as malas,pois o mesmo saiu de casa sem dizer nada antes do horario. O bairro, nao muito longe, mas muitos terrenos baldios e pontes a passar por baixo assombravam-me um pouco. Distante de pelo menos 1,4 milha da principal estacao de trem que leva ao centro. Os outros meios de transporte mais proximos parecem nao funcionar, ou sao inadequados para uma visitante de fora da regiao. A casa dificil definir pois existe duascom o numero 26. o quarto acarpetado e sem limpeza de muito tempo, para quem sabe o que e isso. Armario, somente uma  porta  incompleta e sem chave, apenas uma pequena cadeira. Cama, colchao envelhecido de doer a coluna. Cobertor? frio ou quente um so bem leve: durma com todos seus agasalhos se nao quiser passar frio. A porta do quarto alem de nao ter chaves, esta emperrada torna impossivel o fechamento do quarto. Banheiro razoavel, Cozinha: nao tem mesa, nem cadeira, nem talher, nem pratos, nem copos, nem panela ....nada para uso de hospede, sem dizer da sujeira da pia do fogao e do chao. A sala: tambem so tem 2 poltronas individuais, uma tv no chao.... tem wi-fi somente...."
11907764,70037476,2016-04-15,1043724,Manuela,"Christian was a very friendly host. Communication was great and we had everything we needed. His place is spacious and clean. We were able to use a private parking space, which was very practical. We would come back!"
11907764,71643960,2016-04-27,19310352,Craig,"Christian met me exactly when I told him I would like to come. Christian was warming, welcoming and overall great host. The ad description met the expectations. The place was quiet allowing access to a private room, kitchen and living room. It was great to find a place in the Boston area that had free overnight parking that was not on the street. It is a no-frills private bedroom, however, for the price it was reasonable. Would recommend this to others if needed."
11907764,72091250,2016-05-01,59013999,Khari,"So lucky to have found Christian. I was in Boston on business and screwed up my hotel reservations where I had to check out a day earlier than I was actually leaving. Thankfully I was able to book a last minute reservation with Christian, who despite a check-in time of after 7, allowed me to come by and check in early, which was greatly appreciated by a very tired traveler. The spot is nice, clean, and smells great and Christian did a great job making me feel welcomed in our brief exchanges. Would definitely recommend and look forward to staying again!"
11907764,72516214,2016-05-03,11378621,Fathi,"Christian was great! Although I made a last minute booking and checked in later in the night, he waited for me to arrive and had the room ready with fresh towel and linens. I was also given a reserved parking spot for my rental. He's a really smart guy working on several cool projects that we discussed; a genuine pleasure to meet."
11907764,72899691,2016-05-05,13561825,Justin,Great communication!
11907764,73190759,2016-05-07,30811727,Susan,"Christian was great to deal with, and even brought us the keys when it turned out our best checkin time conflicted with a commitment for him. The room was super clean and basically as described. We were only there for a short night, and quickly on to other things the next morning, so can't say much about the place otherwise. The neighborhood is fine, not fancy, but safe enough for walking around."
11907764,74072279,2016-05-13,46694342,Charles,"It was a private room with extra bed in case you brought guests. Big spacious. Bedroom Door sticks in jam and didn't close completely (may 2016), but down a little hall so still had privacy. Easy to park. Hosts were very nice. Newer construction place, fairly clean"
11907764,74174568,2016-05-13,36004174,Liane,"I enjoyed staying at Christian's place. He and his roommate were gracious hosts. I was in a different part of the city for the majority of my short trip and was unable to check in until the evening, and I really appreciate their flexibility with that. The room was no-frills but certainly a fine place to sleep for the night. I was not driving on this trip but would recommend this as a great place to stay for drivers, especially if you will be traveling later at night and do not feel comfortable walking from the bus stop or T station. The street parking seems ample."
11907764,74502381,2016-05-15,70358352,Fabiola,"Just returned home from a wonderful stay at Christian's home. Everything was accurate as far as the clearness, parking, room sizes go. In other words, he's right on top of everything. Christian was a great host and made us feel at home, right away. I was a little apprehensive about staying in a B&B with my children, but everything worked out find. His room mate even showed my son how to tie a tie, for the wedding we were attending. If I'm ever in Boston I would definitely stay here."
11907764,75078796,2016-05-18,42142202,Jana,He was a great host with a solid place to stay at. Very courteous and friendly. I've got no complaints about him or the place. Definitely recommended.
11907764,76149186,2016-05-25,13834421,Edward,Christian was very communicative and efficient before and during my stay. The apartment had the essentials and he told me to make myself home. The room was neat and ready to go. The door of the room did not close fully but since it was only him and his roommate there nothing to really worry about. The bathroom was clean and very quiet neighborhood. Great experience.
11907764,76312850,2016-05-26,70412504,Mark,Christian was very welcoming and an excellent host!
11907764,77234265,2016-05-30,4322066,Ed,"Christian wrote to me about at 3:23 pm on the day of my check-in, advising me that the boiler was down for maintenance and would be up the next afternoon. He confirmed that there was no hot water in the house. He went on to say that he would understand if I wanted to make changes and that the boiler maintenance had, in fact, been delayed a couple of days prior. I would have liked to have known this much earlier than late afternoon on the day of my arrival. I was pressed for time that day, I did not have time to make an alternate same-day booking at another Airbnb place on such short notice, and I had already made plans for that night to meet a friend based upon where Christian's house is. I asked Christian if there was a YMCA nearby where I could shower in the morning. He confirmed that there was one 5 minutes from his house. I decided that the situation was not ideal (which I told Christian), yet I decided to stick with this booking rather than have to change all of my plans at the last minute in a city which I do not know well outside of the downtown area."
Christian was flexible about my arrival time and was at the house to greet me at 8:00 pm when I arrived.,,,,,
The room itself was spartan yet clean. There were no towels of any size in the bathroom or anywhere in the room. I did not discover this until I arrived back at the house at about 11:00 pm after meeting my friend. Christian was either out or in bed at this point. The bathroom vanity was dirty and the shower was very dirty. The door to the bedroom does not close all the way,and anyone in the hallway could see right into the room. I personally did not care,yet others who are more modest and/or want more privacy might. The door was also extremely squeaky. One of the windows in the bedroom has neither blinds nor drapes. The next morning when I went to the kitchen to find a knife to cut an avocado,I found the kitchen was a mess (dirty dishes everywhere) and I literally could not find a knife anywhere.,,
I am an Airbnb host myself. I would have handled the situation with the boiler differently. I would have told my guest about the issue as soon as I knew about it,and I would have offered my guest a discount if the guest had decided to continue with the reservation.,,,,
I did sleep soundly on the comfortable mattress. Aside from the whole boiler issue,however,I do think that having towels readily available and a cleaner home aside from the bedroom would have gone a long way towards making this a much better experience.,,,
"\"",,,,,
11907764,78543159,2016-06-07,55215193,Tyler,Our stay was great. Christian even accommodated us arriving a little earlier to head to Fenway Park early which was very helpful. Extra towels were available and the room was how it was described.
11907764,79055158,2016-06-11,16356497,Jinqiang,"Nice place to stay,he was so friendly although I was late to reach his house."
11907764,79385387,2016-06-12,71708737,Patrick,Christian was very accommodating to the arrival time because my partner and I were in town for a festival. We appreciated the off street parking. The space was appropriate to our needs.
11907764,80331468,2016-06-17,24285767,David,"My stay was excellent. Christian went out of his way to welcome me in and show me the local environment, which is very important in my travels. All the amenities were perfect, access to everything at all times. I actually got to hang out a bit and learn some things about my host. ...something travelers need to do and Christian provided a welcoming environment for that as well"
11907764,84094155,2016-07-05,63278781,Yelena,"Christian wasn't available while we were there, but his roommate Angel was very welcoming! He checked up on us regularly, and even hung out with us a few times. Hosts aside, the room and home were really comfortable, and it was a short walk to a train station. Check in/out times were also flexible. I definitely recommend this place!"
11907764,84859234,2016-07-09,11396916,Katherine,"Townhouse was clean and freshly renovated. Wifi was fast, especially for our four devices. Really comfortable beds and bathroom. Hosts provide Keurig coffee in the morning and use of kitchen. It's about a 20-minute walk through a working class neighborhood to catch the T. We left our car (free parking!) in front of the townhouse."

11907764,85096902,2016-07-10,43004226,Nick,Friend and I visited Boston for first time and Christian was a great host. 1 mile walk to red line and comfy room with 2 beds.

9870,21995047,2014-10-27,17760867,Jj,"Brownstone apartment in great Back Bay location. Tidy apartment with super comfy bed, cable TV and everything else you need. Contact was easy and super efficient. Could also make use of a small gym at a nearby hotel the same company manage. Some issues with leakage from a Bay window during a heavy and windy downpour one night but I reported the issue so hopefully will be resolved asap. A great spot all round."
9870,32141289,2015-05-14,30125801,Adam,We had a great time. The area was beautiful and close the wonderful restaurants and shopping. I would definitely use seamless again
9870,34651283,2015-06-10,3390691,Ben,"Great location sandwiched between a wine store and French restaurant. We especially enjoyed the private-ish rooftop deck. Walking distance to the financial district and the back bay. The interior was a bit dated and since this property is run by a professional management company, it felt a little less personal than some other places I've stayed. All that aside, I'd stay here again without question."

5649821,39552675,2015-07-24,9472468,Lauren,"Please note that this is an apartment of an indoor smoker. While Nawab was very accommodating with a cleaning crew when he learned of my discomfort, I only stayed because I was locked in due to price and time constraints."
5649821,40799578,2015-08-02,36744184,Eric,This is prime location situated in between the Boylston and Chinatown subway stations. Perfect for those traveling to the nearby neighborhoods. But the amenities are bare; bring your own goodies and toiletries.
5649821,45115147,2015-08-31,26509654,Leila,"Nawab was a great host. Even thought he was out of town he had bother friend link with us and he was super nice and was able to help us on any issue we had for example arrival time. The apartment was super cute and small but spacious considering everything was in the same area. Its right in the heart of everything so it was super easy to go in and out of the apartment and go explore. there is a concierge that does check you in and out, you just gotta say your a friend in from out of town or something. Most of the guys are super nice except from this one late night guy. over all it was a great stay and i would recommend this stay to anyone else!!!"
5649821,51186936,2015-10-18,43397731,Claudia,"Location was great! Nawab receive us when arrived and explain us everything, he was really nice and helpful all time! Great experience!"

8065282,46965321,2015-09-14,36871915,Justin,"I had a great time staying at Jordan's place. The neighborhood is great and close to transports. The apartment and the room that I stayed in were very clean, organized and comfortable. Jordan was a great host. She made me feel very welcome at her place and helped me out a lot (recommending good places to eat in the area, loaning me her phone charger when I forgot mine etc.). I really recommend this place to Airbnb users."
8065282,47529682,2015-09-20,42534368,Gary,Jordan was very nice and accommodating. Small but cozy room. I enjoyed back deck.   Large selection of places to eat within 4 blocks of walking.
8065282,48030842,2015-09-22,13972876,John And Cindy,"The location of Jordan's home was fantastic.  I arrived late at night and was able to jump on the airport shuttle, get off at the T station, and walk three minutes to his place.  Neighborhood feels friendly.  Jordan was very prompt with all correspondences and detailed in the directions.  His apartment is quiet and welcoming."
8065282,48132896,2015-09-23,6319154,Ben & Shay,"I had a great time staying with Jordan, even though it was short, on an overnight connection."
I got in around midnight,so the location,just 3 mins by foot from the airport tram,was spot on! just cross the park from the tram spot,and i arrived.,
As i was arriving late,Jordan was super communicative,and sent me very detailed information to find his place,and get inside.,,
The room is cozy and nice,and I loved how the bed felt! Super comfy to lie in.,,,,
the bathroom is set with small bottles of soap,shampoo and what have you,in case you are missing something.,,,
On top of it all,Jordan is one of the nicest,laid back,genuine people i had met. He was helpful,communicative and out going in every way. I asked to leave my luggage after i checked out,since my flight was late the day after
Even though another guest came after me,and i checked out,Jordan was cool with keeping the luggage at his place until my flight time as well as have another shower to fresh up before i left.,,,
Really,no words to describe how amazing my experience of Boston had been,and it wouldnt had been as great if it had been in any other place.,,,
Jordan,thank you so much!,,,,

8065282,48446292,2015-09-26,22628925,Alicia,"Jordan's listing was as advertised. If you are looking for just a room within a short 3-5min walk to the Airport T subway station this is a fine location. I needed easy access to the airport and downtown and this was it. The neighborhood is old East Boston, a working class area of basic row houses.  Mine was a quick trip so I didn't venture into the neighborhood other than to and from the train. I'm a guy and it seemed safe enough, even at night. Jordan keeps a very clean and tidy home. The room was small, but good for a short trip. The bed was comfy, there is an empty closet with hangers and a nice eclectic book collection. Jordan wasn't around but we communicated as needed by text. He makes key access easy. The bathroom was very clean, including the shower, Jordan left fresh towels and even hotel size shampoo a few other sundries on the bathroom sink. Jordan was kind enough to offer use of his kitchen and living room. This is a good setup for one person, and even two if you are out and about most of the time. I was very comfortable and this was just right for my needs."
"Be prepared if you have luggage to enter through a locked door into a private alley sidewalk between the row homes and up a short flight of stairs in the back. It is perfectly safe.\"",,,,,
8065282,49193512,2015-10-01,44444701,David,The room was cozy albeit a bit warm and humid with no air conditioning. The room was described accurately and Jordan provided good directions and information that made our stay adequate.
8065282,49681765,2015-10-05,8164006,Annie,"I've never met Jordan, but he gave me very detailed instructions. He answered fast to my questions. Thanks to him, it was a lovely stay in Boston and his home. It's very close to the airport, so if you have baggage it's very easy. I'm recommending Jordan and gis home!"
8065282,49928178,2015-10-07,38141448,Allen,Jordan’s place is two minutes walking from the T Blue lind Airport stop. Very convenient to get to the airport. Also only three stops to Boston city hall. His place is very nice and comfortable and clean. Jordan wasnt around when i arrived. So he sent me the instruction to get the key and code to access the house. And he is very flexible with my arrival and departure time. A very nice stay and i would like to choose his place again when i visit the city.
8065282,50125873,2015-10-09,8607715,Brittany,It was really nice that Jordan has a system in place that makes the listing flexible to late arrival/early departure times. the room was good sized and accurately described. The neighborhood was fine/safe for an after midnight arrival and super close to the airport. Jordan is very friendly when you do see him.
8065282,50664337,2015-10-13,7181365,Andy,"Jordan's place was great.  Couldn't ask for a better spot to crash the night before an early flight.  Place was clean and Jordan provided very easy instructions to find the place and get in, was also quick to respond to texts should anything have come up, but there were no issues.  Would definitely recommend."
8065282,51072051,2015-10-17,6214851,Coby,Jordan was great. We were able to walk from the airport to the property. The room was exactly what we needed for a good night's sleep. Jordan also walked us down to the nearest pizza joint and waterfront. We even snagged a few beers from his fridge. Definitely recommend.
8065282,51332001,2015-10-19,33285723,Rehan,"Jordan was an excellent host. He was really welcoming and accommodating to my needs and overall was a pleasant and gracious host. His instructions were concise and clear, and overall experience exceeded all my expectations."

8065282,52707426,2015-11-01,10210997,Sergii,It was a great stay even though I stayed for just one night. Jordan's check-in instructions were really helpful. House is conveniently located close to the Logan Airport and the room was comfortable.
8065282,53086365,2015-11-04,16176581,Theodore,"Jordan was very nice. I had a towel and a separate bedroom. The bed was comfortable. I also had access to the kitchen and living room, which I did not use, but they looked good."

8065282,53310037,2015-11-07,48103399,Stephen,"I only stayed in Jordan's place for about five hours between a late flight and an early train, but it was very clean and comfortable."
8065282,53428474,2015-11-08,15692062,Linh,"Jordan communicates instructions to get in clearly and was very responsive in answering any questions I had. The place was clean and comfortable.

8065282,53657780,2015-11-10,47714566,Ashley Anna,"This was my first experience using AirBNB, and it was excellent. The location cannot be beat in its proximity to the airport. You'll literally hop on the free airport shuttle, hop off, walk a few steps, and bam! You're there. Jordan's instructions are clear and making getting into the home very simple --- if you remember to have them on you and read them! The reviews that say he responds quickly are spot on. Before booking I had a request and I received a response (and a good deal!) within 10 minutes. All other contact involved similar speed and made dialoguing flow. You won't have to fear for your health -- his home is very clean. It was great being able to catch up on sleep, adjust to time zone, and have the option to relax and watch a movie in a nice environment. The only reason I'm not giving the last star is because the mattress could be improved. Other than that, fabulous fabulous fabulous. (And to reiterate, the location to the airport cannot be beat)."
8065282,54077097,2015-11-15,40185194,Manal,"Jordan was a great host, welcoming and friendly. The room was exactly as described and a lifesaver as a place to keep our stuff and get in a quick nap before heading to the airport. It was super easy to get into and out of with detailed instructions guiding you. The room is small but very clean and comfortable, with a bathroom just down the hall. We didn't really have a chance to explore the neighborhood because of the time constraints but it seemed great!"
8065282,56166859,2015-12-09,50461254,Giacomo,Jordan is a great host. He is friendly and welcoming.

He is a proud Bostonian who truly made my visit exceptional. He took the time to sit with me and give me the insiders guide to the city, including several delicious, must-stop restaurants! His place was clean and looked just like the pictures. He checked in often to make sure I had a comfortable and seamless stay. He is quick to respond and gives thorough instructions upon arrival. If traveling in the winter months, Jordan's place is by far the best! It is nice and warm with a cozy fireplace and a space heater in the room. My trip to Boston was enhanced by staying here!"
8065282,68893124,2016-04-07,54509625,Chris,"Jordan's place is in an awesome neighborhood and very convenient for arriving and departing out of Logan airport. It is within walking distance to markets, restaurants, and other shops and is a safe and vibrant area. The T stop is really close and only 2 stops to downtown Boston. The space is roomy, comfortable, and looked just like the pictures. The queen bed is especially comfortable with a foam mattress topper, while the double bed was a bit hard. Overall we really enjoyed staying there and would definitely come back."

8065282,75761650,2016-05-22,23231840,Francisca,"Jasons place is exactly as described. It was easy checking in and out. It was also easy getting to and from Boston and the airport from this location. The neighborhood is pretty and quiet with convenience stores and restaurants nearby. His home is well maintained and had everything we needed to cook breakfast.

8065282,77173216,2016-05-30,29061068,Bambo,Staying here was very nice. Jordan was very helpful in setting me up when I first arrived. The neighborhood is also very conveniently located.

8065282,78084994,2016-06-05,5319494,Megan,Jordan and I never got to meet but he communicated great through the AirBNB message system and left very detailed instructions on how to get into his place. Parking was a breeze which is huge in Boston and a rare thing to find. The listing is accurate and as pictured. We Ubered around for the most part and that worked out really well from the location. Best part about staying here was Jordan's recommendation of Angela's Cafe. It was delicious and would go back to this part of Boston to eat there again!
8065282,78760323,2016-06-09,72033343,Joe,Jordan had great communication and laid everything out for our stay. We arrived to Boston late and his place was very accommodating. His apartment was spacious and exactly what we needed after a long day of travel.

8065282,80024825,2016-06-15,46255038,Sara,Jordan is a great host.  He's quick to respond and we had everything we needed.  His place is close to the airport and the T. Street parking was surprisingly easy. I would stay there again.
8065282,80986486,2016-06-20,7453124,Ann,"Jordan's place was a few minutes from the airport and T line which made it easy to access the city. It seems like there was no AC or at least we didn't find it. There were fans located throughout the house, but if you love an ice cool home this may not be the place for you, especially in the summer. I didnt mind the fan and never felt it was too hot. There was a queen and full bed. I slept in the queen bed which was extremely comfortable. 2 of us slept on the full which they said was uncomfortable and squeaky. I loved the HD flat screen TV which came with HBO and etc; it also has chromecast! The bathroom was clean and equipped with shampoo, conditioner, and soaps. Hot water worked great. We utilized the kitchen and there no issues. Kitchen came fully equipped with utensils. There were a few simple ingredients such as oil and salt. Wifi worked fine. To note, for business people, there is no iron (which is fine because it wasnt promised in the listing).Jordan was very prompt in his response via text and met all our needs. He gave is great recommendations for food. Overall, I would stay here again due to the price and close vicinity to the airport."
8065282,81515535,2016-06-23,14289626,Alex,"My wife and I along with another couple stayed at Jordan's apartment for two nights. Jordan was very responsive and helpful in the accommodations provided. The apartments location made it extremely easy to get around the city via the T. Overall this was exactly what we were looking for while in Boston. Close proximity to public transportation and airport, a clean 2 bedroom apt to shower and sleep, & an affordable price. We would definately stay here again on our next trip to Boston if available."
8065282,82075456,2016-06-26,34285198,Michael,"5 Sterne: von A bis Z hat alles super geklappt - vor der Abreise hat Jordan mitten in der Nacht auf meine SMS geantwortet und erklärt, dass wir vor 05:00 am besten per Uber zum Airport kommen (der Bremen Park ist zu dieser Zeit leider noch geschlossen)."
Die Wohnung war wie beschrieben,sauber und super gelegen.,,,,
"Jordans Pizza-Empfehlung war ein Volltreffer! \"\"Top 10 Pizza in US\"\" (eine Pizza für 12$ reicht ganz gut für 2 Personen). Unbedingt ausprobieren: Pizza with home made sausage!\"",,,,,

8065282,85130300,2016-07-10,5708812,Judith,"Pros:  The location was really, really convenient to the airport, the T and the historic areas of Boston but little or no noise from the planes. The neighborhood has lots of small convenience stores and markets, friendly people and also close-by to a large supermarket and liquor store.  The neighborhood felt very family-oriented and is adjacent to a really nice park with large playgrounds, water play, jogging, walking and biking paths, community garden and a brand new public library. The apartment was clean and comfortable. Beds were perfect and comfortable TV watching with HBO.  Jordan was super easy to deal with and patient and helpful when I needed something."
Cons:  kitchen wasn't as well equipped for cooking as we like.  It could use some newer and smaller frying pans (the only ones available were very large beat up non-stick pans) and a tea kettle and a microwave would be really handy.  Also there were no dish towels,hand towels or wash cloths provided (or at least we could not locate them.),,,,
In spite of those minor drawbacks,"we would stay here again in a heartbeat! And don't miss Santarpino's restaurant for pizza. Really. \"",,,,

8065282,88898950,2016-07-25,64467472,John,Jordan was quick to respond to our questions.  He genuinely cared about our being happy with the rental.  It is easy to get from and to the airport from this location.  It took about 10 minutes to drive to Faneuil Hall in the evening.  It was also easy to get on the interstate to head north to Cambridge and on to Maine.
8065282,90025929,2016-07-30,24611210,Ravneet,"Jordan was very quick to respond and provided an easy to fOllow instructions in where to park, how to get in and what we could find near us. Jordan's place is located very conveniently from the airport as well as the  T station. Spent 1 night there, and everything was exactly as described! As described only one of the rooms had an A/C in it and although there were multiple fans provided it was still a little warm in the other bedroom. Overall, a great stay! Thank you!"
8065282,90784920,2016-08-02,44304975,Evangeline,"The overall experience is you get what you paid. You may need to be careful when choosing this place, make sure you read all the descriptions and you might encounter same problem as described below."
The location is convenient,quiet and the price is cheap for last minute options.,,,,
Jordan is very helpful in providing instructions entering the suite and suggestions for restaurants.,,,,,
He also accommodates most of our needs such as late check out of our bags.,,,,,
However,since he relied on his maid and he was not living in the area,there was hardly any quality control for the cleaning.,,,
The first night was like a nightmare for us.,,,,,
After seeing the whale and visiting several different locations in the downtown Boston,we were all tired and just want to have a nice shower and sleep after we check in the place.,,,,
And when we entered the room,we saw the bed was not made in the second bedroom. The quilt was half on the rack and half on the floor and there were only cushions on the bed.,,,,
We tried to switch on the lights in the living room but they were not working.,,,,,
And second bedroom didn't have ac in the room,it did have a hot/cool fan but it was making extreme loud noise that we have to shut it down. (We should have read the descriptions more carefully before we made our decisions.),,,,
The main bedroom had an old ac and it had the same problem of loud noise.,,,,,
We reflected the situation to Jordan and hope he could get back to us at his earliest convenience but we were too tired to wait for his response.,,,,,
At 2am,somebody in the upper stairs were making loud noise by stepping around and dropping things on the floor,we were all awake because of that.,,,
Jordan replied our request,apologized for the situation,promised he will ask the maid to fix all of this and sent us $60 refund on the next day.,,,
We had very tight travel plans and we didn't have much time dealing with this so we hope we would be able to see everything fixed after we returned.,,,,,
Well the bed was made after we returned,with the quilt we saw that was half on the floor the night before.,,,,
And on the third day we realized the room didn't have microwaves either. Not to mention because the house is old it always have a strange smell and the floor is out of level.,,,,,
"We would suggest Jordan to change a maid after all these things happened. Apparently the maid was not as reliable as he thought.\"",,,,,
8065282,91032812,2016-08-03,30504193,Qingyi,"The room is clean, and the host give the room to me on time. He give me some advice to find something to eat, it is helpful!"
8065282,91249034,2016-08-04,86438020,Scott,Love the proximity to the airport and public transportation lines. Would definitely stay here again. Great place and great host.
8065282,91565414,2016-08-05,65293458,Suzanne,Jordan's place was great!  His response time was timely.   This was a last minute booking he was very accomodating.  Next time in Boston I will book Jordan's again!
8065282,91994257,2016-08-07,76919455,Heather,"I stayed here with three others on Friday night, what a great spot! Close to the T and a beautiful park. The apartment was clean and well set up for guests, and super cozy. Jordan's directions for getting there and check-in were very clear. I would definitely stay here again!"
8065282,93359056,2016-08-12,29316383,Lesley,"We really enjoyed our stay in Boston and Jordan's place was really central and easily accessible for everything we needed. The living area is a good space. We had trouble with the heat whilst there and one of the beds was not so comfortable and quite noisy when you turned over. Parking was quite tricky as everyone tends to get a space early evening before it fills up but we managed to move it around accordingly, Jordan was helpful with this too. The recommendations for food were great and would definitely go back again!"
8065282,95979102,2016-08-21,72437506,Isolda,Jordan's place was very conveniently located right by the airport. It's a short walk to the airport shuttle.
Parking is a challenge,but luckily we could just return our rental car at the airport instead. The neighborhood is Hispanic with plenty of little places to eat.,,,,
The apartment was is good order,"with everything we needed. It was a convenient stopover for us before flying out of Logan airport.\"",,,,
8065282,96848725,2016-08-24,6942405,Micaela,"Situata nei pressi dell'aeroporto ( quartiere poco interessante) e vicino alla metro che porta in città,  la casa è funzionale ma un po' trascurata nell'arredo e nella pulizia. Buona soluzione per chi è di passaggio e vuole trascorrere una notte risparmiando."

8065282,97858565,2016-08-28,20163206,R,Great place to stay. Very easy walking distance to the airport and Jordan have good advice on good places close by to eat
8065282,98259176,2016-08-30,305238,Ha,Super close to airport and very responsive host. A lot of space for the price.
8065282,98731913,2016-09-01,12298127,Robert,Extremely convenient to the airport. Jordan's directions were spot on. Really good suggestions for food too. I'd also suggest Roy's for great sandwiches! Jordan was very responsive as well and flexible when we had a request.
8065282,99353448,2016-09-04,73810421,Kathy,Excellent communication!
13768853,87078755,2016-07-18,59318500,Matt,"Great time in Boston. The place was nice and quiet and had everything my girlfriend and I needed. Elly was nice and her roommate, Sarah, was very helpful as well."
13768853,89889750,2016-07-30,21917606,Teresa,We enjoyed our stay and felt welcomed. We would recommend Elly to our friends and family. She helped us find our way around and always made us feel welcome!
13768853,90573716,2016-08-01,15643146,Lorena,"Elly's place is way cuter than what the pictures show. It is in a very safe neighborhood, and a comfortable bed and clean space and bathroom made this a very valuable stay. Elly and Sarah were both very easy going and communicative, which made our stay even more enjoyable! I will come back here if I ever find myself back in Boston."
13768853,92662496,2016-08-09,27474542,Paul,Sarah and Arthur were very sympathetic hosts. I stayed a week with two friends of mine and with them in their apartment. They were very welcoming and they advice us well during our trip. I will definitely recommend this place to visit Boston. Thank you again for everything.
13768853,93249846,2016-08-12,25511876,Rocio,"I didn't have the chance to meet elly. But Sarah, her roommate, and her husband were SUPER NICE!!!!. Not only they wait for us late in the night when we arrived but they also gave us a lift to the metro station. Honesty as host they were incredible. The house is super clean and cozy. The neighborhood really nice and quiet and close to the bus stop. It was a really good experience for us!!! Thank you!"
13768853,93957624,2016-08-14,47422520,Hamoody,Elly was a great host and we had a comfortable stay at her place. The place  was exactly like it was described in the listing and was in a good location. Elly and her roommates were friendly and made checking in smooth and easy. Overall we had a great stay!
13768853,94912661,2016-08-17,20817127,Louisa,Elly was very welcoming and was very happy to answer our million questions! The neighbourhood had a lovely coffee shop a stones throw from the house.
13768853,95399778,2016-08-19,88370391,Vincent,The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

4635390,28342675,2015-03-22,11973140,Eric,"Great weekend in Boston! A quaint, artfully decorated Beacon hill flat in a great location."
4635390,30391079,2015-04-21,8870935,Amy,Amy was very welcoming and even had some toiletries and coffee out for me to use during my stay. The place was clean and lived up to the high expectations I had from seeing the photos. The location is great and I was super comfortable.
4635390,32340229,2015-05-17,7743329,Gabriela,"Amy has a great place in the beatiful neighbourhood of Beacon Hill. It is more spacious than it appears in the pictures, the decoration is really nice and you can feel at home there. We spent only a weekend there, but wished we could have stayed more."
"She is really sweet and she waited for us when our train had a little delay. She left coffee and biscuits for us. We highly recommend staying there when you go to visit the beatiful city of Boston.\"",,,,,
4635390,34049935,2015-06-04,26702126,Kim,Wonderful location. Amy was a thoughtful and considerate host
4635390,35008427,2015-06-14,4755575,Olena,"We had a great experience staying at Amy's - amazing location for exploring Boston, with everything you need to be comfortable in a condo.  Amy was really accommodating with our arrival and departure time, and everything was just fantastic.  Thanks for the wonderful weekend :)"
4635390,39824670,2015-07-26,10561279,Victoria,"Amy was a great host. She was easy to talk to and also very considerate of her guests. Although Amy's apartment was a little small, it was very cosy and convenient as the station was close."
4635390,41812730,2015-08-09,9092754,Ilana,"Amy was great and so was the apartment - you cannot beat the location.  Since we were in town for just a long weekend it was important for us to be able to get around quickly and easily.  Aside from being able to walk to so many things, the T is right across the street (easy connections to Logan airport at $2.65 each way).  There is even a public bike rental hub on the corner.  I hope we can stay there again if we are back in the area!"
4635390,46782192,2015-09-13,1933311,Peter,"Amy's apartment was lovely and perfectly located! We were in town to see a friend in Cambridge and attend a wedding near Boston Common, and it was so easy to get around from Amy's home-base (right next to a Red Line T stop & completely walkable to many locations). The apartment itself was spacious, charming, clean and comfortable. Wonderful experience all-around and I'd definitely recommend!"
4635390,51348742,2015-10-19,11727919,Mélanie,Cute appartment. Everything as expected. Easy to collect key even if Amy wasn't around. Well located to walk around town. A bit noisy though.
4635390,74457540,2016-05-15,57755434,Cece,"Amy has created a light, well-decorated and friendly little apartment in a typical Beacon Hill older building. It is perfectly located, providing easy  access to nearly all points of interest in Boston; even close to my family on the Hill. And how did she know that the wine she welcomed me with was the one my son and his wife favor? Brilliant! I look forward to my next stay. Thank you, Amy."
4635390,75924433,2016-05-23,27532951,Hilary,"I'm so glad we decided to stay at Amy's place during our trip to Boston.  The location was perfect, around the corner from Beacon Hill's main street with restaurants and shops, and an easy walk to the Commons, as well as other neighborhoods.  Also right across the street from the red line metro.  The apartment itself was a lovely place to call home during our stay.  It was tidy and comfortable and had everything we needed and more!"
4635390,88544621,2016-07-24,14868082,Luyi,"Amy was awesome! The place was clean and lovely, close to everything, we really enjoy the stay and will recommend for anybody who wants to explore Boston!"
4635390,95991411,2016-08-21,85088040,Jessica,"This was our first time using AirBnB and it could not have been better! Amy's apartment was idyllic. It did get a little warm when the sun was pouring in but luckily the window AC kept the area by the bed cool enough for sleeping. Everything was clean and ready for us when we arrived. The LOCATION though was easily our favorite part. It was as close as you can get to the Red Line and a quick walk to Boston Common. The entire neighborhood felt incredibly safe as well. We walked all over at night and never had a worry. If we ever visit Boston again, this will be our first choice :)"
8814532,53421617,2015-11-08,45036271,Hanjin,"Very nice apartment, with everything we need. One queen bed and one King bed. Queen sofa bed in living room. Clean and comfortable. We spent more than 40 minutes checking in, but things turned out to be good."
8814532,54259380,2015-11-17,3603962,Efi,"The place was exactly what we expected. Very convenient, close to everything and clean. Thank you!"
8814532,58859550,2016-01-05,27042348,Pilar,"The experience with the rental was a very positive experience, very well location building, great beds, the apartment was exactly as the picture I saw on Airbnb, nicely decorated and very clean, complete kitchen and baths, everything was perfect!"
I call couple time for information and they were always nice and solve all my request. I will definitely stay again.,,,,,

We were in Boston primarily to take our daughter to a Bruins game, so the proximity to TD Gardens was amazing. Tons of restaurants and  pubs nearby. It's a 15 minute walk or 3 minute uber ride to Boston Common. Loved everything about this flat and would definitely recommend it and our host to anyone traveling to Boston!!"
8814532,61897749,2016-02-09,52652974,Celine,"这次行程中第一次也是唯一的一次住的公寓房。之前被入住前所需要填写的信息给吓到,没想到入住的当天收到了非常详细的入住和退房申明,太周到太体贴了。"
自驾到公寓楼下,有暂时停车处,可以先安排登记入住和卸行李,入住后就有免费停车的停车卡,妥妥的停入地下车库专用车位。,
公寓门口有专人负责整栋楼的进出入,感觉很有安全感。,,,,
上楼后,进屋感觉2房2卫2厅1厨房的房间布局很适合我们2个家庭的和睦相处,毕竟不用抢用1个卫生间。房间很大,有暖气,有阳台,厨房设施一应俱全
波士顿地方不大,所以公寓所在的位置也算很好,对面就有家餐馆叫Finch,味道很不错,公寓离公园也很近,到唐人街最多也就15分钟路程
很喜欢这套公寓房,楼下还有洗衣房,主人很细心,还给足30刀的洗衣卡,可惜我们就享用了2次,哈哈
感谢AIRBNB的平台能让我们入住的那么舒适,也极力推荐此套房源给小伙伴们了,"不错不错。\"",,,
8814532,65953651,2016-03-18,50406175,Jason,This apartment exceeded our expectations in every way. The apartment is spacious and modern with all the facilities you could ask for. Attending the TD Garden couldn't be a more simple process with it only being a 5 minute walk away. All I could have asked for was the Celtics put in a better performance. This will be my first choice for accommodation when I come back to Boston.
8814532,98128050,2016-08-29,83765101,Jean,"Everything was as described.  Comfortable beds, Clean.  We were out everyday sightseeing, it was a great place to come home to and chill out.  Convenient to transportation.  The T-rail and the Commuter Train."
14151531,91710851,2016-08-06,87355676,Diana,"Nick et Fal ont été très accueillants et chaleureux. Tout était soigneusement préparé pour notre arrivée et nous n'avons manqué de rien. La chambre et la salle de bain sont dans un espace relativement indépendant dans la maison, ce qui nous a permis de nous y sentir très libres."
14151531,92596114,2016-08-09,9580179,Thuy & JB,"One of the best airbnb's I have ever stayed at. Incredibly lovely couple (and newborn!). So welcoming but offering so much privacy. Everything you could want at an airbnb and more! Only a $10-ish Uber to the centre of town, its a very cool area. The private bathroom is a bonus."
14151531,94326327,2016-08-15,88814715,Eliazer,"Nick provided toiletries, water, some snacks, and a clean environment. The bed is very comfortable and there are books and a TV at your disposal."
If you want to socialize with your host,then this is probably not for you. The guests stay downstairs and Nick and his family stay upstairs,so there isn't any contact between the two. This wasn't a problem for me. It was quite convenient to have access to the backdoor,I didn't feel like an imposition when I came home at 2am one night.,,
I didn't have problem with noise but you can hear when they take a shower and talk.,,,,,
"My only real complaint is that I couldn't make coffee in the morning (but I wonder if this is actually was the case since Nick provided a package of hot chocolate mix in the room...)\"",,,,,
14151531,95493696,2016-08-20,89528106,Jeremie,Our stay at Nick's apartment was a real pleasure.
The room and bath room were located on a separed level which gave us the feeling of having our own apartment even if it was in a house.,,,,,
The couple were really respectful of our privacy while being really helpful.,,,,,
The place is located in south boston which is at a walking distance of the city center and near a subway station. They are also a few nice restaurants at only 5 minute walk.,,,,,
In all,i would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice host that knows how to respect people privacy while being available if you need anything.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
14151531,98094683,2016-08-29,79867995,Suntara,If I could give more than 5 stars I would! Nick and Fal hosted us really nicely and even wrote us a greetings card at our arrival. The room and bathroom were super clean and they provided snacks and all the necessary amenities. The privacy they gave us was perfect since we were on the first floor with a private entrance and they were living on the higher floors. The parking spot is a huge add-on for travelling to B-town. A real jewel in the area!
14151531,98956779,2016-09-02,54892976,Makoto,"Nick's place was great. This was my first Airbnb stay but the bedroom and bus room was exactly as described, clean, quiet, and comfortable. It was 5 min walking from T9 bus stop. Wouldn't recommend walking from Andrew station. Broadway station feels safer. I would definitely stay here again."
14151531,99681618,2016-09-05,23190848,Belen,"We couldn’t be happier with our experience staying here. Everything was really clean, including the bathroom - private bathroom was a huge plus! The bed was very comfortable and Nick and Fal are a lovely couple who were really nice and provided us with all the things we needed to enjoy our stay (even snacks and fresh flowers!). The location is very convenient in what we thought was a safe neighborhood and we loved the fact that the train station was within a walking distance so it was really easy and fast to move around the city using public transportation. Highly recommended!"
10103725,70620177,2016-04-19,21925490,Judi,This was a lovely home with a very nice neighborhood. We walked to the beach and jogged around the area. The description of the place was accurate the host was very helpful. I would definitely stay there again.
10103725,71220593,2016-04-24,33694643,Myron,"Check-in, check-out was an ease! Brendan was really helpful with any questions we had and extremely responsive! The place was incredibly comfy, it's a perfect place to stay. I would definitely recommend staying here!"

10103725,97790066,2016-08-28,35780776,E,"Brendan sent several timely texts and gave a phone number to reach him if needed.   He made us feel right at home.  The condo is small and charming with several seating areas. We enjoyed hanging out in the kitchen and back deck in the mornings, and the beach is just a couple blocks away."

It's only a 1 minute walk from the subway station which makes it very easy to go into the center.,,,,,
Even though we arrived very late Sean welcomed us very friendly and gave us all the important information we needed for our stay.,,,,,
We were also allowed to leave our bags there while we went into the center on our last day.,,,,,
Although we only saw him once he always replied to our messages and answered all our questions + gave us tips to make our trip even better.,,,,,
As already mentioned the location was great. The neighborhood seemed very safe and there even is a liquor store right next to the house ;),,,,,
Boston is a great city and our stay at Sean's place made it even more perfect.,,,,,

It was easy to get there from the airport with his place only about 2 blocks from the T station (Stony Brook). Sean was very welcoming and friendly upon my arrival. Unfortunately it was very cold out and I was on my way to the Caribbean so I wasn't prepared to spend a lot of time walking around his neighborhood. It seemed quite nice though! Sean's flat is clean and full of character. I loved the art and antiques! It felt very warm and comfortable.   He is very hospitable and had many nice touches for someone who is staying longer (eg, a \"\"Charlie card\"\" to facilitate your use of the T).  The whole apt is full of plants"

South Station에서 숙소까지 가는 방법을 묻기 위해 Sean에게 연락을 하였고 Sean은 자세하고 친절하게 숙소까지 오는 법을 알려주었습니다. 소개글에 나와있듯이, Sean은 거리낌 없이 숙소를 자기집처럼 사용해주었으면 좋겠다고 적극적으로 안내해주었습니다. 손님으로서 집을 방문해준 저희에게 편하게, 부담스럽지 않게 서로 잘 지냈으면 좋겠다며 안심시켜주기도 했습니다. 다시 한 번 미국 동부 여행을 하게 된다면 Sean의 숙소를 또 이용하고 싶을 정도로 좋은 인상을 남겼습니다."
9676551,62171783,2016-02-12,31598784,Ian,"Wonderfully comfortable room...perhaps better than described. Sean is a warm host who has outfitted a room that has such a homey feel, you may not want to leave. Location is always key, and being right off the Orange Line is a big selling point. Being on the outskirts also means that the price is cheaper, but it's easy enough to get into the heart of the city that it doesn't make a difference."
Extra blankets,towels,and plenty of pillows provided. Bed is comfortable,"and the plants add such a nice ambiance to the room!\"",,
9676551,62325910,2016-02-13,58352819,Kevin,Very charming place and welcoming. Thank you for letting us in your home. Very nice unique decorations
9676551,62830557,2016-02-17,17997213,Bob,"Sean is a fantastic host. Even though I scooted in late (9pm) and immediately left to visit a friend, he made me feel welcome right away. The location is perfect: close to the T, Centre street, with its stores and eateries, Arborway, Sam Adams Brewery. The room is spacious, comfortable, homey, with plenty of light and good views.  Sean made his whole apt available.  I used the kitchen table extensively to do some work. Sean is friendly and welcoming, with great tips that made my stay even better. I'd recommend his place wholeheartedly.  I look forward to my next visit!"
9676551,63029285,2016-02-19,9618964,Gregory,"A wonderful stay. Sean and his roommate are very kind, the apartment is beautifully decorated, clean, and they even provided energy bars to take in the morning. Thank you!"
9676551,63483006,2016-02-23,56222625,Ed,"Our Boston condo sold very quickly, before our new home was ready. We lived in this neighborhood for 9 years and were hoping to find a place close by in the mean time. Sean was a great host, friendly and helpful with anything we could ask for. The room is on the top floor with lots of great light. Access to the subway, restaurants and stores is fantastic, as well as being about 5 blocks from Whole Foods. When we come back to visit in the future we'd love to stay here again."
9676551,63995075,2016-02-28,49657213,Austin,Sean's room was exactly what I needed when I had to plan an immediate trip to Boston for an interview! The room was beautiful and had everything I needed. It's extremely close to the subway which made travel into downtown Boston a breeze and it's also got a really nice coffee shop and bar nearby!
Sean was extremely accommodating and helpful. He helped me find my way to the room from the airport with step-by-step instructions,ensured I got my keys even though I was running late,and gave me advice on where to grab some food.,,,
"I would absolutely recommend the room if you need a place to stay in Boston!\"",,,,,

9676551,64868414,2016-03-08,4134310,Roshani,"Great location near Stonybrook T station. The room was bright and comfortable. Sean was very helpful. Only thing to keep in mind is that there is only one bathroom shared between three people plus AirBNB guests, so it's challenging in the morning."
9676551,65266283,2016-03-12,59237550,Sam,"Sean was an excellent host, very helpful with giving ideas about what to do in the area. Being extremely close to the T it made it very easy to get around. Would definitely stay here again!"
9676551,65663935,2016-03-16,27553406,Michael,"Seans pad is incredible, warm and comfortable. I could spend an entire week wandering around getting lost in his collection of books and memorabilia. He should be genuinely proud of his place, it#s stunning. The views are also incredible."
Sean himself is a warm an welcoming chap,very friendly and he very much respected our privacy,whilst still being responsive and helpful. I would have loved to talk some more,unfortunately the 8 hour drive to Boston left me broken!,,
Cheers Sean,hopefully meet again one day!,,,,
"Mike\"",,,,,
9676551,66173810,2016-03-20,54878502,Monica,"Despite our paths never crossing, Sean was a phenomenal host! The room is gorgeously decorated and Sean was very communicative and friendly via email/message. The third-floor walkup meant I got my cardio in, there's a little corner store/deli on the same block, and it's about a ten-minute walk to more stores and restaurants on Centre St. I would definitely stay again."
9676551,66687203,2016-03-24,33382486,Nathalie & Olivier,"La chambre est dans un bel appartement,  lui-même situé dans un quartier résidentiel très sympathique et à 100m du métro qui mène au centre ville en 1/4 d'heure et à l'aéroport en 40 mn avec seulement 1 changement. La salle d'eau est commune, mais il n'y a aucun souci de propreté ou d'occupation. Tout est très soigné."
Sean est vraiment très gentil. Il nous a fourni beaucoup de détails sur les lieux à visiter,les endroits où se régaler ( breakfast,restaurants,pubs,etc..),les choses à découvrir ( parcs

Sean was extremely friendly and welcoming, and his apartment is really nice and in a great location. I would highly recommend staying here if you are looking for a place in Jamaica Plain."
9676551,67521547,2016-03-29,59477817,Alyssa,"Very happy with our stay. The price is ridiculously cheap for how nice the room and the area is. It is not even two minutes from the subway stop, and there's a few good places to eat within walking distance too. Sean was super friendly and answered any questions we had. Would definitely recommend."
9676551,68035790,2016-04-01,27331834,Montse,"Sean was an excellent host. We did not get to meet him, since we stayed at his place only for a night. Nonetheless, he left everything ready for us in the room and the apartment wae in perfect conditions. The location of the apartment is great, 3min away from the subway. I recommend him to anyone who wants to stay in a nice and cozy place in Boston. Also, I would not hesitate to request to stay at his room again if I ever come back to Boston."
9676551,68721194,2016-04-06,2074855,Paolo,Sean's place is simply PERFECT! It is less than one minute away from the subway station. In four or five subway stops you are in Boston downtown. The area is nice and quiet. Sean was incredibly kind and helpful. His directions to get to the appartment precise.
9676551,68851731,2016-04-07,28471675,John,"Amazing room in a lovely home. Street parking wasn't too difficult, and the neighborhood is very charming complete with its own tiny market."

The apartment is great with a nice view,very convenient and decorated with a nice taste and very close to the tube to go downtown.,,,,
I recommend it,,,,,

9676551,70156662,2016-04-16,41171588,Paul,"Sean was absolutely wonderful, providing us with many tips about his neighborhood. The train is conveniently located steps away. Lots of nice markets surround the place. The place is well decorated and clean, would absolutely stay there again."
9676551,70638349,2016-04-19,54290909,Brian,"It was a great stay at Sean's place. We were welcomed with soft music in the background, low lighting and a clean and tidy apartment. The room was spacious with lots of windows and light filtering in. We were able to use any of the kitchen facilities and felt very welcomed to relax at his place. The neighborhood was quiet and  well maintained. It was a two minute walk to the subway and a very short ride to the city center. Sean was a very personable host. We would stay there again if we were in Boston."
9676551,70798184,2016-04-20,43799491,Robert,"Sean is great, nice place, great location, I could never have asked for a better host."

"The location was the best - less than 5min walk to the \"\"T\"\" stop",and from there about 20min ride to the City center.,,,,
"Sean is a great host. We highly recommend him :)\"",,,,,
9676551,72032735,2016-04-30,21408508,Ginni,"What a great location! Literally a 1-minute walk from the Stonybrook subway station. Very convenient for travelling to other parts of Boston (only 1 subway line to Quincy Market). Prior to our stay, Sean was very helpful and informative."
We didn't get to meet him during our stay,but had a chance to meet his roommate Daniel,who was very friendly and welcoming. They were very accommodating and let us check in early to drop off our belongings before heading out to the city for the day.,,,
The room was spacious and decorated with lots of quirky and vintage items - the house plants were also awesome. The bed was a comfy futon with lots of blankets and clean bedding. Perfect after a long day of exploring the city.,,,,,
Because it was close to the subway station,it got a little loud at times,so if you are a light sleeper,it might be an issue. It was also an older home,so we could hear the floor and walls settle with a knocking sound every so often throughout the night. Again - only an issue for light sleepers.,
The apartment was close to a liquor store,and a short walk to a CVS,7/11 and Whole Foods. Sorella's restaurant (7-minute walk) is a MUST. It's a small hole-in-the-wall,but they had the most delicious Ginger Blueberry Hazelnut pancakes. Although a little bit on the pricey side for breakfast food,definitely worth the try! There was a short wait to be seated,so make sure you go early.
Overall,Sean's apartment was just what we needed - a convenient place to sleep within walking distance to nearby shops and restaurants,"as well as the subway station.\"",,,
9676551,72550455,2016-05-03,2261799,Susan,"Sean's place was great. All I needed was a place to sleep, and this served my needs perfectly. The space is exactly as described, and very close to the T. I would definitely stay here again."
9676551,73010675,2016-05-06,49264049,Ray,"Location was good in sense of proximity to T station. Room was ok but was really cold. Too many windows in the room might be good for daytime but became problem for outside traffic noise making it hard to sleep. This is my first experience with Renting a Room, don't think will ever look  into room rental. Worth to pay little more for comfort."
9676551,73306758,2016-05-08,13420125,Suleyman,"Communication with Sean was good.  His location was very convenient for us and we were made to feel very welcome. With parking being on the street, we had a challenging time finding a place to park our rental car. The reality (which we already knew) is that, in any bedroom community such as this, you should expect a challenge finding a late-night parking spot-- because everyone has returned from work and is already unwinding within their homes.  To prove that point, the next day we got back a little earlier and were able to park right outside Sean's! On our last night we were kept awake into the wee hours of the next day because someone else in the building happened to be entertaining-- what sounded to us like-- a lively and talkative group of people.  Far from getting us angry, we just laughed--and marveled-- at the fact that it actually added to the whole Airbnb thing.  All-in-all we had a positive experience and only wish we could have met Sean to thank him for his hospitality."
9676551,73637023,2016-05-09,64444924,Bob,"Nice location, beautiful home and, more importantly,  Sean was absolutely the best!"
9676551,74061601,2016-05-12,11255557,Amélie,We had a nice stay at Sean's home. It's really next to the metro station.
The room is bright,spacious and decorated with numerous plants. Dan and Sean were nice,"they were flexible on the schedule. They allow us to leave our luggage at their place during the last day and that was really convenient for us as we left Boston late. \"",,,
9676551,74179533,2016-05-13,34733001,Jessie Rose,"We arrived really late to Sean's house, he kindly left a key for us outside, left the light on in the room we would be staying in so we knew where to go. The apartment was lovely, comfy bed, everything we needed left out for us. Very flighing visit but perfect! Thank you x"
9676551,74805870,2016-05-16,56212989,Monica,"My bf and I stayed at Sean's place for the weekend. It was his first time visiting the U.S. and our first time using airbnb and our stay at Sean's in Jamaica Plains was awesome. It's so close to the train, like literally a 5 minute walk. There is also a little coffee shop about a 2 minute walk from his door, which is perfect for someone like me who needs coffee to get started. The room was nice and clean and the bed was comfortable. U will get sunlight in the morning, which I usually have black out curtains, but the sun didn't bother me too much. I really didn't get to see Sean much, but when we did have questions he would respond quickly which was helpful. My last day there I hurt my back and Sean was so sweet helping us with our luggage, he's so friendly, really a nice guy. Jamaica Plains we found to be a great little community, we went to some local bars at night and met some locals that were just so fun and easy going. We loved it. We were only in Boston for 2 days but totally fell in love with the city! Quincy Market, Boston public garden, Harvard Square, Boston harbor, just to give u ideas in case u r planning on visiting."
9676551,75327266,2016-05-20,27959278,Juul,"The appartment was really nice, the bed was good and the location very convenient next to the subway. Sean was super flexible and friendly!"

9676551,76334433,2016-05-26,72593013,Rick,"Outstanding. I don't think I can add anything to the other reviews. This is truly a hidden gem, an oasis just a few minutes from downtown."
This is my first AirBnB and I have to say the bar has been set high.,,,,,
The photos actually don't do the room justice. It's far more beautiful in person. Noted: it was perfect weather,blue skies,with birds chirping. Cracked open the windows and slept soundly.,,,
My hours were really all over the map and the instructions were accurate to get in and get around the apartment,and to find the place. In fact,it's far easier to get to from the T than I thought. Maybe a 3 minutes walk.,,,
My only regret was that with my hours I wasn't able to meet Sean in person,but then again that's a testament to how well this AirBnB was organized. He really thought this one out. His repies to my questions were really fast and accurate.,,,,
The only criticism I can extend and it's been noted before is that it really is right next to a busy train line,and right below a flight path.,,,,
But seriously,this is a beautiful space and beautiful street,and super easy access to Boston via transit plus Uber was here in 90 seconds for a late night errand.,,,
"I say go for it! \"",,,,,
9676551,76606202,2016-05-28,54782117,Aubrey,"Sean was extremely welcoming when my sister and I arrived to his place. The room and apartment was exactly as described and pictured. Our room and the apartment was very clean. The neighborhood was nice and there was great food and drink within close proximity. The T into downtown Boston was a block away from Sean's making it very easy to and from your destinations. I would 100% recommend staying here! If I ever find myself needing a place in Boston again, I will definitely look to see if Sean's place is available!"

9676551,77650375,2016-06-02,9326412,Marshall,"Sean’s apartment is located in Jamaica Plain, an area with its own fascinating history and changing communities. You get a sense that the many elegant houses that line the streets have lots of stories to tell. There is an independent coffee shop just a few doors away if you need an early morning coffee or snack, and just a bit further, on Centre Street, there are many shops, bars and restaurants. We had breakfast at the RobinWood Café where the staff are friendly and efficient and there is plentiful choice on the menu – the walk there will take you through the pleasant interconnecting streets. Once in Sean’s apartment, it is like being in a storybook or a mystery novel. The guest room is furnished with unexpected collections of objects and books which will stir your imagination, and the house high trees outside give you some sense of being in a treehouse. The bathroom is likewise decorated with curious bits and pieces and a small library for your private moments. Nonetheless, there is a good shower with as much power and heat as you need. For your travel, the subway station is a few minutes walk with a fast and frequent service  into downtown Boston and other city destinations. From the moment I requested a booking with Sean, he replied very quickly with clear and useful information and coped easily with our late arrival. Similarly, as we had a late flight from Boston, Sean readily allowed us to come and go on our last day, and made provision to keep our luggage in the apartment."

We found the whole foods around the corner helpful for our grocery needs & Sean let us use the refrigerator and other appliances/dishes in his apartment so we could make a lot of our food instead of having to eat out. There are many great places to eat in the neighborhood though! Make sure to check out Sean's recommendations... he has LOADS of good ones, especially the free Sam Adam's brewery tour!"

The location is close to the Orange line on the T subway, but not too close, with a  great little coffee shop just around the corner.

Sean was very accommodating and flexible with our arrival and departure times. His place is kept in awesome shape and very much felt like home (way better than a hotel). His list of recommended places was also great, he went to both locations of City Feed and Supply every day we were there (the Centre St location makes AMAZING food). The best part about the place, other than how nice of a neighborhood it's in, is that it is literally one block away from the subway - the center of Boston is only about a 20 minute ride and made the whole trip a piece of cake. Any time I'm returning to Boston, I would love to stay here again and would recommend it to everyone!"

9676551,90882025,2016-08-02,11528774,Melissa,Such a lovely spot and very close to transport to everywhere. Our accommodation was exactly as Sean described and we loved it. I dropped my phone on the front steps when we left. Sean found it and sent it on to Hawaii for me. He went out of his way as he was at work when I discovered I had lost it. You rock Sean. We loved Boston and huge thanks to a great guy.
9676551,91524776,2016-08-05,74194838,Christine,"This room was absolutely gorgeous and the location can't be beat - just a block away from the train to downtown! Jamaica Plain is a lovely area to explore in and if itself, a nice and quiet respite from exploring the big city. Sean was very prompt and provided everything we needed! My girlfriend and I very much enjoyed our stay here and we miss it already!"
9676551,93439037,2016-08-12,10950794,Romain,"Fantastic. Wonderful neighborhood. Perfect apart. Well located. The perfect place in Boston. We really have a wondeful moment. And Sean took care of us and you can have the keys whenever you want. I haven't seen Sean, it's my only regret because he seems a very nice guy. I hope we can meet you one day. If we come back to Boston, we know how to stay. Thanks a lot."
9676551,93630925,2016-08-13,88784673,Emmett,Sean was fantastic about everything! He was super accommodating and the stay was wonderful!!
9676551,94041510,2016-08-14,58675395,Silvana,We have not seen Sean personally. He was very caring and has asked online to our well-being and he was available for us if we needed his help. The apartment was exactly as advertised. Very well located and only a 5 minute walk to the orange line. There was a Whole Food Market in walking distance and some Restaurants or diner around. We woud come back.
9676551,94367570,2016-08-15,27217976,Sarah,"Sean's place was perfect! The room was fantastic and the location was great, a quick hop to downtown. We only stayed one night but Sean was great in helping is check in and even let us leave our stuff a little longer in the day so we could explore until our flight. The next time I am in Boston I will for sure be staying here!"
9676551,95196322,2016-08-18,15568570,Julie,"Sean was a friendly and uncomplicated host. The listing was just as described and the bed was very comfortable (but creaky!) The location was nice, and it is only a two minute walk to the closest train stop. If you're looking for something in Boston that doesn't break the bank but is comfy and clean, this is a perfect pick!"

The neighborhood is fun and vibrant,  and it couldn't have been easier to get around the city with the T being such a short walk away. I would definitely stay again for another trip to Boston, Sean was so helpful and was a great host."
9676551,98589646,2016-08-31,14927752,Alessandra,"Sean is a wonderful host. He is a kind person, positive and friendly. You will feel right at home.

6686224,71654591,2016-04-27,26967401,Nicolae,"Wentao is a great host. He was waiting for me even though I was late by a few hours. Something came up and a friend of mine had to tag along even though I already booked for one person, Wentao was perfectly fine with it. I asked him for a second set of keys, he went out and got them the next morning."
Super cool guy,room was good enough,had an awesome heater that works wonder for your feet while you work at the desk.,,,
Building was very close to the South Station and was surrounded by various restaurants.,,,,,
Overall,"awesome experience!\"",,,,
6686224,73471519,2016-05-08,38678447,Patrick,"The listing description was accurate except that I was caught off-guard when Will introduced me to his roommate, who wasn't mentioned so far as I could remember. It didn't end up being an issue during my week-long stay but I would've liked to have known beforehand that it was going to be three in the apartment instead of just two. The location was great for me, just a ten-minute walk from the office I was working from while I was in town. The apartment sits above two bars and a pizza place and the crowd noise in the later hours (and especially the honking of the cars outside) was very audible. I wouldn't recommend this room if you're a light sleeper but, for me, it was fine."
I was looking for an inexpensive and well located place to sleep during a week-long business trip and,overall,"the place worked out well for that and Will did everything you could expect from a host.\"",,,
6686224,73870264,2016-05-11,39395701,Line,It's a nice trip. Wentao is a nice person and the house is great. Happy trip.
6686224,74201299,2016-05-14,70206749,Andrew,Wentao is fantastic. He made the whole process very seamless. I was there on business from out of the country. I didn't have much time. We tap was able to accommodate all of my needs and was extremely well-prepared for me. I met up and got the keys without any issue.
My flight didn't leave until later in the evening,but Wentao just let me leave my stuff and come back when I was ready. It was all super easy,super convenient.,,,
"The location is very nearby to restaurants and tons of points of interest. \"",,,,,
6686224,75163676,2016-05-19,37580478,Nun,It was great to be so well located in my short and first stay in Boston!! Nice to be received kindly by Wentao! The place has just what you need in a busy and full of restaurants spot.
6686224,75543211,2016-05-22,3047357,Carly,"The location is amazing, the room big, but that is it. Wentao sleeps on a bed in the living room, so you can't relax or spend any time out there. For the money you are paying, I would recommend a hotel, or even the hostel around the corner."
6686224,77901744,2016-06-04,70007418,Ethan,"It was a good experience especially for a 1st-timer to Boston like myself. Wentao was a very affable and accomodating host, and really easy-going. There was no hiccups and no major problems. The room was comfortable and neat and fairly clean, sparsely furnished but adequate and the building and the apartment itself is a bit worn but otherwise serviceable. Location was great, really near to the subway station and the train station which was fantastic. It is in the Theatre district and just 1 block away from Boston Commons and and near the shopping/ dining area. Quite a few diners and cafes and a well-stocked 7-11 nearby which was fantastic."
6686224,78878355,2016-06-09,5026649,Jake,"I'll echo the other reviews about check-in and check-out being easy, which was nice. The room is comfortable enough, but faces a busy and loud street that did manage to wake me up once in the night."
The washroom is through the living room,which is fine except it is also where Wentao sleeps. That's a little uncomfortable for my liking but not really much you can do about it.,,,,
But overall,a generally positive experience. For the price and location,"it's a good deal.\"",,,
6686224,79080318,2016-06-11,13693660,Eric,I spent one night at Wentao's place.
His place is very well located,which was exactly what I was looking for. The room is not big,but was really sufficient for my needs.,,,
Wentao is really a nice person,I had a great contact with him and he has made sure my stay would be as good as possible.,,,,
Nevertheless,this appartment is surrounded by night clubs and bars: the windows are so thin that you hear the street as if they were open.,,,,
This room is terribly noisy at night and I had real troubles to sleep.,,,,,
If you plan to go there,"remember that ear-plugs are necessary.\"",,,,
6686224,79220264,2016-06-12,25661124,Sam,"Just finished up a business trip to Boston staying at Wentao's. Overall, I had a great experience. Wentao was very welcoming and made the experience very seamless. He was available anytime I had questions and responded quickly. I would recommend Wentao's place if you're in Boston and need a relatively inexpensive place to stay for a night."
6686224,79982749,2016-06-15,36675918,George,"Will was very friendly and accommodating. He had another roommate living in the room over while he slept in the living room - making it a little awkward when going to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The room and apartment are depicted accurately in the pictures. I was at first lost before I found the place as I expected an apartment building or brownstone or such, as it was instead located above a Subway and a psychic reader in the Theatre District. The place was very clean and included a space heater and a humidifier. It was nice having a desk and a lamp, as well as a window that I could open. The bathroom was clean."
Being downtown,it was definitely loud outside at night until around 3 AM,but Will provides ear plugs if you need them. Personally I enjoy ambient city sounds.,,,
The location was great,right in the middle of downtown next to Boston Commons and Chinatown. I loved being able to walk to the park and to restaurants. It's not a hotel,"but that's why you're here on AirBnB - I think I saved something like $50+ a night.\"",,,
6686224,81313956,2016-06-22,7231311,Peter,"I spent 6 nights with Wentao and his roommate while visiting Boston for a conference. Wentao was very helpful with arranging the visit, especially since I was arriving late (after midnight). They were very friendly, but not obtrusive. The location is very central and the pictures accurately show the flat. There were lots of food options nearby and the apartment was right by Boston Common. For me the downside was that the room was very noisy with traffic, sirens and in the weekend there was a lot of noise from the bars nearby."

Wenato war ein sehr angehmer Host. Er hat dafür gesorgt,dass ich auch ohne seine Anwesenheit in die Wohnung kam (und das war wichtig,denn nach einem Überseeglug und Ankuft mitten in der Nacht will man nicht noch lange warten müssen),und hatte sogar Ohropax besorgt damit ich gut schlafen kann. Leider kann man die wirklich gut gebrauchen,aber das bringt eine Wohnung direkt im Theater District eben mit sich!,
Ich empfehle die Wohnung allen weiter,die auch das Bostoner Nachtleben erkunden wollen. Wer Wert auf eine ruhige Unterkunft legt,"sollte sich sicher nach einer ruhieren Lage umsehen.\"",,,

He came back the day before I left and I never heard him at all. I was going for location and price. I got that. However, I was not prepared for a 4 flight walk up. As a result I stayed out all day and only came back to sleep. Although warned about the street noise I was not prepared for the intensity. Summer and no AC necessitated open windows. Although he was a kind host, the quality of the lodging, the stairs and the noise would prevent me from staying there again."
6686224,91035619,2016-08-03,85708590,Eglee,"No me gusto, el baño muy lejos de la habitacion, la cama olia muy mal. No pude conciliar el sueño, demasiado ruido de la calle motos, personas hablando, musica a todo volumen, camion de la basura, un bar funciona en la planta baja, mucho trafico de carros,etc. El dispone de tapones para los oidos para el huesped, me parece absurdo. Llegue buscando tranquilidad porque el viaje fue muy accidentado y no pude descansar."
6686224,92633119,2016-08-09,29760264,Austin,Enjoyed my stay here. Wentao is a friendly and gracious host. Location is fantastic and for the price it is a great value.

He went beyond his way to make sure my arrival was smooth,and it was. He offered to give me all sorts of tips to get around Boston,unfortunately my agenda was full for my short visit,,,
The location is great,you can't get more Down Town,just a couple of blocks away from Boston South Station which you can reach for free with the Silver Line from Boston Logan.,,,
The room is perfect,good bed,but no airco ( which I'm not used to anyway ) so in summer it is warm. Its a city apartment so it has some noise,being raised in a big city myself it didn't bother me at all!,,
There is more then plenty of stuff to see / do / eat around the corner,if you want to discover Boston,"this is the place to stay!\"",,,
6686224,93120773,2016-08-11,84621804,Jiaxian,Wentao gave me quite detailed instructions to enter the apt. Really logical and organized. Many thanks for that!
But the noise did go beyond my imagination. But again,no worries. Wentao attentively provided ear plugs in advance. Lol. Thx! Actually I was way too tired so I even did not use them. Boston is quite a pretty elegant city~ surprised me again. After a tightly-scheduled tour day here,"I think u won't need those ear plugs as well. \"",,,

El departamento es muy lindo, muy limpio y ordenado. La habitación es muy cómoda y es todo tal cual como se describe en la publicación. El barrio también es muy lindo y da gusto caminar por sus calles. Se ve muy seguro aún andando tarde en la noche. Esta muy cerca de un montón de lugares para visitar en Bostos ...

Valeria and her brother were very nice and made everything for my stay to be comfortable. That was my first time in Boston and they gave me many useful advises. What I appreciated the most was the nice location,that enables you to visit almost everything walking ... I never had to use a cab/uber and believe me I visited a lot of places,from dowtown to Charles River. It is a very safe area and coming back home late is not a problem (even walking). This district is also the typical Boston area you expect to see,with nice streets full of red houses :-). Have shopping to do ? Just walk to newbury and enjoy.....,,

The Studio is only a few steps away from the T-Line which makes it easy to explore the city. There's no room for unpacking stuff from the suitcase that's why it's better for short term stays."

It is right next to the T station, drug store, little food shops, and Sean is so helpful and understanding! It's weird but Sean's art supplies keeps you company.. lol! I felt like an actual student who's living in Boston even though I stayed only a night there (which was a great experience). I definitely recommend this spot and Sean as a host! :)"

The place is small but perfect for one person or a couple of people with pretty much all of the basics you could need and lots of sunshine. I especially loved the shower - great water pressure -:). It is a block from the Green Line so I could take it directly there from the airport. It is about 2 blocks to Harvard Medical, Dental and Public Health schools and very close to Mass Art, Simmons, Northeastern as well. About a 30 minute walk to downtown and Copley square. There are several good restaurants, a Walgreens, grocery store, etc very close by but my favorite was a Ethiopian place called Lucy's - great food! I would definitely stay here again!"
66288,225868,2011-04-13,491500,Drew,"Sean made the effort to meet me in the late evening after my flight arrived late--it was much appreciated. Everything was great, I'd stay there again!"
66288,228919,2011-04-17,446426,Krista,Sean was super great about communicating. Greta directions.
Apt matched the description and pictures-- tiny,"but perfect spot for someone who will be out on the town during their Boston visit. \"",,,,
66288,241234,2011-04-26,436680,Lara,My stay at Seans and visit in Boston was everything I needed it to be. The tiny apartment was interesting and cute. It felt safe for my son and I and we crashed and slept well at the end of each day's explorations.
Sean was a good host,communicated well and offered lots of information. He was kind and flexible when we were very lost and even came to find us.,,,,
"A wonderful human being and a memorable spot. \"",,,,,
66288,250426,2011-05-03,525394,Michael,"Sean is a great communicator and the studio is just as listed. I really enjoyed the convenient location and loved the area. The neighborhood is safe, the food around is good (I tried the indian halal cuisine and for an affordable $7 ate a really pleasant lunch special), and the public transportation close. All in all, A+."
66288,301817,2011-06-07,371441,Emma,Sean was very helpfull with everything. He gave us all we needed for the studio and then helped us find an apartment. So he's a good guide if you want to move to Boston !!!
Above all he is a really nice guy and we enjoyed the time we spent together. We will definitively keep in touch !,,,,,
"Emma and Guille\"",,,,,
66288,310242,2011-06-12,635698,Kate,"Sean was very helpful with accommodating us arriving in Boston early from an overnight bus - we really appreciated this. The room is small for two people but excellent value for money. It is in a great location - easily accessible by the T Line. We found it very easy to get around, and there is lots of places to eat close by (very cheap) and a supermarke and chemist up the street. As we arrived early the place was not able to be cleaned before we arrived. There were some plumbing issues with the toilet but Sean was very helpful and communicated with us until the issue was resolved. We would recommend staying at Sean's apartment when in Boston."
66288,313938,2011-06-14,288924,Tiffany,"The apartment covers all of the basics but being that it's a tiny studio it definitely had some space issues for two people. Sean was awesome, even met us early on Saturday morning after our red-eye flight. The apartment is just over a block from a T stop and the local spots: Penguin Pizza, JP Licks and such are awesome!  The only downside was the age of the building and the fact that Sean wasn't able to clean it before we arrived (given that someone had just left and we were early). Overall, it's very accessible from public transit, has great local spots for food/drink and gives you a places to crash in Boston at a reasonable price. However, for some creature comforts I would splurge for something a little more plush."
66288,317931,2011-06-16,648763,Jim,Sean is excellent on communication...via phone and e-mail. Pleasant and easy-going.
The studio is small and basic. It  has what you need for a quick night's stay.  The bed is a twin. The pull-out bed doesn't make it a double. Excellent internet. He leaves terminal his on.,,,,,
Location: You're basically at Brigham and Women's hospital. We walked to the Pru Center in about 30 minutes. Lots of schools are closer than that. It's just a few easy blocks from Green Line metro/Brigham Circle. The 'T' is about five-10 minutes from downtown.,,,,,
Very good stores such as a good Stop n'Shop supermarket and Walgreen pharmacy. Very good internet access..he leaves his computer on.,,,,,
Drawback? Old building not a dream,but fine. Neighborhood is fairly dodgy,but I parked on the main drag unde street lights and around stores. No problem.,,,
"I'd go back for another stay.\"",,,,,
66288,330557,2011-06-23,688611,Jin,"It was a great place to be at Longwood area. I spent 3-4 days there for an interview, and it's very close and convenient to walk to the academic area hospitals."
"Sean is so nice to have everything ready for you. Including the high speed internet set up. I highly recommend this place!\"",,,,,
66288,366688,2011-07-11,411824,Karin,"Sean's place was ideal for me, a 2 day 1 night tourist to Boston.  I spent my days touring, and came home to a comfortable private studio."
66288,373572,2011-07-14,318122,Michael,"This place is incredibly well located at the intersection between the Green/E line of the T and the 66 Harvard Square bus route. So it's really easy to go anywhere, whether it's downtown, north or south. The room and the bathroom are clean and well equipped (frigobar and computer with Internet came really handy), and Sean is very quick to reply to requests and easy to communicate with. I'd stay there again."
66288,395829,2011-07-25,788749,Pia,"I (f, 29) stayed two days in Sean's apartment. Sean is very nice and helpful (I could have some packages shipped to his flat, which he brought me), the apartment cozy and it is very close to Harvard Medical School (5-10 min walk). I enjoyed my stay and can recommend Sean."
66288,420878,2011-08-05,466792,Narasimhachari,"Sean is a wonderful host and very considerate. The apartment is in a great location near the Longwood medical center, close to public transportation."
66288,425622,2011-08-07,466792,Narasimhachari,Sean is considerate and flexible. Goes out of his way to make the guests comfortable. Recommend highly.
66288,435958,2011-08-11,421218,Fernando,"Sean's studio is not bigger than my living room, is small but conveniently situated 3 min from the metro line. We had problems with our check in - was hard to reach Sean by phone - but Sean seemed to make every effort to handle us the key and be there at our arrival and even let us make our check-in a bit earlier than it was supposed to. The studio is good for short stays for no more than two people with few luggage. Kitchen isn't ready to cook real meals, just maybe breakfast, and even that will be a puzzling exercise over the kitchen table - small,  with PC keyboard and monitor in the way. Bathroom was ok, bed comfortable in a quiet neighbourhood. Affordable. Overall, good stay, and I would say recommended for short stays in Boston for people on a budget."
66288,443238,2011-08-14,542449,Antonella,"Sean is a great and easy-going host, helpful and friendly. The studio is small and basic. It has what you need for a quick stay with not big luggages. Internet is fast and with PC keyboard and monitor. It's close to the subway so you can reach downtown in 15 min."
We enjoyed a lot the place and the city,"so we would recommend staying at Sean's apartment when in Boston!\"",,,,
66288,471645,2011-08-24,571372,Federica,"Sean is a great host, available and kind! Thank you Sean!"
66288,475559,2011-08-25,1002167,Troy,Sean is a nice young man and great host.  The studio was a good value and location was convenient (close to the subway) and easy access to anything in Boston.
66288,477811,2011-08-26,1009462,Rookie,"Sean was a great host, very flexible and did great in communication with us. His appartment is small, but clean and comfortable for short term staying. The connection to public transportation is only a few steps away and easy to find. Thanks Sean"
66288,486704,2011-08-30,591554,Kevin,"Sean's apartment is extremely well situated for shops, food, and transport.  Sean himself is affable and helpful.  The room is a lot smaller than it appears in the photo and is a big squeeze for more than one person.  However, it is well equipped, and everything worked.  We particularly appreciated the use of the PC and internet.  Thanks Sean."
66288,492087,2011-09-01,630550,Wilson,Fun location and sean did a great job making everything comfortable and easy.
66288,510541,2011-09-07,839939,Leslie,Sean was an excellent host.  He met me at the train stop and provided me with great suggestions for touring the city.  The apartment was neat and had everything I needed.
66288,518654,2011-09-10,1018916,Dan,Sean is helpful and communicative. Room is compact but clean and well located. A good budget option for exploring the city.
66288,523207,2011-09-12,867048,Jillana,"Sean's studio was perfect for our weekend stay, we felt right at home and cozy in our own little space! It is well situated to explore Boston, we were quickly and easily able to take the transit to Harvard, downtown, and the Sam Adams brewery. Sean was very communicative and helpful with advice about getting around and tips about the city. An excellent host with a great little studio!"
66288,530499,2011-09-14,752709,Dia,"It's a nice little room, perfect if you are only planning to sleep there."
66288,560845,2011-09-23,1168608,Thomas,"Lors d'un Road Trip de Boston à Miami, j'ai eu l'occasion de passer de trouver un hébergement via Airbnb chez Sean."
Sean nous a fait totalement confiance,et nous avons passé une très bonne nuit dans son studio. Un hôte très sympathique ! Allez-y les yeux fermés !,,,,
Une superbe expérience,pour un prix très attractif. A renouveler !,,,,
"\"",,,,,
66288,579828,2011-09-29,664875,William & Catherine,"Sean's live in architects studio is exactly as pictured, very nice.It turned out to be the perfect location for us, easy to get around by train. We would stay there again. We flew in from overseas to another state and drove to Boston. Parking tip: there is a parking lot around the corner, across from the Stop N Shop for only $18.00 a day. Parking tickets are $40.00."
"\"",,,,,
66288,588799,2011-10-02,959323,David,"Sean is a fine host.  Our Wait Street studio was small and funky, just what we were looking for.  Great location.  I would stay there again."
66288,593707,2011-10-03,425194,Anamarija,"Our Boston trip was short (1,5 day) but we enjoyed it so much. Sean's studio was exactly as described and it was a perfect home during the stay. Sean was an awesome host and he suggested things we should see while there."
Both of us would warmly recommend Sean and his studio to people traveling to Boston.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
66288,600134,2011-10-05,709892,Ricarda,"Seans place is nice, but really very very small (too small for two people with big backpacks) - and also not the cleanest."
Sean himself is a charming and very nice guy,he just doesn't seem to take renting out his ex-studio all too seriously ... These factors considered,"it does not really seem worth the price.\"",,,
66288,608354,2011-10-08,1028737,Anna,We had a short stay in Boston and the stuido suited our needs. The T was a short walk from the studio and it took us about 15mins to get Downton. Having access to the laundry facilities was a saviour at that point of our trip. Thanks Sean.
66288,617841,2011-10-11,655321,Dawn,The flat was easy to find and very quiet. So near the train station. I did enjoy Brigham Circle very much and everyone seemed friendly. Plenty of pubs-bars places to eat. Sean was lovely.Loved Boston and def going back. I  couldnt believe how easy and quick Boston was to navigate. Would def stay here again.
66288,622825,2011-10-12,1035271,Edina,"Our stay in Boston worked out perfectly! This studio is in an absolutely great location especially if you are wanting to check out the museums in the area. Very close to transit which makes the location even better. Sean was very flexible with meeting us at the studio and even left a key for some friends that needed a nap before their flight! I highly recommend this place if you are traveling alone or w/ one other person and you need a cute, clean, convenient place to lay your head. Thanks Sean! We hope to make it back soon!"
66288,645195,2011-10-19,13071,Kevin,"Sean was great, he worked around our schedule to make sure we had the keys right when we arrived. The location was perfect, just a 2 min walk to the T station, ideal for anyone visiting Boston."
66288,656963,2011-10-24,777909,Karen,"We spent 3 days at Sean's studio.  He was very helpful, letting us know how to get to his place from the airport and being there to meet us.  The studio was exactly as shown.  We appreciated the use of the internet.  The area was good and really close to the green line with shops right there."
"Just a wee suggestion for future users - if there's 2 we would recommend that you move the mattress from the rollaway to the top bed and put one of the softer mattresses on there at night. That worked well for us.  Sean was very helpful and brought us a missing blanket even later in the evening along with a spare.  Thanks again.\"",,,,,
66288,671100,2011-10-28,1125406,Jennifer,"The place was just okay. Good to sleep in, but not a place I wanted to hang out in. If you're just looking for a convenient spot (a short walk to the T) and a place to sleep at night, this is a great choice."
66288,680856,2011-11-01,972372,Tj,"Great place.  As advertised.  Close to a T station, grocery store, neighborhood bars, and a good ice cream/coffee shop.  The perfect place if you're just looking for somewhere to sleep and get dressed to explore Boston."
My only warning would be that the bed is a twin,and while Sean does have another twin pullout under the bed,its not the most comfortable.  If you're not a picky sleeper then you'll be fine.  I am a little picky and it was tough.  Other than that,"I'd recommend the place for sure.\"",,
66288,690720,2011-11-03,1355204,Cody,Sean made a last minute reservation work out great! The place was super clean and cozy. I would definitely stay there again and Sean was great! I really liked the architectural renderings and sketches on the wall.
66288,702137,2011-11-08,125651,Chigusa,Sean was a great host. The place was conveniently located and close to T stops and bus stops.
66288,716110,2011-11-14,1224458,Mitch,"Perfect.  Sean very accommodating, answered lots of questions in advance, etc.  My first AirBNB experience, very successful."
Room is small as others have noted but perfectly fine for one person.  On the second floor of an apartment/condo building.  Not spotless but on par with a spare bedroom/bathroom in an oldish building.  Internet is through a 3G USB stick that I was able to plug into my laptop,but doesn't get you WiFi.  Was fine for my needs.  He also has a Windows PC which I didn't use.  Room gets a bit warm,but the window air conditioner balanced it fine.  Smoke and carbon monoxide detectors were disabled; hopefully that was done by a prior guest and will be reconnected.  Lots of basics in the hotel-sized fridge.  Rarely heard any neighbors.  Quieter than expected for a city location.,,,
Super location for a conference in the Longwood Medical area.  Several decent restaurants around the corner - Indian,pizza,Chinese,and great burgers.  Stop & Shop and TGI Friday's extremely close-by too.  Parking across from Stop & Shop (essentially behind Sean's building,on Calumet Street) is $18/night.  Needed to pay each morning but they were friendly.,
Extremely short walk to Fenwood Road Station (Green Line E) subway stop.  This is an above-ground stop,so cash (exact change) needed.,,,,
"I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.\"",,,,,
66288,725909,2011-11-17,244264,Chris,"Sean was accomdating, letting us drop of our luggage in the morning, even though somebody else was still not checked out. Also, I was able to stay until late afternoon and the end of the stay.  The place is small and was not as clean as one would hope.  However, it is also very convenient.  A city-wide bicycle rental place has a station very close and of course busses and subway are even closer."
66288,728992,2011-11-18,990402,Guy,"It's a small, full-service place at a very affordable price. The neighborhood isn't that great, but the room itself took care of all of my needs."
66288,739514,2011-11-23,1251469,Alma,"This small studio is conveniently located near bus lines and trollies, and is about 15 minutes from downtown Boston.  The nearest trolley stop is Fenwood Rd. off of the E green line.  There is a grocery store, convenience store, and several restaurants near by.  I don't regret sacrificing the comforts of a hotel considering the money I saved."
Also,Sean is responsive,friendly,and responsible.,,
The only down side is that it's not too clean.,,,,,
"It's worth it if you don't plan on spending too much time in the room. \"",,,,,
66288,742953,2011-11-25,1308791,Judy,"This place is definitely smaller than pictured, and it's really suited for only one person. The pullout bed is not comfortable and will kill your back. I also feel it's a little expensive for what it is, it's more comparable to staying at a hostel and therefore should be cheaper. The location was alright, there are plenty of places to go walking distance, but this did not matter to us since we spent most of the our time in downtown Boston and around the theater district. If you are used to staying in reasonably nice hotels when you travel, I would not recommend staying here."
66288,774491,2011-12-10,1355907,Hamid,"Sean is a cool guy and very friendly. Indeed we appreciated his guides. Suit was convenience for us and we had a good time, very near to our business addresses."
Suit is good for 1 to 2 people and it is really cool to MIT,Harvard and center city. We appreciate friendly environment provided by Sean.,,,,
Hope again to visit him and wish him and his family all the best with full of joy.,,,,,
"Hamid\"",,,,,
66288,792050,2011-12-18,911598,Anup,"Sean is awesome, and the place is great! I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. The place is private, and you can come and go as you please. This was really convenient. The location is great as well - lots of restaurants, access to the T, and close to the hospitals. All of these things call for a 5-star rating, but when I stayed over the place was in need of a good, professional cleaning job that leaves me rating it a 4. I'm sure Sean will have this taken care of when you get there so don't hesitate to stay here!"
66288,850191,2012-01-08,863648,Jody,Sean's place is as described and very conveniently located near a T station and restaurants. It's perfect if you want to spend all day exploring Boston and just want somewhere private to sleep at night.
As some people have noted,it would benefit from a thorough cleaning but if you're not picky,"the place has all the basics that you need for a fraction of hotel price. Being able to use the internet on the desktop there was very convenient and Sean was very nice when we checked in even though we arrived late. Would probably stay here again if I returned to Boston.\"",,,
66288,857456,2012-01-11,276776,Sarah,Great spot!
66288,869065,2012-01-17,1095711,Corentin,"Excellent host !!! Always willing to help his guests, answer very quick to every need or questions we had !! Very convenient location (less than 5 minutes walking to the subway)!! I definitely recommend this place !"
66288,879817,2012-01-23,1601263,Chris Aaron,"\"The place is nice. It is right by the \"\"T\"\" (subway/train). The bar around the corner is lovely. \""
66288,907620,2012-02-07,1310265,Brad,"Let's be honest, this is small, basic accommodation. It's an older apartment in an older building, so it's not luxury accommodation by any stretch. Personally, I would feel claustrophobic with 2 people, unless it was exclusively a place to sleep and shower."
However,it was perfect for me as a single traveler with business in the Longwood Medical Area. This is an excellent value for private,independent accommodation with your own bathroom and basic kitchen facilities,a comfortable bed,and PC with internet.,
The green line is right outside the door,and there are some great restaurants nearby,my favorites were Mama's on the corner,and the Mission bar and grill around the corner.,,
"Sean was prompt with communication and dealt with any problems that came up. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.\"",,,,,
66288,909551,2012-02-08,1310265,Brad,"Once again, an excellent and hassle free stay at Sean's studio."
66288,918709,2012-02-13,1613789,Norman,"small cozy lil space, super convenient for one or 2 people. Great food right around the corner and easy access to south boston and other areas with the tram right there at street access. By the way, Mama's Place, right there on the corner, amazing burgers"
66288,924112,2012-02-15,1739069,James,absolutely fantastic.
sean is a wonderful guy and the apartment was very well kept. clean. and convenient to get too.,,,,,
"your nuts if you dont stay here.\"",,,,,
66288,930824,2012-02-19,1097667,Laurel & Charles,"The studio was clean and convenient. Best for 1 but there is a trundle bed and that worked well for the 2 of us. The apartment is light, everything worked, and the small kitchenette was handy. Sean communicates well and is easy to work with."
66288,938459,2012-02-21,118227,Alex,"Sean was a fantastic communicator, friendly and on time. His place was in a great area I'd stay there again without a doubt!"
66288,958893,2012-02-28,1495430,Sophia,"Overall, it was comfortable and clean. It's a great place to sleep and have a little breakfast in the morning. Beware of showering too early in the day because there's limited warm water."
66288,968762,2012-03-04,1705039,Matt,"Sean was great, and the place was cleaner than expected after reading some reviews. The roll out bed doesn't pop up like I was hoping and is definitely close to the floor as far as the comfort level."
- 1 star for comfort and - 1 star for Sean accidentally falling asleep the night we were supposed to check in.,,,,,
p.s. Airbnb is great if any problems arise,"I would feel safe using the site and contacting Sean again even with the check in problems we had.\"",,,,
66288,977350,2012-03-06,1832115,Noémie,"Sean is very easy to communicate with and extremely accomodating. The studio is pretty small, but perfect if you just want to sleep at night and hang out in the city during the day. I stayed there with a friend for 2 nights and it was alright. As for the cleanliness for the studio is was ok, but it could have been better (but, nothing that will prevent you from going there, and actually enjoy !)"
66288,987682,2012-03-11,1623036,Joern,"To be honest, Sean seems to be a nice guy, but he should take more care of what he rents out. The place is small, but i can live with that. It is simple, which is fine, too. But what wasn't good at all was the cleanliness in the room and especially in the bath. The space between the tiles wasn't white, it was something between grey and black. A vacuum would be a great thing to have, because there has not been used one for ages."
All in all a cool place to be,"if it was a lot better maintained.\"",,,,
66288,1022787,2012-03-20,1525317,Gustavo,"El estudio de Sean es perfecto para una estadía breve en Boston. Esta muy bien ubicado y tiene todas las comodidades necesarias para uno o dos personas.  Tiene la ventaja de la total privacidad, si bien es pequeño es de uso exclusivo del visitante."
66288,1034032,2012-03-23,1670408,Anna,"The location was perfect because I was doing research at a library located in the medical school complex.  There was a nice little coffee house around the corner from Sean's studio, and it has great Irish lattes.   Sean is a really nice guy and can give you all sorts of information about the area and transportation etc."
66288,1041814,2012-03-25,1969829,Michael,The spot was great. Practically step off the T and you're there - this I key after long days of travel and touring around when the last thing you want is a hassle getting home.
"Sean was very helpful - also a very hip guy. Good at answering phone calls and getting back to you when you call. When we got there he was happy to hang around and let us ask any questions we might have had. \"",,,,,
66288,1054823,2012-03-28,1671296,Julian,"Sean is a very responsive host that has made my stay in Boston a positive experience. The location is quite convenient to the T and easy to get around. The studio apt is quite well-equipped. Though it's a bit tiny, it's good for 1 person stay. Sean gave the guest full respect and flexibility and it's great to have the full privacy to yourself. If I could make any suggestion, I think sometimes it's a bit noisy in the morning since some construction workers were working starting at 7:30. Other than that, it's a nice stay. Thank you."
66288,1060145,2012-03-29,876425,Perry,Sean was extremely accommodating when I needed a place at the last minute. The apartment is conveniently located and so close to the main part of the city.
66288,1062894,2012-03-30,1902814,Ben,Nice little place very convenient to metro transit. Sean was very welcoming on short notice and met me right on time where we agreed.
66288,1064178,2012-03-31,1554985,Marion,"C'est un appartement très pratique car situé tout prêt du métro, vraiment à 1min à pied. Simple mais complet, on peut y faire un peu de cuisine. J'ai trouvé cela très bien pour notre court séjour sur Boston (une nuit), le seul point négatif étant la fenêtre qui ne ferme pas (la rue est assez passante)."
66288,1089048,2012-04-06,1294559,Simon,The apartment was exactly as described and pictured. The location was great as it was on one of the main tramlines to downtown. Lots of take-away places nearby and a supermarket round the corner. This place was perfect for me as I just needed somewhere to crash at night but it would be a tight squeeze for 2 people. Sean very kindly waited in for me as I arrived late (3am) so I was very thankful for that. He was very helpful and answered most of the questions I had. A little expensive for what it is (going on what I have had elsewhere) but I guess that's because it is Boston. All in all very pleasant experience.
66288,1109359,2012-04-11,1683126,Brandon,Very good experience. Great location for the price.
66288,1129193,2012-04-14,2060767,Cara,The room was just perfect for my stay and Sean was very welcoming. All questions were answered and no problems ever came up. Thanks Sean!
66288,1130919,2012-04-15,1712464,Brian,Studio was just a described. It was small but clean and close to the subway. Sean meet me as the studio right on time and it was easy to check out the next day.  I would stay their again.
66288,1146710,2012-04-18,1182021,Brian,"If your needs are basic -- a place to sleep, shower, and convenient to public transportation -- it is fine.  The pictures and description of the apartment are accurate.  I have no complaints."
It is very small.  For that reason,I would not personally choose it for a stay of more than a couple nights or more than one person.  You can hear a lot of street noise at night.  The blinds let a lot of light through so the room does not stay dark once the sun comes up.,,,,
The location felt safe.   It was extremely close to the T Green Line,which was very nice.  There was a good coffee shop,some quickie restaurants,and a 7-Eleven on the block.,,
I had no problems getting in contact with Sean.  He was responsive and a good host.,,,,,

66288,1176503,2012-04-25,1476955,Arnaud,"Sean was very welcoming. He was there when I arrived  ; although my plane was early, he managed to be there : very appreciated."
The place (toilet or sink) wasn't as clean as one can expect on arrival (please people : leave the place as you would like to find it yourself) and Sean didn't had time to clean it up since the last renter.,,,,,
As somebody already said,the studio is smaller than the photos suggest,and it's rather rudimentary. But it's convenient and at a fair price.,,,
The computer needed to be reinstalled so there wasn't any wifi when I was there (Sean will find time to repair it eventually).,,,,,
Wait St. was being rebuilt at the time as I was there,so it was pretty noisy throughout the day (and early in the morning) ; the buildings are rather old and need some serious renovation.,,,,
I LOVED the Mission Hill neighborhood.,,,,,
Brigham Circle is VERY convenient : stop for the T (15mn to Prudential or Copley Sq,30mn to Lechmere) ; there's a Stop & Shop grocery store (from 6AM to 11PM),and restaurants (TGI Friday,Dunkin Donuts,Au Bon Pain) nearby.,
The neighborhood is young and very vibrant at night.,,,,,
The Emerald Necklace is a few yards away and is a great place for jogging.,,,,,
"There's a Hubway station (bike sharing) almost in front of the studio\"",,,,,
66288,1214441,2012-05-02,987512,Secil,Sean is a smart man and his property was just as he described. It is very close to train and bus station and just a few moments to the heart of Boston. Sean were very welcoming and helpful. The room was a good size and I can throughly recommend it.
66288,1233283,2012-05-06,1627363,Fabien,"Sean is a sympathetic and atypical person. There were really everything we needed in the studio and also in the neighborhood, which is not so far from the historical town. I definitely recommand this amazing place! Thank you Sean!!!"
66288,1252143,2012-05-09,1826877,Vicki,This studio is in a wonderful location and Sean is a very helpful host.  Would recommend for 1-2 people.
66288,1262455,2012-05-11,2036094,Ezzah,"Sean was extremely helpful when we arrived - he helped us with our luggage up the stairs and provided us with tips on where to go and how to get to those places. As my travel partner and I only had a night in Boston, we really appreciated his tips. Additionally, we faced no problems at all with checking in. He was already promptly there by the time we arrived, and made sure we were all settled in before taking his leave. He was also extremely easy to get to by texts, when we were facing problems with the wifi. We were also allowed to conveniently slot his key back into the room when we were checking out. Overall, a highly recommended place to stay!! His place is extremely convenient by the metro/subway, whether from the bus station or the airport - it was such a short walk seriously. If two petite girls could drag their luggages through that short distance, so can anyone!  On a last note, his place is really close to a lot of eating places and the neighbourhood is really safe!"
66288,1269285,2012-05-12,1036332,Lauren,"Definitely would stay again.  What u see is what u get, and if you are looking for a simple place to sleep and shower and save $ rather than spend money on a hotel, this is your spot!  Sean was great.  Thanks!!!"
66288,1293356,2012-05-17,1764942,Maïa,Everything went great. The studio is as described. It was really easy to communicate with Sean. The Green line is really close from the studio so it's easy to go anywhere you want in Boston.There are also a few restaurants/cafes nearby. It was my first airbnb experience and I have no complaint!
66288,1333705,2012-05-23,1698101,Mirjam,"At Sean's place you've got all you need to spend a couple of days in Boston. It's a nice area. Nearby is the GreenTLine Coffee, a very cute little café to have breakfast or such. There are also other decent restaurants around as well as a supermarket and so on. We had all we needed at the flat and Sean was very welcoming and reliable. I can only recommend staying at his place!"
66288,1355744,2012-05-27,1913531,Stephen,"The apartment was functional for my needs. Very small but that wasn't a surprise as it was advertised that way. The bathroom was a bit grotty due to the age of the building (ie tiles loose on the floor, stains in the sink and mildue on wall tiles) but thats part and parcel of some of these older style apartments. Given the outrageous prices for Hotels in this city this apartment proved to be a big money saver for me. Sean was helpful when I needed to ask a question and check in and check out were conducted without any dramas. If you like roughing it to save dollars like I do then this is a great option. If you are a bit precious about things and need everything to be spotless and sparkling white then maybe u might consider other options. Transport options were good with a tram to downtown being only a block away. Excellent options everywhere around the neighborhood for eating out. Thanks Sean."
66288,1372839,2012-05-29,2083950,Elaine,"I stayed for two nights with a friend and there was limited space with our luggage lying around and the second twin bed rolled out. However, we only used the studio as a place to sleep and shower, so it wasn't an issue for us. We also found the beds to be very comfortable contrary to other reviews. A huge positive about this location is that it is steps away from the T line. We had some issues meeting with Sean upon our arrival, but as we waited, it gave us an opportunity to check out a place called Mama's down the block (the gyros were delicious). Over all, Sean was very nice and our stay at his studio was a positive experience. It's a great space for it's price. Thanks again, Sean!"
66288,1391560,2012-05-31,253587,Peter,"Our stay @ Sean's place was perfect. Check in was easy, the place fit the description/pictures. The A/C was welcome, given the recent heat. Sean was very accommodating when it came to us having our dog stay at the place with us."
Note: If you need to park your car during your stay,"it can be a bit tricky. We ended up moving the car a few times during the day to avoid paying $20 (!) for just 4 hours at the nearby parking 'garage'\"",,,,
66288,1396756,2012-06-01,2444962,Alan,"Sean was a great host -- he made it very easy to check in and out of the studio, and was fun to talk to.  He had a lot of insights and helpful information about the immediate area and Boston as a whole.  The studio was clean and comfortable and in a good location -- very easy to get to by T or bus and with good restaurants nearby."

66288,1514311,2012-06-19,1936248,Julia,"The suite is conveniently located for visits in Boston. There is quite a bit of noise from the nearby major street with street cars, busses and traffic. I wouldn't recommend it to light sleepers like myself. Even with earplugs, I woke up several times during the nights. It is a really small space, good enough to sleep in, but not great to spend any extra time."
66288,1652780,2012-07-07,1877583,Greta,"Me and my mum, we stayed there just fo one night, it was really nice room, a bit small for two of us...in the case that we would stay for longer.But for this one night it was perfect....subway station right on the corner..."
66288,1663663,2012-07-09,2330921,Raffaella,"Sean was really kind and helpful. The studio is great! It's cosy, clean and well furnished. The T-station and shops, everything that can be useful during your stay is very close. I definitely will contact Sean again if I go back to Boston."
66288,1758496,2012-07-20,2426619,Chris,"Sean is a very nice guy and very accomodating. There are a few tricky parts to the stay, one of which I think he can remedy - the airconditioner didn't really bring the apt up to sufficient coolness for quite a bit of time.  The other piece is that parking can be tricky  - but Sean was very accomodating and went out of his way to find a parking space for me. The place is small, but can work for the right kind of person/mission."
66288,1863390,2012-08-01,2536313,Paul-Marie,"We stayed 2 nights in Sean's appartement. We really enjoyed our stay. More specifically, we appreciated :"
- The fact that Sean welcomed us personnally at the studio when we arrived (although we had some delays on our schedule) and gave us some useful advices especially regarding the parking of our car.,,,,,
- The proximity to the tram (that goes directly to the city centre) and the museums,,,,,
- The internet access (although it's not yet on wi-fi it should be available soon),,,,,

The apartment was not clean at all and the washing machine was also out of order. For the price we were really upset because the space is really very small for two persons when the bed is double, you cannot easyly pass or open the fridge ( very full of ice)"

66288,2010532,2012-08-17,2510619,Veronica,"My boy-friend and I stay here for two days. Sean is a very kind host, but the apartment was very small And not so clean"
66288,2108732,2012-08-27,2653931,Åsa,"I don't recommend this place. The studio is tiny, hardly any floor space once you have the two beds folded out. It wasn´t very clean and the shower is old and moldy. it's OK if you just want to sleep though and the area and public communications into Boston are OK."
What really upset me and my friend however was that it was so difficult to get in touch with Sean on arrival. As we entered the US,we had to wait 1,5h (!) at border control (we are European citizens) and we immediately texted Sean that we would be late. We sent several texts,informing him. He never replied. We were really worried as it was nearing midnight and we hadn´t heard from him. We decided to find the studio,praying that he'd be there waiting for us.,
When we arrived he simply said,"\"\"ah",I saw your text,"but I didn't reply since it would cost me\"\". This made both me and my friend furious",it was just so extremely arrogant to have us worrying like that,tired
66288,2141032,2012-08-30,1349272,Cynthia,"Two adages come to mind: location, location, location and you get what you pay for. It's very small and in need of some repair, but good value for the access to transportation, museums, restaurants, etc. You arent gong to get a mint on your pillow but Sean is very cool and accomodating.  We will stay again when in Boston on a budget."
66288,2175971,2012-09-03,1814889,Mari,"Can hardly wait to go back! Sean is great even though I only saw him briefly. The apartment is in a PERFECT location and has all the necessities.  The bed is super comfortable, and the building super helpful! There is an information sheet for everything you need from pc use to laundry.  Great stay!  GO!"
"Mari\"",,,,,
66288,2209133,2012-09-05,3290865,BaekHong,"I stayed here for 2 night. Sean is very welcoming host and checked several times to make sure everything was fine. The location is good. Bus stop is just one block away and subway is also very close. Honestly, the room was little small for two people. Interior is similar to the picture. What I didn't like was the smell of the room and bathroom's poor maintenance. If you are sensitive about sound, leaking water may bother your sleeping."
66288,2225626,2012-09-07,3405887,Erin,"Sean is great, punctual, and honest. The room was all my friend and I needed (two beds, a bathroom, convenient location) but it could have been easily cleaned more thoroughly before we arrived. The sheets for the beds were cleaned but left in a pile for us to make the beds ourselves."
If you are sensitive to building smells or dust I suggest renting elsewhere because this place was a little gross in that regard. If you aren't too picky and just need a place to stay,however,"then this place should fit for you. The architectural drawings made it a fun space for sure. \"",,,
66288,2260265,2012-09-11,2647425,Tavia,"Totally awesome affordable little place to stay.  I really enjoyed staying in the area where the studio was located. It is a little off the beaten path of the main Boston sites, but the apartment is located right near the T line, and you will be downtown in ten minutes easily. It also allowed me to explore an area of Boston I would have probably not ventured out to if I knew any better. There are some great little food and bar places near by."
The air conditioner in the room rocked! It cooled up the studio pretty quickly and I am so not use to Boston heat and humidity. The bed is comfortable. I mainly was in the room to sleep and shower and that was it.,so I didn't really use anything else in the room.,,,,
Sean was super accommodating. He met us once we arrived. Gave us some helpful tips on the area.,,,,,

66288,2295532,2012-09-14,3538513,David,"Sean was very accommodating with arranging a key pickup time even though I reserved at very short notice. The neighborhood is very convenient. Even though I'm not a city dweller and the window was open, I didn't notice much noise at all. The single bed was comfortable."
66288,2358485,2012-09-21,1025847,Dominique,"Positive points: this very small flat (definitively for a single) is well situated, very close to a T station linked to downtown in 15mn."
Negative: it requires to be refurbished urgently: very old,numerous failures,electric network outdated and dangerous,but it is also dirty (room and washroom). Sean do not do the minimum after each stays. Additionally,you are not allowed to switch off the old PC,so you have the noise made by the CU all along the night (+ the fridge noise
I met a stressed Sean 15 mn on arrival and bye-bye. No guest book in the room with key informations and advices...,,,,,
Sean is not fair enough and do not fulfill the Airbnb minimum requirements.,,,,,

The subway station is very close and there is a supermarket 2 streets from the apartment so you can easily cook your own meal. The communication was good, Sean answered all our messages."
66288,2480908,2012-10-02,746573,Timothy,"Sean is extremely personable which really adds to the experience. The location, near the Green Line tram which gets you anywhere you need to go with simple transfers and near a supermarket, drugstore, and low-end bars/restaurants is wonderful. The shower is great - strong & lots of hot water. Access to the internet was quite adequate. If you are picky about perfect cleanliness and insist on the highest of high-tech you might be less than thrilled, but with moderate expectations you should be quite happy as I was. Relax and enjoy all that Boston has to offer."

New installed Wifi. I missed nothing. The location is near the Green Line – the main underground/metro line, near supermarkets/drugstores (Stop&Shop, Walgreens, 7-Eleven), lots of bars and very good and cheap restaurants where you can find every kind of food. Good communication with Sean!"

The studio is very good located, directly next to a Green Line Station, there are shops and bistros in the direct neighborhood. Regarding the studio you shouldn't have high expectations. It is is small and needs thorough cleaning. But the bed was comfortable, the shower works very well (nothing leaking) and so does the WiFi. There's everything you need. I think you won't find any better for the money. I would stay there again!"

Bed was comfy, and Sean left clean sheets and towels. The place is right on the train line, so convenient to get in / out of downtown. Would stay there again, no question."
66288,2726772,2012-10-26,335380,Liz,"Sean was super communicative and easy to coordinate with! The studio was perfect for my one night stay - everything in working order, a T stop steps away and places to eat all around the area. The room is just like you see.

Sin embargo la ubicación es excelente, buenos bares, coffe shops, liquor stores y restaurantes jamaiquinos, italianos, asiáticos y americanos obviamente. En general muy practico para un viajero o pareja de viajeros jóvenes que quieran conocer Boston/Cambridge y sus alrededores."
66288,2883504,2012-11-14,1933801,Tess,Please read this review before you consider booking this place! Also please note that I am yet to leave a bad review on yelp. My partner and I have been travelling with airbnb stops for about the last 4 months and are not at all fussy travellers.
The apartment is not what it seems when you book it.,,,,,
Pictures-,,,,,
The pictures on the site do not clearly represent the apartment. The photos are spaciously deceptive and do not  give a true representation of what we found when we arrived. There is not room for one person to be comfortable here let alone two travellers with suitcases. The pictures did not show how two people would have to sleep - with one on a mattress on the floor. The pictures also do not portray the state of the apartment - the kitchen and bathroom were both not in the condition in which we found the place.,,,,,
Cleanliness-,,,,,
The place was not acceptable to live in. It was disgusting. The bathroom tiles are filed with mould and rust and dust. The floors are all covered with dust and look like the place has never seen a broom before. I could never allow for a places would stay in to get like that let alone to leave it in such a state and have the nerve to let someone else stay there. It is an embarrassment to do such a thing. The kitchen was also disgusting and left uncleaned from when it was last used. It was in such a state that we did not feel comfortable to use the facilities.,,,,,
"Overall it was a disgusting place to stay in where we can barely fit ourselves in let alone all of our luggage. I definitely do NOT recommend for anyone to stay here. We payed an outrageous price to stay in such a place - one of our most expensive stops on our trip and with out a doubt the worst. \"",,,,,
66288,2912682,2012-11-19,2685594,Tara,The apt. was exactly as described and Sean was very accomodating and responsive when I had a few questions about parking and the area.  If I had any concerns I'm sure he would have responded quickly but luckily there was nothing unexpected about this place since he listed it with an honest description.
This is not a new apartment and the bathroom is a little worn down but the place is clean and comfortable.  Sean had clean sheets and towels stocked along with some cooking utensils if you choose to use the small range top or microwave.,,,,,
Area is VERY safe and there are some college type bars,grocery store and an amazing sushi place within couple blocks.  Also awesome coffee shop about 45 second walk from door. The green line is right down the street.  For the location and price Sean's apartment is a great deal.  If you're the type of person who likes to explore a city instead of staying in your room,"this is the perfect place.\"",,,

66288,3016609,2012-12-03,1437827,Marcos,"We really enjoyed our stay at Seans place.  Although on the small side, it satisfied our requirements of a comfortable bed and a hot shower at the end of a long day of sightseeing.  For the most part we ate out, but the kitchen was completely adequate for making a simple breakfast each morning.  The immediate neighborhood has a great coffee shop right around the corner called the Green T which we made daily trips to.  There are also several restaurants and a few pubs just a few minutes walk away.  Overall I was happy w/ our accommodations and wouldn't hesitate to book with Sean again."
66288,3085822,2012-12-14,806673,Lindsay,"Sean was very responsive and everything was great. The apartment is quite small, but it was perfect for us. There is a small stovetop and a fridge so we could eat small meals at the studio if we wanted. The apartment is also steps from a T stop which is super nice. There are also several restaurants around the corner which were pretty mediocre but you won't starve!  There's also a grocery store and a Walgreens a few minutes walk away so that's super convenient too.  A great experience."

Location is convenient, only steps from Green Line which will get you to most POIs near Downtown in less than 20 mins but remember to have your tickets purchased in advance. Price and location wise, this is a great place. And the host Sean, has been nice and helpful."
66288,3321165,2013-01-10,4174398,Helen,The apartment had everything we needed for a short stay in Boston for 2 people. It is quite small but we fitted in with 2 aeroplane-sized suitcases although it was a bit of a squeeze. The apartment is in a great location with easy access to the subway system and shops/take-aways/restaurants. Sean was really helpful and got back to me quickly if we had any questions.
66288,3336439,2013-01-13,3139786,Helene,Petit studio suffisant pour 2/3 jours sur place. L'hôte est plutôt agréable et prêt à répondre à toutes les questions.

We actually didnt stay at this studio, we stayed at another apartment in the North End, bigger I guess, very well located, spacious, had almost all the appliances, right next to old North Church.

It's a but rough around the edges but its got style and,most importantly,amenity on its side.,,,
It's right near the T that goes right into town and right past Symphony Hall (which was a big plus for me).,,,,,
I enjoyed having my own space for a reasonable price. Sean was most helpful and accommodating.,,,,,
There was quite a bit of noise from the trams in the morning and the general building its self. But I recall being warned about that.,,,,,

66288,3574124,2013-02-18,666437,Ashley,"Sean couldn't have been more accomodating.  He met up with us even though we got there later in the evening.  The place is in a great location right off of the train line, near museums and near a few great bars and shops.  That being said read the other reviews and you know what you're getting. It is what it is (It is literally a college dorm room)! You cannot beat the price and it was perfect for our weekend trip where we just needed a hot shower and a bed.  As for the bed itself it is a trundle bed that pulls out to make a queen bed, but the mattress is not comfortable on both sides. One side is very thin and lopsided.  The windows in the place are pretty this so be prepared to hear anything that goes on outside and if you go when it's cold, it can get a bit chilly (I couldn't find a thermostat anywhere in the joint)  for those reason it got 4 stars, but really We'd stay again if we went back!

66288,3610036,2013-02-26,2071869,Leni,"We had the best experience at Sean's apartment. Even though our plans changed about 3 times, Sean was always very understanding and flexible."
The apartment is great and has everything one needs for a stay in Boston. A little kitchen,a single bed with a pull out bed underneath + 2 extra mattresses,wireless internet,an extra PC,bathroom...,
Around the corner there's a bus and trolley station - both bring you directly to the city centre. There's also a supermarket,some restaurant and other places in (1-2 minute) walking distance.,,,,
All in all we really enjoyed our stay and next time,we'll definitely come back to this studio.,,,,
If you want to have the best time in Boston,a great place to stay at and a helpful,"funny and super-nice host: Sean's your choice :)\"",,,

Little small but good value for the daily rent.,,,,,
Street parking was available. The host Mr. Sean was very cooperative. was waiting for us on the door with the keys.,,,,,
We enjoyed the brief stay.,,,,,

66288,3770874,2013-03-13,4249870,Lorena,"I'm hesitant to give this 2 stars -- I'd like to give it one or none -- because I got BED BUGS from this place!  But I have to be fair and say that the location and convenience are great; it's super close to the T, great point from which to explore Boston and restaurants and shops close by. Also, Sean was accommodating and helpful; he brought us more bedding when we needed it and also let us keep our bags in the studio for a few hours past check out time on the day we left so that we wouldn't have to traipse through Boston with them.  BUT, and it's a big BUT, this place feels like it hasn't had a good cleaning in years.  There is dust everywhere and worst of all, the mold was THICK in the bathroom.  So bad and so nasty that I went out and bought tile cleaner and cleaned the thing myself!  When Sean came by (to drop the bedding) he noticed I had cleaned and said something about oh, it'll just be back because there isn't ventilation.  Um, no, it won't come back if you clean regularly.  He also said something along the lines of, well, that's why it's not $200 a night.  Again, no.  I don't care how much I'm paying, I expect a clean and healthy place -- and mold in every crevice of the bathroom is just plain disgusting and unhealthy.  There are also missing tiles in the bathroom floor and some are coming up.  I took pictures of all this by the way, because I couldn't believe it. I wouldn't care so much about that if -- again -- I felt that the bathroom floor had been properly scrubbed in the last year or so.  But whatever, I could get over all that -- it's the BED BUGS I'm mad about.  Lo and behold I come home and to dozens -- maybe hundreds? -- of bites all over my body.  I'd post pictures but they are rather gross. It takes a few days for them to appear so I didn't realize it till after I left, because believe me, otherwise I would have called Sean and AirBnB and demanded a new place to stay.  So yeah, here I am at home, now frantically washing all my clothes and linens.  So if the place were cleaned and exterminated, I'd give it a 3 or 4 (it is very small) but as is, I'd say go somewhere else!"

- wireless internet,running water,lights turn on,,,
- host was prompt with responses via email/text/phone,,,,,
- reasonable price,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
Despite what the host says,there are STILL bed bugs at this apartment. My friend and I found bugs EVERY,SINGLE night and woke up with bites. I took pictures of the bugs too and would post it up if it were possible. When the problem was addressed to the host  in person at the end of my stay,he came off as defensive and kept repeating the fact that he had hired someone to get rid of the bed bugs already. But at the end of the day,there are still bed bugs so it doesn't matter to me if someone was hired to exterminate the bugs already. I understand that this place was fairly inexpensive to rent,"but the apartment was dusty and bug infested. I had to frantically wash all my clothes and sheets when I got home. \""
66288,4042113,2013-04-05,4989087,Michael,"Sean was a very accommodating host. He worked very hard to make my stay enjoyable. As you might have read in other reviews, the apartment had a case of the bed bugs, which are VERY difficult to get rid of. I arrived early and Sean was in the apartment with the bed apart and steaming everything (the best way to get rid of them). I'm happy to say that in my 4-night stay, I saw no bed bugs anywhere. Yes, the apartment is small. But as others noted, you are probably going to be out all day and just need a place to sleep. Therefore, it didn't bother me. The room wasn't spotless, but it was as clean enough. It's kind of like what you'd expect if you crashed at a friend's dorm room. The location is nice: you are about 30 seconds from the Fenwood Rd Green Line stop. My only real gripes were that the wireless connection was slow and the bathroom faucet leaked. Otherwise, I enjoyed my stay considering the price."
66288,4092048,2013-04-09,1261538,Peter,"Description of the apartment is accurate. It's small but comfortable and has good access to public transport. It's not the Ritz, but it's decent value for money in Boston."
66288,4125725,2013-04-12,677635,Lee,"Sean's place was in a perfect location. Easy access to restaurants and cafes, etc. I really enjoyed my stay there."
"The apartment was clean and I would definitely recommend it for a single person traveling. \"",,,,,
66288,4201435,2013-04-18,4330598,Alex,"Our stay in Boston was great, we loved the city. We found Sean to be very communicative and helpful (even to the extent of receiving tickets for us in the post before our arrival). Checking in and out was made easy by Sean, with minimal fuss. Although the room was a little on the small side, it was actually perfect for us (a couple), and the bed is big enough to hold two (small!) adults and we didn't use the extra blow-up mattress provided by Sean. A couple of people had complained about the toilet blocking which we were a little worried about, but there was no need as we had no problems with it at all. The location is great too, slightly out of the city but a very short Trolley Train ride to the centre, and the surrounding area has some nice bars/cafes itself. Would definitely stay here again if I found myself in Boston once more"
66288,4219360,2013-04-19,5949987,Ethan,"Sean is a great host. He's quick to respond to any questions you have and will go out of his way to make things work for you. This apartment is totally awesome, it's in a great part of Boston, near many attractions and restaurants. Suuuper close to the Arboretum."
"5 stars.\"",,,,,
66288,4308912,2013-04-27,2175580,Dmitrii,"Студию можно рекомендовать только на короткую остановку, 1-2 ночи. На большую остановку лучше не экономить на жилье."
Плюс - очень хорошее местоположение,в 2 минутах ходьбы от остановки транспорта.,,,,
Минус - сама студия очень грязная,не удивлен что в ней появились клопы. Поэтому я удивлен последними хорошими отзывами посетителей. Может быть,это мне не повезло.,,,
Относительно клопов. Увидеть их сам не смог,поэтому не могу гаранировать что они есть. Но на руках появлялись пятна (аллергия или укусы) неизвестного происхождения,"что в связи с информацией о клопах внушает подозрения.\"",,,
66288,4396216,2013-05-02,5790311,Ben,"The room is located in a nice part of the city, we walked downtown and it was about a 25-minute walk, but the bus stops right outside the door. It's small but cozy :)"
66288,4443859,2013-05-06,2180001,Andy,"This was great value for the money, and just as importantly Sean was a very good host.  To cite the example that most impressed me, I forgot one of my bags in the studio when I checked out, and he actually brought it all the way downtown and dropped it off to me on his way home later that day.  He provided detailed guidance and lots of flexibility from the time I booked to the time I checked out."
The location is an important consideration.  I found it very convenient,with a Walgreen's and a grocery store only 2 blocks away,the Green T coffee shop just around the corner,and very frequent service by the Green E train and the #39 bus.  You also have your choice of a range of restaurants within a 5-minute walk.  It's about 15-20 minutes downtown by train or bus depending on where you're headed.  Since you're in a fairly active neighborhood & the unit faces the street,it does occasionally get noisy at night,but it wasn't too bad
In summary,"I would not hesitate to recommend this studio.\"",,,,
66288,4522091,2013-05-10,6055947,Spencer,Sean was great! We had great communication all the way and he made sure we got the things we needed for the apartment without us asking for it!  A hospitable host and creative with how he fixed up the studio.  Would definitely come back again!
66288,4650391,2013-05-18,4418691,Kevin,It's good stay here. Spacious studio. Close to subway station.
66288,4725824,2013-05-22,4612992,Heidi,"We had a good short stay in Sean's apartment. It's very well located & great area. I think the apartment is as described, clean & had plenty of room for the two of us (but we are pretty low maintenance). . .Sean was helpful with letting us leave our bags at his place after a horrible overnight bus. However, was a bit slow giving us a specific time early on for check in after I asked if it would be possible to go earlier in the morning - he just kinda put of answering - woulda been nice to just get a specific time & arrangement earlier to arrange our short stay around that. Also, I hate to say it but there is still a few bed bugs. Nothing too serious - i was fine (& we kept our stuff well away in case) but my boyfriend got attacked all over the top of one of his legs :( & completely understand they are tres difficult to get rid of & Sean seems on top of the problem. But overall well priced, comfortable & well located apartment."
66288,4826049,2013-05-28,1405583,Viviana,"We reserved this architects live in studio, but we were given the option of staying in a larger apartment as we neared Boston. We met Sean at the larger studio in the north end which was completely unacceptable. It was a basement apartment in poor condition. Now, this may sound picky, but there was no top sheet on the bed. We had pillows, bottom sheet and comforter. After unpacking and realizing that we could not possibly stay in this apartment, we told Sean that we were leaving. He was kind but this apartment was disgusting. After we saw the tub and bathroom we realized we wouldn't feel comfortable bathing our daughter in it. Also, our friends who live in Boston told us that the architects live in studio is located in an area that is hardly safe. We asked, out of curiosity, whether Sean actually owned the two different studios and he told us that he basically manages them for a company. So, it seems somewhat misleading from the apartment posting. They seem like privately owned, by Sean, which gives them a more quaint feel. In the end, airbnb reimbursed us for our stay and sent us an apologetic gift basket. Excellent customer service from airbnb."
66288,4880358,2013-05-30,6321835,Emily,"We were only in Boston for one night to catch a Red Sox game on our way home from vacation. The place was as described, small, but perfect for an overnight stay and in an amazing location. We were able to walk to Fenway park and to the Sam Adams brewery. The train also let off basically at the front door and there were great pubs right down the street. Sean was really accommodating in leaving us a key and letting us slide it under the door when we left. The entire stay was pleasant and smooth and we highly recommend staying here!"
66288,4961262,2013-06-04,1879724,Sarah & Nick,"Sean was really nice! The studio apartment on wait street was very small, but perfect for what we needed for the weekend, and a good price. There are resturants, grocery, ice cream and the T stop all within walking distance. It was super easy to get around Boston from Sean's apartment. Our only disappointment were the mattresses. I was told prior to booking that there were two twin mattresses that lined up to make a full sized bed. When we arrived, it was actually one twin and one blow up mattress that did not line up. As it was me and my fiancé, we would've enjoyed being able to sleep in the same bed. Also the mattress was pretty uncomfortable. But there was air conditioning, a small fridge to store a few things and the neighborhood felt very safe. Overall, we had a great time in Boston with an affordable place to sleep."
66288,4995036,2013-06-06,84313,Scott,"Great location, Sean is really easy to work with, T within a block and lots of shops and eateries in the area.  Great value.  Would recommend and stay again."
66288,5038316,2013-06-09,6169542,Megan,"First and foremost, Sean was extremely easy to get a hold of and consistently communicate with. He even helped explain how this whole airbnb process worked in a bit of confusion on my end. The Studio was perfect for our stay in Boston as we weren't planning on relaxing indoors too much. The location is great for walking and public transport and there are various food, drink, and shopping options within a block or two of the studio. Staying at the studio can be easily compared to crashing at a friends place. Nothing fancy but it's a safe and comfortable place to recharge. This spot worked out great for our budget and expectations. Sean also was flexible with check in time as traveling emergencies got us in quite late to Boston. We were very happy with our stay and would recommend Sean to any future travelers!"
66288,5146909,2013-06-15,6202702,Iris,"Overall, our stay was good. But honestly, this place is really for one person. It actually looks smaller than the pictures shown. We were a little bit concerned about bedbugs before we came, but it was fine. None of us got bitten. The area seems safe. There is a T station right outside of the apt. For budgeted travelers, this is the place to go."
66288,5234727,2013-06-19,4099345,Charles,Sean was a fantastic host! He was responsive and communicated well. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in the studio. Coffee shops and stores nearby. Public transportation is just a short walk away. You can get around Boston from the apt with such ease! I will definitely check this place out again when I make my way back to Boston!
66288,5260664,2013-06-21,265476,Mia,Very accommodating when my flight was delayed and delayed again.  Comfortable and easy to find.
66288,5308979,2013-06-24,5555177,Daniel,GOOD:
The AREA is quite nice; there is a little plaza right around the corner that sort of serves as the starting point of your day; any items you may need,you can pick up at the Stop & Shop before heading into the city (twenty minutes by public transit) or wherever you plan on going.,,,,
Sean is very nice; he gave us information about interesting places to visit in the city - less touristy,and more hip and fun and affordable - which was perfect.,,,,
BAD:,,,,,
Lo and behold,there are STILL BED BUG problems. Despite thoroughly checking the mattress and the frame,we woke up the next morning to find a few bugs in plain sight and found more amongst our things. Had to go through the trouble of sanitizing and throwing away everything of ours WHILE ON OUR TRIP so we didn't bring it home (or to the hotel we checked into the next day).,,,
Even aside from the bed bugs,though,the cleanliness of the place was hard to bear. Sean arrived at around the same time as us,and let us into a dirty apartment. He pulled off all the sheets and towels in front of us,piled them up,and put new (albeit still stained) sheets on. His cleaning of the bathroom involved running the sink and letting the water rinse it out. There was NO CLEANING of the toilet
It's a shame to say because Sean himself was great; he was completely understanding about the bed bug scenario and our early checkout. But all that said,the guests should feel comfortable; not have that grimy feeling that stops them from being able to relax in their bed.,,,,
AirBNB's customer service was excellent; they were available to help us the day of,and responded quickly and with care to the situation.,,,,
All in all,the low price was not worth the stress and time lost from our vacation. Dish out a couple extra dollars and snag a place with a higher a cleanliness rating.,,,,

The apartment was perfect size for us and had everything we needed (including A/C). We slept on the twin bed which was fine for us. It was very easy to reach Sean and he helped us out with everything we needed. Would definitely stay here again.
66288,5505051,2013-07-03,4058103,Thomas & Cyrielle,Sean's appartment is a perfect place to discover Boston ! The green line to Downtown is just three minutes walk from the apartment and leads you to downtown in fifteen minutes. Mission Hill is a great neighborhood in which you will find everything you need ! The apartment was small but as we were there only at night it was sufficient for us (a couple).

The bus stop and subway stops are right around the corner.  The bed was comfortable and there is hot water for a shower, but the rest of the room either needs some work or the price should be reduced.  The smoke detector was questionable (batteries?) as was the fan in the bathroom (which did was not secured to the ceiling nor had a cover), and the window locked shut with screws should probably be addressed."

66288,5980385,2013-07-25,5226418,Amy,"This apartment is fine if you are only spending a short time there and just need somewhere for a night. I would not recommend it for longer. The location of this flat is excellent, it is right on the green T line and is near to some good places to eat and local shops. The flat itself, however, is rather tired and is in desperate need of decorating and thorough cleaning. The fan is hanging off the bathroom ceiling, a light is missing, walls and sheets are also stained and the room itself needs quite a lot of work. There is a single bed and an air bed so having a double bed is quite tricky especially given the very small dimensions of the room. Sean was helpful and responded to emails quickly so I can only give positive reviews of the host himself."

66288,8128694,2013-10-16,9426557,Alison,"Sean was immediately very responsive. Within minutes I got a response to my booking. We had a huge technical issue with AirBnB which meant we sat on the porch waiting for the reservation to clear but Sean was friendly, and quick. Yes, the room is small but perfect for us who just needed a place to crash that night."
66288,8147323,2013-10-18,5761295,Leonardo,"Sean's place was a kind of a disappointment for us. The place is small as described, but that's not the problem. The real issue is the big amount of dirt we found all over the place. The freezer reeks and is so dirty that we found it impossible to use. The location though is awesome. There are plenty of good places to eat around, not to mention there is a train station nearby. The thing is if you're looking for cleaness and a big room thats definetly not the place, but if your budged is low and you're trying to be well located, go for it."

66288,8180021,2013-10-19,9346826,Peter,"Great place!  Definitely a small space, but in a very easy to get to location, was very affordable, and it still fit the two of us just fine.  The apartment has everything you need to cook, and there are plenty of great local restaurants for dining out.  It was clean, and everything worked great.  We'll be looking to stay there again next time though Boston."
66288,8505641,2013-11-03,4518903,Hugo,"Our stay at Sean's is decent. Very convenient location and at a very affordable price! Though the pictures might seems a little bit more attractive than the actually apartment, I would still recommend it to my friends who are looking for a short stay."
66288,8562845,2013-11-05,285934,Zack,"The best thing about Sean's place is the location. It's by a T station, there are a number of groceries and restaurants around, etc. It was nice to see all the drawings he made while studying architecture. The building is a bit old so walls are a bit thinner but overall it was a nice place to be."
"Sean was great in answering phone calls and questions. He was there to meet us when we got to the place.\"",,,,,
66288,8602686,2013-11-07,8404000,Federico,"Really well located , it 's been a great stay and Sean is very responsive and willing to help with anything..."
66288,8620266,2013-11-08,9850803,Julian,"Seans a great, attentive host. His place is small, but quiet and clean. Overall served my purposes perfectly. Thanks again sean!"
66288,8640791,2013-11-10,8886973,Angeles,Very nice stay! The apartament is small but enogh for tourism!
66288,8773301,2013-11-17,3857742,Evan,"Cute place in a nice neighbourhood, very close to transit. Certainly more character than a hotel, and Sean left the key somewhere I could find it when I arrived late."
66288,8824572,2013-11-19,5900041,Justin,"Sean was super nice. The place is small, but if you just need a place to sleep, it works fine. Great location. Would stay at again."
66288,8895705,2013-11-25,2118585,Jan,Perfect place not far from downtown; located in a nice neighborhood and close to public transportation; everything went smoothly! Thank you for a perfect stay!
66288,8946005,2013-11-27,9312001,Ranier,This architect's room for a BnB was very comfy and quaint which was occupied by me and my brother.  It was very accessible to the public commute and easy to find.  There were many nearby places to also get your everyday essentials.  Sean met us at the apartment and was polite and helpful.  He was real informative of the area too.  I highly recommend.  Five stars for what we paid for.  Nice people lived in the apartment complex as well.  Very clean.
66288,9020598,2013-12-02,8963027,Allison,"Super close to the T station, pretty convenient. There's grocery store one block away, so very accessible. It was a wonderful stay! Really comfy, wifi was good. Thanks a lot Sean!"
66288,9147123,2013-12-09,10295233,Skylar,"Just stayed this past weekend with a buddy and had a great time. Apartment is as small as it looks but I went to Boston to enjoy the city, not stay in the room! Never met Sean but I understand we all run in to complications throughout the day. He was very accommodating and the apartment was just fine! Thanks Sean!!"
66288,9202618,2013-12-13,7195173,Amy,"Sean was a great host: warm/friendly, good communication. He even offered a few tips on relocating to the area. Apartment was in a convenient location close to the T. I'd stay here again :)"
66288,9281000,2013-12-18,7750629,Megan,"We ended up wasting our money on this booking as Sean did not meet us at our scheduled meeting time.  Over an hour later and after several calls, Sean showed no urgency to get to the apartment. We were willing to wait when he said he was on his way, but when we called him later and he was still doing other things, we decided to seek accommodation elsewhere. We were extremely disappointed by Sean's careless attitude after a long journey to get to Boston."
66288,9346782,2013-12-23,9806595,Wantseng,"The location is great and convenient, there is a 7-11 within a"
5-min walk. Sean is a great host,"response message very quickly. I recommend this place.\"",,,,
66288,9768817,2014-01-08,8141797,Liebe,Good location and convience.
66288,9943079,2014-01-20,10812358,Caitlin,Sean was very good at communicating with us. Good location.
66288,10079236,2014-01-29,10707036,Yee,Sean is a nice guy. He's easy going and friendly. Room is nice and warm. Perfect location for public transport.
66288,10204324,2014-02-06,10309714,Song,It's a very nice room.
66288,10240085,2014-02-08,1918039,Irving,"Great stay, basic necessities for a short trip , what more could I ask for."
66288,10343382,2014-02-14,1334289,Corie,"The studio was great for crashing. Clean linens and really small, but I appreciated Seans last minute flexibility and direct communication. Recommended."
66288,10462657,2014-02-20,403331,Nicole,"Sean was wonderful and very thorough. He emailed us a week in advance with a reminder and all the details we needed. The place was very basic, just what we were looking for."
66288,10564789,2014-02-25,10429771,Stephan,"Sean was really helpful and proactive throughout all the process involved. We dealt through the phone pretty much all the time, and everything happened very well."
The apartment did supply our needs and had a good location. We would take around 30 min to pretty much everywhere we wanted to go,either walking or using public transportation. The cab from/to the airport costs around $30,and takes 20 minutes.,,,
The downsides are that the apartment is quite small,so it barely fitted me and my girlfriend + our bags (two big bags + backpacks) and the whole building (including the apartment) is old and could use some maintenance.,,,,
"For the good price and location I would reccomend it.\"",,,,,
66288,10669389,2014-03-02,5752329,Florian,"Sean's studio was exactly what I needed ! The location is great, and the place is exactly as described, nice, clean and furnished with everything that you may need ! I didn't meet Sean but didn't have issue to communicate with him, and everything went well ! Definitely a place that I recommend if you need to do a short trip to Boston. And First place I'll think about if I have to come back ! Thank you Sean !"
66288,10745910,2014-03-05,11826005,Zhenxing,"sean is nice,apt is perfect."
66288,10776117,2014-03-07,10851248,Michel,
66288,10975541,2014-03-16,10645170,Mingyu,"This my first time being in Boston and I really enjoyed. Nice city and nice apartment~It's big, comfortable and clean. Thanks."
66288,11154708,2014-03-23,12606609,Roslyn And Dick,"This place was OK. We were happy with the double bed(not twin that was shown) A bit buggy, maybe a good cleaning would help? !  Also some wiring that could be improved.  The decorations were fun. Location great, we loved cafe on the corner!"
66288,11268123,2014-03-27,12884592,Tiffany,Small place but all you really need for one person. Thank you Sean!
66288,11388833,2014-03-31,4163613,Philipp,The Studio was cozy and in a great location. Not very clean though!
66288,11488618,2014-04-05,2176569,G.,"Everything was fine. It's a convenient place to stay very close to subway (green line) in a friendly looking neighborhood with everything you need close by : reasonable restaurants, supermarket, ice-cream, coffee, liqueur store... The apartment, too has everything you need. We didn't meet Sean, but on the phone he seemed really easy-going. I recommend this place."
66288,11642990,2014-04-10,4692155,Nancy,"We were only in Boston for one overnight, and Sean's studio was just what we needed.  Being right on the Green Line, we had easy access to anywhere by public transportation, but we were pleased to find that it was only a 20 min (very pleasant) walk to Fenway and from there another 20 min. to downtown Boston."
We were also pleased to find the trundle bed has been replaced by a double bed.  We had clean linens and towels,and the bathroom had been cleaned.  The room was a bit dusty in a few places,but that was probably because Sean allowed us to check in early so there was little time for him to do a thorough cleaning.,,,
Sean was easily reached for questions and was very flexible about check-in and check-out,and the detailed notes he provided about the place in advance were very helpful. The kitchenette seemed to have what anyone would need,but we didn't use it during such a short trip.  The shower had good pressure.,,,
This is an excellent lodging for anyone who doesn't care about a lot of space.,,,,,
"We enjoyed our stay there. \"",,,,,
66288,11677307,2014-04-11,14032791,Rhett,"Good location.  Sean, the owner, is very nice and responds quickly."
66288,11882212,2014-04-18,11088017,Sarah,"We stayed three nights at the apartment and were pretty much satisfied with the place. Check-In and -out were as flexible as communication with Sean was easy going. We liked the neighbourhood and considered the connection to public transport really good. The apartment could have been cleaner - especially the bathroom didn't seemed to be cleaned after the previous guests had left. Sleeping arrangements were different than shown on pictures - double-matress on the floor, but we slept ok."
66288,11989623,2014-04-21,6626108,David,"We had a late arrival to discover that the key wasn't in the lockbox. This was disappointing but Sean was great in that he rushed over and dropped a key off with us promptly. It was a restful nights sleep though these photos probably show the apartments appearance years ago, it needs a good scrubbing now (April 2014)."
66288,12170947,2014-04-24,14463640,Denis,Airbnb at its best! Even the very late arrival was no big deal.
66288,12252872,2014-04-27,10614332,Shiran,"The apartment is well equipped - bed, sheets, towels and full kitchen. There's even WIFI. It was clean too."
Public transportation is good - very close to the tram station,and there's a direct line to the city center (takes about 30 minutes).,,,,
Sean was very responsive when we needed him!,,,,,
It's rather small but it's private,and it's great value for money comparing to the rates at Boston.,,,,

66288,12648424,2014-05-06,14148544,Shyam,The stay was very comfortable and I highly recommend it. The location was pretty safe and had easy access to T as well as to shops & restaurants.
66288,12702742,2014-05-08,14906309,Aaron,Sean was great and quick with responses to my questions. Place was as advertised and a great value for the location. I'll be using this place again for future Red Sox games.
66288,12953028,2014-05-15,3124355,Nektaria,"Sean was pleasant, helpful and easy to get a hold of.  The apartment is in an accessible location by all means of transport with a great family-style restaurant on the corner (Mama's Place).  I recommend you confirm your check-in and check-out time with him prior to your arrival (I forgot)."
"My only complaints:  room is a bit different from how it's pictured and the apartment is in need of some serious cleaning.\"",,,,,
66288,12988707,2014-05-16,14644021,Maria,"Sean was very attentive and answered my text fast. The studio is very small and needs a very good and thorough cleaning. It could be so cute with some TLC. I did not need a big place  but, it looks nicer and bigger in the picture. Very conveniently located the T stops basically at the door. A nice coffee shop next door called the Green T. People in Boston were so nice!!"
66288,13022761,2014-05-17,13043386,Wendy,"This studio did the job for a good night's rest. It is tiny and not much of anything but good for sleep. Plus side: The mattress is super comfy. It was what we needed for our one night in Boston. Sean left clean sheets, towels and maps for us. Awesome! Thanks Sean."
66288,13131384,2014-05-20,11877947,Pam,Communication with the host was satisfactory. The Apartment was very disappointing. There was no stopper for the bath or basin and the basin faucet dripped all the time. The cover was missing from the extract fan which was clogged with dust. The bed was a mattress on the floor. My wife and I are 68 and fortunately we are both fit but the mattress would have been a problem for a less able couple.The smoke detector in the bedroom was hanging from the ceiling  secured by the electrical wiring. Both blinds in the bedroom were broken and did not operate. There was mold on the bathroom tiles.Only one element on the cooker worked. The whole apartment would have been vastly improved with a decoration and attention given to the above points none of which would have involved large financial expense.
"I would not recommend this apartment to anyone.\"",,,,,
66288,13402085,2014-05-27,11821311,Joy,"Sean was great, we never met but everything was exactly as described. The bed was even bigger than in the picture. the convince is factor is excellent the T stops steps from the apartment."
The street can be a little noisy at night so if  you are a light sleeper bring your headphones.,,,,,
Having stable wifi in the studio was a major plus for us. If I am ever in Boston I will return!,,,,,
"Thanks Sean\"",,,,,
66288,13529566,2014-05-30,1518950,Marlon,Th apartment was very close to the subway. It is small but for a budget traveller isit okay for a couple of days.
66288,13605143,2014-06-01,10732019,Adrienne,"This was a great physical location and good value. The green line stops nearby and there was a great local coffee shop steps away that also offered good breakfast options. As we were primarily in need of a place to sleep and change clothes, it was perfect in that capacity. I would stay here again."
66288,13966010,2014-06-09,2300901,Josh,"Great stay here in Boston. The room is small but quirky, and the double bed on the floor is comfortable. I liked the decor and felt like an architect for a night. The room is a steal especially for a weekend, would definitely come here again."
66288,14179510,2014-06-14,12022322,塑益,Small but it very well
Traffic is very convenient,,,,,
"The next will be taken into account\"",,,,,
66288,14280053,2014-06-16,4534041,Joe,"I'm a fairly frequent Airbnb-er.... luckily for a buddy and I we were only interested in a crash pad after the Red-Sox game.  The place is pretty much as described... it is very small, and not terribly clean, and certainly not modern by any standard.  The neighborhood seemed mostly ok... parking was tricky, but we did luck into a free overnight spot, which was a bonus.  Sean was pretty solid with communications."
I think we caught him on a busy morning... as we did have to wait a bit for instructions so that we could drop our gear and make it to the game.  If there were towels,I couldn't find them.  The bed,just a mattress on the floor,wasn't bad.,,
I didn't see a second trundle bed. (?),,,,,
Summary:  this is a relatively inexpensive crash pad for folks who maybe are well traveled and have stayed in some of the world's less than post hostels,"like me.  I wouldn't recommend it to everyone... but it will serve just fine if all you need is a place to lay your head after a busy night in Boston.\"",,,,
66288,14363522,2014-06-17,13193672,Simone,"We stayed at the apartment for one night. Sean was helpful and accurate in the information provided, although we did not meet. At the time of booking we were aware of the small size of the study and mattress left on the floor (learned from previous reviews); the only positive aspect that we found was the proximity to public transportation."
The apartment was awfully dirty: stained mattress cover and probably unwashed,half an inch of dust everywhere,from shutters to tables and kitchen. On the floor of the bathroom we found several hairs,half-finished bars of soap and detergents that probably dated back to a few years ago. From the ceiling dangled the smoke detector. Finally,the noise coming from the street was rather annoying.,
Concluding this apartment does not reflect the photos presented on AirBNB,as already reported by other users. Boston is expensive,so we opted for this solution (relying on the photos and on some good reviews). Certainly We didn't expect a hotel service but certainly not the situation in which we found ourselves. We wouldn't recommend this experience to anyone.,,,
"\"",,,,,
66288,14771336,2014-06-26,6705641,Corinne,"I recently stayed at the architects live-in studio, and the experience was great!  Honestly, I was looking for a place that was close to public transit, had a stove, and was comfy.  This place met all those things."
The apartment itself is a bit older than what is shown in the pictures,but it's not a deal-breaker by any means.  The place is small - remember,it's a studio,but two of us stayed here no problem and loved it.  OMG,can we talk about the bathroom for a sec?  BEST showers ever.  Also,having a small kitchen was nice for mornings where I wanted to fry up an egg and make my own coffee before running out.
Super close to public transit; lots of tasty places to eat around it.  I didn't get to meet Sean personally because our schedules didn't line up,"but he was super good at communicating via AirBnB and email.  Checking in and out was a breeze.  I'd stay here again!\"",,,,
66288,14820946,2014-06-27,13099741,Amanda Jo,This place was not represented well on Air B&B! The space is small (not a huge deal) dirty and the bed was just a mattress on the floor (picture showed otherwise). We ended up not even staying here and had to book a last min hotel!
66288,15015404,2014-06-30,8788483,My,"We had a great stay at Sean's. We needed a place for the night and for that purpose it was perfect. It is a small apartment but with all you need and a comfortable bed. It's close, 3 minutes, to the train that takes you to town and it's a good vibe in the neighbourhood with restaurants and bars."
"We didn't meet Sean but his was great in giving guidance and did reply fast. Also he was flexible with check out when we had a late check in at our other stay.\"",,,,,
66288,15300213,2014-07-07,7172308,Ron,"All went well... having key in lockbox made it simple.  Great location, very cozy, but good for 2, and the price is right.  Wonderfully convenient to mass transit (the T and busses) and restaurants, grocery stores, etc."
66288,15438432,2014-07-08,17709460,Kaisa,"The room is old and pictures are outdated and misleading. There isnt bed, just matress on the floor."
66288,15486656,2014-07-10,696629,Agnieszka,very SMALL place even for my husbands standards (who isn't picky at all). But it was good for max 2 night stay. It was super hot during our stay but the AC was working beautifully and kept us cool. Picked this place for good price and location. Ideal for younger people who don't mind tiny space and mattress on the floor. Liked that you could pick up/ drop off keys from a lock box - very convenient.
66288,15613447,2014-07-13,8359476,Raffael,"We had a great time in Boston. The accomodation isn't luxurious but if you wanna see the city and don't stay long time in it, it's great."
66288,15724276,2014-07-14,9600380,Mike,Private studio in great location. Sean is a super helpful and accessible host. Highly recommend!
66288,15817732,2014-07-16,11177724,Giulia,"Communication with Sean was perfect, everything went smoothly, from check-in to check-out. The flat is the ideal solution for those like me who like to travel a lot and stop only to sleep. The apartment is good for 2 people, there is a double-sized bed now (bigger than the one pictured in the photos) and it is very well placed (the green line of the subway is 20 meters away, 10 min distance from downtown). For those who get there with a car, be careful where to park: it's very difficult to find toll-free areas and very easy to get tickets."
66288,16054311,2014-07-21,11374221,Lourdes,"Communication with Sean was efficient and helpful. Prior to our arrival I had a concern about the bed being on the floor.  Sean was in the process of adding a bed frame and assured me that he would have it set up before our arrival.  He was true to his word.  I also had some difficulty closing the lock after retrieving the key.  I called Sean, he returned my call and walked me through the process.  The apartment itself has all the basics and is functionally clean, though not impeccable.  The location was great with public transportation steps away."
66288,16356301,2014-07-26,1972622,Joshua,"Needs to be better prepared, and have a cleaner place."
66288,16609447,2014-07-30,15670621,Patrick,"When we arrived the key of the flat did not fit, turned out that by mistake somebody else was given the studio we were supose to stay. Unfortinatley  Sean did not warn us about that mistake. We agreed to spend our first night in studio 202 instead of 201. That studio was by far not what we had Seen on the pictures here. It was small, unclean, run down not fit to host anybody. The next day we could change from studio 202 to 201. That one was already a lot better, but still small and if tidy and clean is a must not the best place to stay. But to be honnest it was very well located, close to some Nice places to have a breakfast ie lunch and close to public transport. Not expensive, to sleep and visit Boston."
66288,17087014,2014-08-07,7801301,Alexander,Wir hatten eine gute Zeit bei Sean.
Die Schluesseluebergabe erfolgte nicht persoenlich sondern ueber eine lockbox,was den Vorteil hat,dass man unabhaengig von der Ankunftszeit in die Wohnung kann.,,,
Zugegeben war der erste Eindruck,wenn man die Wohnung betritt,nicht der Beste,da das Studio und die Einrichtung nicht das/ die Neueste ist/ sind. Allerdings hat sich der Eindruck innerhalb kuerzester Zeit verfluechtigt! Alles hat problemlos funktioniert und wir haben uns in den 4 Tagen sehr wohl gefuehlt.,,
Die Nachbarschaft und Umgebung war gut; wir haben uns jederzeit sicher gefuehlt.,,,,,
Ausserdem hat das Studio eine gute Anbindung an die T (Tram und Ubahn in Boston).,,,,,
Alles in allem trifft die Beschreibung von Sean zu 100% zu und wir koennen ihn und das Studio auf alle Faelle weiterempfehlen!,,,,,
"Alex & Jenny\"",,,,,
66288,17177937,2014-08-08,19040182,Roland,"Sean war sehr gut erreichbar und hat uns sofort geholfen, wenn wir ihn angerufen haben. Das Zimmer ist sehr klein aber ok für einen kurzen Aufenthalt. Die Sauberkeit könnte besser sein. Das Zimmer ist sehr laut. Lärm von der Strasse (Straßenbahn), Lärm von den Nachbarn oben und nebenan. Die Matratze im Bett ist durchgelegen und viel zu weich."
66288,17253628,2014-08-09,4244909,Hannah,"Less than 24hrs in Boston, made Sean's studio the perfect layover for me and my girlfriend."
It's not fancy or pretty,but it's efficient and easily accessible. We felt safe in the area,"charming cafés & corner stores down the block for last minute grabs too. \"",,,
66288,17315778,2014-08-10,19310940,Nancy Viglianti,The studio was perfect for our needs. Communication with Sean was very good. Excellent location to transportation and a lot a great restaurants. We will definitely be contacting Sean in the future.
66288,17425978,2014-08-12,9618325,Marina,The apartment is very well connected with the metro.
"It has all you need for a short term stay. The description of the place and the pictures are correct. Sean was very gentle.\"",,,,,
66288,17681870,2014-08-16,10987227,Barbara,"We spent 3 nights in this apartment and if I will visit again Boston I will choose this again! It is located in a very strategical position, green line tube is 1 minute walk from the apartment and in 15 minutes You are in Boston centre. The apartment is located in an area full of restaurants and there is also a big supermarket. For me it is perfect if You are looking for a cheap accomodation close to Boston downtown. I recomed it!! Moreover Sean is extremely quick in answering to emails and a very kind person."
66288,18096211,2014-08-21,3571784,Megan,"This is like staying at a college student's small apartment for the night, but one where the host gives you clean sheets.  Nothing fancy, but Sean was easy to coordinate with and the place was easy to find.  And the price was right compared to other private rooms."
66288,18302203,2014-08-25,5865485,Gert,"Small but very efficient. Good bed, good bath, good desk & chair, good wifi. Location just around the corner from the Green Line T stop (Brigham Circle) and Hubway Bike Scheme stand."

66288,19064320,2014-09-06,10403806,Hernan,"Las fotos no coinciden con lo que es hoy el apartamento, creo que es un engaño decir que las fotos que estan publicadas son verificadas por Airbnb porque hoy el apt está bastante deteriorado (si alguien desea le puedo enviar fotos actuales). No está sucio pero es una pocilga con mucho deterioro en paredes, pisos, baño ( hay goteras en el cielorraso que están tapadas con paños femeninos!!!! tengo fotos de esto!!!). el agua apenas sale tibia, la cama no es para nada confortable y además es muy pequeña para dos personas, las sábanas y frazadas bien lavadas pero muy manchadas, lo mismo que las toallas. En fin creo que el dueño debería gastarse unos dólares y acomodarlo porque publicarlo de esta forma es un a engaño ( o sino cambiar las fotos y poner unas actuales). Nosotros tuvimos la suerte de viajar mucho por el mundo y esta fue la primer y última experiencia con Airbnb porque creo que deberian dejar cargar fotos actuales como lo deja hacer tripadvisor."
"La conexión con el metro es buena y el vecindario tambien. \"",,,,,
66288,19258412,2014-09-09,13041737,Tiffani,"This was a steal for the price we paid. Sean was truly wonderful. He allowed us to check in early in order to drop our bags and explore the town. The location of his studio was perfect for our long weekend. Once we figured out the trains, we were just a stones throw away from one of the stops. The room was perfect. It was quite warm while we were there, but the air in his studio was nothing less than perfect. Sean had superb communication and made us feel very comfortable."
66288,19325705,2014-09-10,19588696,Daria,Good price for apartment. We slept there 3 person and it was okey. Good neighborhood. I recomend this host.
66288,19516450,2014-09-14,5519976,Paola,"Non abbiamo avuto modo di incontrare personalmente Sean che ha comunque provveduto a farci trovare le chiavi ed ad essere contattabile in caso di necessità. Posizione comoda anche se non centralissima, vista la vicinanza alla metropolitana. In zona ci sono comunque diversi negozi e baretti. Posto piccolo ma funzionale per due persone. Buon rapporto qualità-prezzo."

66288,20118906,2014-09-23,21289465,Hannah,"Sean was a perfect host. His apartment was exactly as described in the listing, with little surprises like shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom, clean extra towels and a big comfy bed. My boyfriend and I were thrilled to be able to spend the night in Boston so cheaply in such a cute little apartment. Sean was endlessly kind, patient and understanding. He picked up my call every time, answered all questions we had and was just all around 100% helpful and awesome with not only finding our way into Boston, but also how to park and get to the apartment. Thank you so much for making our trip a great one!"
66288,20244312,2014-09-26,20533682,Pierre,We stayed 3 nights at the studio and there are so many things to say..
this studio does not meet basic standards of cleanliness and safety,Airbnb should not allow to rent such a place. The low price can not justify it! That was easy to get the keys,probably the only good point of this Airbnb (with the location,close to subway station). The rest was UNACCEPTABLE,and we contacted Airbnb to let them know,the pictures were taken probably many years ago
MAIN ROOM:,,,,,
- 1st day,we saw a cockroach on the floor (even if the building is old),that is not possible !!,,,
- wall lamp in the room is broken (not like in the picture).,,,,,
- the studio is old but the main problem is the level of disrepair,dirtiness (water splash on the door of the bathroom),"and safety (electrical outlet where it's written \"\"do not unplug\"\"",why ??),,
- I m not going to detail everything (old computer on the floor that takes place for nothing,foam insulation on the wall,etc),,,
- kitchen and bath are dirty and outdated,,,,,
- ceiling lamp with visible wires (very dangerous!),,,,,
- the fridge was not emptied by previous renters,,,,,
Bathroom:,,,,,
- broken ventilation in the bathroom is very dusty but still works (really unsafe),,,,,
- there is some mold on the bathroom's ceinling and some sanitary napkins to contain it !!! (this is more than dirty !!!),,,,,
For sure we were expecting a small and basic studio (as the pictures are showing) but not such an unhealthy place. This is unacceptable,,,,,

66288,20491979,2014-09-30,16989925,Michael,"Communication with Sean was very good and helpful, we did not have any problems to find the apartment and get into it. The Apartment itself was disappointing: extremely small and run down and somewhat shabby, especially the bathroom. Bed is very uncomfortable and too small for two. The photos are very well made... And one needs earplugs as the busy street is very close and the neighbourhood is loud."
Good: Towels,"conveniently located and the breakfast place around the corner.\"",,,,

66288,21440571,2014-10-17,22179949,Daniel,"I had a very poor experience with the apartment and the host. This listing has great reviews, so perhaps the host was a bit off of his game. Whatever the case, here's my experience:"
The apartment: The photos on airbnb show an inviting and clean if not small studio. In person,I found a cluttered room that had clearly not been cleaned in some time. There were food crumbs on the floor,and the bed unmade with apparently dirty sheets.,,,
The host: Sean initially confirmed the reservation very quickly,but when I needed information about getting the key and checking in,I couldn't get a response. I finally made contact mid afternoon of the day of my reservation. When I was finally able to drop off my luggage,I had no time to track down Sean to find out why the apartment was in poor condition. I didn't stay the night and had to find other accommodation.,,
Sean was defensive and unprofessional when I confronted him via email. He refused to offer a refund. Luckily a Airbnb representative was able to intervene. Ironically,Sean was very quick to write up my review,even before I had a chance to formally ask for a refund.  So,"at least you can be assured Sean can be responsive when he feels motivated.\"",,
66288,21571834,2014-10-19,18988506,Ramzey,Everything was great. Would definately stay there again
66288,21646759,2014-10-20,10110794,Philip,Apartment was great for just me. It is a small space but very convenient and well done. I didn't notice any real city noise with the windows closed.  I think it's exactly as described and in a good location.
66288,21695256,2014-10-21,22671248,Deb,"I had to fly to Boston for a medical emergency. Sean responded to my accommodation request immediately and, in fact, responded to all my communications quickly. I really appreciated not having to worry about where I was staying so that I could attend to my daughter. I wouldn't hesitate to stay in his place again"
66288,21741562,2014-10-23,18265902,Katie,"Sean was quick to respond to messages. I loved how close it was to transportation, which was around the corner. The apartment was also near good restaurant and coffee shops."
66288,22012281,2014-10-28,16725825,Susan,This room was perfect for me.  I came to Boston to visit my daughter and this place is only a few blocks from her apartment.
It is exactly as billed.  It's an inexpensive alternative to very expensive hotels in Boston and conveniently located near the T.  An earlier reviewer described it best,it's like staying on the couch of a college student. I'd like to add it's better than that because you're sleeping on a comfy bed and you have your own bathroom! I could have stayed on my daughter's couch but didn't really want to share a bathroom with 4 girls or have to keep their hours.,,,,
This is a student neighborhood so there's a bit more street noise on Friday and Saturday nights.  But the building is very quiet.,,,,,
Sean was very attentive responding quickly every time I contacted him.,,,,,

66288,22093873,2014-10-29,3004859,Cathy & Ben,"This studio met our needs, parking was easy and it was close to many great food options. Sean responded quickly and we enjoyed our stay."
66288,22325963,2014-11-03,21256016,Ana,"The apartment was perfect for a short stay accommodation for the night. Pretty easy to locate and find street parking. If anyone is looking for a small simple space to stay in Boston, I'd definitely recommend it."
"Cheers!\"",,,,,
66288,22479562,2014-11-07,1805754,YImo,"Sean was a great host! Communicative, nice, accommodating, friendly."
The room was exactly as described. It's a cute little studio in a nice location in Boston a short walk away from the Brigham & Women's hospital,a perfect place to stay if you're interviewing at the hospital/medical school. The room was warm and clean,the bedding freshly laundered,"the bed was very comfortable. I would definitely stay there again if I'm ever in Boston and would recommend Sean's place to all my friends. \"",,
66288,22577387,2014-11-10,18696684,Nina,"Sean seems  to have a lot of places to rent out in Boston, but he is relatively responsive and was very patient when I had a hard time to try to open the key locker."
The location is good. But since it is pretty cheap to stay,you get what you pay for. The light is blinking so I had to go buy a new light bulb. The restroom is the part which I do not particularly like. There were no shampoo,body soap prepared. I have to admit I wasn't feeling comfortable to take shower there. But to be honest,if you pay less,don't expect more right?  I am not sure if I am the one who is picky or not.,
The internet is ok if you don't need watch videos on line. I was in Boston for Career Forum and it took me 2 hours to watch a 40 min company introduction video because of the slow connection. I was very frustrated but again whom I can blame?,,,,,
The room is not really clean but I had clean sheet,clean towels. I could not find the heater? so it was a little bit chilly during the night.,,,,
I think there is a lot of improvements can be done in that room but again I only paid that little money to stay. I didn't expect much but if you care about cleanliness and comfort,I recommend you to pay more for a better place.,,,,
But I have to say Sean is a good guy. Since I forgot my charger in his house,he shipped it to me with express shipping. I really appreciate him doing that for me.,,,,
I think for me,"he just really needs to hire one guy to clean the whole place once thoroughly. \"",,,,
66288,22763482,2014-11-14,1231416,Annie,Sean was very accommodating of my early arrival and departure. Our path's never crossed but he was always very responsive by text and email. The room was great and just what I needed for my trip. Easy access to the T (green line to Heath St) which was nice.
66288,22829201,2014-11-16,3885793,David,"Communication/logistics were easy and smooth; studio was pretty much exactly as advertised. Saved me nearly 300 dollars for two nights compared to a hotel. I might advise light sleepers to bring earplugs, as the street noise (which wasn't too bad, given the location) came through pretty well, but this wasn't an issue for me. Excellent deal, would gladly stay again."
66288,22978894,2014-11-19,21030181,Moe271183,"Nice stay in Boston, everything was fine. The Sean's condo was little but generous. Very close to the subway. Quite. We enjoy our stay in Boston. Wonderful town...this place was a part of our fabulous trip. Thanks again"
66288,23247188,2014-11-26,6746195,Jared,"I stayed at Sean's apartment for only 1 night with my girlfriend but it was perfect for what we were looking for. Sean wasn't there, we just picked up the key from a lockbox and returned it the next morning--easy! The apartment is what you'd expect for the price- full bed, small kitchen, hot shower, etc. The location was great as well, T was 2 blocks away and bus stops right outside the door. All in all, reliable host and good apartment for quick stays."
66288,23316360,2014-11-28,18050791,Nesim,Spot was fine for a place to stay at night. Don't park right in front of the house or you will get a ticket. Very warm room which was nice. Smart set up with the drop box.
66288,23348229,2014-11-29,16401498,Nikita,Sean is a very good host. We had an amazing stay at Boston.
66288,23433601,2014-12-01,671843,Anuradha,Sean gave us precise instructions and was available for questions. It was my mistake that I messed up the instructions but Sean was patient and very helpful. His studio apartment was sufficient and cosy. He had thoughtfully stocked his kitchen and bathroom for us which was much appreciated.
66288,23643458,2014-12-07,23307111,Rachel,"Sean was very helpful and attentive to our needs and our trip! He kept in touch regularly when we were set to arrive, which was really helpful. The apartment was perfect for two people and in a GREAT location--access to the T was across the street, lots to do around the apartment also. Felt like a safe location, lots of people around, nice neighbors as well."

66288,23916813,2014-12-14,24050661,Hailiu,Sean was very professional and attentive to my needs.  Everything went with my stay smoothly.  The room was small but very well kept and had everything I needed.  I would definitely stay here again.
66288,24028229,2014-12-17,21026110,Ploywaen,"Sean was very quick to respond. Instructions were very clear, and although he wasn't there in the beginning, we simply picked up the key in a lockbox nearby and admitted ourselves. The neighborhood is nice, hipster-y, feels safe at night, and the T green line is right at the corner. It takes at most 30 minutes to go downtown from there. There are convenience stores and coffee shops nearby. The room itself is small, perfect for at most two people willing to share a bed. The kitchen area was clean. The pictures are mostly accurate, but look newer (and brighter) than the actual room. The bathroom was our only (small) issue; it was kind of old and deviates a bit from what you see in the picture, but at this price it was still a deal."
"Another big thing: the room was very warm while we stayed there in the winter. That was a pleasant surprise. Bedding is provided and is very clean.\"",,,,,
66288,24151505,2014-12-21,18746449,Cody,"Great stay! I had been planning my trip for awhile and Sean was available for contact before and during my stay. Smooth, easy, and fun stay with a great host!"
66288,24261065,2014-12-24,21140161,Tim,Very pleasant stay in Sean's comfortable little studio. It is conveniently located 2 mins away from the tram / underground which will get you downtown in 15 mns.

66288,24695304,2015-01-01,18607361,Frank (And Meridith),A clean little room with fridge and stove at hand (especially useful with the nearby grocery store). This room is set up to rent with no contact necessary; I'll have to remember this option when I'm in Boston and the hour is late.
66288,24997726,2015-01-04,7503479,Nina,We had a really easy and comfortable experience staying here. Sean gave us easy instructions and was easy to get in touch with. Thank you!

66288,26411016,2015-02-11,7323140,Edgar,Sean was very hospitable due to my unforeseeable circumstance after my flight was canceled. His studio is an excellent choice for a quick one night stay and his communication throughout the time was excellent.
66288,26606584,2015-02-16,5029515,Justin,"The neighborhood surrounding this apartment is filled with restaurants, bars, cafe's etc. You won't have a hard time finding stuff to do, although I did find prices to be fairly expensive. Even in the extreme cold and snow, there were always people out, which I liked. Reminded me of college. The room itself was just as described and was good enough for me and my girlfriend to crash. Well worth the price and recommend for someone low maintenance just looking for a cheap place to stay."
66288,26726927,2015-02-17,19192006,Davram,As advertised.  Nice little place in a good area.  Nothing to complain about!
66288,26742114,2015-02-18,10781562,Chris,"While affordable, you will make concessions stay in this studio. The bathroom needs a deep cleaning. The sink needs repair (it drips and previous guests have Macgyver'd a sponge to dampen the noise). The beautiful looking drafting table wasn't there when I stayed. The host interrupted me in the middle of my stay and asked if I wanted clean sheets... I would have appreciated a message beforehand that he would not have an opportunity to clean the studio before my arrival, and to expect him."
66288,26987350,2015-02-23,23915501,Mihaela,"\"This listing was not accurate, except the location; I do not recommend this place. The place has not been cleaned in a really long time, everything is dusty and rusty. The faucet in the bathroom is leaking continuosly (for at least the last 9 months according to other reviews), and one of the elements on the stove is not functioning. Yes, the place has a great location right next to public transportation. As expected, the place was small, which didn't bother us, but the cleanliness did. Check in says 1 pm, with most of the time during school sheets being changed by 3 pm, I check in at 4 pm and place still had trash from the previous person and sheets were not changed. When I texted Sean to confirm that check in was 1 pm and I wanted to nap, since I was on the road since 4 am, I was told that using the word \"\"disgusting\"\" to lay on other people's sheets was an exagerration and he proceeded to ask me \"\"How many times I change my sheets per week at home\"\". I thought that was a very rude comment. Also"

66288,27397877,2015-03-03,3329997,Brittany,"I hate to leave a negative review, but after many Airbnb experiences, this one left a bit to be desired. The entrance key was not left behind for me; the previous guests hadn’t left it as they should have, but the host hadn’t ensured it was there, which wasn't the best way to welcome a guest if anything goes wrong. In the end, I waited an hour and a half outside the building, to the point that neighbors offered to let me in and asked if I was ok. I would have gone for a coffee or lunch to avoid loitering, but Sean told me he was coming shortly.  I had very little time to spend in Boston, and though Sean responded fairly quickly, he didn’t come for an hour. While Sean seemed like a nice, laid-back guy who tried to accommodate me and did apologize (a little), he seemed somewhat oblivious to the fact that this was kind of a big bummer and really threw my plans off.  When I realized there was no key, I asked Sean to call me so we could sort it all that way quickly, but he only texted and sent Airbnb messages, which wasn’t easy to handle in the cold on my phone , and I guess that made me feel like he was avoiding a conversation, which would have been reassuring. Upon entering the apartment late in the afternoon with him once he arrived (3pm, check in was about 1pm), I can’t lie; the place was pretty dirty, had an odor, and at that point I was a bit exasperated. To Sean’s credit, after I returned in the evening and he had changed the sheets and cleaned, it was better. (Sorry! As someone else mentioned, I think the place needs a deep clean and a bit of maintenance to be truly ready for guests--I understand the apartment is old and I don't care about that a bit, but that doesn't mean it can't be cleaned and maintained in a caring way, and I would feel a bit bad renting a place in this shape. It looks rougher than the pictures.) On the plus side: the apartment was the perfect temperature, it's conveniently located by the green line, the kitchenette is useful, wifi was fine, and Sean was really nice to bring a bike over for me that I felt badly I couldn't use in the end due to limited time and more snow. I get that things happen, and this is one way to do an Airbnb rental (minimal maintenance and a full guest list based on a good city location), but I would have appreciated a little more, “Sorry once again about the big hiccup getting in, I really apologize for that and will look into a better system so it doesn’t happen again!,” instead of him inquiring whether I’d returned the key (of course I did after my experience! :) )-- that would have gone a long way."
66288,27694386,2015-03-09,28629606,John,Very accommodating. A friend and I needed a place to stay when we visited Boston for PAX East and Sean was flexible enough in his schedule that even with all the activity during the day we were able to get into the apartment without much trouble at all.
66288,27783783,2015-03-11,7029160,Tin,Small studio about the size of a bedroom with a bathroom.  Reminded me of living in a college dorm.  The price was the main selling point and the area around the studio was good.  Plenty of places to eat nearby and close to a number of colleges as well as the train line.  The building is quite old and the walls are thin.  Might not be good for light sleepers as there is a bit of noise and the studio is near the subway.
Sean was nice and very easy to get a hold of for questions.  The lockbox was easy to use.  I arrived a bit early but was able to get in.  Sean was by the place around 3 to clean up.,,,,,
To sum it up,"it's a good cheap place to sleep for a night or two on a budget.  You'd have a hard time finding a place at this price in Boston.\"",,,,
66288,28049891,2015-03-16,29026730,Cynthia H.,"Sean was not at the location when I arrived despite having been called three times to alert him to the time of my arrival.  The key was not in the lockbox.  I waited in the cold rain for him to come with the key to let me in.  Upon entering the studio the previous tenant's used sheets and towels were in a pile on the bed.  Sean left me in the apartment while he went to the laundry in the basement to wash everything.  It was a good hour from the time I initially arrived outside until I was able to occupy the space.  It is, as I expected for the price, a spartan space, but it needs a thorough cleaning.  Sticky table, dusty lamp, dirty soap dish.  Sean warns of a leaky faucet in the bathroom, but it is more like a cascade of hot water pouring from the faucet.  Sean is a very nice man, however, and will rectify these problems for the next occupants, I hope."
66288,28179897,2015-03-19,25437920,Carrie,"We stayed at Sean's on St Patrick's Day and it was exactly as described and pictured.  He communicated well and made it very easy to check into his place.  The bed was definitely bigger in the picture and quite comfortable.  The apartment was incredibly quiet.  Unfortunately even on the second floor, the T was very loud by about 5:30 in the morning.  If you are sensitive to that sort of thing, you should bring earplugs.  My significant other did and it was a little easier for him to sleep.  We parked in a parking garage about a block down at the eye institute and it cost us $25 for the 24 hour stay.  This place was a great little place to crash while staying in Boston.  Thanks, Sean!"
66288,28462378,2015-03-24,24429949,Tony,Although we did not meet Sean he was always responsive to my txts and left clear instructions about access to the apartment.
The apartment is very central and has very good access to trains and buses.  There are plenty of good cafes and eating places very close and a good supermarket is just down the road.  The apartment is reasonably quiet at night but there is some noise from the nearby main road. This apartment is typical of student digs.,,,,,

I was only in Boston for one night, and admittedly didn't spend a lot of time in the studio as I was meeting friends for dinner, and then up early in the morning to head home, but the location and price were just right for my needs and I look forward to renting it again."
Sean was attentive and always gave a timely response to my messages. The lock box instructions were easy to follow,and while I was concerned about parking,"I easily found a spot just around the corner.  \"",,,
66288,29605138,2015-04-10,27335695,Philip,Staying here was great! It's clean and comfy. It had all I needed for my stay as well. Sean was easy to contact and he was very helpful! The place is one half of a block from the trains and busses and a block from convenience stores and restaurants. I would definitely ask to stay at Sean's again!
66288,30072259,2015-04-17,25556941,Erin,This studio is in a cool area of Boston called Mission Hill. It's surrounded by bars and places to eat. There's a light rail a 2 min walk away which takes you downtown and connects to other lines really easily. The apartment was clean and Sean was super helpful and clear. We had a great stay.
66288,30437113,2015-04-22,13564662,Ryan,"Sean was very helpful and responsive, and the apartment was cozy and clean. It was the perfect base for our short stay in Boston."
66288,31635378,2015-05-08,28567687,Stephen,"I stayed for several nights and the apartment was as advertised. It is a bit smaller than it appears in the pictures, but is perfectly functional. It may benefit from a deep cleaning, but having stayed in older apartments before I appreciate it can be very difficult to get them spotless. Overall, it was as expected. Picking up the key couldn't have been easier and I had no problems. The building itself was quiet. There was a fair amount of street noise, but it's a fine trade off to be so close to mass transit options. The neighborhood has some great bars within walking distance and I felt safe walking at night.  I didn't need to interact with Sean very much as access to the apartment was extremely easy and I had no issues, but the times I contacted him he was prompt and courteous with his replies. It was a good experience and I would recommend this place to friends in family who need an easy, no frills, affordable place to stay in the city."

66288,31872267,2015-05-11,7249728,Yujin,Sean was very responsive via text message.
The instruction to get the key and enter the studio was very clear and worked well.,,,,,
The location was great,very close to the T station and a lot of stores for food/water etc.,,,,
The studio was very cozy and it wasn't too bad,but I couldn't sleep well due to noises outside.,,,,
It was very loud since I’m guessing the windows are old,you could hear everything very loudly…cars passing,people talking etc.,,,
But all in all it was a good experience for the affordable price.,,,,,

66288,32022915,2015-05-12,27898763,Vibe,"Everything was as described - basic but functional. Bathroom was clean and tidy. There was a little trouble with the internet, but Sean was fast in responding - and made sure this was fixed fast! there is plenty of restaurants in the area - it was perfect for my purpose of staying a day for a meeting. Close to transport and parks."
66288,32090579,2015-05-13,31600531,Jonathan,"Sean's place was adequate for the one or two days I was staying in Boston. Sean was very accommodating and easy to reach, but place is a bit cramped and located in an old building. All the amenities were old as well, but if you only need a bed to sleep in, this is the place; for the price, you can't really ask for much more. It's located in an active neighborhood, close to tons of transportation so you'll be able to get to wherever you need to go. Don't expect any frills, and to Sean's credit, he doesn't advertise it as such."
66288,32131330,2015-05-14,24308459,Samuel,The studio was perfect for a short overnight stay in Boston. Very clean and cozy. Sean was very easy to contact and welcoming of questions. Would highly recommend :)

66288,32469658,2015-05-18,6028811,Seb,We hesitated a lot before writing this comment because we fand Sean really nice and kind: we met him upon our arrival as he was finishing preparing our flat. The bed sheets and towels have been changed. The first impression of the flat was that we have been trapped!!!
The appartment is definitly is a very bad shape and shall be completly refurbished: questionnable electrical installation (cables repaired with band,...),broken stores,ceiling in the bathroom almost falling down,ventilator in the bathroom also broken. The bed was even funny : the feet are composed of 2 superimposed shoe pairs on one side and a rechargeable battery on the other (!). But okay,what do you expect for this price ? This was indeed not was shocked us with this flat.
The worst part was the dirt. And even for such a price you can expect the flat to be cleaned !!! The floor was full of dust and of hairs (different sizes and colors so it was probably not only from the former guest unless they've lived with 5 people here).,,,,,
The bathroom was covered with moisture,the electrical plate and the oven were black with dirt,the fridge had brown motives made of a fluid which one fell on it,the walls and the doors were covered with traces of liquid which made flowing motives when drying. We tried to clean the dust from the table to check if it had just not been cleaned for one or two days: it was actually fixed by months or years of quiet sedimentation...,,
Clear NO GO,"even for the price!\"",,,,

"Don't go there...\"",,,,,
66288,33893565,2015-06-02,25966061,David,The location was a short walk from the green line and a clean grocery store which is great.  The neighborhood was reasonably safe and the rail is mostly used by students in this area.  For the low cost this space met our needs but be prepared for more of a hostel type experience.  Again for the cost this is to be expected but the room could definitely have been cleaner and I was glad that we brought our own sheets.
66288,34396291,2015-06-08,24531180,Fang-Pei,"Sean provided very detailed instruction about everything I needed to know for my stay (his house manual was a must read!) and he was very accommodating. Because I had a long stay, it was a really nice plus that there was a supermarket just a block away from the place."
66288,34780834,2015-06-12,1858630,Rosen,"We didn't get the chance to meet Sean, but he was very responsive over e-mail before and during the stay. It is an older studio apartment, a small and very modest place, but is conveniently located and on both the Green line and multiple bus routes.  We also noticed that Sean did his best to make sure the place was clean and fully stocked.  It's a perfect size for one or two budget travelers.  Check-in and check-out were very easy."
66288,35195337,2015-06-16,7260764,Mieke,"We didn't meet Sean, but he was answered our questions very quick and he was very friendly. The appartment was small and a bit dusty. We found the bed very soft and uncomfortable. Location however was perfect, close to the hubway bike station and other public transport."
66288,35406498,2015-06-18,21217246,Emily,"The location of the studio is right next to the T so it was very convenient for me. As previously mentioned, it is very small but that didn't bother me since I was out most of the day and only slept here."
66288,35873162,2015-06-22,22245962,Nathalie,"Sean's tiny studio apartment was perfect for our needs! We just needed a place to crash and this was definitely it. We enjoyed the privacy. I also don't quite understand complaints about the bed - we found it very comfy. Also the location is really nice, there is a T right around the corner, plus grocery and liquor stores, bars and restaurants within a 5 minutes walking distance."
"Probably not so good for a longer stay but perfect for one night or two!\"",,,,,
66288,36083861,2015-06-25,66333,Yvette,"The neighborhood felt perfectly safe.  The studio is very close to a Metro stop, so it was really easy to get anywhere we wanted to go.  The bedding looked/felt brand new and was very comfy after long days of walking all over Boston.  The place is quite small, but all we really needed was a bed, so it was fine!"

66288,38368289,2015-07-15,27286391,Caitlin,"Sean made sure we had all the info we needed before we arrived in Boston. The studio is pocket-sized and cheery, and in a lovely neighbourhood - it's close to transit and some amazing restaurants and bars, plus museums and galleries."

Pros: The place was overall clean. The location is very convenient and close to the Green Line and many shops. The fridge and the microwave oven worked properly.,,,,,
"Cons: The studio is small and the facilities inside seemed quite old. The faucet in the bathroom could not be closed tightly. The sound of dribbling of water was annoying and it was quite a waste of water. (I have known this from the host manual beforehand but could not understand why Sean did not fix it.) The location is too close to Huntington Ave and the noise at night was horrible. The air conditioner did not seem to work properly and was quite noisy. Interestingly we managed to use the noise of the air conditioner as \"\"white noise\"\" to cover the noise from outside so that we had a better sleep at night...",,,,,
"You got what you paid for. \"",,,,,
66288,38990784,2015-07-20,30780980,Ariana,The studio is as described. It's a great place to stay for 1 or 2 people just looking for somewhere to sleep and shower. Great location that made it easy to get to different parts of the city.
66288,40197158,2015-07-29,15085109,Robert,"Never met host but easy to get key. It was a great location and wifi, adequate but basic and fair for the price. But Sean you have to fix the leak in the bathroom sink, just a washer, and defrost the refrigerator. You are wasting a lot of water and electricity."
66288,41321270,2015-08-07,144271,Dave,"\"Avoid this place. It felt like a very run down dorm room in a dirty building. The air conditioning cooled the room but the ball bearings are going so it made loud screeching noises periodically throughout the night. Thankfully I had ear plugs along. The bed \"\"frame\"\" is made with 4 2x4/s holding up the sagging mattress. The sink is not just leaky it is constantly on (hot at that) - an example of what is wrong with this place. This place was steps below the worst motel I have ever stayed in.  I also am bothered by staying in places where after paying I get informed that I should not let anyone in the place know that I am with airbnb - we were afraid the manager"
66288,41426127,2015-08-07,3084100,Kate,Convenient to public transportation and Sean was very responsive to messages. Apartment was a little lacking in cleanliness and basic items such as hand soap in the bathroom.

Appartamento pulito e ordinato. Unica nota negativa: l'appartamento è molto piccolo e  piuttosto vecchio e malmesso. Noi abbiamo soggiornato con una bimba di un anno e non era proprio il massimo della sicurezza (prese con cavi a vista molto usurati, letto che pur essendo stabile poggia su delle ciabatte di gomma). Se non si guardano queste cose l'appartamento è perfetto, molto comodo perché esattamente sopra la fermata della green Line dei treni che portano in centro."

The train stops literally down the block and that is so important after exploring all day. My boyfriend and I stayed here for 5 days and we looked forward to coming back 'home' every day. The room is small, but comfy and all the space is utilized in the best way possible. I had one question for Sean and when I called he responded super quickly and I had no issue at all! Totally recommend!"
66288,43054803,2015-08-17,19861869,Jen,"I didn't meet Sean in person, but he was responsive and helpful by email, text, and phone when I had questions (and gracious about the ones that I wouldn't have had to ask if I'd read the house manual more carefully). Everything was as advertised."
The location was good: just two blocks away from the Brigham Circle stop on the Green line E branch,and a number of restaurants nearby.,,,,
The place itself was fine: think older student housing. If you like everything pristine,this probably isn't the place for you. If you're not picky about older fixtures and construction,"this is a great deal.\"",,,

The apartment was as described and also rare find at this cost value for the city location.  Very simple space, nothing fancy, but a great location for anyone spending time in the city. Everything you need was in super short walking distance, coffee, train, food etc. Exactly what we were looking for. Also free street parking on weekends. Bonus!  No complaints for a simple space for me to rest my head at night!  Thanks so much and would book again."

I had no problems getting to his studio in the Mission Hill neighborhood, so I really appreciated the timely and accurate communication on Sean's part. The detailed house manual he provided was also helpful."

Sean communicated promptly and I did not have any trouble finding this place or the keys. It's very conveniently located to the Green line subway/light rail.
The biggest advantages about Sean's place for me were its location,price,and the fact that it is a standalone unit as opposed to just a room. The description of the unit was accurate and the pictures will give you an idea of the size. It was suitable for one person and the bed was quite comfortable. As I was staying for several weeks,it was good that this unit was within a 2 minute walk from groceries and had on-site laundry.,,
"There is some street noise but I'm a good sleeper so it didn't bother me. There are deficiencies that have been noted in previous reviews such as dripping faucets (need to keep bathroom door closed to reduce the noise). One of the blinds also need to be replaced.  The building is fairly old so don't expect a shiny new place. Overall for me though the pros outweighed the cons and it was a pleasant stay.\"",,,,,

I was very dissatisfied with the apartment. The faucet continuously drips interfering with sleep. The place is generally not clean including small flying insects. I wonder when the bed covering was last washed.  I was struck at how little cleaning was done between tenants. There are missing covers on smoke detectors and fans. Tape on wires. There is mold on the patched up tile in the bathroom. There is not one comfortable seat in the place. It is noisy--ambulances,subway,auto horns (also making sleep difficult). The building is generally run down and poorly cared for.,,,

We did not meet Sean himself, but there were no issues with letting ourselves in, and he was great with answering our queries via email. We found the apartment in a clean condition when we arrived. The neighborhood is really nice, with several shops and eateries, and appeared to be quite safe. There were a lot of supplies (tea, coffee, milk etc) kept in the fridge and the kitchen cabinets. The only major issue in the apartment really is the bathroom faucet, which is leaking quite profusely.

The tap in the bathroom leaks constantly and no matter how hard you turn it,it doesn't stop. The bathroom is also rather dirty and for some reason there a hole in the ceiling where a fan should be.,,,,
The bed is uncomfortable and difficult to sleep in,probably because flip flops are balancing it,the pillows aren't any better.,,,
On top of the bed being useless the road outside is quite loud so sleeping is difficult unless you're a heavy sleeper.

The wifi was fast and easy to connect to which was essential for me to work from the studio. Overall, the studio was clean and tidy; I found everything I needed. There were a few little quarks that come with any older apartment, like a leaky faucet, but nothing that would prevent me from renting the studio again the future."

66288,70184186,2016-04-16,64585125,Miguel Angel,"Sean was very cordial and friendly. Getting the keys was easy and the instructions were spot on. Just happened to run into him as I arrived in the late afternoon and had a nice chat.  The apartment was clean and cozy and as described.  Bed was comfortable.  The location couldn't be beat.  2minutes from the train and the neighborhood had all amenities you could ask for in walking distance, including grocery stores, convenience stores, and restaurants.  Area is close to a few colleges and art schools."
66288,70542989,2016-04-18,16467951,Caroline,Instructions to get there and get the keys were easy and I found free parking for the weekend so that was very good.  The host answered my questions quickly and was very nice.
I got a bit discouraged when I got in the apartment.   The kitchen was not cleaned,the faucet was constantly leaking (even if valve was turned off),"and no hot water so difficult to clean the dishes.  The room is very small so I find there are too many things...a lot of wires all over the place...papers.  It has potential but needs a little bit of revamping.\"",,,
66288,70965685,2016-04-22,23496239,Matt,Enjoyed my stay. Sean provided clear instructions and everything went smoothly. It is a great value for money with an unbeatable location near to the T stop. I would come back and stay there again when i am back in Boston
66288,71507820,2016-04-25,37480246,Frederique,"My husband and I stayed 4 days, 3 nights in Boston."
Negative aspects of the flat:,,,,,
- Lack of soundproof windows: The noise from the street woke us up many times each night,no matter we had the windows open or closed,,,,
- Old building and a lot of fixing is needed in the appartement (including vent in bathroom,main room lightning,DIY bed etc.),,,
- the kitchen needed a few more items such as a second drinking glass,,,,,
- the housework can be improved,,,,,
Positive aspects of the flat:,,,,,
- Lots of restaurants and stores nearby,,,,,
- Transit just around the corner,,,,,
- Sean was responsive to our questions,,,,,
- his explanation to arrive to the flat was clear,,,,,
- we found jam,milk,bread and butter ready to use in the fridge.,,,
- there was useful info pinned to the wall including a map of Boston.,,,,,
All in all a great stay,but the flat itself needs a big renovation.,,,,
"I would recommend it if you do not mind the aspect and comfort.\"",,,,,
66288,72465971,2016-05-02,42962163,Tara,"This cozy studio was perfect for our stay! The directions to get into the apartment were clear and kind of fun, like a treasure hunt. It was also in such a great location, right on the bus and train line that allowed us to get to wherever we needed to go. And the restaurants around the area were amazing!"
66288,74324228,2016-05-14,55917094,Kate,The host did a great job of making us feel welcome and was always very quick to answer any questions we asked. The place was very clean and looked exactly like the photos. The neighborhood was great and very conveniently located by the green line which made getting anywhere we wanted to go very simple. I loved the apartment and would definitely visit again!
66288,74959971,2016-05-17,54689728,María Ines,"El apartamento de Sean se puede decir que necesita mejoras. No tuvimos inconvenientes con el anfitrion, salvo que el apartamento, ni la cama estaban listos cuando llegamos el dia convenido, a las 14 horas."
Hay detalles importantes a mejorar como la limpieza de la heladera,que deja un olor horrible en la habitación  cada vez que se abre.,,,,
Los zocalos muy desmejorados y muy desprolijo.,,,,,
La canilla de la ducha muy difícil de manejar,imposible de cerrar.,,,,
La persiana americana de una de las ventanas a la calle esta rota. Es  casi imposible bajarla para que no te vean se afuera.,,,,,
En general falta cuidado y limpieza en el apartamento,para que los huespedes esten mas a gusto.,,,,
El barrio es alejado,pero no nos pareció malo.,,,,
En general,"le recomendamos a Sean mejorar loa cuidados del apartamento.\"",,,,
66288,76344583,2016-05-26,49989795,Yaniv,"Awful. I think its the worst place i have ever stayed in. Really after being in india for three months, paying sometimes 2-3 dollars a night i cant remember such an awful place."
I'll explain: on the day we arrived sean told us to be patient because maybe he wont change the sheets by the check in (URL HIDDEN) why it is the check in time??,,,,,
There is absolutely no parking there if you are not a resident.,,,,,
The building is old and dirty and realy not nice. When we got inside the apartment there was a cat leaning on the door. Suffocating feeling inside.,,,,,
The apt is small,so small that i thought sean is a magician for taking pictures and making it look liveable. And if its so small why putting all this junk inside?,,,,
And it was dirty like no one cleaned it. Hair and dust balls got stuck in my leg,twice.,,,,
The bed is not really a bed just a bunch of broken strings. We woke up every day with a backache. I tried to sleep on the floor (after cleaning it) but there was no room,,,,,
There was soap for cleaning your hands but i guess buying a new one is too expensive so why not fill it with water?,,,,,
The leak in the bathroom,just fix it,the sound of it with the overall atmosphere made me feel like a horror movie..,,,
The vent is broken and the dirt on it is just disgusting,take a swab and send to harvard microbiology test,,,,
Ohh,but there is a drawing on the wall so its an architecht's studio..,,,,
The neighborhood is also not a nice one.,,,,,
The plus side for the place  - close to the train and a good wifi,,,,,
If you are a single young man with really no standarts you can come to this place otherwise do youself a favor and dont be tempted by the cheap price. Its really un-rentable and airbnb shouldnt let this place be rented. Go to the suburbs and take the train.,,,,,
"I should mention also that being so angry about this place we left it after half of the time. Screw the money. I have pictures and if anyone want i can send it\"",,,,,
66288,77062428,2016-05-30,6786067,Teresa,"The place looks a lot better in the photos, as a heads up. Honestly, it is a bit of a fire hazard with exposed sockets and something was going on with the fire alarm, if I recall correctly. I say this in case you are worried about that kind of thing, it is good to know."
The price was good,but I would probably lean towards a private room in someone else's place if I go back to Boston again. Sean had good communication at first...Then I asked about leaving my bags to just run in and pick up prior to a later flight,and he said he would check to see what time the next person would be checking in and it was a possibility. I then never heard back from him. To me,that is not a sign of a great host and the lack of flexibility rubbed me the wrong way-- at the very least,follow up with your guest. (We ended up taking our bags to a hotel and pretending we were guests there,in case you wanted to know what we ended up doing).
"\"",,,,,
66288,79293902,2016-06-12,29700099,Esra,"Sean was helpful, polite and and friendly. He was very fast answered any questions we asked."
Neighborhood was good. Very close to T stop green line and bus stop. Also there are good shopping center and restaurants.,,,,,
Flat was small and needs some improvements. Cleaning,kitchen stuffs,lightning,bed and windows could be better. It was lively but a bit noisy.,,
"Wifi was very good. \"",,,,,
66288,80377999,2016-06-17,1027926,Roberto,apartamento minúsculo.  Sem conforto. o forno elétrico é sujo  e velho. Não tinha toalhas no apartamento. Solicitamos e o anfitrião providenciou. A localização é boa.
66288,81026168,2016-06-20,36668027,Dominique,"We had a great time in Boston and staying at Sean's place. Although we never met Sean, he is very quick to reply to messages and check in and check out information was very clear and easy to understand. The room had fresh towels and sheets. We loved how close we were to the T. We would stay here again the next time we come up to Boston. It's perfect for 1-2 people :)"
66288,82664220,2016-06-28,4949125,Salla,"First, I don't mind if studio is small. It was, but I liked it. Neighborhood was quite noisy, but I've could have been lived with that, IF the apartment would have been looking like in a pictures."
There wasn't any carpet,nice lamps or stools. Pictures at the wall were dusty and wrinkled. There wasn't any coffee machine over the microwave as in pictures,just a dirty old toaster. We made our coffee with old-fashioned way with a pot. Every piece of furniture was old and ugly (not the nice oldies,just crappy),nothing like in the pictures. I don't get the pile of electric (internet-related?) machines under the table. Also the chairs were uncomfortable and unattractive.,
I don't need any luxury or spotless and dustless place to sleep. It was clean enough. But it was so depressing and unbecoming.,,,,,
Again: if the decoration would have been nicer and much more cosy,"the studio would been a good place to be and sleep few nights. \"",,,,
66288,83373914,2016-07-02,6111511,Kate,"Really great location, perfect for one or two people looking to explore Boston. Very small (as described), so great if you plan on spending most of the day sight seeing. Sean was a fantastic host."
66288,84155580,2016-07-05,5992682,Kirsten,The studio was exactly as advertised and exactly what we expected. We really enjoyed the neighborhood. There is great coffee (hard to find on the east coast) right around the corner and the green line was so so easy. Sean was responsive. This place is no-frills but it suited our needs for a place to sleep and leave our bags.
66288,84290422,2016-07-06,45689075,Kevin,"The place was just as described,a fine spot to check out the neighborhood from. Would stay again, check in and check out were a breeze and Sean was communicative."
66288,85211679,2016-07-10,49664813,Lisa,"Sean was great at communicating and recommendations for the area. Good location and close to public transport. just remember, you do get what you pay for."

66288,86115315,2016-07-15,52147125,Sharon,I loved this room. It's close to everything! I will say... I don't suggest a woman traveling alone and arriving at night take this room. I struggled to get the key out of the lock box and stood there for 20 minutes at night on this street alone fiddling with the lock.
Other than that,it was wonderful! Sean was responsive and even allowed me to stay longer when my work ran over.,,,,
Would stay again,"but would just arrive during the day. \"",,,,
66288,88019624,2016-07-22,59312818,Christine,Pros-
Wonderful neighbourhood,lively but safe with lots of local amenities and excellent transport links to downtown Boston. We loved the area!,,,,
It's basically clean- Sean changed the sheets and towels for us.,,,,,
Sean the host was very communicative and helpful. We had no problems accessing the property despite never seeing Sean face to face.,,,,,
Cons-,,,,,
This apartment is not for everybody. We were surprised how small it was and it could definitely use a refurb. The bed seems to be a composite of different pieces of wood propped up at one end by a trainer.,,,,,
Don't expect to self cater- the kitchen is a small sink/ hob/ microwave within the bedroom/ living space.,,,,,
As a young couple we did not have a problem staying here although it would be too much to say we loved it. Some travelers used to more refined accommodation may be disappointed and feel uncomfortable here.,,,,,
Another key problem is parking- there is absolutely none anywhere near. This is however a problem across Boston. We ended up parking in the Alewife multistory which Sean did advise.,,,,,
Conclusion-,,,,,
If you are a hardy traveler looking to safe money on a Boston stay this is absolutely fine. As the saying goes 'you get what you pay for'!,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
66288,88245567,2016-07-23,63506669,Kira,Sean's appartement was perfect for our first night in Boston. We reached it very easily from the airport. Everything was clean and it was easy to get in although we didn't meet Sean.
66288,91066820,2016-08-03,45981734,Ugo,"The apartment is really well located, with the subway down the street. However, it's really small. You barely have the space to cook and eat, especially if you leave your baggage and the floor. Cleanliness is far to be perfect, but if you are not a fussy person that's ok. Sean is really responsive in case of any problems. If you only want to sleep there, and hang out all the day that's fine."
66288,94677297,2016-08-16,87479787,Kimberly,"This place was pretty much what we expected and as described, and it fit our needs exactly. It is in a good location and close to the T. We had zero issues receiving the key from the lockbox, and Sean provided very clear instructions for access. It is a no-frills, simple place, but great value. We had a very early flight and had no issues with getting an Uber or returning the key."
It has a window AC unit,"but it cooled pretty quickly and we slept comfortably. The wireless was also reliable and fast (we watched Netflix without any issues).  \"",,,,
66288,95678687,2016-08-20,42189555,Halani,It was very much like the photo. Too my surprise though - the bed was bigger than I expected. The flat served all the purposes I needed: it was close to public transportation; close to shops and restaurants; easy for me to get to the Longwood Medical area where I was doing research.
Sean was very swift when responding to my questions and clear with his directions on how to get to the flat and enter it. I also felt that he was clear about his expectations of his guests. Additionally,one afternoon there was a glitch with wifi technology in the room and Sean was super helpful when coming by to sort it out for me.,,,,
Some other great things I would add: The AC worked well during a very hot and humid week; the water pressure in the shower was fantastic which was a pleasant surprise; the bed was comfy; the fridge kept my drinks incredibly cool and my food fresh - again - during a very hot and humid week.,,,,,
As I was only one person travelling,I found the studio to be just the right fit for my needs. It might be a bit cosy for two people but I think that depends more on how much luggage you have with you rather than it being about two bodies in the flat. Two people could sleep comfortably in the bed,I would think.,,,
"All in all it was positive experience for an affordable price. I was glad to have this option available to me.\"",,,,,

The apartment is very clean and modern just as it looks in the photos. The only negative thing was the hot water system isn't the best so showers have to be quick some times. Would stay again"

He has great house rules in place, it's super clean, has a full kitchen, backyard, and located in a unbelievable place in town. Upon arrival, Javier even went with me to show me different places I could park for free/legally and I lucked out and got a spot for free for my whole stay! He was also very accommodating with my emotional support dog and a great communicator when I had questions. To be honest, im not sure if I would stay anywhere else in Boston next time I come back!"

The townhouse is new, and very well kept and decorated, and the garage was a huge plus for me. There are a number of restaurants, bars, a supermarket and a gym within a few blocks of the house.  overall it was a great value for the money especially when you take into consideration the attached garage.  Parking at some hotels nearby can cost $30-$40 per night."
11787441,75578063,2016-05-22,55275637,John,Michael was a great host. We absolutely loved our stay. I can't tell you how great it was to have not only a parking space but a garage that we could keep our car in. The apartment was just beautiful. Very comfortable layout. We loved sitting out in the evening on the porch with a glass of wine enjoying the night air and the sounds of the neighborhood. Beautiful bedroom and bathroom. Location for us was terrific.  I had a medical meeting at the Seaport World Trade Center  - a nice 20 minute walk. Each morning I walked along Summer Street - I got to see a new cruise ship in port. Not far from the Quincy Market or much of the downtown activity. We will definitely consider going back in the future and staying at Michaels apartment!
4287989,37242418,2015-07-05,36866054,Darin,"For using air bnb for the first time, we were pleasantly surprised on how easy and affordable it was. David was an excellent host who was very caring and made us feel at home. The deck has an absolutely stunning view and the butcher shop on the corner was excellent. We highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a quick weekend getaway to Boston."

I never stayed at an AirBNB prior to this stay,so I wasn't sure what to expect.,,,,
The apartment was clean. Bed and couch were comfortable. Internet worked well. Dave kept in contact throughout our stay.,,,,,

First, I asked to check in late and that was fine, he even left a key out for me.  Then when I got to the apartment on a rainy weekend, he left me an umbrella, which turned out to be a life-saver because mine was too big to carry around."
His apartment was the perfect cozy place with a comfortable bed,a nice kitchen,and even a sizable living room.  Also,I have to say that the shower was amazing.  It was a simple tub shower but the pressure was intense and the water was hot (it reminded me of a time before there were EPA approved water restricting shower heads).  It's just one of those things that can make or break a trip.,,
"The best praise I can give Dave and his apartment are simply this...  The next time I'm in Boston I hope his place is available so I can stay again.  \"",,,,,

He checked in with me frequently and made sure I had everything I needed.

Don't expect much of a personal touch. This is definitely setup more as hotel-style accommodation, and I didn't interact with the host at all except once via text message. Perfect place to stay if you're visiting the city for an extended period of time or traveling for work."

4461613,45250474,2015-09-01,33793121,Ricky,"Let me start off by saying I was very happy with my stay. There was some confusion when I first checked in, however, as I had reserved Unit 13, and was put in Unit 8 without any explanation. After discussing it with Alicia, it ended up working in my favor because the unit I was in was actually bigger and nicer than the one I had reserved, but it would have been helpful to have been told right off the bat what was going on. I loved Unit 8, it was perfect for everything I needed, in a really fantastic location, great light, and great little quiet street it was on. Just read the listing thoroughly because things I had been used to having provided at Airbnbs were not provided here, ie: dish soap, handsoap, paper towels, sponges, any cleaning products whatsoever. Also it's a very late check in, at 4pm. Contacted Alicia telling her my flight would be getting in at 2, and I needed to get in then, she said I could get in, but it might not be clean. Luckily, my flight was delayed an hour, so by the time I got there, it was cleaned."
Wifi works fantastic. A/C was great. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Once again,this is for Unit 8,"I can't speak on Unit 13 which the review will be under. \"",,,

3068453,16374361,2014-07-26,235930,Colin,"Despite a few hiccups (see below) the apartment is nicely decorated in a great location. At first, given the smell and poorly maintained entrance to the building, you are positively surprised to see a clean, air-conditioned, well-equipped studio. Unfortunately the wifi worked only 1 of the 3 days I was there; Eddie was informed by text messages but he found no solution before I left."
There were a few organizational issues in getting the keys. After confirmation from Ahmed,I provided my exact arrival details from Europe. Ahmed responded quickly and told me his assistant,Eddie,would make sure I get the keys when I arrived. When I arrived at Boston airport,after a long long flight,I checked my Airbnb text messages but saw nothing. I had to turn on roaming and exchange several expensive phone calls with Eddie to organise my arrival and to get the keys. To make a long story short
With all the amazing tools to communicate that are provided by Airbnb,it's unfortunate that Ahmed does not use them,or let his assistant use them. Regardless the contact was friendly and courteous.,,,
Would I stay there again? Yes,"but only if I didn't find anywhere else to stay. \"",,,,

Sadly there was no coffee pot or tea pot and no mugs so we had to make do with a pan and soup bowls. The place itself was very nice although NO CABLE. There is a tv, but not cable which is stated that there is in the description, so we were disappointed. The neighborhood is nice and right in the middle of the theatre district, which is great. However, if you are moving and will have lots of luggage I do not recommend this place because there is no elevator and you must go up two steep and narrow set of stairs to get to the room. Overall it was a very enjoyable and fun stay, the place was nicely decorated and enjoyable. The best part was the prime location."
3068453,18846723,2014-09-01,7073966,Camilla,Eddie (Ahmed's assistent) was very nice and helpful (he carried 3 of our extra heavy suitcases to the apartment - so nice of him!)

3068453,19365898,2014-09-11,18595542,Andrew,"This apartment was located well within the theater district of Boston and worked well for my stay. It was clean, but that was the extent of the positive aspects."
The apartment was within a poorly kept building with lopsided stairwells above a pizza shop.  There was an incredible amount of noise related to construction beginning at 6 AM every morning during my stay.  Moreover,I was not able to check in at the agreed-upon time as the manager was busy elsewhere. This was not communicated to me and I was left waiting. No significant apology was made and while I was accommodated slightly with a temporary office,it would have been more ideal to actually be allowed to check in on time,not two hours later. Moreover,the bathroom was old,stained and decrepit with leaking toilet and shower faucet and the bed and furnishings were cheap IKEA materials that look way better in the photos.
All in all,"it was a convenient location and clean but otherwise lackluster with poor service.\"",,,,
3068453,19449410,2014-09-12,4544936,Nate,"Nice spot in great location downtown, checkin was a little late - satisfactory all in all."
3068453,19879930,2014-09-20,19627068,Ashley,"The location was great, right in the heart of Boston within walking distance to almost everything (and if walking isn't your thing the subway is very close too).  Ahmed's assistant, Eddie (very nice), checked us in and gave us a few tips about the area.  He was also easy to get a hold of and was able to fix a few issues we had with the wifi internet and heat quickly.  Overall this place is a good value for your money in downtown. However, it is in a very old building which shows its age upon entering (a little stinky and dirty). This is definitely a good alternative to staying in a pricey hotel but be ready to part with some of the amenities and comforts as well."

3068453,21549726,2014-10-19,22245529,Ani,Kind of clean. The hallways of the building smell terrible. Wouldn't recommend for the price. The guy who met me at the apartment was super cool though. Very easy to get the keys.

3068453,22467728,2014-11-07,12395027,Meghann,"The apartment was exactly as described in the AirBnB listing and by reviewers. The apartment is in a fun part of town and easily accessible to theaters, restaurants, and public transportation. I felt safe and secure. There was some construction pretty early in the building next door, not much you can do about it but just to note if you're planning to sleep in. The building isn't new but it is a pretty typical, older downtown walk up. There is an entire bathroom, the listing makes it sound as though there is only a half bath. Everything in the apartment was clean and cozy when I arrived. Eddie, owners assistant, was kind and courteous. I would stay here again! Thanks!"
3068453,22844361,2014-11-16,1752756,Ian,We had a very nice stay.  The person giving us the key was kind and on time.
The only criticism I have is the sheets weren't cleaned before our stay.   There was long hair on the sheets and pillow cases,so they clearly weren't washed.,,,,

I liked how quickly he responded to texts, making himself available even though our arrival was pretty late in the evening."
On the down side,the stairs were formidable and perhaps older folks should have a warning about this structural detail. Otherwise,"very enjoyable stay. Thanks.\"",,,
3068453,31492517,2015-05-05,12635540,Noreen,"Eddy, someone who works for the host was really wonderful. He met me on time with the keys to show me the apartment. The place was a little underwhelming - lots of random open holes in the ceiling but in general - great location and decently clean. After he left I noticed blood stains on the comforter - three large ones. He was back in two hours with new bedding (thank you!!) There's no sunlight in the apartment and the shower head didn't work at all, so I ended up having to essentially bucket shower (with a glass from the kitchen) twice since it wasn't fixed over the few days I stayed."
3068453,31807993,2015-05-10,23912675,Justin,Place was as advertised.
3068453,32082987,2015-05-13,30734544,James,Ahmed offered us a positive experience. He couldn't meet us himself but set up an arrangement for the landlord of the building to let us in. The building is old and the apartment was as described. The electrical is being updated but was is not a problem. The bathroom has yet to be renovated and is the only drawback. The location is super convenient to the park and beginning of the Freedom Trail. If you want shows it is in the heart of that district and just a few blocks from Boston's small Chinatown. We actually pulled our suitcases and walked from the Bus/Train station at Boston South which is only .6 miles away. The Panara Bread across the street was an added convenience.
3068453,32254263,2015-05-16,5314693,Laura,You could not find a more convenient location for a place to stay in Boston and really experience the city!  Ahmed has a very organized system for his guests and the apartment has all of the basics you could want.   I was there on a work trip and it was a very restful place to be.
3068453,32784788,2015-05-21,28019967,Heidi,"I didn't meet Ahmed but someone else was there to check us in and help us with everything. There is no elevator, it's a walk-up with 2 flights of stairs. Besides the lack of electric outlets, the stay was pleasant; place is clean and well organized. The location is great, a few steps from the Common and Newbury as well as the charming Beacon Hill. My family of three adults stayed comfortably."
3068453,33118532,2015-05-25,13181693,Monica,Host was good and welcoming. Listing description was accurate except the shower in bathroom tub. Neighborhood was decent.
3068453,33401861,2015-05-27,128371,Thomas,The staff is very accomodating and friendly. The apartment is simple but good value for that part of the city. Would stay there again if I had business in that part of Boston.
3068453,33705462,2015-05-31,8811177,John (Matt),"Great location. Eddy (Ahmed's assistant) was friendly and met me with the key soon after I arrived in town. The inside of the apartment was reasonably clean, but seemed to be undergoing some kind of renovation work with exposed holes in the ceilings and walls. As others have mentioned, the building's shared stairwell and hallways were a bit grubby, but fine for a couple of days."
3068453,34797458,2015-06-12,31588694,Erin,Didn't meet Ahmed but met his assistant Eddie was there to help me with check in. Eddie is very friendly!
The apartment is neatly decorated. It's in an old building,"with old bathroom but has everything you need. The picture is accurate in terms of the furniture and arrangements. \"",,,,
3068453,35172612,2015-06-15,21980471,Stephanie,"Ahmed's place is in the most perfect area of Boston. Minutes walk from the Boston Common, lots of restaurant, bars, theatres and subways very near by."
Ahmed's colleague Eddie met us outside the apartment,showed us in,and was really helpful giving us hints and tips on the city. He was really friendly.,,,
The studio is a great size for 2 people,a large room consisting of a comfy bed,seating area with TV,and basic kitchen. Then a separate bathroom. The decor is really nice and cosy too. The only slight negatives were that the apartment wasn't the cleanest we have stayed in,very dusty and just a general feeling of being rough around the edges. Also,a number of the plug sockets in the walls didn't work which was a little frustrating.
All in all,"a very convenient apartment in a great location but in need of a good spring clean.\"",,,,
3068453,37711834,2015-07-09,34577568,Don,"The experience was pretty good in terms of getting in and out.  The place is basic and simple.  The building itself needs more cleaning and cosmetic work in the common areas.  For the price point and location this place was ok, the location is close to the downtown area which would be the main reason to stay here.  The dwelling could use more lighting and the bathroom shower fixture needed a little tweaking to work however.  Also, getting to the unit is up two flights of stairs, so be aware.  If looking for no frills this place is ok, however if looking for compatible with Marriott Hotel basic, stay with the hotel.  Overall - Ok!"
3068453,39533116,2015-07-24,9107581,Alexandra,"The apartment was terrific, nicely decorated, very clean with everything we needed. We liked the set-up and it was great space. It was clearly newly renovated, which was nice."
The building itself was a little dingy and there are people that smoke in other apts. We couldn't smell it in the apt,just walking up the stairs.,,,,
Otherwise,"great stay. And great location!\"",,,,
3068453,40781808,2015-08-02,12844948,Massah,"I had a great stay at this location. As many have said before me, Eddie was fabulous! Meet me in the area and helped me carry my bags upstairs."
The location is great! Minutes’ walk to either the green line or the orange line stops. It took me about 20 minutes to get to Logan Airport using the T and by taxi it cost me about 21 bucks.,,,,,
I won’t lie walking into the building isn’t very thrilling. Exposed pipes,creaky stairs and fans in the hallways did make me feel like I was in an old New York City walk up. I won’t complain because when I got to the apartment I was satisfied.,,,,
Pros: The apartment is pretty large for a studio very clean and tidy. Bed is firm,comfortable & sturdy and as pictured in the ad. Comforter is pretty warm if you get chilly. TV worked and was super clear and high def.,had basic channels but I was barely there to really care what was on.  Great Location! Air conditioning and fan was so great and necessary in the summer. Sufficient amount of glassware and kitchen essentials. Plenty of space for storage.,,,
Neutral: The bathroom was small and as described not as renovated as the rest of the apartment. The water from the shower took a second or two to heat up but when it did get there it was nice warm/hot. Wifi was okay; Eddie was awesome quick to respond when I forgot the password.,,,,,
Cons: Very few outlets worked,specifically the ones in the kitchen where you are supposed to plug in the microwave. So don’t try to microwave anything because there were no outlets to plug the microwave in; at least in the kitchen but who wants to warm up their tea in the living room?.  Noisy at times (night and evening),construction literally outside of the entrance of the building; I had to sleep with TV to block out some of the city sounds.,,,
All in All I had a great stay,for Boston prices and the location I think it was decent. If you are looking for something fancy in this price range and that is this accessible… GOOD LUCK!,,,,
"\"",,,,,
3068453,41433387,2015-08-07,38516563,Madeline,"This is a great location and very well priced relative to hotels in the area. It's within walking distance to many neighborhoods and very easy to access transit. Eddie, the assistant, was on schedule to meet me with keys to the studio."
The unit itself is basic but meets the requirements for a few days in Boston. It could do with some additional lighting as natural light is minimal with only one window and the air conditioning isn't strong enough to provide much relief during a heat wave. The locks are not the best,but overall building security is ok. Both the building and the unit could use with a thorough cleaning.,,,,
Overall a good place to stay for a few days in Boston.,,,,,

3068453,51453872,2015-10-20,43888042,Juana Ines,The appartment was in very good conditions. It is near several interesting places. And not so far from the old part of the city neither the shopping places. The temperature of the appartment was apropiated but in the bathroom was cold. There is no heat there. The exchange of information and time of response was very good. One bad thing for me was that i arrived at 11 in the morning and i had to stay at one place with muy luggage up to 15 because they were cleaning the appartment. I would recomend Ahmed to other people and if i come back to Boston again i would contact him again for sure.

3068453,56253760,2015-12-11,41114417,Aaron,Ahmed was a professional host. He responded quickly to my questions and made the rental experience seamless. There was one issue with windows being installed in the building and a possible need to access the unit I was staying in. He advised me early and addressed my concern. He even offered to discount my price. As it turned out the window crew never made it to my unit. The unit definitely needs new windows so the next renters should have those. As for the unit it was exactly as described. It was well equipped and WIFI was fast. The building is 'OLD' but they are in the process of making renovations. It could have been cleaner in the hallways as trash is left for pick up there on the second floor. There are smokers in the building that hang in the front entrance. There was no smell in the unit but you would smell the cigarettes as you entered and exited on occasion. Otherwise the rental was good. The location is excellent. Very close to everything in downtown including transit and an easy ride to the airport. I have to emphasize that this is an OLD building but the price is fair and reflects that. I would rent this unit again.
3068453,56377129,2015-12-13,3806511,Nate,"Cozy little apartment just a few short blocks from The Orpheum Theater. Very clean and super comfy temperpedic-like bed. Convenient overnight parking garage right around the corner ($36). The bathroom although clean, definitely showed the building's age and left something to be desired if you are a picky traveler (small gaps in window, rust stains, cracking concrete, messy caulking)."

The place is a little hard to find, but Eddie (the person who was going to give us our keys) directed us to the right place.  The building itself is a bit run-down and smells like smoke in the stair well and hallways.  There is also no elevator, but the 3rd floor isn't too bad as long as your luggage isn't too heavy.  The room itself is very well decorated and home-y.  The bed was definitely comfortable and having a fridge was convenient.  The bathroom is definitely old, and had some hair and a few pieces of broken glass on the floor which threw me off a little, but my boyfriend and I got over it pretty quickly.  The location of this place is really the selling point!  Being so close to a T station makes getting around the entire city a breeze!

3068453,79407987,2016-06-12,30600405,Annie,The location of the apartment was great and perfect for the wedding we were attending. We could walk everywhere.
It was quiet and we didn't share any walls with other apartments. At least that we knew of because we never heard anyone else,which was nice. The bed was decent and all the pillows were down feathers,which was comfy.,,,
The description of the place reminded us that the apartment was an old building so we were prepared for that. However,the apartment was not very clean when we arrived. There was a giant hair ball in the bathroom. There was hair on the tub. There was hair on the floor in the kitchen. Under the bed was disgusting. There was sticky stuff on the floor by the bed.  It made you wonder and question what was actually clean,especially since we were charged a cleaning fee.,,,
We never actually met the host. He referred us to someone named Eddie. Who we also never met. He had someone else let us in the building. Then he sent us a message that asked us to be out at 11 when our check out was at noon. So we had to screen shot the air b n b agreement that said noon.,,,,,
It was a fine stay and $135/ a night in that area wasn't bad. Although the cleaning fee and service charge brought up the price to what another location would have been.,,,,,
I've stayed in Air BnB's across the world with incredible hosts,incredible cleanliness and have had above and beyond experiences.,,,,

Price reflected the age of the building and location. Being cheaper than a standard hotel in Boston,this had a trade off being the older property (which was well advertised in the listing) and location. The apartment itself was fairly dated,with a few cosmetic things (such as a box filling the windows next to the A/C,wafting smell of bacon from the pizza shop below,curtains which did not block out all light,floorboards which did not extend fully to the wall
Location was central to most things in Boston,which made getting around quite easy,however it was located in the middle of quite a few nightclubs and party spots,which attracted a few homeless locals to the area.,,
Ahmed was very easy to get in contact with,mostly responding within a few hours via the Airbnb app. His associate Eddie,who let us into the apartment,gave some good advice as well whilst he checked us in.,,
Overall,probably not worth the overall rating it currently has on Airbnb,"but a good stay overall and priced accurately given the points above.\"",,,
3068453,92824155,2016-08-10,37626200,Paul,"The large studio is very nice on the inside with a couch and a chair and the bed so it is like a one bedroom.  The bathroom is dated but it has good water pressure and constant temperature.  The air con unit keeps it very comfortable and the location is right in the heart of the theatre district with a short walk to the Common, to Copley, and to the Financial District.  The inside of the building getting to the studio is not pleasant.  This is not the fault of Ahmed but the owner of the building.  It is rustic and odorific.  But inside the studio you forget what right outside the door is like until you open the door.  Like two different worlds."

3068453,96004007,2016-08-21,20337357,Edward,"Location is great. Walkable to almost everything: the Commons, Chinatown for great food selection, the T, South Station, etc... You are situated between 2 bars and a karaoke bar (a great place to lose your voice) and a late night taqueria and pizza joint, so it gets pretty lively when all the bars close around 2p and everyone gravitates to a late night meal. But you don't hear any of it while in the studio. It was pretty quiet up there"
The studio itself is clean and comfortable. The unit is on the 3rd floor with no elevators,so expect 2 short flights of stairs if you have mobility issues.,,,,
The building manager who let me in was 30 mins late,so a slight ding on the rating for that. But when he did arrive/let me in,he was very friendly,"knowledgeable of the area and has great recommendations.\"",,
3068453,97016607,2016-08-25,19342459,Joëlle,"Ahmed's appartment is REALLY well located, very nicely decorated and the bed is comfortable. Unfortunately, we were really disapointed by its cleanliness. The walls, the couch and the kitchen sink were dirty and the shower curtains were really disgusting. I know this is an old building but I am able to distinguish the old from the dirty and poorly maintained. I'm sorry to have to write this but the cleanliness is an important factor for me. There is also a constant pizza and frying smell coming from the restaurant underneath, which can be a little annoying in the morning... Fortunately, the bed and the towels were clean and we only needed the appartment to sleep and take showers. Eddie (Ahmed's assistant) was nice and helpful. We had a nice time in Boston anyway and this appartment made us save money compared to a hotel room, but I think more attention should be given on the cleaning."
3068453,97341263,2016-08-27,58699683,Tatiana,Great host! Very acommodating
10051003,57956785,2015-12-30,39921483,Rebecca,"We had an awful experience with the Northeast host. First of all, we started trying to contact the host the day before our arrival to confirm the reservation and receive information on the check in process. We attempted to contact them via the Airbnb messenger, text, and phone call. We were an hour outside of Boston and had to contact Airbnb corporate for them to reach out to our host and alert them that we had been trying to contact them. Finally once Airbnb corporate contacted them they contacted us and had moved us to a different building than we booked and called it an 'upgrade'. Although the room was very clean and nice we had a huge issue with parking our vehicle. We asked prior to booking what the parking situation was and the host told us that parking was $10/night. This was a blatant lie and the result was ruining our entire vacation. Parking was in garages for a minimum $70 for a two night stay with zero access to our vehicle. When we contacted the host regarding this and seeking a solution they flat out ignored us and didn't contact us for the remainder of our trip. When we contacted them after our trip and expressed our issues they continued to ignore us and Airbnb was forced to step in and sort everything out. Do not stay with this host if you are hoping for proper customer service and communication, and also if you have a vehicle."
10051003,58670728,2016-01-03,51451912,Anna,The best thing was the beautiful balcony with an amazing view over Boston! We felt very comfortable and the service was good.

The hosts were accommodating and accessible, honest good ppl. The unit location is tough to beat. Most of the sights are only a 5-20m walk and there's a subway station only 4 minutes by foot. The bed was very comfortable."
8036024,46520895,2015-09-11,6357924,Leslie Ann,"Frank's place is very spacious and clean, not to mention, walking distance to EVERYTHING! I was only in town for two nights, but was able to see so much because I was so close to all the action! Parking is tricky in this area, so it's 1) perfect if you don't have a car and 2) ok if you do. There are many nearby lots that can keep your car overnight for a reasonable fee. In addition to having a perfect place to stay, Frank was a great host -- very responsive and accommodating! Will definitely stay here again next time I'm in town."
8036024,47086482,2015-09-15,42316602,Mary,"This was a wonderful place to stay. It accomodated four adults nicely. Beautiful apartment and great location. Frank was easy to work with leading up to the rental, which was lovely."

8036024,47391295,2015-09-18,42525338,Jack,"The apartment was nice and as advertised. Frank was very good and prompt in communicating. The apt is located on ground level, which I liked, and was easy to access. About a block or so from the Garden, which can be seen from the apartment. Within several block of amenities and restaurants. Faces a busier street, but wasn't overly noisy--and the bedroom is in the back part of the apt. There is meter parking on the street. There's a smaller parking garage several blocks out the door to the right, and then a half block to the right again before going on a bridge-like part of the street. King bed. I would stay there again if available."

The flat itself was very clean and high end furnished. The communication with Frank was very pleasant. He responded always very quick and was an excellent host.

The T was very conveniently located just several minutes away, and it’s easy to transfer to the train system. Frank was very prompt and courteous in his replies. Be aware that the apartment is located on a busy street and can be noisy for light sleepers.  Check-in is not until 2pm and there is no early storage of bags."
8036024,50716555,2015-10-13,45941957,Benjamin,We enjoyed our stay at the condo.  It was clean and well kept and was in a good central location to enjoy both daytime activities and night time entertainment in Boston.  The price was fair and a much better value than hotels in the area. I would recommend this to someone who was looking to explore Boston.
8036024,50864877,2015-10-15,18216515,Suchi,"Yes, it was better than expected. Neighborhood is 10-15 walk from action, it was perfect."

Its location felt safe and was ideal for our purpose. I contacted Frank because of some issues with the internet and TV. Even though it was on a weekend, he and his brother Dan, made sure it was working to my complete satisfaction within a reasonable time."

The Haymarket T station is diagonally across the street and you can see it from the front door of the apartment. The apartment was very clean. There were plenty of fresh sheets and towels. The king size bed is extremely comfortable. I am a frequent visitor of the Boston area, however this was my first experience utilizing Airbnb. It would be an honor to stay at Frank's place again as he is a true professional! He ensured that my trip was comfortable and convenient. I could only be so lucky that his place is available for my future travels to Boston! Frank, Thank you again for sharing your beautiful place:)"
8036024,54529941,2015-11-21,31917208,Drew,"Excellent property, everything was exactly as described, Frank was prompt with answering questions. Only issue was parking (mainly due to events happening at TD Center every night of my stay) being in the north end that should be expected. Comfy, clean, excellent location."
8036024,55252989,2015-11-29,20701335,Anna,"We loved our stay here! The location was terrific, close to TD Garden and historic sites--and we had great parking kharma, many times being able to find on street parking on the block. Highly recommend getting a Park Boston App to pay instead of searching for quarters. You can feed the meter from the comfort of Frank's place. The apartment itself is clean and stylish."
One downside which may not be one for some folks: while there was a television,there was no cable/local/sat.,,,,

8036024,56259837,2015-12-11,10161813,Nguyen,"Great place in a great location.  The place is as nice/even nicer than the photos suggest.  Spacious and clean, and a great bed.  Super easy check-in and check-out process makes it great for business travelers like myself who are not certain of their schedule because of work."
Very close to the North End and its endless restaurants.  Haymarket on Friday/Saturday is across the street,where you can buy very cheap produce to cook at home.  Otherwise,Boston Public Market has a plethora of dining options as well.,,,
Close to the T station for convenient transport around the city.  You can see the TD Garden from the door,so this would be an incredible place to stay for the basketball/hockey fan.,,,,
As others have mentioned,there is Amazon FireTV,but no basic cable/local TV.,,,

Great location in walking distance to almost every major attraction in Boston or at least transportation hubs.  Faults: When we arrived there the table top was broken, probably overlooked and not noticed from previous stay. Also, we could not find the remote for the Amazon firestick, and when we sought out info regarding this we did not get the answer to our problem. Overall, I would definitely stay here again as it is reasonably priced and in prime location for a fun weekend in Boston."

The apartment does what it says- and a bit more. It's clean,comfortable,well-located and well-outfitted. There are also a lot of small things that Frank has done to make the apartment more comfortable/useful that you might not notice right away. Example: the Harvard bed frame has cushions on the corners,so that in the unlikely event that you bump into them your shins will come away unscathed!,,

He clearly knows and loves his city very well and was able to provide some of the insider tips I was seeking. The location is great - Boston's North End has a very authentic and lively vibe that is great for those who aren't looking for a sterile, touristy neighborhood. We walked everywhere from this location, including all the way to Cambridge, Fenway Park, etc. The apartment was very spacious. The living area was nice and bright and the bedroom was an insomniac's dream - quiet and dark with an incredibly comfortable bed. The busy location wasn't a bother in terms of noise. I think it added to the charm and was part of what made the location so perfect. We spent very little time at the apartment because there was so much to see and do in the city but we were very happy to call this place \"\"home\"\" for a few days!\""

The apartment was clean, conveniently located, and true to the listing. The king bed was great, and we took advantage of the washer dryer. The apartment is on a busy main road, so you can expect some noise, but we didn't find it to be bothersome. If traveling with your own car, be prepared to search for limited (metered) on street parking, or to pay to park in a garage. The surrounding area is full of restaurants and nightlife, so it's a great place to come back to after exploring the neighborhood. Definitely would stay here again."

8036024,75633652,2016-05-22,55130497,Matt,Frank was great. I messaged him a couple times during our stay and he was pretty quick to get back with helpful answers. The listing was pretty accurate as well.
I feel like there were a couple pitfalls that bothered us though. First was the street outside. Boston drivers honk for anything and we heard traffic constantly. The second was the WiFi at this location. It was just absolutely terrible. I did a speed test and it was barely over 1 mb. Be prepared to wait an awful long time if you need to do anything online. Me and my wife had to take turns using it because it was so slow.,,,,,
"This was our first experience with Airbnb and was overall positive.\"",,,,,
8036024,76124255,2016-05-24,46550273,Daniel,Frank was an exceptional host!  His apartment was exactly what we expected from the photos. We will definitely be staying at your place next time we visit Boston.

The apartment was very comfortable,very clean,spacious.  Frank was very responsive prior to the arrival.  We didn't need his assistance while in Boston. His explanations were enough.,,,
Very recommended.,,,,,
Frank,"thanks!\"",,,,
8036024,78191122,2016-06-05,64934886,Lindsey,"Frank was an awesome host! My husband and I had never been to Boston before and his list of restaurants and things to do included in the home manual proved to be a very valuable resource. Additionally, Frank was quick to respond to any questions I had regarding our trip. His residence was easy to find, within walking distance to almost everything we wanted to see/do, and very clean and well-kept. I would definitely recommend staying at Frank's!"
8036024,79983949,2016-06-15,36309702,Annie,Frank's house was perfect. It was in fact better than it appears in the pictures and the location is unbeatable. You can walk to most attractions and the T is just a couple of mins away. If you re planning a visit to Boston this is the place to be. I have stayed in a few Airbnb places before but never felt I needed to leave a review but this stay was too good to not leave one
8036024,81249181,2016-06-21,59671199,Ian,"Detailed instructions regarding access to the apartment and all the necessary information about the apartment were provided well in advance, which is very imporant for overseas travellers. Wish the same could be said for other 'hosts'."

8036024,84725643,2016-07-08,68443754,Jim,"Frank's place in the North end of Boston is perfect place for those that like history, Italian food and within walking distance to the T station.  No car needed the entire trip."
The neighborhood is purely Italian with many excellent restaurants,diners,cafe's and pastry places.  It's within walking distance of the long wharf,Faneuil Hall,Quincy Market and many downtown spots.,
You enter the loft up a few steps on the first floor into the kitchen and living area.   The bath room is back a hall to the left along with a washer and dryer.  The bedroom is large with a very good mattress and another fold-away bed if needed.,,,,,
The loft is on a Main Street which can be noises at night but otherwise very nice.,,,,,

Location was perfect,we walked to everything,or to the T.. fell in love with the North End neighborhood..,,,
It was close to the street,but really didn't hear a lot of noise.. would gladly stay there again.,,,,
Our first experience with Airbnb,"and wouldn't hesitate to use it again...\"",,,,
8036024,87454285,2016-07-20,43576153,James,"Absolutely.  Everything was lovely, and perhaps it's most telling to say that the apartment looked *exactly* like what the photographs suggested it would.  Spotless, comfy, efficient.  You might think the location (busy road) would be noisy, but it is not; super-insulated windows.  And you're footsteps from some of the most charming, old-world-ish streets in the continental USA . . ."
8036024,88484965,2016-07-24,72876399,Terez,"Frank was so organized, easy to communicate with and had lots of tips etc!"

8036024,95515836,2016-08-20,84801580,Michelle And Dave,Perfect place to stay as you could truly walk everywhere. Nice large space and affordable compared to the hotels! Frank was attentive and quick to respond when we needed anything. Would recommend Frank anytime.
8036024,95643235,2016-08-20,53358700,Sang,Frank's home was absolutely amazing. Very simple to check in and the interior was beautiful. Everything is as it is portrayed in the pictures provided. The location was perfect as it was walking distance to so many different restaurants and places to see. Your best bet for parking is a garage right up the street because it is very difficult to find street parking but it is totally worth it.
"I cannot recommend Frank's home enough. Definitely would love to stay again. \"",,,,,
8036024,96071555,2016-08-21,18098317,Daniel,"Our stay was very nice and relaxing! Frank's home is beautiful and spacious with extra high ceilings and a great open floor plan. House was clean upon arrival and our stay was a breeze. Easy wifi access, although not the fastest, and nice TV in the living room to watch television or movies. Location is key for a trip to Boston and this apartment is perfect for anyone looking to spend some time in the North End or Faneuil Hall."
I would recommend this place to friends and family and will likely try to stay here again (if there are any dates available). It books up quick!,,,,,

Not far from both the subway and bus systems it is a short hop to practically anything you could want to do in Boston. Would recommend!

They had an amazing time visiting all of Boston, but said where Rachel's apartment was located was her favorite neighborhood.  I asked her how she would rate her stay at Rachel's apartment and she said \"\"100 out of 100!\"\" :)  Rachel was super fast with communication and my daughter said the description of the apartment was spot on and that again"

She was a great host, and was super flexible about my boyfriend and I not knowing exactly when were going to be arriving, and she had great recommendations for things to do and restaurants to try. Charlestown was beautiful and it was the perfect place from which to explore Boston. The apartment was clean, had everything we needed, was close to the grocery store, great restaurants, and the freedom trail, and within walking distance of the North End and Downtown. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay or a better host!"

I was there for about 2 weeks and thoroughly enjoyed it. It is the perfect size for a longer term stay. The neighborhood is quaint and very accessible. It is safe and there is a shopping mall with a Whole Foods,CVS,Post office and much more.,,,
"I could not have asked for a better experience!!\"",,,,,
1658983,12997749,2014-05-17,11662644,Frances,"Rachel's place was pretty much exactly as I expected from the airbnb pictures and description.

L'appartement est egalement charmant et fonctionnel. Rachel est une excellente hôte. Elle nous a très bien accueilli et bien expliqué pour le stationnement de la voiture. Super location pour visiter Boston."
1658983,18635000,2014-08-29,9165104,Christina,The apartment is very functional. It's located in a good neiberhood and it's  easy to get to Boston. I would recommand it for a couple nights stay.
1658983,18976958,2014-09-03,6238649,Steff,Rachel's place was exactly what we hoped for and more. Located in gorgeous Charlestown this was the perfectly cozy  place to stay while we were in Boston. The proximity to the Bunker Hill memorial is ridiculous -- literally one block away and we even walked to whole foods in 5 minutes and got stuff to cook on Rachel's back patio grill. I also would like to note how well equipped the place was in preparation for a guest--everything from towels to eating utensils and cooking essentials was provided. Super comfortable stay we would recommend to anyone planing a Boston trip.
1658983,19453755,2014-09-13,9126954,Pam,"My father and I stayed here for a little over a week. My father slept on the regular bed and the Aerobed was very comfy too. Everything was as expected, the hosts were very friendly and helpful. Nice neighborhood we could walk to the laundry mat, grocery store and the hubway (bikes for rent) which was a nice form of transportation. Thank you for a nice place to stay while we were enjoying a wonderful vacation."
1658983,19601592,2014-09-15,13003165,Matt,The location was perfect. Easy walking distance to many of the major tourist attractions as well as a short walk to public transit which can take you anywhere you want to go. The apartment was very clean and had everything you could want in it. Rachel was a great host and very accommodating when it comes to checking in and out.
"I would gladly stay here again when returning to Boston.\"",,,,,
1658983,19687229,2014-09-16,20057914,Kristine,"Wonderful experience! Nice location. I'm a petite 5'0 female so I felt perfectly comfortable, but I think anyone much bigger than that may feel a bit claustrophobic in the bathroom with low ceilings and small shower. Other than that, the space is clean and accommodating. Excellent hosts!"
1658983,19778317,2014-09-18,13406794,Dirk,"Perfect apt. to visit Boston. Very clean and Rachel is a great host, helping her guests with everything they need.

Beautiful neighborhood. Walk to the North End in 15 minutes or so, or grab the Orange Line into the city which is a short stroll down the bottom of the hill.  Very comfortable bed. Nice towels. Be sure to stop by Warren Tavern for $1 oysters after 3 p.m.  Also, Harpoon Brewery tour is great!  Until next time..."
1658983,24099397,2014-12-20,15914128,Sharon,Rachel and Nate were very accommodating hosts! They made my stay very enjoyable! We're very quick to address any concerns or issues I may have had. The apartment is a cute studio  apartment in perfect and the best location!
1658983,24229264,2014-12-23,19831251,Gaëlle,"The appartment is a comfortable, quiet and very convenient place for a stay in Boston ! You have a supermarket about 5 min by walking and it's pretty easy to park a car near the place. Subway is very close, about 5-10 min by walking and after that, you're in the city center in 10 min. But you can also do the Freedom Trail : it's a walking path which make you discover the city of Boston by going through historical monuments ! And it starts right next to the appartment !"
Finally,Rachel and Nate are very welcoming and kind people ! They take care of you and your comfort. They were easily available before our arrival and at any time during our stay.,,,,
"We highly recommand these hosts and their appartment !\"",,,,,
1658983,24542368,2014-12-30,23864653,Stacey,Rachel and Nate were really nice. Even before we arrived (as we were arriving on Christmas Eve) they offered to buy some groceries to cover us for a couple of days in case the shops were closed by the time we arrived.
We arrived at the address and as described the door to the property is very small. We didn't think this was correct at first but it was as described so this was fine. The apartment itself is very clean,cosy and basic,again as described. As we were there over Christmas and cooked on Christmas day,we did struggle a little with no plug or draining board in the sink area,but mostly this wasn't an issue as we just had breakfast for the rest of the time.,
The area of Charlestown is very pleasant. The neighbourhood seems friendly and it is actually much closer to downtown Boston than we had originally thought. The freedom trail starts/ends practically on the doorstep at Bunker Hill Monument so for the first day we followed the trail which is a great way to get your bearings and to discover the area as well as learning more about the history of the area.,,,,,
Overall this place is great as a base from which to explore the area and we can recommend it. Rachel and Nate made us feel extremely welcome and despite them being away for Christmas during most of our stay they still contacted us regularly to make sure everything was fine and to ask if we needed anything else.,,,,,
"Thank you \"",,,,,
1658983,25165189,2015-01-08,229067,Sam,"Lovely welcome from Rachel to their cosy place in a special part of Boston, which managed to still be warm despite the extraordinary -18C temps outside! Hosts were quick to respond to any issues or questions we had and eager to ensure we were comfortable. Thanks for making us feel welcome!"
1658983,27877451,2015-03-14,26873634,Marilia,"It was an amazing experience the days I passed in the house! Everything was good, exactly like in the site. I have not any problems during the days and everything works very well. Rachel and Nate are very very amazing, solicitous, very polite and help with all you need! I really feel like if was at home! It was perfect!"
1658983,28129080,2015-03-18,7382133,Esmeralda,Great little place in Charlestown.  A stones throw away from Boston.  The orange T line is just down the way to access any Boston area.
It was perfect for our girls getaway.,,,,,
"Bathroom is a little snug even for a short person but not a deal breaker.  \"",,,,,

The apartment was exactly as described and was very comfortable. The apartment is in a beautiful location with easy access to the city by foot or by a short can ride. Rachel and Nate were always on hand to cater to our every need and went above and beyond to make us feel at home. I would definitely come back here to stay and will keep the apartment in mind for my next trip!
1658983,29126303,2015-04-04,29404483,Andrew,"Rachel was very responsive to our questions and communication by email and phone. The apartment is conveniently located for many of the Boston landmarks, and easy walking distance to the T rail system. The apartment itself is a little unusual, but none-the-less was comfortable and supplied with everything that we needed. We'd certainly stay here again."
1658983,29391496,2015-04-07,4294797,Suzi,Rachel and Nate were wonderful hosts and we had a fantastic stay in their apartment. It is very well fitted out with everything you could possibly need and they had a great supply of maps and booklets to help with our stay. The flat is just as pictured.
Charlestown is a gorgeous part of Boston and the flat is really well located,with a train line,buses to Cambridge,the oldest tavern in Boston and the lovely waterfront within a few minutes walk.,,
Rachel and Nate were fantastic in helping us to plan a day by the coast  and were incredibly warm and welcoming. We wished we could have stayed longer to get to know them better!,,,,,
"Highly recommended!\"",,,,,
1658983,41584696,2015-08-08,30350608,Peter,"Rachel and Nate were excellent hosts! I stayed here for an entire summer and it was the perfect home. You can walk downtown in 15 minutes and the Freedom Trail starts basically right down the street. The air conditioning and furniture were especially great, and Rachel and Nate were very accommodating to anything I needed. The ceilings are pretty low but I'm around six foot and didn't have any problem. I highly recommend staying here if you're looking for a place in Boston that is close to all the action but also a quiet and comfortable place to return to!"

1658983,45625993,2015-09-04,42805126,Nikola,"Boston itself was an amazing city to experience ! Totally walkable, easy access to any means of transport. But we prefered Uber, it was cheaper, very easy to use. Now, to start with the housing. We do not have any complaints about the house. Location is perfect - lovely neighborhood, very close to the downtown. Apartment was just like on the pictures - clean, tidy, cozy. We had everything what we needed for the time we spent in Boston including clean towels, shampoons, hair dryer etc. The hosts were very friendly and ready to help at any time. We would definitely recommend it if you were planning to visit Boston ! 10/10 from us !"
1658983,48267388,2015-09-25,8041150,M,"I stayed with Rachel and Nate's apartment for nearly one month, for work nearby at MGH laboratories."
From the outset of our communication Rachel was prompt to reply and extremely accommodating.  We agreed my stay with ease and I was most grateful for her so easily allowing my earlier check in and flexible check out also.  She was the perfect hostess,making sure I had everything I needed but also not intrusive.,,,,
The apartment had everything I needed and is perfectly located in a lovely neighbourhood within easy reach of town and with a great Wholefoods supermarket and nice restaurants/cafes nearby.  The neighbourhood has a lovely vibe and was a very peaceful retreat.,,,,,

1658983,49113116,2015-10-01,33668575,Sarah,"We arrived in Boston around 16:00 with clear instructions on how to access the apartment. It was easy to find and the welcome was lovely. Rachel and Nate had prepared an information sheet with everything we needed to know, including the wifi code, and lots of Boston books and maps so we could plan our time in the city. Not forgetting the bottle of red wine! The apartment was clean, well equipped and cosy! Lovely warm shower, fluffy towels and bathroom products in case the guest had forgotten theirs."
Location of the apartment was perfect - only 100 metres from the freedom trail,and Charlestown was a lovely area of the city.,,,,
"Highly recommended. A lovely couple too. Shame we couldn't stay longer!! \"",,,,,

1658983,52567357,2015-10-31,1616353,Amy & Scott,"I stayed at Rachel & Nate's place for a whole month because I was staying in Boston researching a book. They were incredibly friendly and welcoming! The apartment offers complete privacy, which I enjoyed, and Rachel gave me plenty of notice whenever they needed access to the utility room (which is in the basement bathroom). As for the apartment itself, it had pretty much everything I needed! It's a beautiful old house, and its age shows here and there; it's also a little drafty on cold days. But the mini-split AC/heater unit keeps the sitting area nice and warm. In short: I felt really lucky to have this place. It's very difficult to find a short-term apartment rental in Boston that doesn't eat up (or exceed) my entire research budget whenever I go there. Fortunately, Rachel & Nate provide a private, affordable, and conveniently located place to stay for people like me. I hope to stay there again during my next visit!"
1658983,53325571,2015-11-08,9331731,Anthony,"Rachel was a fantastic host. Apartment great a stones throw from the start of freedom trail with easy access to the city by foot, Uber or train. Would recommended to anyone travelling to Boston."

1658983,60943495,2016-01-30,21929827,Emma,"Our host made us feel welcome from the moment we contacted them. The location of the apartment is fantastic in that it is minutes from the grocery store, the harbor and all the happenings that the Charlestown community has to offer. Rachel and Nate's attention to detail was remarkable."
1658983,62229355,2016-02-13,18893292,Taylah,"The apartment is exactly as pictured/described. Has everything you need and more.

1658983,90350171,2016-07-31,56659820,Sarah,"This is a great place to stay in the Boston area. The location is right off the freedom trail and is a short (~0.5-1.5 mile) walk to lots of historical sites, the North End and Boston harbor and also about 0.5 mile to the T. If you're a runner, you can make it to the Charles river in less than a mile--beautiful place for a run. Rachel and Nate (absolutely awesome hosts) were easy to communicate with and more than willing to make additions or other changes to the place that would make my stay better. It was very easy to make this place my home this summer. If I need a place to stay next time I'm in the area, I will definitely try to book this again!"
Only one thing to note--if you're tall,this might not be the place for you,"the ceilings are not much higher than 6 feet. Being about 5'4\"\"","this was absolutely not a problem for me but I think if my taller friends visited they would have a hard time staying comfortably.\"",,

The area is beautiful and just steps from the Bunker Hill Monument at the end of the Freedom Trail! We loved wondering around this neighborhood, and it was so easy to go to and from Boston! Rachel and Nate were so kind and easy to get in contact with. They were willing to work around our schedule for check in and check out which made our trip that much more enjoyable. Upon arrival we were greeted at the door where they carried in our bags and showed us around the place. I can't express enough how accommodating they were. I will for sure try and book this again if I am ever back in this area. I highly recommend a stay if you are planning a trip here."
1658983,92867560,2016-08-10,55956017,Mel,"This was a great wee basement apartment with everything you need! It is in a lovely area a short distance from the Freedom trail and with plenty of nice restaurants nearby. Rachel and Nate were really friendly and keen to hear feedback on the place. We had a lovely stay, thank you!"
7475379,55805101,2015-12-06,43740134,Luciana,"Alicia was very receptive and helpful.  She allowed me to do the check in earlier than usual. Also the studio is exactly as shown in the pictures, clean, cozy and with all necessary utensils. The location is good, safe, close to restaurants, stores, pharmacies and supermarkets. A perfect place for one or two people!"
7475379,71154601,2016-04-24,11178012,Gerald,"Alicia was very responsive to any questions I had before arriving, and when I had some difficulty with the entrance password when I first arrived, she called me right back and solved the problem. The apartment was exactly as had been described and just what I was looking for. The charming and historic Newbury Street neighborhood in Back Bay has everything one needs: restaurants, shopping, markets and pharmacies, and access to public transportation."
7475379,75019394,2016-05-18,8883156,Amir-Pashah,"Very clean and decent. Location is really the selling point: right on Newbury across from Shakeshack. Very accessible to everything from public transport to local bars & restaurants. Did not have much amenities though like soap and shampoos and stuff. The stairs were a killer too. But overall a very positive experience.  Also, great communications with Alicia. Very helpful and accommodating. Definitely recommended."
7475379,78872406,2016-06-09,73629618,Jade,The location was amazing. It was close to a subway station and walking distance to nice restaurants and shopping areas. The place pretty much had everything that you need for two people. Alicia was great at messaging back if you had any questions.
7475379,84965190,2016-07-09,7552128,Lucas,"El apartamento es muy acogedor y cómodo, y está muy bien situado en una de las mejores calles de Boston, cerca de paradas de metro."
7475379,94988289,2016-08-17,26792911,Kristy,"Great location! I love the back bay neighborhood, especially Newberry Street, and so I was thrilled when I found this listing. Everything is within walking distance: restaurants, large grocery store  (just about two blocks away, Star Market), a smaller market (Delucas, just next door) and CVS just across the street!"
The day before you arrive,you will receive all the information you need for a keyless entry.,,,,
Be sure to bring with you laundry detergent and quarters for laundry,toiletries including extra toilet paper,shampoo/conditioner,bath soap,hairdryer; dish soap and sponge for doing dishes.,
We had a great stay,"and we will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Boston!\"",,,,
12891323,83537722,2016-07-03,80684987,Kat,"Rich was very accommodating and was easy to reach. His instructions for his home (Wifi, TV, air conditioning/heat) were easy to follow and everything ran smoothly. Not only was his home comfortable to stay at, but the neighborhood had a variety of food and shops to explore. Getting to the airport from Rich's home in the morning of my flight was easy and made my travels much more convenient. Overall, a great stay and good time!"
12891323,84092800,2016-07-05,45688429,Chris,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Richards apartment on the 4th of July. Richard was a great host and the place was exactly as advertised. For starters, Richard was extremely flexible with check-in times - which was helpful for us because we wanted to get an earlier start."
Parking has the potential to be a little bit of a problem,but if you're going into to Boston with a car,it should be expected. In my experience,"I had no problem at all. I found free street parking right outside his place. Didn't get ticketed or towed despite the \"\"2 hour parking\"\" sign.",,
The location was perfect for us. There were tons of restaurants,convenience stores,liquor stores,and a T station - all a short walk away.,,
Richard himself was a pleasure to hangout with and did everything in his power to ensure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.,,,,,
The apartment was exactly as listed. He had just returned from South America,so there were a few things he had to get fixed. The TV in the room was temporarily down,which wasn't a problem for us since we were in Boston for most of the day/night anyway. We also the discovered there was a problem with the oven,it kept shutting itself off. The toaster oven worked as a fine replacement. He was already working on getting those fixed before I left the next morning.,,
All-in-all,"I'd highly recommend staying with Richard. \"",,,,
12891323,86150657,2016-07-15,8236535,Richard,Great location. Close to airport and to downtown. Comfy bed with good air con. Richard was a charming host and very helpful throughout our stay. The area is generally nice but like many more suburban areas a single woman walking home on her own at night may feel a little intimidated.
12891323,87504134,2016-07-20,84319413,Mark,"My girlfriend and I had a very welcoming and comfortable stay with Richard!  We were in town to sight see and see a concert. The location was great.  2 blocks from the T station, which was only one stop away from the Seaport area. Nice and clean apartment with all the amenities we could have needed. We were out in the city for most of our stay so we didn't have much interaction, but upon arrival we had a nice conversation with Richard about our plans and he offered some advice for transportation and places to go; great guy.  I would recommend this for anyone looking to stay within a stones throw of the downtown area!  Plus Richard has some awesome artwork around the place."
13417233,81817132,2016-06-25,3473818,Eric,"If I could give Elle 6 stars I would. She went above and beyond in helping make our stay fun and productive.  We just moved across the country to make Boston our new home, and Elle was very helpful during this stressful process. This is basically an apartment sans kitchen, and an excellent deal."
13417233,85073145,2016-07-10,28243613,Charlotte,Elle was a wonderful host and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. The place was clean and had great access to the T. It also had a parking lot which made things so much easier while having a car! :)

The room is very large and confortamble.,,,,,
I've spent two week in boston this time and I can affirm that was the best airbnb experience in this city.,,,,,
Elle and Aaron are a rare example of courtesy. They are at disposition for any need.,,,,,
The next time in boston I hope to find available this room.,,,,,

13685592,92646453,2016-08-09,50845405,Matt,"Since I was arriving early on the first day and cleaning was complete from the prior guest, Flatbook allowed me to checkin earlier in the day which was excellent as I needed to work. The wifi was excellent. I did have issue with the lock as there were no real explanation of the locking mechanism and so called Flatbook. Their representative came out and showed me how it worked but even he had issues getting lock to work correctly. Later that evening we ran into difficulties and needed assistance and none was available. Clients make sure your code is working correctly. Once it was changed the following morning, no further issues. The location is excellent as we were going to shows at Fenway so easy to take Harvard Ave Green T stop (1 block away) and head to Fenway or anywhere downtown in Boston. There are multiple restaurants and grocery stores in close proximity. The beds are comfortable. All three bedrooms are similar in size so that is excellent. Kitchen is updated and even though we did not cook, it was well-stocked. Flat panel TV with satellite programming was excellent as we caught some of the Olympics. As Flatbook has several units in the building, you do hear your neighbors if they come home late and decide to continue the evening in their apartment as the walls are thin but this was not much of an issue as we had no small children with us.  Due to the price of hotels in Boston area, this is an excellent alternative to a hotel for a group coming into Boston for sightseeing, sporting events or music. It is also in close proximity to Boston University so could be alternative for visiting students in the area. I am not sure I would recommend for families traveling with small children but overall, I would recommend. Also there is a great restaurant near by on Brighton Avenue called Carlo's Cantina with fantastic Italian food."
13685592,93971144,2016-08-14,529714,Christopher,"Stayed with my wife, our 10 mos old and grandparents, and it was still a very comfortable space, with easy access to all of metro Boston. Would definitely stay again if I was traveling to Boston."
13685592,95665813,2016-08-20,4446168,Steve,The host canceled this reservation 237 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

8238311,48224589,2015-09-24,763602,George,Jay was an amazing host. Very flexible and attentive our needs.
Place was clean and tidy.,,,,,
Offered to hold a few things for me while I travel. He really went out his way to please.,,,,,
Wonderful stay.,,,,,
"Will use him again. \"",,,,,
8238311,48368659,2015-09-25,44799124,Jay,Jay was very friendly and inviting. Location was great which made it easy to get around town. Jay was fantastic at making sure we had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable.
8238311,48935403,2015-09-29,9722198,Maria,Jays place is not far from the centre of Boston. Only takes about 10 minutes with the train. The house has about 5-6 rooms for airbnb guests.
8238311,49530397,2015-10-04,44762633,Vijay,Jay was very accommodating of my schedule. House is simple and clean. I stayed in the attic room. Comfy for sleeping and not much more. The sheets on the bed were very high end and comfortable.
"All in all a nice experience.\"",,,,,
8238311,50369548,2015-10-11,33701247,Awais,The place was really clean and close to orange line. It took us only a couple of minutes to get to the orange line. Jay is a really good host
8238311,50825446,2015-10-14,46449408,Nathan,"Jay was an incredibly thoughtful host, and the residence had everything we could desire. Our beds were clean and comfortable and the room was accommodating. Also, many people had expressed concerns about the area in which this was located. I can comfortably say that I never felt unsafe or unwelcome. All in all, a great experience."
8238311,51472701,2015-10-20,45001806,Anthony,Great stay and a great host.  Jay was a wonderful host.  He was accommodating to allow us to drop our bag off in the morning so we did not have to haul it around while we were being tourists in town.   The room was as described with two beds which was good for my son and I.  There were two full bathrooms available for use.  Jay also said we could make use of the kitchen and the living room.  There was also a private back yard with patio tables and chairs.  Lastly the location was very convenient to the Orange line.
8238311,51861939,2015-10-24,19637635,Victor,Very professional and friendly. Fantastic location. Definitely check out the shower heads!
8238311,52140500,2015-10-26,20185887,Helio,"The location is extremely convenient, a couple of blocks (or less) from the metro. The house is OK looking. Nothing wrong with it."
We had one problem with our stay,though. The first night the heater broke,so we were extremely cold. Felt like camping in the beginning of winter.,,,
We understand that these things can happen,but I wish Jay would have let us know. He did not mention that. Apparently it was a last minute thing.,,,,
Next day the heater was fixed,and everything went smooth.,,,,
I would definitely recommend the place and the host. Not the fanciest place,"but decent and well located.\"",,,,
8238311,52371219,2015-10-28,19032424,Sebastien,"Amazing location just few minutes from the subway. Jay was really welcoming. The feel of the place was more like an hostel, many rooms and many people around. Only two full bathrooms, but it never was a problem for me. The attic room was a bit short in height, i could only stand at specific location. a weird smell (smoke or food) was still lingering. But all beds, sheets and comforters were clean. I didn't get a towel as it was mention in the description."
8238311,53543758,2015-11-09,47666990,Jason,Jay was super friendly and helpful.the location was convenient to the orange line. The house was clean and quiet. I would stay there again.
8238311,53870654,2015-11-13,48780479,Josh,"Honestly I've been staying in shared homes for a long time. Us, and abroad.This is by far one of the coolest experiences I've had. in an actor so I'm always on the go. So trust me when I say there are a lot of bad places out there, this I can 100% assure you, is not one of those place. But book fast, this place goes quickly!"
If you get a chance to stay here,make sure you sit down and talk with the host. He is a very sweet man. Makes you feel right at home.,,,,
"Thanks for a kick ass experience! \"",,,,,
8238311,54073419,2015-11-15,48299810,Mark,"This was a very uneven trip.  Jay graciously guided me to the T station early Friday morning the day of my arrival but I didn't see him again until Saturday night. There was no space to park in front of Jay's house so I had to park around the corner which later earned me a $40 parking ticket. Not Jay's fault but it would have been nice to know. When I came back after the conference Friday, someone else was in my room.  I tried calling Jay to sort this out but got no reply. After the second call, my phone died. I couldn't use my computer to access him either as I was never given a password to the wireless network, or a towel to shower with or how to use the TV.  I waited up for him until 11:00 before trying a different room that seemed available. There was one but there was a space by the air conditioner that was open to the street and the lock to the door was broken. I crashed there and after finding a clean towel in the bathroom showered and hit the sack, hoping I wasn't going to be turned out in the middle of the night. After another day at the conference, I checked back into my room that had not been touched. I finally caught up with Jay at around 6:30 Sat. night and he seemed perplexed over the circumstances. He then filled the space by the window so the cold air couldn't come in, gave me a towel, showed me how to work the TV and gave me the wireless password. He also told me that there was some food in the kitchen I could cook up for breakfast which would have been good to know. I asked him about a place to eat and he guided me to the place next door that served Somalian food. The food was great (lamb shank on a bed of rice, grilled veggies and a salad) and I returned and put on a movie. After the movie, I tried to get on-line but my computer couldn't find the signal and at 11:00, it felt it was too late to bother Jay about it so I showered and crashed. I left early for the conference the next day and checked out of my room before I left but Jay wasn't around and I didn't want to go knocking on doors to find him."
In sum,Jay was friendly and,when he was around,helpful. The bed was comfy,the house was clean and the location was convenient to the T. The problem was that Jay wasn't around to give me the low down on the place,how things worked or what to do with the person in my room. Would I come again? I don't know. I guess it would depend on whether Jay would be around to problem solve or not. And based on my visit
8238311,54767352,2015-11-23,34243114,Ryota,We had wonderful time at this place. Jay is so cool guy and the locate is close to station. If you want to stay in Boston for cheap check this place out. Thank you for giving awesome place.

A two minute walk away from the orange line, which smelled like a bathroom, this attic was the perfect place for me and my friend. We stayed for one night, and Donovan and friend were both really sweet and accommodating! It really felt like we were sleeping over in a fort, and the feel couldn't have been more perfect for an overnight stay in Boston. We'll be back! 10/10 would recommend!"
8238311,57338712,2015-12-24,39990590,Kenneth,Good host. Good location.
8238311,57593999,2015-12-27,51460982,Zhen,"This room is one of the two attics of a house next to a community college. Though the space in the room is not very big, I would say it's pretty much enough for staying overnight plus the host is very nice and the amenities provided in the house are very good. One downside of this listing is that I was a little bit anxious about the safety around the house during my stay when returning late at night because there aren't many people around and the road in front of the house is kind of dim. Luckily this place is very close to a subway station so this shouldn't be a problem most of the time."

8238311,71706977,2016-04-27,22379507,Sarah,"This was a great stay in Boston. To be clear it is about 2.5 miles from the North End of Boston which is where all of the touristy/history spots are located BUT the T station was literally steps away, therefore, downtown was only about 8 minutes away, and it was on the orange line which is apparently the most reliable according to locals. The location is a close 0.5-mile walk to Mission Hill with fantastic Irish pubs and food. About the place itself: it is run by people who don't actually live in the space, if I am correct. It is a house with about 7 bedrooms housing a mix of different people each day. You get a personal code to open the front door, and then inside you get your own key to a private room. There are 3 floors with 2-3 rooms per floor, and 2 shared, full bathrooms with all the amenities. Throughout my 2 days 3-night stay there were people coming in and out, but it was very quiet and I didn't actually SEE anyone else, I only knew other people were there based on how often the keys to the other rooms were off their respective hooks. I would definitely recommend this place, and would personally stay here again. I used the instant book to book it as I was driving into Boston, about 10 minutes prior to arrival, and immediately after booking received my house code, and Donovan, the caretaker, was easily reachable by phone and super helpful."
8238311,71784558,2016-04-28,60761204,William,Great and cheap place to spend our travel in the expensive Boston. Our room was quiet and clean. Host are clearly about the access and all about the room . good choice

8238311,78783900,2016-06-09,75772477,Michael,Bed and room seemed clean. S.P was helpful when i had a problem. Overall the stay was very satisfactory. Would stay again.

"Veey low ceiling. I do not know how I took this room but may be I am not lucky enough\"",,,,,
8238311,80446900,2016-06-18,76156426,Nate,"Wonderful location and a great place to stay. About 3 miles from the center of Boston and around a mile to Fenway, a walk can get you anywhere you need to go. Room was very clean when we arrived and very accommodating. Free parking right outside was also a huge bonus. Would definitely book here again."
8238311,81510743,2016-06-23,25507632,Berta,Very convenient location. Clean and comfortable.  Good communication.
8238311,82517104,2016-06-27,4034081,Kirsten,The description of the room and the house is accurate. The house is close to the subway and thereby conveniently located.
We had some trouble with the electronic front door since the host changed the key code last minute and we had no possibility to check the emails before our arrival. But upon calling the new code was provided immediately,which is still a inconvenience when you are coming from Europe due to the high costs for calling.,,,,
The room is indeed small and has a low ceiling. It was very warm and sticky when we arrived but thanks to the AC we could cool it down quickly. Sadly it was not as clean as suggested by the other reviewer. In one of the two bed there was hair under the blanket...,,,,,
Also both beds are not very stable,the legs are bent inwards which made us afraid to turn around on them. Furthermore,there was only one towel provided for the two of us,probably would have gotten a second but since one of us brought a towel we didn't bother with calling.,,
"The house itself was quite and clean. There were other people staying there as well but we barely saw them.\"",,,,,
8238311,82615909,2016-06-28,19868236,容青,It is a really nice and cozy loft! Nice price and nice environment! I would choose S.P again if I come to Boston next time!
8238311,82833881,2016-06-29,78350336,Anaïs,"Really good place, house it was just perfect"
8238311,82942267,2016-06-30,79681766,Denise,The neighborhood was great. Felt safe and is a nice walk around to the T. Not much around for food...but you can always jump on the T and go to Boylston.
8238311,83778393,2016-07-04,46290398,Bryan,"Dealing with the property managers was absolutely a breeze-- Oscar answered my inquiries almost immediately, from start to finish. Our room was as described, small but very tidy and perfect for two of us. We stayed in an attic and found the air conditioning on a hot July weekend to be very useful! Location to T stop was very very close. We had a great time and enjoyed the room, access to a kitchen and more. Price was a little steep, but it was a holiday weekend, and comparable with other amenities. Shared bathrooms were quite clean and well-stacked, and the towels are a nice surprise for those that might have forgot their own; although there were only 2 for multiple guest rooms.  Overall it was an excellent choice, would gladly stay again."
8238311,85083855,2016-07-10,9972184,Ana,La casa estaba bien pero el vecindario estaba lejos del centro.
8238311,85099429,2016-07-10,39889241,Jess,Great little room. Comfy and clean beds. Love the offer of the Roku TV. Our door code didn't work at first but they fixed it quickly and were really nice about it.
8238311,85646254,2016-07-12,76841840,绍征,"the place is not so good, the highest point of the roof is only less than 2 meters away from the floor, that means that you can touch the roof easily, higher people may need to bend their head all the time, the total area of the room is about 5 meter square, there is no vacancy except the room between the beds, this place is not suitable for living in, think twice people."
8238311,86797741,2016-07-17,31633051,John,"The room was great, clean, and as described in the listing. The host was very accessible; I had a question about the place late in the evening and I promptly received an answer.  Would definitely recommend."
8238311,87319415,2016-07-19,9397127,Steven,Room was as described. Instructions and communication were great.
8238311,88264157,2016-07-23,21670861,Paul,Nice place to stay and really close to downtown/city center via train (2 minutes away and comes every 10 minutes). Only warning is 6 rooms (12 people) have to share two bathrooms which meant there were times waiting have a shower or use restroom. Overall a great place that was in safe neighborhood and was outstanding value for money
8238311,90062413,2016-07-31,38470291,Julian,"The apartment was clean and a nice place to stay. The neighbourhood was safe and there was a good connection to the city center! Commumication was good, we received answers really fast. Definitely recommend!"
8238311,90909998,2016-08-02,44665618,Sebastien,"The room in the attic was exactly as described, large enough for the two of us and has its own AC."
The house is very cosy,the living room and the kitchen are quite large and have everything you can find in a house. We had the sense that a family lives in the house which is what we were looking for.,,,,
We did not meet the hosts but were in touch by phone when needed.,,,,,
"We highly recommend this place and would definitely stay with them again.\"",,,,,
8238311,91229532,2016-08-04,57477452,Hillary,"Nice people, very clean and comfortable! Very guest friendly."
8238311,92402045,2016-08-08,78590294,Adeel,It was a pleasurable experience living at this place. I had no problems whatsoever with finding this place and the owners were really nice and helpful.
8238311,94604477,2016-08-16,19187119,Rob,It's clean and well presented but there are no local amenities so you really need a car.  It's over 15 min walk to the nearest shop which isn't open after 9pm so you need to remember to bring breakfast and food with you.  I'd expected that accommodation in Boston would have plenty to do on the doorstep so be prepared.  However once you've got everything together for a night in their provision of Netflix and wifi in the room will be appreciated.
"Also bring a sleeping mask if you get woken with light as the windows don't have blackout blinds.\"",,,,,
8238311,94974600,2016-08-17,75942114,Florence,The house was clean and everything was as shown in the pictures.  The only downside is that there it's a bit of a walk from any facilities or stores so you definitely need a car.  Overall it was a good experience living in this house.
8238311,95326464,2016-08-19,59022908,Anthony,"The listing was accurate and only stayed one night, but it was enjoyable. Would recommend for those looking for a place close to transit just outside of downtown Boston."
8238311,95381468,2016-08-19,63434565,Marques,Great apartment in a great location. I would definitely stay again.
8238311,96803955,2016-08-24,91193882,Johannes,We had a great stay in the room. The common area is very comfortable and we had a great transit option to down town via the near by T-line.
8238311,97395412,2016-08-27,55078577,登坡,"居住地點離車站附近很靠近,交通十分方便,不過房間床鋪有一個彈簧床已經塌掉,睡覺起來十分不舒服,再聯絡方面也很難聯絡,回信速度沒有很快。"
8238311,98168106,2016-08-29,37788187,Ranran,I reserve this room for two of my friends. They had a great time living there. The direction and instruction was clear to them to check in by themselves. And the communication with the host is prompt and friendly. I highly recommend everyone to live in this place while visiting Boston.
8238311,99634830,2016-09-05,22649788,Damien,I find the place expensive for what is was. Maybe because is Boston but a better price should be more appropriate. Bathroom was not really clean and lock of the room door was really not secure. Location of the house is fine very close to the train. Room is fine if you want only to stay for the night.
3289921,14652954,2014-06-23,7755720,Emma,"We stayed in the apartment for 2 nights and was a comfortable, clean apartment. The neighborhood is safe, but has a fair share of questionable characters around during the day; also parking is tough. The sleeping loft is adorable and the bed is very very comfortable. Lauren did a great job making the place welcoming, and I would definitely recommend this location to friends visiting Boston."
3289921,15590745,2014-07-12,4982258,Yosefa,"The apartment was great. It's in a convenient location, we walked almost everywhere while staying there. Boston gets quite hot in the summer but the air conditioner downstairs and fan in the loft kept the place at a fairly comfortable temperature. The apartment had everything we needed and was clean. Lauren was a great host and did a great job communicating before during and after our stay."
3289921,16911642,2014-08-04,10998046,Guillaume,"Great place and great host! The indication for checking in were clear. The studio was lovely, very cosy, clean and very well located in a beautiful old Bostonian building. The best way to discover the city."
"A very nice experience! \"",,,,,

3289921,25017600,2015-01-05,23032419,David,"Lauren provided us a lovely place to stay whilst in Boston. The place had everything we needed with excellent instructions, useful information, and Lauren even provided us with a bottle of Bubbly to celebrate NYE - which was a big surprise. Lauren also helped us find a great restaurant called Toro which we recommend to anyone who's in the area. People with a group of 4 should note the apartment is very cosy which Lauren does mention."
3289921,29347655,2015-04-06,2754918,Hannah,"We recently stayed in the apartment for a weekend, and Lauren was an excellent host! The apartment was clean, extremely well-decorated, quiet (slept very well) and overall had a very comfortable feel.  The location worked out well for us, but it seemed fairly residential (was a bit of a walk to most the restaurants/bars in South End). I would definitely recommend staying there!"
3289921,31327795,2015-05-04,29934490,Ian,"The apartment was clean and felt very welcoming on arrival.  The instructions were very clear and covered everything we needed to know from getting into the house, staying comfortable, watching TV, and getting around.  The apartment was as described, no surprises.  We found it to be an excellent value for a place to stay in Boston."
3289921,35781172,2015-06-22,29952132,Elinor,We were straight away attracted to the decor of this apartment. We appreciated the fresh flowers on arrival. It suited all our needs and was well located. Lauren was really helpful whenever we needed anything.
3289921,37511210,2015-07-07,32368087,Felix,Everything was fine. it is clean and well located so it is easy to get around from here. Everytime we had questions Lauren responded to it and gave us tips (for example where to have breakfast). She was very flexible regarding check in and check out.
I think for two it is absolutely perfect,for three it was still ok.,,,,
All in all we have nothing to complain! I recommend it.,,,,,

Overall,"great for the price.\"",,,,
3289921,46178986,2015-09-08,30557531,Matthew,"My wife and I stayed here and we had a great experience. Lauren was very accommodating both with our early arrival and our late departure. She also had a great summary of the apartment, how to enter, where to park, et cetera. Highly recommend her place as it is also so close to great spots like Mike's Diner, Toro, Blunch, Flour, the Butcher Shop and a lot more."
3289921,50857027,2015-10-15,14414100,Val,"My parents stayed in Lauren's apartment for a week and had a great time. Her place is perfectly decorated, cozy and comfortable for a couple. She left detailed instructions of her place which were very helpful. The studio is located close to great restaurants, bars and diners. Highly recommended!"
3289921,75931836,2016-05-23,4793683,Anna-Lena,Lauren has been a great host and the apartment is nice. We had a great time and would certainly recommend staying at her place for a short trip to Boston.

7513605,52726389,2015-11-01,28007800,Fatema,The host simply provided the necessary passcodes for the building. No other interaction was initiated. Which was fine.

I'd totally recommend for someone visiting Boston. It is within two blocks from Boston Common, walkable distance to Copley Square, Back Bay and North End, and also close to orange, green and red lines metro stations. The only negative point is that we had a problem in the first days because our reservation was for 4 people, but there was only bedding for 3. It took 2 days to solve the problem, but finally they provided us an extra roll up bed with no extra charge."
994317,37229351,2015-07-05,22063423,Dennis,"I thoroughly enjoyed staying here at this apartment. It had everything I needed to feel right at home. Not only was it very comfortable and well furnished, but it's also on a high floor, the building facilities are great, and the concierge crew were all very friendly. A few hours after checkout I realized I left a load of laundry in the drying machine, and I called the 24 hour customer service on a Sunday afternoon and they arranged for me to go back in and get it. Overall I'm very satisfied with my experience and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again on my next trip to town."
994317,40499152,2015-07-31,660687,Brendan,This listing was true to form and perfect for our stay.  Our host even included a small gift basket with items to make our stay more comfortable.

The house is beautiful, the bedroom was really big, the bed was great and confortable and the bathrooms were always clean!! The flip flops and the robe were also a very nice touch! I couldn't have chose a better place to stay! :)"
1584362,8600056,2013-11-07,3275532,Joseph,"Wow, what exceptional hosts!"
Barney and Mary treated my like an old friend. They were very easy to communicate with and very accommodating. My arrival time changed,no problem. I asked for a fan,Barney brought one in no time. Brilliant breakfast,clean accommodations,and the hosts know how to pick their guests :] (I think they rent two other rooms).,
I don't know New England well,but would like to think these folks are the quintessential New England family. Kind,cultured,and efficient. Nothing but good things to say about my 4 day stay there. It was just my second AirBnB,hopeful those in the future will be this great.,
BTW,I was commuting on the Red Line to the convention center every day,and the trip was not bad at all.,,,

I never used airbnb before but I did a great choice to use this site because I could find welcoming Carney family for my great experience to stay in Boston.,,,,,
I really loved the place and their hospitality was beyond my head!,,,,,
Hospitality: Barney served coffee and hand made tasty cup cakes in the morning and he politely told me the short-cut way to the station because the nearest station Savin Hill didn't connect the place I needed to go at that day.,,,,,
Place: the room is really tidy and clean.,,,,,
safety box,bath towels,refrigerator,pot,cups and dishes supplied,
the place around of Carney Family is really safe and good neighborhood. Loved the view of harbor from the window.,,,,,

Great thing was they had only one room left but arranged with neighbor  who also is an AirBnB client to house the other two.  Can't be beat!
1584362,8875097,2013-11-23,6767753,Evelyn And Rafe,"The Carney's place was absolutely amazing - one of the best places we've stayed in with airbnb. Lovely spacious, comfortable and clean rooms, and beautiful and large bathrooms. Meeting the lovely family and the delicious muffins and coffee in the mornings was just icing on the cake (though the muffins themselves were uniced :) ). Would absolutely stay there again if in Boston!"

The dorms were closing and he needed a place for a weekend before flying to Europe for a month. His stay here was easy, comfortable and enjoyable. I'd like for Noah to say firsthand what he liked so much, but he is off on a trip. What he told me was the bed was super comfortable (better than the dorm!) and he slept well (much needed). He appreciated the coffee available and the convenience to public transportation. The Carney Family was welcoming. Noah said he would recommend staying here to others."

1584362,13517419,2014-05-29,6456951,Maria,READ THE INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE OWNER HOW TO GET THERE AND CHECK IT WITH (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) MAPS!!!
The GPS shows a small path as a road,so on our arrival we had to park nearby and when we got to the house on foot we kindly asked the owner (who didn't even give us his name...) if he could get with us to the car and show us the way. Instead he gave us a 15 minutes lecture about 'orientation',which would be perfectly ok if it wasn't for the 8h drive that I just had,we were so tired... Actually,getting to the car and driving us to the house would take 5min.,
But overall the place was very clean and beautiful,close to metro,"and I would stay there again.\"",,,

1584362,14542333,2014-06-21,11011448,Guia,"Very nice place, great host! The room is clean, the bathroom is large and there is everything you need. Perfect breakfast. Very good experience! The house is close to tha train station (10 minutes by walking) so it's easy reach the center of Boston. I recommend this accomodation!!"
1584362,14952135,2014-06-30,11557367,Jim,"\" The coffee & homemade muffins were right outside this third-floor room (in the sitting area/breakfast nook) in the AM, so you didn't even have to go downstairs to partake.  The neighborhood is beautiful and an inviting place should you wish to stroll about.  And the Harbor Walk goes to the JFK Library & beyond. Good eateries nearby at the Metro Station (10 minute walk). Fast into Boston by \"\"T\"\" or car.  The onsite parking was very convenient"
1584362,15123960,2014-07-02,17271230,Richard,"We enjoyed our stay at the Carney's.  Thank you for the hospitality, our son enjoyed playing the baby grand piano. Everything is as described, only a few minutes to the subway, amazing water view and quiet neighborhood.  We definitely are coming back!"
1584362,15164509,2014-07-03,7756715,Kolin,"The Carneys we're wonderful hosts, and their was just splendid. I wish I had had more time to enjoy it all and walk around the beachfront!"
1584362,15489457,2014-07-10,14458933,Eileen,"Mary and Barney are very nice host, we enjoyed our stay with them for our short visit to Boston. The house is near the harbor with beautiful view, the room is very clean with big and new bath room as shared. It's convenient to go to gown town with 10 minutes walking distance to the subway station."
We'll miss the time stay in Carney's home.,,,,,
"Eileen & the family\"",,,,,
1584362,15574933,2014-07-12,121455,Nicola,My colleague and I chose the Carney family for our 4 nights in Boston because of the excellent reviews on this page and proximity to UMass Boston. We couldn't have made a better choice!
The Carney's reside in beautiful part of the City,quiet but close to everything Boston has to offer via the Red Line. Barney makes fresh muffins each day as well. The family was very responsive to email contact about reservations up to our last day.,,,,
"We enjoyed the familiar atmosphere and look forward to our next trip (Sept 2014) to Boston and residing with the Carney family. \"",,,,,
1584362,16062092,2014-07-21,14400951,Sofia,"The Carney Family was an absolutely amazing place to stay. We stayed in Boston for 10 days for work and this house provided the coziest welcome, with really nice company, the perfect smell of muffins and coffee in the morning, and a good place to rest. A special must go for the hosts, who were extremely kind and helpful! And though the house isn’t located in the city center, it is quite easy to get there. Perfect! The best airbnb experience ever!"
1584362,16197195,2014-07-23,10163446,Guillaume,"We stayed for 2 days at The Carney family's house and we had a very nice stay. Mary and Barney are very welcoming and helpful. Their house is really beautiful and convenient. It is located at a short walking distance from the subway which goes downtown. Our room was lovely and comfortable. We shared two bathrooms with the other guests. But it was not a problem as they were never busy and always clean. There was also a kitchen, living room and laundry accesible to all guests. What we also really appreciated was the breakfast. Especially Barney's great muffins. That was a shame we couldn't stay longer."
1584362,16272271,2014-07-24,17612978,Ale,"Camera molto bella e MOLTO pulita, ci siamo trovati benissimo e a nostro agio!!Tra la camera e il bagno c'è un'accogliente cucina con divanetto."
La casa si trova un po' lontana dal centro,ma in 20 minuti lo si raggiunge con la metro.,,,,
Consiglio questa sistemazione a tutti,qualità/prezzo ottimi.,,,,

1584362,16423719,2014-07-27,8451042,Sarah,"\"The Carneys are gracious hostesses; I felt right at home which means a lot coming from southern hospitality! Their home is charming. The room was clean and quiet and the other guests there were also very pleasant. Mary could not have been more gracious in answering \"\"local knowledge\"\" questions and it was simple and direct to get to their house from the airport via (free) public transit. The beach nearby was a bonus"
1584362,16621195,2014-07-30,17310387,Mariano,My first experience using airbnb and couldn't be better. Just a few blocks from the T station where you can get the red line to the city center or even Cambridge. The room was very confortable and the neighborhood is very quiet. The Carney family was very helpfull and so nice. Great experience.
1584362,16803671,2014-08-02,16655515,Lauren,"The Carney House is beautiful - in a quiet, leafy suburb in south Boston, really lovely to walk around and close to transport so it's easy to get around the city (plus, direct train to Harvard). Mary, Barney and their children were amazingly welcoming and gave me some excellent advice on where to find good coffee, go shopping and to hang out in Boston. I felt right at home in this house and loved the fresh coffee and muffins for breakfast! I would definitely love to see the Carney family again next time I am in Boston."
1584362,16840433,2014-08-03,15938862,Silvia,"We had a wonderful time at Carney's house! Bedrooms and restrooms are JUST PERFECT, with excellent soaps and body lotion.... Breakfast was served at floor with coffee, milk, juice, fruit and freshly baked muffins.... The position was near the metro station and it's very quick to reach downtown. If you visit Boston this is the best accomodation ever!"
1584362,16915159,2014-08-04,17633925,Marco Davide,"Beautiful Victorian house, 5 mins drive from the center of Boston,  good vibes since the very first moment. Everything was really clean, and despite the high amount of rooms we had no problem finding some privacy. The atmosphere inside the house is more than friendly and the host has been really nice to us, also extending our check out time. Very recommended, just like the muffins in the morning, delicious."
1584362,17142901,2014-08-08,12257942,Natalie,"The picture and listing were very accurate.  Barney and Mary were kind, intelligent, and helpful.  I stayed there while attending a conference at the convention center, which was about a 40 min. commute, door-to-door, on the very easy to use public transportation.  I was able to walk to a local market and restaurants for food, and also jog on the shore of an inlet of the bay."
I stayed on the third floor and there were a few other boarders who were all polite and respectful.  There were two remodeled full baths available on that floor plus an additional sink,so no problem there.  The continental breakfast was great -- coffee & tea & juice with homemade muffins (delicious),English muffins,yogurt,cereal,"and fruit.  I would definitely consider staying there again if I was in the area.  \""
1584362,17439145,2014-08-12,16260402,Chloé,"Si vous cherchez un coin tranquille, près de l'océan, à environ 20 minutes du centre de Boston, je vous recommande pleinement ce logement. Mary et Barney sont des hôtes chaleureux et disponibles. La chambre est spatieuse, luxueuse et bien équipée. Il y a toutes les commodités près de la maison (épiceries, restaurants). Nous avons adoré cet endroit et nous y retournerons assurément. Les hôtes sont attentifs aux moindres détails pour le confort des voyageurs. La cuisine a un minimum d'équipement pour se faire un repas, mais les restaurants dans le coin sont délicieux. Mary saura vous conseiller les meilleurs! Nous sommes restés 4 nuits et nous en aurions pris plus!"
1584362,17674156,2014-08-16,14786159,Gwyn,"The room was exactly as depicted and actually a little larger than expected. Many of the little things most would forget about were provided. (Like hangars in the closet, I mean, how thoughtful!) Unfortunately, my trip was a busy one and I wasn't left with much time to socialize, but my few interactions with the family was a positive one. Quick with restaurant suggestions, checking in when bringing up the coffee and muffins, and someone (?) playing the piano beautifully, the home seemed tranquil and a good place to relax."
1584362,17895733,2014-08-18,9269560,Félix,3 day trip! In a perfect spot! Loved the Fresh muffins in the morning :) thanx to the Carney family! Will come back for sure!
1584362,18032693,2014-08-20,1896574,Sam,"Carney family house is well suited for a short visit to Boston, it locates near Boston downtown with good transportation and car access. The house has all the amenities for its guests and the host Mary is very helpful to show us around the house and introduce the subway system. My family enjoyed the stay in their house very much. We will definitely stay in their house when visit Boston next time."
"The only thing is little bit unusual is that we were asked to move out the bedroom we rent by 9:00am in the next morning in order for the cleaning lady to clean the room. I hope Carney and Mary will find a more cooperating cleaner in the near future.\"",,,,,
1584362,18102202,2014-08-21,12518185,Tiago,"Carney's home was absolutely amazing and way above what we expected. Although we have stayed for only one night, I can easily say that it was the best Airbnb experience I've ever had. The house is complete, the bathrooms have towels and shampoos, and the breakfast is awesome (Barney's muffins are delicious!). It is very practical to get in and out the house and it is very safe! The housekeeper is very friendly and made us feel at home!"
"We will surely come back!\"",,,,,
1584362,18174286,2014-08-23,17194495,Alysia,"Our host was very welcoming and kind to us when we arrived, and provided us accurate and detailed description that made us easy to find the location. The neighborhood was quiet but convenient as it was close to a T Stop, and the house was lovely and we enjoyed our stay very much. The bathrooms were really clean, the room was nicely layout, and the breakfast nook was super thoughtful. My mom also said that when she visits Boston, she will definitely stay here again. Thank you Carney family for sharing your house with us!"
1584362,18620434,2014-08-29,17516219,Judith,"I can't wait to go back. This was my first airbnb and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Great driving directions. Clean and pleasant accommodations. Thoughtful hosts who anticipated your needs before you knew you had them.  Easy walk to public transportation and good food, a pleasant neighborhood to walk in."
1584362,18942635,2014-09-03,2083162,Tiffany,My parents and I had a really great stay here! I think this may have been one of our best Airbnb stays ever.
Mary and Barney were such wonderful hosts,and extremely accomodating. The room and bathrooms were beautiful and clean,and with 2 bathrooms shared between the guests,we rarely ever had to wait for one. The house is in a nice residential neighbourhood close to the beach,yet still very convenient to the city centre,even by public transit.
"I could not say enough good things about this place. Will definitely recommend this to everyone I know who is visiting Boston!\"",,,,,
1584362,19075118,2014-09-06,313937,Ginger,"We enjoyed our stay at the Carney's family. Good communications with withe hosts. House located close yo the train. Tasty muffins, fruits, and juice in the morning."
1584362,19151805,2014-09-07,5833378,Isabel,We really enjoyed our stay at this beautiful house and our room. We have wished we could stay longer! We felt really welcomed as Barney provided us with everything we needed. The location is perfect to explore Boston and the coast around. Especially the bathrooms and the view from the rooms were amazing! We definetely recommend this accomodation and would come back again.

1584362,20095039,2014-09-23,18051542,Iris,We very much enjoyed our stay with the Carney family.
Before we arrived Mary provided us with clear details on how to reach the house,and even how to check ourselves in in case she would not be home.,,,,
The house is lovely! Even though everything is shared,you have a lot of privacy. Everything was well arranged. There were even bathrobes and slippers in the room. It even felt more luxurious than it would be in a hotel,"especially for that price. But it's the \"\"home feeling\"\" that makes this place extra nice.",,,
"Would definitely recommend staying here.\"",,,,,
1584362,20196316,2014-09-25,8665857,Justína,"Our stay in this house was great. Everything was very nice and clean and the room was really cozy. We actually did not meet with any of our hosts, but it was easy to communicate with them when we had some problems. It was new experience for us,because it is a little bit different then other places where we have already spent some time, but it was amazing!"
1584362,20490455,2014-09-30,16406457,Charlotte,They are very kind and friendly! We especially love the muffins everyday in the morning! A great and safe place to stay!
1584362,20614653,2014-10-02,15066365,Li Da,Carney family are so kind and nice to us. Their breakfast is very rich. Their house has 115 years history. I recommend them very much.
1584362,20987535,2014-10-09,2786080,Diane,Nous avons grandement apprécié notre séjour chez Barney et Mary idéalement situé et Barney nous a bien rendu service. Nous y retournerons avec le plus grand plaisir.
1584362,21088524,2014-10-11,20166315,Jim,"A huge, beautiful old home awaited us after a brisk, 10 minute walk from the train from South Station. The home entry was split into two halves, left and right; with parts of the left first floor dedicated to an unused sitting room, and a kitchen for the guests. The right door of the entry was a stairway leading to our room on the third floor. The room was clean and large, across the hall from a bathroom with two toilet rooms, one also containing a shower. These rooms were beautiful, the shower one with a beautiful view of the harbor from the only place to sit in the room."
We were awakened early each morning by the low voices of those in the adjoining rooms,and I am sure they were kept up late into the evening by our conversation in our room. There is no TV,so time is spent online or in conversation.,,,
There is a Keurig coffee maker back down on the first floor,and in the morning a continental breakfast is provided in the common area on the third floor with fruit,coffee that is 1/2 decaf and 1/2 regular,and assorted bagels and granola offerings.,,
Our biggest complaint was the noise from the thin walls. The bed was firm,"but some like it like that. \"",,,,
1584362,21302814,2014-10-14,8442170,Valerie,"Great experience, just as explained. We enjoyed our stay!"
1584362,21371879,2014-10-15,22508536,Kevin,"This was an amazing place to stay.  For less than $100, you get a beautiful room in a classic well maintained 3 story home...nicely updated and luxurious bathrooms...fresh muffins, coffee, and fruit in the morning,  a short walk to the waterfront, only a few minutes walk to the Savin Hill T station, and best of all, only a 10-15 minute train ride to the downtown.  Why stay at a Super 8 in the suburbs or a fancy hotel, when for the same price, you can get all this value at Grace's Harbourview?"
1584362,21477071,2014-10-18,8116718,Jimmy,It was a good experience.
The house is beautiful,near to Boston and accesible,,,,

1584362,21520744,2014-10-19,11661620,Markus,"Perfect stopover experience. Arrived late and found everything as described. Barney and Mary had been very proactive with providing detailed info ahead of time. Nice and comfy room, coffee and muffin an unexpected bonus. Highly recommended."
1584362,21648327,2014-10-20,18110130,Cean,"Staying with the Carney is an example of why I love using airbnb. They were really nice when I arrived at their beautiful, cozy, and clean home. The room was very simple with a large desk for me to work on and a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was also very clean. They are about four or five stops from downtown Boston and their home is just under 10 min away by foot. I thought the location was great because it was removed enough where you could get some rest and experience what it's like to be a local, but close enough where you can enjoy the city in no time. Definitely coming back again!"
1584362,21778422,2014-10-24,5464985,Rebecca,"This is a nice, well-kept space in a lovely house that is easily accessible to Boston public transport. Mary and Barney were great hosts--providing helpful and timely information about getting there, checking in, and other information about sites, food, and transportation. It was nice to have breakfast as part of the stay in the morning--especially Barney's home-made muffins. This is one of several rooms in a bed and breakfast--which means shared bathroom space and other guests. Most of the time there weren't any problems with this--indeed, I met some other really fun people and enjoyed sharing time and stories in the evening with many of them. I was in Boston doing research at the JFK presidential library and this was a great location for that--I could walk to the library."
1584362,21946384,2014-10-27,11624560,Jose,"We had a great time at Barney and Mary's. They have wonderful home in a great location, easy to drive to. The room is cozy and clean. Bathrooms (2) are shared but always clean and accessible. The red line train takes you straight downtown Boston or to Cambridge (Harvard/MIT)."
1584362,22135687,2014-10-31,5464985,Rebecca,"My second time at the Carney's lovely home. Responsive and helpful hosts, listing was clean, well-maintainted, and as described. Nice street, convenient to subway (felt safe walking after dark)--and to the JFK presidential library where I was doing research (most of the time--you have to have a little fun in Boston!). Enjoyed meeting some of the other BnB guests."
1584362,22432213,2014-11-06,5221370,Kate,"We had a wonderful five night stay in Grace's Harborview room. The house itself is stunning and the room was spacious with a super comfortable bed. The two bathrooms were excellent and better than a luxury hotel! Waking each morning to delicious fresh muffins was an added bonus, as were the other breakfast goods available to guests. Barney and Mary were the perfect hosts and we would certainly love to stay again."

The neighbourhood is lovely and at a short walking distance from Savin Hill station where you can take the red line to South Station and town centre. The hosts are very welcoming and helpful. The house is probably one of the most beautiful places I have ever stayed; full of character, beautifully decorated, very clean and cosy. The rooms (as I had the pleasure of staying in two different rooms) are exactly as pictured, there's two bathrooms upstairs (no queuing in the morning!) and a cosy shared seating area with tea, coffee and muffins for breakfast!"

The accommodations were excellent: a beautiful house, very nice spacious and comfortable rooms, and a lot of small amenities that made it extra special (like fresh muffins in the morning). Mary and Barney are just wonderful people and they really go out of their way to make sure you are comfortable and that your needs are taken care of."

My stay was work related and they made sure I had everything I needed to feel comfortable and kept for. Along with my stay I got to listen to nightly piano music and singing by the Carney Family which was such a wonderful way to end the day.

I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend anyone to also:)"

There was always coffee, tea, hot water, and healthy snacks available. I stayed for 5 nights while attending a conference at the Boston Convention Center. 10 minute walk to the train station to the red line, which goes downtown, and to Cambridge etc. I'm so happy I stayed here instead of an overpriced hotel. There is some noise between rooms...but you get that at hotels too!"

1584362,30067737,2015-04-17,26743532,Murielle,"Un accueil chaleureux le 15 avril à notre arrivée dans cette somptueuse demeure, située à 5mn de marche de la station de métro Savon hill puis 10mn de la station Park street au centre de Boston, départ de la Freedom trail. Nous sommes restés 2 nuits, trop peu pour faire la connaissance de la famille Carney mais suffisamment pour apprécier le cadre, les savoureux muffins de Mary. A recommander encore et encore."
1584362,30373563,2015-04-21,869324,Robert,Barney and Mary made us feel very welcome when we arrived. The house is historic and large and in a community with similar type homes. They all have an individual character and it was nice to walk around the friendly neighbourhood to the nearby restaurants and metro station.
1584362,30865122,2015-04-28,28100682,Real,"Honnêtement, nous sommes déçus.  La maison nous apparaît comme un bon endroit pour dormir si vous êtes en déplacement d’affaires et assez abordable.  Mais pas pour des vacances, car vous serez réveillé peu après 7 heures AM par des déplacements, des chambreurs  ou des propriétaires qui parlent fort au téléphone.  Impossible, d’avoir des changements de serviettes ou de débarbouillettes sans avoir à le demander.  Les petits déjeuners promis ne sont pas toujours au rendez-vous, peut-être parce que d’autres gens passés avant nous ont trop consommé.  Nous avons eu un bel accueil, mais par la suite, le rapport avec les propriétaires a été plutôt froid. Bref, plusieurs petits irritants qui pourraient être réglés en établissant des règlements clairs pour tous. Un endroit conseillé que pour un court séjour de 1 ou 2 jours."
1584362,31172831,2015-05-03,8309715,Mandar,"Interaction with host was limited but pleasant. House is easy to find, well-organized and has access to the rail/subway system. Would recommend to anyone looking for a hassle-free stay near Boston."
1584362,31416961,2015-05-04,6858657,Grant,"What a great home! Super clean, super comfy, super cute! This was the closest to an old-school bed and breakfast that I've had with Aribnb. I sadly had virtually zero interaction with the hosts other than email, but everything was easy and smooth. If you are looking for a great spot to stay in this neighborhood in Boston, you cant go wrong."
1584362,31534793,2015-05-06,25034168,Anthony,"Barney is very kind and nice. I always has prompt response before my stay. Barney sent a very detail check in instruction that I feel peace of mind. During my stay Barney always offer help. He is just like Boston people, very nice! Every morning some delicious breakfast was ready. The house is located at a quiet neighborhood. It's good to walk around in the morning. It's just few minutes away to a sand beach. The house is cool. The antique furnitures and art works are my favourite. The room is cozy, clean and tidy. It's my first airbnb experience and I feel amazing to stay here. It's a pity that I can't spend more time with barney's family because we came back late everyday."
1584362,31866232,2015-05-11,17626770,Linda,"I was made to feel very welcome in the Carney Family home which is a lovely house, full of character. The room was very clean and comfortable and a lot of thought has gone into making life easier for the traveller i.e. microwave, laundry, hair dryer, juice in fridge and, of course, Mary's granola and Barney's muffins."
The neighbourhood is quiet,residential and within walking distance to a regular train service into town. It's definitely worth buying a 7 day pass for $16,even if you're not staying the full 7 days.,,,

1584362,32490704,2015-05-19,23829903,Diana,"Mary and Barney were one of the sweetest people! Descriptions of listing were very accurate and bathrooms were very clean especially. I visited Boston because of my sister's college graduation so we had a bouquet of flowers and Mary even gave us a vase for it - which I believe was way out of her way to make us feel at home! She was very accommodating and had a lovely house. Also, Barney's muffins were top-notch! Thank you for a great stay."
1584362,32979706,2015-05-24,17851366,Andrew,"We didn't have the opportunity to see the Carney family very often but the few times we did interact with them were pleasant. Everything they say about the stay is true - the free muffins in the morning, the fresh towels, and the excellent neighborhood. It was also extremely convenient that the house is 6 minutes walk from the T (Boston's metro system) especially since driving downtown is a nightmare. The entire place is run better than a hotel and feels way more inviting."
1584362,34844404,2015-06-13,24723289,James,"I had a fantastic first airbnb experience at the Carney's. The family were very friendly, welcoming, engaging and helpful, and the house is situated in a great neighbourhood, with plenty of places to eat and within walking distance to the nearest T stop. I came to Boston to conduct research at the JFK Library and would most definitely recommend the Carney family's house to any other researcher, as the Library is only a short 20 minute walk away. I'd also highly recommend the house to anyone else  coming to Boston. You can quickly get into the city or can take a short walk to the beach. I would definitely stay here again."

They are friendly and provide guests with fresh muffins, granola, fruit, juice, and tea/coffee in the morning (or any time throughout the day)! The rooms are spacious, clean, and beautifully decorated. There are a few bathrooms to use and shower in, all of which are immaculate and are supplied with towels, shampoo, etc. The location is perfect - as a first time & solo traveler in Boston, I was able to manuever the area with ease! The Red Line is less than a 10 minute walk from the house. Getting to and from the airport was no problem at all. You have a beautiful beach right in the backyard which is great for evenings you just want to relax. If you are looking for a safe, relaxed, welcoming place to stay and are traveling alone or with a group, come here!"

The house was immaculate, and our rooms were stocked with everything we needed, even though we were just staying one night. Mary was very kind and helpful with our questions needs, and her granola is out of this world. If I'm ever in Boston again, this will be the first place I'll stay."
1584362,37587809,2015-07-08,12967270,Hunter,"We had a short, sweet, and near-perfect stay with the Carney Family. Though we never got a chance to meet our hosts, their hospitality and care for their guests was abundantly present. There was a cool pitcher of water greeting us at the door along with fresh towels, a microwave, a mini fridge, and (I couldn't believe it) muffins."
The walk from the train was a bit of a trek,but there shouldn't be any hurry when walking through this lovely beach side neighborhood. As the hosts said,the train ride was about 30 minutes into town. Not at all an imposition getting to and from South Station and the Airport.,,,
If you're looking for a getaway,"I'd highly recommend this place!  I will be submitting a request very soon to stay again in August - I hope it works out! Thanks Carney Family! :)\"",,,,

They have 3 bedrooms they rent separately and there are 2 shared bathrooms. This was never an issue. Breakfast (homemade muffins and granola) and coffee is provided every morning. Delicious!

1584362,55863400,2015-12-06,46088858,Drexell,"Awesome listing! The Carney Family was super understanding about checking in at a later time. The area the house is located in is very close to other homes, I had to get used to that. Bathrooms looked like they were just redone, they were beautiful. The third floor was where the listing was located and it overlooked the main street. Right when I walked out of the room, there was a little common area for breakfast. Overall great experience!"
1584362,56791901,2015-12-18,3379013,Renaud,"Wonderful place to stay, Barney was really helpful, gave us a lot of indications before we arrived. This part of Dorchester was nice and close to the train to downtown Boston. Our room and common bathrooms were beautiful, quiet, and very clean. It was nice meeting kind people around breakfast. Again, great place. Would gladly come back again!"
1584362,56935526,2015-12-20,48861870,Maria,The Carney family was extremely welcoming. We had tons of privacy and we were given more than enough amenities. Their hospitality exceeded all of our expectations.
1584362,58010414,2015-12-31,16773725,K,"Barney and Mary's home is quintessentially Boston. Charming, spacious, with views that will make every traveller grateful they arrived there."
I stayed in Grace's Harborview Room and found it perfectly splendid. Situated on the third floor,the room was warm,comfortable,and made the perfect spot from which to watch snow fall across the neighborhood. With a nicely sized desk,coffee and tea right outside the door and an immaculate bathroom mere steps away,I could have holed up there for days if my projects didn't take me out into the city.
What makes staying here special are Barney and Mary and their family and friends. They are kind and engaging,and your stay will be made absolutely memorable if you have a chance to interact with them.,,,,

The room was perfectly clean, the shared bathrooms looked like they came out of an interior design magazine, and each room had towel racks, table, and a safe. In the shared kitchen/lounge there are freshly baked muffins, granola, milk, coffee, and everything you need. A washing machine and dryer are also available. Truly a great find."

The Carney Family provided me with clear and detailed instructions about getting to my room from the T (only 10 minute walk). The added touches of homemade granola, muffins, and coffee each morning were very nice and made my stay comfortable. As others have mentioned, the bathrooms were clean and beautiful- though others were staying in the house I never had to wait to shower or use the restroom. When I'm next in Boston, I will definitely be staying here again."

방은 사진과 다르지 않았고 이용하기 깨끗했습니다. 욕실도 청결하게 준비되어 있었고 샴푸와 바디클렌저,깨끗한 수건을 충분히 이용할 수 있었습니다. 1층의 부억과 세탁시설,조리 도구와 거실도 편안하게 이용할 수 있습니다.,,,
보스턴 다운타운(South Station,Back bay)가 아니기 때문에 시내로는 이동을 해야 하지만 Red line 지하철 역(Savin hill)에서 쉽게 걸어갈 수 있는 거리이고 주택가이기 때문에 오히려 낮에 여행한 후 쉬기 좋습니다.,,,,
와이파이 이용을 얼마든지 무료로 할 수 있고 비앤비 사이트에서 보여진 것 보다 더욱 편안하고 청결하게 이용할 수 있는 곳입니다.,,,,,
내가 머문 3층에서도 냉장고와 식기들을 배치해 3층에 머무는 사람들이 이용할 수 있고,"Mary가 구워준 머핀과 자유롭게 내려 마실 수 있는 커피를 매일 먹을 수 있는 것도 좋았습니다. 부부가 나에게 친절하게 대해주었고 이 집에서 머물러서 첫 미국여행에서 좋은 추억을 만들었습니다.\"",,,,

Grace's room was awesome, my friend had the bed and I am small enough to have fit on the cot and it was very comfy. The room and the furniture was very cute and I love the overall view from the home."

Appreciated the options for breakfast-tea kettle as well as coffee maker, frig well stocked with o. j., milk, yogurt, jam; granola, fresh fruit, homemade muffins and English muffins available. Luxurious bathrooms. Easy parking and short walk to public transit."
My only challenge was getting my luggage up and down the steep,shallow stairs,although it was clearly stated in the listing that the room was on the third floor. If you have physical challenges,this may not be the best place for you.,,
"Will happily return-with less luggage.\"",,,,,
1584362,65834021,2016-03-17,49125142,Ruth,My friend and I loved everything about this listing. Our stay in Grace's Harbor view room was quite the experience to remember. The Carney's house was full of character and it's clear that they've been taking great care of the house.
Barney had also allowed for us to store our luggage at their home even before checking. This made it easier for us to start exploring the city right away without having to carry luggage around. The T (Boston metro) was also less than 10 minutes away,making this a super convenient location.,,,,
So glad we were able to find this place! We were out exploring most of the time so we didn't get to meet the homeowners but having a cozy room to retreat to during the night really made our stay at the Carneys feel like home. Not to mention,"breakfast is always ready in the morning when we wake up. Will definitely stay at their house again in my next visit! \"",,,,
1584362,66868715,2016-03-25,30605165,Eduardo,"Very very nice house. Barney and Mary are so kind and hospitable. The room and bathrooms are really bright, clean and big. It's quiet happy that every morning when you get up you can enjoy several delicious fresh muffins and tea o coffee for breakfast. But my favorite part of this house is that it is surrounded by music. When I was there I could always hear an amazing piano player playing exquisite melodies and once an incredible female singer singing with young but rich melodic timbre. I hated to disturb so I lost my chance to greet them. Sincerely hope that I will be able to have another chance to stay here again in the future and become acquainted with those musicians."

The neighbourhood was safe and pretty and the house was very easily accessible from the T. Barney provided clear and useful instructions on how to get there from the airport and check into my room, making my arrival very easy. The room itself was exactly as listed with a comfortable bed, plenty of storage, and no problems with the shared bathrooms. And, of course, Barney's muffins were fantastic to wake up to every morning! All in all I had a brilliant stay and would love to return to the Carneys' house one day."

Be wary and read closely the rules they have on restrictions in and outside the house and double check when there on where you can and cannot go.

We made good use of the T-Line to get into the city which was a short 5 minute walk from the house. We never saw the host but the house was kept open, which may be a security issue for some. We were welcomed to leave our bags early and then late until we left town. There were several other guests so you may be waiting for a bathroom at peak times and the hardwood floors are noisey with the common area right outside our door, overall it felt like a nice hostel.

1584362,98915669,2016-09-02,12096536,Marie,I am a regular at the Carney's.I stay with them all the time and would not stay anywhere else.
4044840,19704847,2014-09-16,6182399,Stuart,"Amazing place and Heskel was a great communicator. The apartment is in a great location, beautiful and spacious. The only down side is the shower/bathroom which could do with an update everything else was brilliant."
4044840,20519639,2014-09-30,14638923,Ryan,"The property was furnished & as described.  They did do us a favor & got us into the unit to drop off our luggage earlier than check in so that we could enjoy the sites before we took occupancy, thank you very much for that."
The check in procedure was slightly difficult due to the lockbox code/lockbox not functioning properly.  There was only one set of key's left,so when we were let in by the apartment managers we still did not have keys to access the property.  I cannot say that Churchill was not pleasant to deal with on all occasions,because they were.  The hassle was the fact that things were not as they should have been.  The unit did need some maintenance that was deferred as well.  Overall,we loved the place,dealing with Churchill was not bad,& dealing with the property's on site apartment management was pleasant as well.  Would we recommend it
4044840,21317780,2014-10-14,4069786,William,"Very nice apartment. Extremely easy, convenient process for getting in and out. Great host!"
4044840,22918633,2014-11-17,11092430,Melanie,"My husband and I enjoyed staying here for a long weekend while we visited our son, who is a student at Northeastern. Great location, very close to the Prudential Center, Newberry St, Copley Place and Northeastern. There were welcome goodies waiting for us, and plenty of towels, pillows and blankets. Kitchen was well-stocked, and we appreciated having coffee provided for our first morning. Bed and all furnishings were comfortable. When we requested a very late checkout, it was no problem at all, and responses were always swift and pleasant. The bathroom is a bit dated and could use some sprucing up, but was sufficient (It stands out only because the rest of the apartment is so modern and nice). Only downside was that this particular apartment #210 has a public off-leash dog park *right* outside the windows, and we could hear dogs barking and people talking early in the morning, and once late at night. In future, I'd request to be in a different unit if possible. Having said that, I won't hesitate to stay again with Heskel or Churchill Suites. Great experience."
4044840,25066503,2015-01-05,3744103,Thomas,"\"Great experience! place is as pictured, clean upon arrival, towels and small bag of toiletries.  A few wobbly legs on the dinning room chairs, but nothing that really mattered.  There is onsite parking available for an additional fee, for anyone unfamiliar with bostons resident only parking, this is a huge plus.  Overall Great location. 2 minute walk to the Prudential.  multiple T lines within walking distance.  An avenue over from the \"\"hipster\"\" part of town.  Would stay again without hesitation.\""
12308161,70597771,2016-04-18,22628923,Chad,"We loved staying at Evelyn's place! It's in a great neighborhood, close to good restaurants and a short walk from downtown and Fenway. Or if you don't feel like walking it's a cheap Uber ride as well. Also only a 15-20 minute ride from the airport. The house and room itself are very clean. And Evelyn is an awesome host that's easy to talk to and hang out with. She was always available for questions right away. Really use her recommendations! The sushi place and coffee shop she recommends are very good. We would definitely want to stay with her again if we are in Boston again"

12308161,75295554,2016-05-20,61717290,Rachel,"Stayed at Evelyn's for just a couple nights. Place is exactly as depicted if not better in person! Super home-y with simple, neat decorations. High ceilings make the place feel extra spacious. The bed is wonderfully large and takes up majority of the bedroom if leg room is a concern. Location is EXTREMELY convenient with great food and the T just a few minutes walk away. Evelyn herself is amiable and prepared - she even made a binder with guides, maps and other useful information."
12308161,75963998,2016-05-23,58262456,Christopher,"All I can say is Evelyn was fantastic! She was easy to reach at all times if we needed anything or had any questions. The room is as described, comfy and cozy! The location is spot on! Massachusetts Ave is a main street so we walked to Fenway Park for a game, 25min walk but it's busy and you get to see the architecture of the city. The train is like a 5 min walk from her house and you're in downtown Boston within 15mins. We absolutely loved staying there and Evelyn was amazing. We accidentally left some jewelry and contacted Evelyn while we were at the airport waiting to board. She had it packaged and ready to ship to us before we got home! She's amazing!!! Thank you for everything Evelyn!"

12308161,79407061,2016-06-12,20917013,Nick,"Fits description - very convenient, cozy, and clean flat in Boston near Northeastern University. Evelyn is very accommodating and nice. The living room of the location is a little noisy with street traffic, however the bedroom is away from the noise and is hardly audible. The location is good, and near train station, bus stops, and walking distance to a bike rental."
We're Asian,so we were used to removing our shoes when entering,so long as you're cool with that,you're good.  The house is clean,bed comfortable,"and a convenient location.\""

12308161,88523826,2016-07-24,13759016,Barbara,"I had a great stay at Eve's Centrally Located Brownstone in Boston.  Eve made me feel very welcome from the moment I arrived.  Her home is very comfortable, spacious and clean.  My room had a comfy bed with high quality linens.  I appreciated her notebook with useful information about things to do in the  neighborhood  The location was great--very close to mass transit, shopping, and restaurants.   I felt safe in the neighborhood.  I hope to be able to stay with Eve on my next visit to Boston!"

12308161,93958575,2016-08-14,84010621,Tiffany,"Eve was a great host! She was very available to answer questions we had about Boston and the apartment. The room even had a small binder with local places to eat/shop/explore, maps of the T, and more! The brownstone was very cute, and the room stayed pretty cool with just a small fan, despite the heat in Boston the weekend we were there. The brownstone was just a short (maybe 8-10 minutes) walk to the T green line, which can take you into central Boston. The towels she provided were also incredibly soft and luxurious."
The two small negatives to the apartment: 1) a loud/squeaky mattress. It didn't bother me,but the person I shared the bed with was a VERY light sleeper and woke up when I went to the bathroom. 2) no coffee maker in the apartment (though good coffee shops were close by!),,,,
Overall - I would definitely recommend for your next trip to Boston. Great value,good location,"fantastic host. \"",,,

10627514,67298161,2016-03-28,34227900,Evan,Really good place to stay in Boston. Orion and his wife make you feel welcome in their house. The neighborhood is pretty calm and close to the T so you can access to Boston downtown quickly.

The condo was beautiful, clean and plenty of room for the 4 of us! The added bonus was the garage parking and patio! The neighborhood was great with plenty of restaurants and grocery stores nearby! I can't say enough about this airbnb experience. We have travelled many places and stayed in airbnb many times. Elizabeth's place is one of the best! Thank you, Elizabeth, for your hospitality!"
2412715,32244063,2015-05-16,19602363,Hiroko,We stayed at Elizabeth's brand new condo. Very spacious and clean! It was easy walking distance to the Seaport area.

13295184,80273740,2016-06-17,76654110,Josh,"This was a great location. The apartment was clean, easily accessible, and very comfortable for 7 guests. Paige was great to work with and the listing was exactly as she described. She responded quickly to communication and offered up information about Beacon Hill and the Boston area.  We will be dealing with her again for future visits to Boston and the experience of the other guests have them looking at Airbnb for their future travel accommodations."
13295184,83035910,2016-06-30,799319,Christopher,"Great location: a quiet street on Beacon Hill, a block from Charles Street, a couple blocks from the subway, close to Whole Foods and lots of restaurants. The property manager, Paige, was friendly and quick to respond."
The apartment was clean with plenty of space for our three person group,and the furnishings were uncluttered and basic. Maybe a little too basic,since it’s missing small things like coffee mugs/cups,a cutting board,extra towels for our five night stay,more than one lamp in most rooms.... There’s a small window air conditioner in the front of the apartment
I should add that we initially selected and were approved by Paige for a different apartment. A couple weeks before our arrival Paige noted an issue with that apartment and suggested we switch to this unit (which was fine) and even offered a discount of roughly ten percent. The apartment we stayed in was a new listing,"and I’m guessing that the things I mentioned have been resolved.\"",,,,
13295184,83540993,2016-07-03,7455037,Zicong,good communication with the host. The apartment is big and its location is so good.

13295184,87494891,2016-07-20,65938771,Marie-France,"Quand nous avons organisé notre séjour à Boston, je crois que  cet appartement n'était pas proposé. Nous en avions choisi un autre et nous avons appris 48 h avant que la transaction était annulée."
Mais finalement quelle chance ! Cela nous a permis d'habiter cet appartement idéalement situé en plein coeur de Beaconhill,à 100 mètres de la station de métro Charles qui permet d'aller partout dans les autres quartiers de Boston mais également à Cambridge et,très intéressant,à l'aéroport de façon directe. Et nous avions beaucoup de bagages... L'appartement lui même est grand avec de larges espaces de rangement,une grande table avec 6 chaises et une salle de bain très pratique avec 2 entrées. La seule chose qui me semble souhaitable,c'est d'ajouter un ventilateur dans la chambre du fond. Il y a une climatisation dans le séjour
Pour finir,"Paige est extrêmement réactive et agréable et elle a a \"\"sauvé\"\" notre séjour à Boston en quelques échanges de courriel.",,,,
"Merci encore !\"",,,,,
13295184,87832072,2016-07-22,13992281,Kristina,"We absolutely loved our stay in this great Beacon Hill apartment. We were steps away from a few great cafes and juice bars and within a short walk from the downtown core where we went for lots of nice meals. The apartment was clean, spacious and exactly as shown. We had everything we needed, including laundry detergent to run a few loads of laundry (a major bonus when travelling!). I would recommend this apartment (or another one of Paige's units) to anyone visiting Boston!"
13295184,87996706,2016-07-22,37328876,Ken,Paige does a great job with communication and would stay in her properties again when I get a chance.
13295184,95089134,2016-08-18,170763,Maryann,"Paige was a very responsive host and her assistant Amber was great. Anything we needed, they were all over it! The neighborhood can't be beat. We needed to be close to the hospitals in the area and this location was a 4-block walk away. Win! Plenty to see and do close by, as well as food options. And quiet. Other guests in the building were quiet too, which we really appreciated. There was plenty of space for the two of us and all our stuff and we were close to a supermarket so we could cook for ourselves some of the time. Thanks for a great stay! Oh, and there is a garage just a block away at 144 Charles St where you can park a car for $22/night if you book online in advance using a parking app like SpotHero. Seems steep but really it's a bargain in that neighborhood if you've come with a car."

David was very helpful and friendly.  Would definitely stay here again."

4405982,30437807,2015-04-22,22937802,Joel,This place is fantastic! My family of seven and I were all very well situated and found we had everything we needed. Beds are soft and comfortable. Plenty of space in each of the rooms. All amenities worked great.
Location was as good as I could have wanted it. Groceries are just around the corner. Plenty of easy carry out and nice dining within walking distance. Public transport is just a hop,skip,and jump away.,,,
If you are a light sleeper,be aware that with this house - just as with any house this age,sounds will just travel better than in a soundproof hotel room.,,,
I could almost have been selfish enough to give this place just one star so that I could keep this gem hidden to myself. But,David was a great host and you should patronize his apartment. If I can help it,though,"I call dibs for next year's Boston Marathon.\"",,
4405982,32885349,2015-05-23,18281133,Martin,"Great space! Clean, good amenities. Wifi and cable TV worked great. Nice little kitchen.

Everything you need is here, from kitchen to bath to wifi to TV; plenty of space; comfortable beds, etc. The Jamaica Plain neighborhood is beautiful; especially tremendous if you're an avid runner or just love to stroll around town. The area is filled with excellent and widely varied restaurants."
The T train Orange Line is a 1/3 of a mile walk away - we used it every day. The 39 bus line is a few feet away on Centre Street - we used it once,"but it's very convenient. We bought a week pass for $20 for unlimited train and bus. No need to rent a car; it'll be a hassle!\"",,,,

4405982,39065594,2015-07-20,23230439,Kate,"David was probably the easiest and most accommodating host I've ever worked with on Airbnb. He was helpful, extremely responsive and made us feel right at home! The house is absolutely stunning and even more beautiful than what the photos depict. The dinning room table extends and the beds were super comfortable and the kitchen was fully stocked and very nice. The location is also in a perfect location - the quiet neighborhood of Jamaica Plains and 5 minute walk to the pond and a 0.5 mile walk to the Stony Brook Orange Line Stop. There is a CVS right around the corner, a grocery store (Stop & Shop) about 0.75 miles away, a Whole foods even closer, and so many delicious restaurants within walking distance (highly recommend Tres Gatos and JP Licks). I would highly recommend staying here!"

4405982,76814561,2016-05-29,47793004,Gigi,"I had guests for convocation and they stayed here.  If possible, I would give 10 stars to David's apartment.  It is beautiful, well equipped, renovated (tough to find in Boston) and clean.  The rooms are large, the beds are comfy,  the bathrooms are modern, there are plenty of towels, the kitchen has everything you need, the wifi is clear and a large screen tv awaits in the living room.  The location is ideal with Whole Foods, restaurants, Jamaica Pond and transit close by.  Keyless entry and street parking make it all easy.  It was extremely hot during their stay and the central a/c worked perfectly.  My guests were thrilled with the apartment."

The keyless entry is a huge convenience for a larger group (which this apartment can handle) and it's about a 20 minute Uber ride to downtown (can be 30 at rush hour).  Very convenient to Fenway Park and Back Bay neighborhoods.  Having CVS a block away was very handy.  David was very accessible via text or email.  Thanks again!"

He was very prompt to reply, and was flexible to meet our needs of leaving our luggage for a few hours on the final day, as well as providing two sets of keys. The location was exactly where we wanted to be.  We enjoyed the neighborhood very much.  The general space of the apartment was good for the two of us.  The bedroom is large, and the couch was comfortable.  We would have appreciated more lighting in the living room and space in the fridge.  The bathroom is on the small side, but the shower and water pressure were fine."

The Boston common park is close by too and there's a lovely running or walking trail along the river a 5 min walk from apartment. I recommend this place and Can as it was hassle free!

Her place was a 5-7 minute walk to Fenway and was also close enough to walk to Newbury St. for great shops and restaurants.

She is a terrific host and welcomed me on my arrival with new slippers, fresh towels, toiletries and lovely food from Wholefoods. She then showed me around her  home and ensured I knew how to use the wifi, coffee machine, etc. She also showed me how get around the area and pointed out the nearest T stop which was just minutes away.  The bedroom is extremely comfortable with ample closet space which allowed me to hang up my clothes and feel really at home. Additionally, Tricia had an extra heater (the house was warm too) in my room just in case I got cold and needed it - so thoughtful. Tricia also provided a range of tasty food for breakfast each morning and this made my stay even nicer. Before I left Tricia even helped me to print my boarding pass for my flight. She is really kind and her home is extremely clean, comfortable, quiet and cozy. I would highly recommend staying here!"

The location was also very convenient for me as I was interviewing at the nearby med center. In regards to Tricia, she makes sure you have anything you could need: towels, snacks, a room to yourself, and she was very flexible with my hectic schedule while I was in town. Overall, a fantastic experience and would recommend it to anyone visiting the area."

4160585,41403301,2015-08-07,37479621,Tiffany,"I chose to stay with Tricia based on other reviews and the location. Just as so many others, this was a great stay. I had a nightmare trip - cancellations, delays, layovers - and Tricia was kind enough to pick me up from the train stop so I didn't have to drag all my luggage up the hilly streets of Boston."

The house was perfect, and Tricia had thoughtfully provided many little helpful things (like a cup by the sink for my toothbrush) so that it didn't feel like I was encroaching on her space. The room was very neat and clean, and the bed was SO comfortable. Tricia's house is quite close to the train (or trolly) so the commute into the city was very easy. I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in Boston! I'd recommend the room to anyone."

The environment was very relaxing & clean. The fluffy bath towels, the lavender soap, the place setting for breakfast, the coffee, fruit, english muffins and more were a welcome treat when so far from home. I would highly recommend this listing....Thanks Tricia, you may hear from me again if visiting Boston"

She is very considerate in her communication ensuring that you feel comfortable and have what you need. She has a pure and simple approach that makes you feel welcome immediately.
Her home is very well kept and the location is just great,very peaceful and quiet. My purpose of staying with Tricia was due to some private business in the Brookline area - so,"in that regard the location was also perfect and close to public transportation too. All in all I simply felt close to being at home.\"",,,
4160585,65393256,2016-03-13,1554350,Sarah,"Tricia is the nicest hostess I have come across during my travels using Airbnb. She was very hospitable and made a great effort to respect your privacy. She was also easily accessible if you had a question (through the Airbnb message system or through text). Tricia added some small touches which made a big difference: she gave me my own space in the medicine cabinet, bag of toiletries (shampoo/conditioner, body wash and lotion), special space for my dental hygiene, and place setting in the kitchen every morning. Also almost every room had a nice bouquet of flowers which was inviting and the house had superb natural sunlight. She had items in the fridge for guests to prepare breakfast at their leisure. The home was very clean. Before arriving, I was nervous about the parking situation. When I arrived, I was pleased to find there is a lot of space to (URL HIDDEN) I wouldn't worry about that if you stay here. The house is close to a T and also a bus stop. If you are a jogger/walker she is close to Olmstead park. Parts of Boston can be very noisy. Tricia's neighborhood is QUIET; which was a gift!!! I only wish this was open to couples, because I would love to stay her with my husband the next time we visit Boston. If you are traveling alone for business, etc, this would be the place to stay."
4160585,71045471,2016-04-23,65161084,Vince,"I cannot speak highly enough of Tricia and her hosting of me. She is a fantastic individual who is kind, responsive and caring to the needs and unknowns a visitor to Boston will face. The room is beautifully furnished, as is her home, and very accessible."
My time was taken up by work at Harvard Medical School,which is a 20 minute walk or quick trip on the Green T-line away. The station is within a block and just perfect if you're in town for the medical district.,,,,
Again,thank you for a great stay! I will definitly try to stay here when I return,"which is the best recommendation I can provide. \"",,,
4160585,74039683,2016-05-12,51599383,David,Tricia was very helpful and accommodating. She provided appropriate information regarding the amenities in the surrounding area and suggestions for transportation. I would definitely stay here again.

Great location near hospitals and museem of fine arts."

Bathroom is ok. The two other apartments in the building were quiet during our 3-day stay. Free parking is available in the area, though you may have to drive around for 5-10 minutes to find a spot. There are several small supermarkets within walking distance. The $99 per night rate is a superb deal for Boston, though keep in mind that this is not the fanciest part of the city. My family and I felt very safe, and it is less than a 10-minute walk to the subway station."
2441095,13602679,2014-06-01,9648722,Sharon,"Shawn was helpful & easy to get in touch with. The apartment was small, but cute & everything we needed. The neighborhood was fine. Close to Tstop."
2441095,14271252,2014-06-16,13714768,Kwasi,"I booked Shawn's apartment for my parents' one week stay in Boston. My parents enjoyed the experience immensely. The apartment was clean and well maintained. My parents had no issues with the facilities. Even though the neighborhood was unfamiliar to my folks in the beginning, they quickly felt comfortable, and even ventured out for walks to the local grocery store. Shawn was also amazingly accommodating to my parents. He was gracious enough to give my parents an extended for a couple of hours when he found out that the official check out time was close to 12 hours before my parents' flight out of Boston!"
2441095,14973222,2014-06-30,6336521,Greg,"The apartment was exactly as described: clean, comfortable, and conveniently located. Parts of the neighborhood were a little rough around the edges, but we always felt safe and weren't bothered by any noise from outside or in the building. Shawn arranged for an early check in so we could leave our luggage and head out for some sightseeing earlier than expected. For travelers looking to save a few dollars and still have a comfortable place to stay, Shawn's apartment is a great choice."
2441095,15322603,2014-07-07,4691701,Julie,"Nous étions deux couples et avons passé un très beau séjour à Boston! Nous avons apprécié l'appartement.  Il se trouve à quelques minutes à peine du Métro, ce qui facilitait les déplacements.  L'appartement était propre et près à nous accueillir avec le nécessaire en place.  Très bon choix!"
2441095,16244212,2014-07-24,13899670,Fiona,"Easy instructions from the host, apartment within easy walking distance of Logan Airport and the T station network. Quiet , pleasant area with local corner shops for all needs. Apartment has secure, multi-key access, good air-con, great shower,good TV and Wi-Fi. Very clean and tidy, with everything you need at hand, and would have no hesitation in using it again. Highly recommended indeed!"
2441095,16463718,2014-07-28,12111093,Rauhdah,"Shawn was prompt in answering our queries by email. However, it would have been better if queries can be replied by phone as we did not have wifi access outside the apartment and had difficulties to track email responses. Wifi is excellent. Couldn't ask for better reception!!"
The apartment was very clean and presentable. However,it would be good if there are full-length mirrors in the apartment. The mattresses were too soft for our likings.,,,,
We had difficulties transporting our luggages to the 2nd floor of the apartment. Hence,it might be better for those who travel light.,,,,
The apartment was near the Airport metro station,which is very convenient. As both of us were women travelling on our own,we didn't feel safe walking back to our apartment at night as the walkways were quite dark.,,,
"\"",,,,,
2441095,16659018,2014-07-31,8264859,Sandi & Gary,"We enjoyed our time at this location.  Shawn was easy to reach and quick to respond before we got there to answer questions.  Access to the property was easy and pain free.  The apartment itself was safe, clean and comfortable.  The queen bed was very soft...almost too soft.  Would highly recommend adding full length mirrors on the backs of the bedroom doors.  With 4 of us trying to get ready in the mornings (3 of us women), it was challenging.  On street parking was also challenging but doable.  At the time of our departure, however, they were working on the street outside of the property so were closing on street parking for a while."
As described,the Airport T stop was just up the street,an easy walk.  At night,we felt safe enough walking back.,,
We would consider this property again in the future and would recommend to friends heading to Boston.,,,,,

2441095,18179902,2014-08-23,17865122,Juan,We had a wonderful time on our Boston trip. The room was perfect for us. It's very close to the Subway station and Logan airport. The apartment was spacious and very clean. There is food places and markets allover this place. Make sure to check out Kellys Pub one block away for delicious food and drinks. The east Boston neighborhood is much quieter than downtown. It was perfect for the four of us. Shawn was very helpful when we would contact him.
2441095,19192668,2014-09-08,2603726,Rob,We were a bit disappointed with this apartment in Boston. Somehow the descriptions we had read in the reviews did not seem to match the reality. According to our standards the apartment was not entirely clean. It is clear that nobody actually lives there. Everything seems a bit old and used. The beds are not super comfortable. On the other side it is quite spacious and well connected to the airport and subway system. Shawn has been very responsive and nice. We had our flight in the evening and he let us do a late check-out which was much appreciated!

The location is close to the Metro and an easy link to the city centre, however there is a bit of litter around the neighbourhood. The apartment was comfortable although the kitchen and bathroom could have been left a bit cleaner."
2441095,20491590,2014-09-30,13279091,Jamie,"We had a great time on our trip to Boston. Shawn was a very helpful and responsive host. The apartment is, as advertised, close to the T and very accessible to and from Logan Airport, and Uber-friendly (It took us about 15 minutes to get to Fenway via Uber). The apartment was relatively clean, although the bathroom could have used a bit more love. The beds are a bit uncomfortable but overall a very nice apartment and good experience, particularly for the price. My family and I enjoyed the experience of not staying in a hotel and being able to explore East Boston."

Roughly $20 cab to go into the city ($17 Uber to get to the South End) beds were decent, didnt cook so we didnt use the kitchen. Linens and towels were provided. Overall, good stay."

2441095,27184187,2015-02-27,21267240,Molly,"Comfortable two bedroom apartment in Eastie. The most important thing for us was that there was unrestricted street parking. Shawn assured me that there was. Even with the massive amount of snow Boston has, we were able to find street parking within a block every evening - once right in front of the building."
Beds are comfortable,"everything is clean and as described. Plenty of towels. The cable channels worked and the internet was fast. The neighborhood was quiet and there are a bunch of local restaurants and bars within walking distance. \"",,,,
2441095,27995174,2015-03-16,1149335,George,"A nice apartment, very clean and as pictured in the listing. We did not meet the host, but he was very responsive to phone requests. I had accidentally erased his email with the lockbox code, and he gave it to me after I arrived at the apartment. The location is excellent with plenty of shopping, restaurants and a wonderful little bakery just around the corner on Bennington. In the other direction is a convenient 99 Cent + department store and Kelly's Pub. Rino's Place, one of the highest-ranked restaurants in all of Boston, is one long block away on Saratoga St. There is baseboard heating in the apartment and it was easy to control the temperature. My wife and I slept in different rooms so she could be warm and I could be cool. I thought the bed was comfortable, she found it too soft. The only problem we had was that the hot water ran out in the morning while she was showering."
2441095,28230070,2015-03-20,444646,Anthony,"Shawn has a fairly decent place. It's pretty no frills, but if you're just looking for a place to crash, then this is your spot. Taking a shower in the morning is a bit tricky, as the hot water runs out. The TV is satellite, so it was a bit sketchy. We weren't able to watch a soccer match and 1 of our weekly TV shows because of long blackouts. Be sure to bring your own soap. It's basic, so I wouldn't really recommend it for couples, but it would definitely be a good look for young people or back packers just looking to have a place to crash. You need to stay several nights to balance out the $99 cleaning fee, as it adds quite a bit to your overall cost. It's extremely close to the airport, which is a huge plus and public transportation is close.  Checking in and out was seamless. I think the best thing was the fact that Rino's was two blocks over.  It's an excellent Italian restaurant that was featured on the food network, so thank you to the previous reviewer who alerted us to it."
2441095,30658389,2015-04-26,21692935,Vickie,"The location is great because it is so close to the airport and the metro line.  Also some really cute pubs within blocks.  We were there for only one night - for a layover- and it was the best deal in town for 4 people and convenient.  I didn't appreciate paying a $99 cleaning fee for just a few hours stay. Shawn says he has a professional cleaning team that will meet and exceed our expectations - they didn't.  It wasn't unclean, but.....  it suited our needs though."
2441095,31743773,2015-05-09,30245926,Jen,"\"Shawn was quick to respond to text messages and put himself at our disposal \"\"24-7.\"\"   We flew into Logan Int'l"

Found the bed to be a bit creaky, but it was bearable for one night. Overall, a decent place, and I wish I could have spent more than one night there!"
2441095,32499549,2015-05-19,10282374,Doris,"\"We never met the host, however the electronic communication level was very good.  He offered to allow us to check in early as the place was vacant at the time, but we didn't take up that offer since we weren't getting in until later in the evening.  Some things that were great about the location were very close to the subway station, lots of ethnic restaurants in the neighbourhood, felt very safe walking around at anytime of the day and night, place was very clean upon arrival, and all appliances and electronics worked well, especially the wi-fi.  Some things that you need to be mindful of is the hot water runs out after about 15 minutes of running the shower, there's a plane landing/taking off within audible range about once an hour, the cable is good for 90% of the stations (about 200+ stations), but poor for the other 10%, and the bed was a bit too short for my boyfriend (who is 5'11\"\")."
One helpful hint if you're renting here is that there's 3 keys to open 3 doors.  The keys are colour coded,so remember to use the Green,Red,"and Yellow keys in that order from the outside door to the inside door.  We were standing at the front door for about 2 minutes attempting the keys over and over again.\"",,
2441095,33768286,2015-06-01,15179008,Sebastien,Shawn was really prompt to answer the questions. It is a self check in / check out.
The neighborhood is popular,few bodega around and the subway airport station is 5 min away by foot.,,,,
The apartment was not as good as what is in the listing,the mattress of both beds needs to be changed. The apartment wasn't really clean when we came in,Shawn got it clean for us. The AC was not working in the living room,the attempt to get it changed failed.,,

The bad. no AC in bedroom 2. 1 lightbulb in the 3 bulb fixture in the kitchen. I lamp in the Living room. 2 lamps/1 bulb in BR1. No door knob in BR 1..deadbolt and shoelace! Bed is in an alcove,so even tho the room is large,no lamp or table fits next to the bed. BR 2 - the bed is too large for the tiny room,so one side is against the wall and the bed is against the window making it difficult to get out on one side. 1 mirror-only in the bathroom making it hard for getting ready in the am. Cabinet doors missing or hanging off in kitchen.,,

Anreise und Abreise verliefen absolut unkompliziert. Die Wohnung hat uns gefallen. Um Boston kennenzulernen ist die Lage der Wohnung sehr gut. In der Umgebung findet man alles was man im Urlaub braucht (vom Mietwagen bis zum Supermarkt). Shawn ist ein guter Gastgeber und ich würde erneut bei ihm wohnen.

The apartment was comfortable but I think a few things need to be addressed.,,,,,
The apartment comes equipped with kitchen but no dish towels are provided and we did clean up after ourselves but doing dishes without dish towels is not easy.,,,,,
The bath towels were pretty old and I could not tell if the 2 hanging in the bathroom were used or not.   Very disconcerting.   For a $99.00 cleaning fee you want to know everything is clean.,,,,,
The lighting in the living room is inadequate for reading. We did spend 3 days in the apartment and ended up moving lamps around.,,,,,

Really nice thick towels and new linens, all very clean. Super fast WiFi. Apartment was cleaned well, but shows its age in parts like the bathroom. Since the apartment is in East Boston, the immediate neighborhood is not touristy and is very diverse. It has some interesting cheap eats (Santarpio's pizza, good Mexican/Central American food) nearby. The location is easy to get to more central locales and downtown because of the proximity of the T."
2441095,53298094,2015-11-07,28937340,Carolyn,"Shawn is open to variable check-in times if the space is available.  Photos are as the apartment appears, and as described by other reviewers.  I found it to be clean and comfortable.  East Boston is East Boston.  If you're driving and want to save time getting into downtown Boston, you're going to pay the tunnel tolls.  This apartment was on the second floor of a quiet building nearby at least 3 convenience stores within 2 block space.  There were also a few restaurants within walking distance, which I did not try, but I got delivery a few times from a restaurant further away, which occurred with no issues.  Shawn was very responsive when I had an issue (that turned out to be a non-issue), and was really kind and great about follow-up of the non-issue.  Super responsive host and positive Airbnb experience."

He was also beyond helpful with some last minute changes that I needed to make. Overall I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a great place in the Boston area.
2441095,64563459,2016-03-05,38301828,Mk,"Overall, this apartment was well worth the price. Shawn was incredibly prompt with his replies. Within moments of sending him a message, he'd reply with plenty of helpful details. The apartment was good for what we needed - a place to crash for the week. It could use a little bit of updating; the bathroom specifically is in need of a facelift. Street parking in Eastie is always a beast. If you have a car, you might need to take 3 or 4 spins around the block before finding a spot."
2441095,64712585,2016-03-06,60980525,John,This was a great place to stay. It was convenient getting in to the apartment and its close enough to anything you would want to do/see in Boston.

Pros: Towels and sheets were really fresh. Owner responded quickly to texts/ questions. All amenities listed were included.,,,,,
Cons: The apartment was not as clean as I expected it to be. It's in a shady neighborhood too. There was paint peeling and cracking everywhere. It felt like the bare minimum was thrown together just to scrape by. I tried to wash the dishes we used,but the dish sponge smelled like mold. One of the cabinets in the kitchen is missing it's cover. No A/C in 2nd bedroom. Overall,"the photos for this listing make it look a lot nicer than it actually is.\"",,,

This Property needs a little LOVE. specially Kitchen and bath. The bed were not comfortable. The neighborhood was fine. Close to the airport ( so airplane noise constantly) and small markets and restaurants. Close to public transportation. We wont stay there again. He other property was much nicer.
2441095,86207242,2016-07-15,23700320,Brian,"We stayed 2 nights and it was great jumping off point to see Boston. So close to the airport it was a breeze arriving and departing. Shawn is lighting quick to reply to any questions. As far as the apartment... It had the feel of a quick makeover on college frat house. That being said there is no dust, it's very clean. The furniture and appliances are new and maintained. So the doors are missing on a couple of cabinets; all the linens are fresh and clean! Fridge, stove and coffee maker work and it's got Wifi and cable. Everything you need to comfortably survive and for that it was an excellent choice for our stay."
Some reviews mention the inner city neighborhood but we never felt threaten and we arrived at 11pm. The apartment its self is very secure,you enter thru 3 separate locked doors.,,,,

I loved that thw transit station for the subway was only 3 blocks away and you can get basicalky anywhere for $2. 75.  Unfortunately,  I didnt spend much time around those local shops or dining and night life.  I spent most of my time in downtown.  The beds are comfortable and you get fresh sheets and towels.  Thank pu Shawn for letting me stay!"
2441095,93359078,2016-08-12,29928146,Bob,"The listing has been reported to the Boston Fire Prevention dept., there was a smoke detector that had been removed between the bedrooms, and several other empty brackets in the apartment, they are out of compliance according to who we spoke to.  We had no problem with the neighborhood, but wouldn't recommend the apartment to anyone with health issues getting around as the staircase is steep and narrow.  With the sloped floors in the bedroom, placing anything on the desk could mean you could lose it, ex. earrings.  The missing towel bar in the bathroom meant that all towels were hung in the bedroom closet, making the closet area less useful.  With air conditioning in only the living area, and 1 bedroom, means that someone will not be comfortable at night.  The scratched teflon on the pans made them something I didn't want to use, as well as the filth on the kitchen floor upon check-in, and the cabinet that was filled with bags that were stuck to it?!  The beds were not great, reminded me of my grandmother's antique from 30+ years ago, but I guess that's better than a bed that's rock hard.  Although Shawn was decent about getting back to us with a few things, we lost about an hour the first day just cleaning the apartment and washing the floor to make it palatable for our stay.  When you pre-pay for your vacation and visit, it doesn't make it easy to just walk away, so we made the best of it."
5163162,28128818,2015-03-18,27468698,Pavel,"Mac was very friendly and helpful during my stay in Boston. Really quick to respond to my messages and requests. The apartment itself is large and has enough space for 6 people. Free coffee and sodas. Good location, close to the Andrew T station (7 mins walk)."
Mac doesn't live there so the apartment can look a little empty,but all the necessities are there. It's on the first floor,"so it can get a bit noisy in the living room. \"",,,
5163162,28348809,2015-03-22,26900626,Christopher,"Mac was an outstanding host.  He was available when needed but let us have our privacy. The apartment was clean and well stocked with beverages and snack food.  Even though the place is located next to a restaurant, it was remarkable quiet at night.  We had four adults in our party and the place was large enough to accommodate all of us with no issue.  If you are looking for an affordable place to stay I recommend it."
5163162,29327378,2015-04-06,29625614,Serjik,"Listing as described, clean apartment, plenty of water and soda in the fridge waiting for us (thanks Mac :), great coffee in the freezer, the instructions were clear and communications perfect."

I know  \"\"why leave New Orleans?\"\" We were looking for something different and this place was great. The house is close to the Andrew Station subway station. Also there are plenty of UBER cars in the area. There was a slight problem with the hot water heater for showers but Mac immediately responded and fixed the issue. I recommend this place to anyone. \""

The apartment was well equipped, immaculate and comfortable--the photos accurately depict it.  Mac responded very quickly to questions and provided detailed information on street parking and public transportation, wifi access etc.  We loved the proximity to Carson Beach just a short walk away.  We enjoyed a very good meal and beers at nearby Telegraph Hill restaurant.   Thanks for making our first airbnb stay a great one!"

The house is very clean and tidy, there's a lot of extra bedding and towels, including a fridge full of beverages. There was a small problem with the master bedroom's bed, but he confirmed that it's a minor issue and has fixed it. Overall, we had a pleasant stay!"

Good location close to T and sea .Free soft drinks and coffe, coins to change for laundry, USB charger for all of our devices. Even not meeting Mac everything was organized perfect, online communication went well. We used the flat with two families incl 4 small kids 6-11 which worked well. Two bedrooms for the parents and the kids had a couch and inflating mattress in the living room."
Its to know that the flat is close to the airport so you get noise in the morning from the planes. If you use the fans provided next to the aircon you dont hear the planes any more.,,,,,

Well, the toilet was blocked up and I don't know if my friend did it or not, anyway, Mac and his partner had it fixed immediately. The only thing needs to be improved is the laundry. $1.5 for washing and another $1.5 for drying and the basement is a little scary for girls. All in all, it's good."
5163162,48207911,2015-09-24,2575921,Raul,"Mac's apartment was very cozy and had all the neat convenient things you would need during a stay in Boston. Also very tidy, and easy common-sense house rules. ( E.g. We were pleasantly surprised the fridge was stocked with water and soft drinks. Coffe, multi hub usb charger was also a nice touch ). Mac responded very quickly and was helpful. Would stay here again."

Mac left really comprehensive instructions to get to his place, and extremely helpful and responsive to queries. 10-15 min walk to the subway. Not a great fan of Apple TV, but generally it's still one of the best apartments we stayed during our trip."

5163162,50033058,2015-10-08,25867041,Nick,"I really want to give a good review, because Mac, the host, is one of the best I have experienced as far as responsiveness and making sure you have everything I needed.  But I was overall disappointed.  When I arrived at the house, there was a full garbage bag on the floor waiting to be taken out, and 2 empty pizza boxes on the counter. So it wasn't cleaned prior, or the cleaning people didn't do their job.  The bed is uncomfortable. The bed frame support beams came out every time, so I would have to always fix it to sleep semi comfortably. And the bathroom was not cleaned. There was hair in the shower and the sink."
Also,there is ZERO parking around. So if you are planning to bring a car,"don't.  \"",,,
5163162,50669756,2015-10-13,23208591,Ali Kemal,We could not be more happy with our stay. Everything was as described and clean. And Mac guided us through the whole process. It is really close to the Andrew metro station and the bus stop right outside. We would definitely come back again.
5163162,51978924,2015-10-25,34320462,Ronald,"We enjoyed our stay at Mac's place.  It was clean and I found the bed I slept in very comfortable.  I also liked the automatic soap dispenser in the bathroom as well as the shampoo and liquid soap in the shower.  The fridge stocked with drinks was a nice touch.  The location was good as it was a short Uber ride to downtown.  One small issue that could be addressed was that we could hear the outside entrance door slam shut when people were entering and exiting the building.  I think this could be corrected easily.  Mac was a good host and was available to help us if we had any questions.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay at Mac's place and would use his apartment again in the future."

We enjoyed both the WiFi and apple TV. Would definitely come back here. Great place to stay!"
5163162,54039959,2015-11-15,44987161,Gerard,This was brilliant from start to finish. Mac could not have been more helpful to us right from the go. He explained everything to us and was available during our visit to help with any query we had.
The apartment was just what we wanted,clean,well stocked,warm,everything we wanted.,
The area is also good,about a 15 minute walk from great bars on Broadway and right next door to a great little local bar.,,,,

5163162,64686514,2016-03-06,29344145,Shirley/Peter,"This is a tough one. Our experience at the home was okay. The home is in a decent location. We had a very interesting interaction with the host, however. We were told initially that there was a single live streaming video camera in the home that was centered in front of the TV solely for the purpose of the host monitoring the cleaning staff. Upon arrival, we were able to find more cameras that were actively recording the home. It was a bit unsettling, but as recommended by the host, we were able to place a coffee can around one of the cameras to obtain more privacy. We had a decent experience at the home, however it became obvious that the home was made strictly as a high traffic Airbnb property. The existing furniture was discount quality with some existing broken pieces and we were asked to check out early to make room for the next guests the same day. Other than that, the property was enjoyable. We were a 10 minute Uber ride from downtown and the host was considerate enough to provide snacks and drinks for our stay. The worse part of our experience came at the conclusion of our stay. We were contacted by the host and accused of breaking a cabinet door, staining a carpet and leaving the place a mess. We take a great amount of offense to these accusations. We appreciate the Airbnb experience and try very hard to treat each property like it was our own. We too have rental property and if someone were to come into one of our properties and treat it badly, we would not be happy to say the least. Admittedly, we left the beds unmade and dishes in the sink. We thought the $100 dollar cleaning fee that we paid would cover those things. Not to mention, we were told that the camera (turns out there was more one camera we were not told about) was for a 3rd party cleaning staff. We respectfully notified the host that we did not break a cabinet door, nor did we create a stain on the carpet, yet we were again accused of the same misdeed. This time, however the host retorted that he was the one in charge of cleaning the property and he was fully aware of the cabinet door's status prior to our stay. Now again, we did not break a cabinet door, however if you read between the lines, all of sudden the live streaming cameras throughout the property become much more unsettling. We were told the cameras were to monitor cleaning staff. Not to mention we were not told about all of the cameras in existence. So if the host is cleaning the property, what is the purpose of the camera? Maybe this was just an isolated occurrence. Nevertheless, we did not appreciate being falsely accused of disrespecting a property. Next time, due to this bad experience, we will take pictures of the property to..."

I was planning to have a dinner/party on Saturday, but my previous host decided to decline my request the night before. Out of desperation I saw Mac's place on Airbnb. Mac accept my request in under 10 min, and he also was very helpful in our conversations. I only spoke to him on phone once, but I'm still impressed by his nice attitude and availability. The apartment itself isn't huge, but it's definitely clean and comfortable, not to mention the fridge was packed with sodas that we were free to drink. If you want to find a chill place to spend a few nights at, or want to have a little event with friends, this is the right place."

There were plenty of bath amenities for everyone as well as a fully stocked kitchen with drinks and snacks that came in handy. It is worth noting there is a bar next to the apartment which can be a pro for some people and a con for others. It is a 30 minute walk to the Boston convention center or a 5 minute Uber ride.

The close proximity to the T made our trips to the city very easy and we really enjoyed the Southie  neighborhood....special shout out to Alfredo's just up the street (great pizza!)
The property itself was excellent.  The rooms were very clean and the whole place was well situated.   My wife loved the bed and the kids actually argued over who slept in the other bed or the sofa (URL HIDDEN) really was nice.  The whole place quickly felt comfortable and a bit like our own place in Boston.,,,,,
Lastly....I can't say enough about the owners.  Prompt responses...super thorough communications and frankly  they seemed like just really nice guys.,,,,,

We had a few cancellations from other houses before hand so having someone that assured us of our stay was great. He kept us updated and was detailed in what there is to do in the area. The place is exactly how it looks in pictures with additional decor that was beautiful in the apartment. I would recommend staying here!

5163162,93353535,2016-08-12,82088424,Ashley,"Mac's apartment made for a great stay of combined business and some vacation. The apartment was very clean and tidy with everything provided including some well needed cold drinks. It's a great location, very close to the Andrew T station and also a short walking distance from the great bars and restaurants on West Broadway."
5163162,93964444,2016-08-14,38189986,Rachel,"Mac was always quick to respond and I was never left wondering how or when to access the space.  The place had drinks and a little food for us, and the neighborhood was a great home base."

He went over and above by providing so many extras that made our stay comfortable and pleasurable. The heater/coolers were effective and a great addition. The towels were in abundance, linens were fresh and the entertainment provided was great. My children especially enjoyed the AppleTV. I could go on and on about our experience. Would come back again. The keyed entry made our checkin and check out effortless."
5163162,95983922,2016-08-21,86308750,Jennifer,"He was super approachable when I contacted him and had questions. He did a really good job of explaining where we could find free parking and describing the location of the place. I was very impressed with how nice the apartment was and how it actually looked like the picture online. There was a small concern with the security of the outer door because in order for the door to be shut securely, you really had to give it a nice shove. The door to the unit was very secure because it automatically locked itself which is convenient. There was also a lot of dishes and cooking ware and food which we weren't expecting that much of. Overall a fantastic experience and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a more affordable place to stay."

The place is well located with many bars and restaurant around it. It is close to the train station and very close to downtown. It has all the kitchen facilities. It is one train station ( almost 30  minutes waling distance) to MIT and just two train stations to the central station in Cambridge.,,,,,

It's about a 25 minute walk from the North End and the same distance to Back Bay, Boston Commons is about 5-10 minutes away. Her apartment is four stories up, so be ready for stairs, but it's an adorable place in an older building. Kara was hospitable and easy-going. For the price and location, it's hard to beat!"

I didn't meet Kara in person as she was out of town, but her roommate was very nice and helpful. They were both good in communication via texts and emails."
The room was just as it was described and it was clean and cozy. I would return to her place if I have a chance to visit Boston again without my family. Thank you very much,Kara!,,,,

The amenities included everything necessary and the 4th floor location separates the windows from the street level and provide a nice view of the trees.  Sunsets on the roof deck were a nice bonus.  Kara and her roommate were friendly"
7918592,95336405,2016-08-19,27414326,Mar,Disappointed...
I spent 3 days at Kara's place. I have been disappointed since my arrival because I didnot really feel welcome. I was warned of 4 floors amount but with a heavy suitcase and alone,after 6 hours travel,it was quite difficult and Kara did not even come down 3 steps to help me. She was cooking for herself when I arrived and did not neither offers anything to eat nor drink,not even glass of water. Moreover,the days after,there was nothing at all for breakfast (nothing to eat
The room provides comfortable bed and was clean. The small bathroom (ok for a young woman of small stature ) was old and uncomfortable but also clean.,,,,,
It was crazy hot at that time and I knew there was no air condition. However I expected great fan rather than the microscopic one provided.,,,,,
My days were very busy since I had not much contact with Kara. The neighborhood is very nice but you can stay not far from it for cheaper.,,,,,
I paid 550 dollars with Airbnb for 3 nights.,,,,,
So almost 190 doll per night with very modest comfort and it looks to me very expensive. Next time I would rather reserve hotel room with lift,air condition,"",,,
bigger bathroom and at least coffee for breakfast for better price!,,,,,
"I would not recommend this room for people more than 30ys\"",,,,,
14407094,94230014,2016-08-15,3034384,Vanessa,Exactly as described. The apt is located on the second floor in the most desirable neighborhood in Boston. I used to live in Boston and love taking a walk on a sunny afternoon in beacon hill.  The famous acorn St is a few blocks away.
Close to everything ( hubway around the block for bike rental for short rides in the city) 15 mins walk to the North end ( where it has the best restaurants in Boston),Quincy market,Haymarket and Boston public market. 20 mins walk to the esplanade and museum of science. 10 mins walk to red line T station and MGH.,,,
Alex was very responsive and he provided adequate instruction to ensure a smooth check in. The place is very clean. Blow dryer was also provided for ladies and I think that's very considerate of Alex. I travelled with my husband and we had a great night of sleep on the memory form mattress but might be a bit snuggly for couples of bigger body frames. Another tenant was in the apt during our stay but he was quite and the curtain provided sufficient privacy.  Parking can be difficult around the area but Alex gave great advice. We ended up parking at the 1 center plaza for $24 for the weekends ($12/ day from 4p-4a). Overall,"can't beat the price for what it offers.   I will recommend it. \"",,,,

She went out of her way to type up clear instructions on the house, had spare toiletries available, and a list of things to do in and around Boston. The apartment and the host are both highly recommended, and the location was lovely as well. I could easily walk anywhere I needed to go."

Amazing location on the north side of the Boston Common and easy walking distance to subways, restaurants and shops.  Did i mention a really comfortable bed! Fantastic stay and I would absolutely stay here again."

13376457,82503723,2016-06-27,33429567,Cindy,"The location was EXCELLENT!! We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay location wise.  It was very close to everything my friend and I wanted to go to.  The neighborhood is very beautiful and quaint.  The park is right outside the house and we didn't have any difficulties parking which was going to be an issue for us (we loved how Boston allows you to pay for the meter on your phone!).  Bradford was great at checking in to confirm with us and was not difficult to reach.  He was very accommodating as well.  The pictures of his place is very accurate as in what to expect.  The only problems we had were the bedsheets had some crummy kind of things on it (but it smelled like it was just changed to new sheets) and the floor was not clean (had some black sticky spots on it).  I read that the bed was amazing to sleep in but it was a bit too soft for our taste.  Other than that, it was a great place to stay.  Thanks Bradford!"
13376457,86107862,2016-07-15,29068204,Nicole,"Bradford made me stay very welcome, he was organized, the towels were out and there was a wifi code available.  He did not leave any descriptions of restaurants, but there are so many, there was really no need to.  The location is awesome, so central.  The only drawback is the apartment is a bit dark because it is a below street level apt."

13376457,90009246,2016-07-30,32265495,Jennifer,"The apartment was great for a quick overnight in Boston. The only downside was it was really hot...not sure if the AC was broken or if it just doesn't cool off that much. All in all though, everything was great!"
13376457,92619376,2016-08-09,46387128,Leslie,"Our stay for two nights to visit with friends and see a show was terrific. The location is outstanding. Bradford was going to be out of town when he arrived so he contacted us almost a week ahead of time and had the keys mailed to us overnight to ensure a smooth arrival. There were thoughtful touches like travel toiletries and an easily accessible wifi password. Plus we were able to do laundry before heading to our next stop. The studio is small and a bit sparse but the location was so fantastic and our host was so helpful, it made up for it. We did have an issue with parking -- I had read another review saying parking was easy, it wasn't -- so we returned our rental car a day early to avoid the headache. Luckily the location is so terrific we had no real need for a car. All in all, a terrific stay. Thanks!"

The unit was exactly as he listed it, and is in an amazing location, and was exactly what we were looking for. We were arriving into Boston early in the morning, so Bradford allowed us to drop our bags well before check-in time, which made things so much easier!! Thank you so much Bradford!! I would definitely recommend staying here."

The Beacon Hill location couldn't have been better--the Public Garden and Boston Common were immediately across the street from the apartment with easy access to the T, restaurants and shopping. Bradford's studio was spacious yet cozy, impeccably clean, with in-unit laundry and wifi access."

Unloading was a little tricky,but since we got there around 3:30 and  it was a Friday evening,we had no problem finding street parking,The bathroom was very nice and towels and toiletries were available.  Almost a full kitchen with a single serve coffee maker.  The weather was perfect and we could leave the windows in the living room open without any worries.,,
I am relatively new to AIRBNB so it seems a little strange to be in someone's home with their personal items in view (although neatly out of the way).,,,,,
The neighborhood is quiet and the neighbors look out for each other.  We found the area quiet,friendly and easy walking.  We didn't take the T,but it's available for those who want to go into Boston proper.,,,
This apartment is a value for those who don't want an expensive hotel and dislike the hubbub of being in the middle of tourist areas.,,,,,

3897995,21017827,2014-10-09,22060174,Edward,My girlfriend and I stayed in one of Ari's spaces for two nights. The room was very comfortable and clean. There was plenty of space for the both of us and the location was in great neighborhood. On our second day Ari was very receptive to our concerns regarding the cleanliness of the shared bathroom after another one of his other guests got sick and took a genuine interest in our comfort in terms of noise level at night. Overall we had a pleasant experience and would recommend Ari's spaces if you're looking to stay in the Boston area for a few days.

Ari was very helpful , responding quickly to my questions and requests especially upon arrival since I didn't know anything about anything."
Very quiet neighborhood,a clean room and most importantly a mega comfortable bed and you really feel it after you've had a loooong day.,,,,
The T green line is close like 15 mins walk and I got greeted by a squirrel each morning so that was very cute.,,,,,
On a more special note,the stupid Alitalia airline lost my luggage and I was so furious,i didn't even have a tooth brush. Thankfully Ari walked with me to the nearest store to get one.,,,
Also,the stupid Alitalia airline delayed my flight for another 24 hours and suddenly I was homeless for the night but Ari came to the rescue.,,,,
So he has been a true hero,and I can truly say that my visit was saved.,,,,

Clean room, clean bathroom, fresh towels. Everything comes as advertised. Conveniently located two blocks from Harry's Bar & Grill, a great place to stop before calling it a night. Ari is always available to help you with anything you need."
3897995,33532686,2015-05-29,32992664,Prashanth,Had an excellent stay in this room. Ari was very helpful and communicative before and during my stay. The room and bed were very comfortable and the fan & A/C were very welcome in the Boston heat! I was also impressed with how clean the room and bathroom were. Would definitely stay here again.
3897995,33756069,2015-05-31,660403,Celine,Peaceful and big bedroom with bird singing. I had a very pleasant night.
Ari was a great host,quick answers and ensuring that everything went fine.,,,,
"I know where to stay in Boston next time ;-)\"",,,,,
3897995,36966600,2015-07-03,29584587,Johnny,"Overall, was a decent experience. Ari was accomodating, especially for being abroad. Communication was great, and listened to suggestions very well. I had minor complaints here and there, such as non-working lights, dirty housemates, etc, but they do not factor into the review. Would stay here again."
3897995,37109542,2015-07-04,36945011,Kiley,"This was a really easy experience all around. Ari was very quick to reply with detailed instructions and directions. The room was big, clean, and comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet even for July 4th weekend! Great spot if you're in Boston for a night or 2."
3897995,38416423,2015-07-15,18021816,Colin,"The room is spacious. While I being there, Ari was aboard. We did not meet but I enjoy staying in the room. It locates in an quiet area."
3897995,43705297,2015-08-21,19373094,Tidiane Cheikh,"Great stay at Ari's. The room was clean and even if he was not available physically, he was reachable by phone and her friend Cindy was there for helping."
3897995,44823409,2015-08-29,41010329,Marko,"First time using Airbnb and it has been a wonderful experience. Despite a power issue, Ari and Cindy were very accommodating and helpful. Additionally, the Internet service that was available was simply incredible! The room was spacious and as described. The neighbourhood was quiet and nice as well. I definitely enjoyed my stay."
3897995,46595366,2015-09-12,29107621,Victoria,"A great stay in Allston. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to stay for a short time or a while. Comfy, clean, well-run, and close to a ton of fun things to do in Allston as well as easy access to the T."
3897995,47795846,2015-09-21,43048101,Nicole,"Great experience overall. Room was faithful to the advertisement and very clean upon arrival. Ari was abroad during my stay, but I had access to the house through a combination lock and access to my room through a key. Cindy was in the house to provide assistance if needed. Similar to staying in an inexpensive hotel, at least in terms of ease and independence. Other people occupy the neighboring rooms, but this was not problematic. The house is close to public transportation and has fun bars and restaurants nearby. Also fairly close to famous parts of Boston. Highly recommend and would stay here again"
3897995,48857064,2015-09-28,23435647,Wenqing,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3897995,49069669,2015-09-30,6501838,Jordan,"My stay in Ari's place was brief but enjoyable. Ari was abroad during the booking but maintained quick and detailed correspondence easing my late night arrival.  Upon arriving I found a comfy bed, functioning AC, private fridge, with a large table suitable for work. The guests in the apartment were also very friendly,welcoming and seemed happy with their long(er) rental commitments."
"I would recommend Ari's place to anyone visiting the Cambridge area looking for a quiet communal stay. \"",,,,,
3897995,50735846,2015-10-13,6122501,Francesca,Ari was very quick to respond to my request just 1.5 days before I requested a stay in his home.  I really appreciated his accommodating my last minute request.
I am both a host myself and an innkeeper,and every B&B as well as AirBnB is different and unique to another.,,,,
What I loved about Ari's place was that it was centrally located to alot of restaurants and the tram.  It was also in a good urban neighborhood and the bed and pillows were comfortable.,,,,,
A few things worth mentioning that I would share with any other prospective guest.,,,,,
There are a few steps leading up to the house,so if you have mobility issues,this is not the place for you.  There is a motion detector that turns on a light on the side of the house,but it would be helpful to have better lighting on the stairs leading up to the house.  It was a little hard to see the steps on the way up after dark.,,
The house contains multiple rooms that house both short-term and long term guests.  And it is a shared bathroom situation.  I did not encounter anyone while awake who needed the bathroom.,,,,,
Also,if you are driving,you have to park your car a couple streets over on a main street,because the street where the house is located,is only for residential parking.  Again,may not be a good situation for someone with mobility issues.
This accommodation suited my needs for a night and Ari was very good about making sure I had every information I needed to access the house and my room.,,,,,
"I am not sure I would stay there over multiple days because I wouldn't feel comfortable sharing a bathroom with other people when they have their personal effects in there.\"",,,,,
3897995,50825568,2015-10-14,5554803,Anvy,Ari was gracious enough to allow me to stay at the last minute!
My stay was very brief (9pm at night to 7am the next day),but everything was smooth and seamless. Instructions to enter (keyless) and find the room (marked with a number) was helpful and easy. The room itself had a key for added security. There are others in neighboring rooms who I did not meet. My room was next to a big,clean,shared bathroom with excellent water pressure.,,
I didn't see towels in my room but didn't ask Ari for any because I brought my own. There were bath products which likely are owned by the other guests - I also brought my own. I did see a hairdryer on a shelf in the hallway but used the one I brought. The A/C was on when I entered,which is very nice! The room was big and spacious. The bed was so comfortable!,,,,
My only suggestions (though not necessary): A full length mirror would be nice in the room (I was dressing for an interview). A new paint job on the walls (I don't know why I was spooked by the random paint markings on the wall - maybe bc I arrived at night!).,,,,,
Overall a lovely stay,"would recommend and return!\"",,,,
3897995,51828925,2015-10-24,33321318,Jennae,"#1 problem: The place smells. Like gerbils or ferrets live there, which is fine, but it was difficult to deal with. There was alot of clutter outside of the home leading up to the entrance way, and in the hallways. As you can see from the photos those dark grey swipes of paint were someone being lazy and filling in holes and painting with a different paint. The whole situation was seemed a little odd. Bed was comfy tho."
3897995,51876119,2015-10-24,41944111,Nina,Had a great stay at Ari's!

3897995,59472269,2016-01-11,48016377,Harper,"It was a wonderful experience living in Ari's house. The location is perfect, quiet to stay away from the noisy street and easy to get public transportations. The house is good maintained. There are clean services twice a week. The bed in my room is big and comfortable, and I love the convenient kitchen the most. Ari and Cindy are nice people, friendly and easy communicating. I will choose to stay here again the next time."

3897995,66022296,2016-03-18,39441871,Doron,"I decided to continue with Ari for the resto of my stay here in Boston, for another 2 weeks. As usual, in my last stay everything was very well communicated. The place is very close to public transport and many restaurants and pubs nearby. It was great staying at Ari's place.  See you tomorrow night! :)"
3897995,66138100,2016-03-19,63239764,Sandiya,"The room was very nice, clean and sunny.  The check in went smoothly  Ari sent me all the instructions that i needed to find things in the house.

3897995,69539930,2016-04-11,64078033,Laura,"Ari is a great host. It has been my first journey with AirBnB and Ari helped me a lot. He has answered every single question I had (and because it was the first time using AirBnB I had a lot) and he was always friendly (I haven't met Ari, we just wrote). The house is located close to Boston downtown and it's a large and clean room. It takes about 30 minutes using a tram that goes directly to Park Street. If you like to see Harvard,  it's just about 20- 25 minutes by walking."
The check -in and check -out was very flexible and I got detailled information how to do the check-in.,,,,,
I can really recommend that room.,,,,,
Thank you so much,"Ari!\"",,,,

Above all the place was warm and cosy for an Australian not ready for the Boston weather. I really have nothing bad to say about my stay.
3897995,70864576,2016-04-21,63028843,Lena,Ari was a great host! He let us know about all the details we needed to know before our trip.
The room came with a mini fridge with a couple water bottles,a water heater and a lot of desks. The bathroom was clean and came stocked with plenty  of toilet paper,towels,and soaps if we happened to forget to bring some. I felt very safe staying here as each room locked. I knew other people were staying in the other rooms,but I never saw them.,
Overall,the place was in very good shape,and I particularly liked the linens on the bed as they felt very soft and clean. If I ever take a trip to Boston again,I will definitely  stay here.,,

Even though he was out of town during my stay, he did everything possible to ensure that I could access the room, and every time I sent him a text or email, he replied immediately.

Many nice pubs are around. Only negative criticism was the bathroom, which was not always very clean, however, maybe this was caused by other guests. Ari`s apartment is good for a short stay in Boston and I would recommend it."

The bathroom is clean and (URL HIDDEN) all means, it's the heart of the north end, which is exactly like a little Italy. We spent a whole afternoon casually walking around the beautiful town, having dinner at giacomos. It was exotic and fun. The only thing is that it's a little bit noisy before midnight, possibly because of the bar nearby and that we're only on the 2nd floor."

Had everything you need and a few little nice touches that make the stay so much nicer. Very accommodating we needed to check in early and keep our bags stashed till we could check in our next place.

We walked to the Commons, Newbury St, and had an incredible dinner on Salem St. The apartment itself was lovely. The only thing I need on vacation is a comfortable bed, and good temperature control. Excellent central air system and the beds were absolutely fabulous. Sheets, quilts, PILLOWS, etc...all lovely. Really nice place. My teenagers loved it. Much cozier than a hotel room. Some may find  the lack of street parking to be daunting, however I found a great lot at Sergeant Wharf a couple blocks away on Commercial St that was the same cost as hotel parking. All in all, a great find. We will definitely return!"

This is the perfect place if you want to see the Italian quarter, freedom Trail, and Downtown.  It is on a busy street, but despite that, it is quiet.  We did not see any of the residents of the building, but occasionally heard footsteps going up the stairs.  But that was no big deal for us.  It was clean, the beds were good, and the place was simply fantastic.  Highly recommended!"
6134145,40396051,2015-07-30,37685037,David,The apartment was just as described in a great walkable neighborhood. Key pickup was a breeze. I would love to stay here again.

You can glimpse the statue of Paul Revere from the window.  The apartment was perfect: clean, comfortable, with brand new appliances.  The key exchange was easy.  We loved every moment, loved having easy access to so many wonderful places...we would come back in a heartbeat."

Beautiful area of Boston too in the North End. Surrounded by endless nice Italian restaurants. The key service was very prompt and filled us in on all of the apartment info. Would definitely go back to stay here."

Right in the thick of Boston's North End...steps from everything. Beautiful apartment with high end appliances. Good separation between front and back bedrooms.,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
"Least comfortable bed my husband and I have EVER slept in. Directly across street from fire station. Literally the only negatives I could think of.\"",,,,,
6134145,50759785,2015-10-14,28595052,Laurie,"We loved being right in the middle of the North end of Boston. This was a great location and we had plenty of restaurants to choose from all from our front door. Having two bedrooms was perfect since we had our adult daughter meet us there. Dave was quick to respond with any needs we had. It can be noisy sleeping in the front bedroom, so bring no some ear plugs."
6134145,51709301,2015-10-24,4120669,Ural,"Great place to stay in the heart of Boston. Cute, safe neighborhood, easy walking distance to everything. Nice, clean apartment. Definitely recommended."
6134145,52397263,2015-10-29,37441311,Veronica,"We arrived early to the apartment and were able to quickly reach our host via the Key Exchange Service. Dave had left a set of keys in a lock box outside, so arrival went smoothly. The apartment was spotless and very comfortable for our party of four. The neighborhood has wonderful restaurants and a short walk away from Fenhuil Hall/Quincy Market. Lots to do close by! The house manual and welcome basket were a nice touch."
Only negative was the noise level from the street outside,which made sleeping in rough for us. If you're a light sleeper bring earplugs.,,,,
"Would stay there again and highly recommend others to stay when in Boston. Thanks Dave!!\"",,,,,
6134145,52693688,2015-11-01,9542812,Daniel,The apartment was exceptionally clean and comfortable--we had everything we needed. The neighborhood was fantastic. We walked everywhere with ease.

You won't get cool, kooky art or a view into the owner's wild imagination - but that's not always what you want! This apartment is literally on the Freedom Trail, perfectly clean, and in like-new condition. The walls are a little thin, but we didn't find it to be too disruptive. We really enjoyed our time here."

6134145,65347518,2016-03-13,18611226,Daniel,"Dave uses the Air Bnb Key Exchange management to deliver the keys, it is super simple and efficient. There is a fire station right next to the apartment and though we didn't get woken up too early, it's possible that you might get a surprise siren. The location is AWESOME!!!! It's right in the center of everything and the restaurants in the area are amazing. The stairway is a little steep and narrow, but the apt is only one flight up. Overall I'd totally recommend the place, the few (and to me insignificant drawbacks) are way overshadowed by the location alone. The apt is also extremely well taken care of. Clean and well provisioned. If it's your first time in Boston, you can stay here and walk to all the major tourist attractions, hit up great shopping and eat extremely well, what else could you want?"
6134145,68293042,2016-04-04,5655862,Barbara,The apartment was in a great location - right across from the Freedom Trail and surrounded by the restaurants and shops of the North End.  The check in process was easy with the bnb caretakers service used by Dave.  The apartment was very clean and furnished as described.

The communication was very responsive even late at night between both Dave and the management service that welcomed us upon check in.

6134145,73592953,2016-05-08,4971658,Ali,We absolutely loved Dave's place. They're are so many great restaurants lining the street & it's a short walk in to the city centre. We wished we had more time to explore just the neighbourhood. Dave also arranged for someone to meet us upon our arrival. The apartment was well equipped & you couldn't beat the location.
6134145,75856711,2016-05-23,27742232,Leah,"Dave's condo is absolutely spectacular! It is located in the most amazing part of North End, right in the middle of all of the good food, history, and culture of the neighborhood. The apartment was clean, and perfect.

We had an absolutely amazing trip to Boston, in no small part to having this flat as a base camp. Our flight over was delayed by 2 hours, and Dave was able to help adjust our arrival and key hand off accordingly. The location was immaculate and very comfortable. Easy access to Mike's Pastry was also a plus... ;)"

Literally steps from The Freedom Trail, excellent dining & close to the Haymarket T stop. It is a busy area with lots of life, so white noise may be helpful if you're a light sleeper, but the host provides fans for both rooms. All the amenities listed were provided & the BNB Caretakers were right on time with the keys. We enjoyed it!"

Relatively small space, but plenty for our family of 4 and we really enjoyed using the apartment as a base to explore Boston. Easy arrival late at night from the airport (only 10-15 mins away by taxi)  - met by one of the team who look after the apartment. Not spotless or particularly stylish, but a really comfortable and good value choice. Virtually opposite the Freedom Trail and within reach of plenty of decent restaurants and cafes. Dave was also quick to respond to communication."

There were a couple of minor maintenance things: the bathroom toilet roll holder,towel rail,a picture and the light in a bedroom were broken. I imagine this is because the place is so popular and a lot of guests are coming through!,,,

He communicated quickly and was very accommodating. The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare meals (Nicolas emptied his fridge for us), there were plenty of towels and linens, plenty of closet space, comfy beds, and the bathroom had many amenities (shampoo, lotion, hair dryer.) The location made things so easy: grocery store and parking garage across the street, and Chinatown with all it's delicious bakeries and restaurants was 5 minutes away."
This loft is really beautiful. The open floor plan,great light,comfortable furniture,"gorgeous view of the city lights makes it overall a fantastic place to stay in Boston.\"",,

4053612,36063052,2015-06-24,36071159,Shannon,"Nicolas was incredibly responsive which at a time when the entire city seemed to be booked for the night provided a huge amount of comfort. I generally waited less than 3 minutes to receive an answer to any inquiry. The condo was exactly as pictured, perfectly located for my trip, and very easy to check-in and out of. Three of us stayed there and while I did not personally sleep on the sleeper sofa the report I got in the morning was that the quality of the bed's comfort was exceptional. This is a high end property with a fantastic host. As a first time Airbnb user I happily left Boston as new customer.  Nicolas' condo is great for an overnight business trip and imagine it would provide a special home-away-from-home for any extended stay."
4053612,39561277,2015-07-24,363403,Nina,Nicolas was a great host and I loved the place. He was very responsive to communication and the place itself was cozy. And all the reviews about the comfortable bed are true!
4053612,39662885,2015-07-25,19523500,Feargal,Nice very clean and very spacious apartment just as described. Plenty of space for a family of four and the living area / kitchen etc was really nice. We were only staying in Boston for one night so it was just perfect. Short five or 7 minute walk to Boston Common and beyond so it was pretty central. Public car park directly across from front door which was very useful. Didn't get to meet our host but hand over was well organised. But noisy at night outside but it was Boston on a Friday night

4053612,43723125,2015-08-21,41361088,Anna,"This loft is wonderful. There are two really lovely bedrooms and one very comfortable bathroom. The common area is completely open but so large that it doesn't feel in any way cramped. The apartment is beautifully decorated. The kitchen is perfect. We stayed here with our two young children, and both of them completely enjoyed the kids' room which was full of basic toys and books to keep them completely occupied. Although we were considerate of the amount of noise we were making, the building is so large and seemingly sound proof that I doubt anyone heard us. We also could barely hear people in the surrounding apartments."
The building is on a corner a block from the Chinatown entrance,so we strolled there in the evening. It is also two blocks the other way from South Station. We also walked 15 minutes or so to the Children's Museum,which was tons of fun. For adult travelers there are restaurants and many places that you can either walk or easily take the T or a cab too. And this place is perfect if you're coming into town on a train and working in the financial district. On our last evening we invited a few friends for Chinese takeout and the space was very comfortable for them for a small informal dinner. (It would also be AMAZING for a small formal dinner,btw--but alas we've got two leprechauns.)  We would definitely stay there again.,,
The only challenge—but this is the case just about anywhere in the city—was loading and unloading the car. Thank god for the elevator!,,,,,
Finally,the owners were a true pleasure to deal with. They answered quickly,responded to any of our concerns,were courteous and flexible. The whole experience was,quite frankly,"perfect. \""

It's a short walk to the Boston Common and the Children's museum, which my kids loved.  Best of all her place feels homey, which is an added plus when traveling with a family."
4053612,87727230,2016-07-21,83192718,Francisco,"The good: The apartment is spacious, clean and looks very nice. We felt safe. Beds are comfortable.  The kitchen is well equipped. The location is great; two blocks walking from the bus station.  It is close too all what you want to see and do in Boston (you can walk or take an Uber to all attractions for less than $10)."
The bad: Noise from everywhere! The noise from the street does not let you fall sleep (the windows are old and not well insulated). There was also noisy from the construction on the same floor (starting at 9:00 AM); so you need to wake up early. But,the worst is that the next-wall neighbor watches TV/plays games until 5:00 AM (the walls are very poorly insulated). You can hear him sneeze and even fart. It  is just impossible to have a good night sleep.  The location is not good if you drive.  You cannot park on the street for longer than 2 hours (everything is reserved for residents). The parking garage across  the street charges $6 per 30 minutes.  There is no TV service.,,,,

We arrived early and the host graciously allowed us to check in early, which was a life saver because one friend was really sick that day. The location is perfect! The apartment is exactly as described. The host was quick to respond with any questions we had. The only drawback to this place was the central air did not work. There is window units in each bedroom though but sometimes the living room felt hotter than outside. I would recommend this place and would definitely stay here again. Everything is within walking distance or a short drive away."

It's location was fantastic.  Here are a couple of things that you don't get from the listing.  It's on the first floor with about 8 steps.  It's right across from the shopping at the Prudential center including close,restaurants,pharmacy,book store.  It's just across the street from a Duck Boat tour stop.  It's just across the street from a 24 hr grocery.  It's 5 minutes walk from Back Bay with numerous restaurants,more restaurants and Wired Puppy coffee.,

The two adorable cats were a big plus! We also really appreciate that J&M were able to house us on such a short notice, as our trip to Boston was made on impulse. The apartment is close to a Whole Foods store, and in walking distance of the subway, which will take you downtown in 25 mins."

22354,415636,2011-08-02,162564,David,"Robert's townhouse dates back all the way to the mid to late 1800s, and is one of the only (if only) Victorian townies on the block that hasn't been turned into condos or split up in different ways. Architecture lovers will really find this place a treat, and Robert's a very trustworthy and friendly host with a great knowledge of the city and the history of his home, which is undergoing quite a few restorations in different places. The location is fantastic. Please note you will not appreciate this place if a) you can't do stairs as there are a few flights, b) you want your own private entrance to your room as you will need to go through the house to your room,  c) you need seriously cold and quiet window air conditioning during the hot days and d) you like a finished place, as this place is undergoing renos on different floors. I should say Robert was great at using the A/C to thoroughly chill the room for me for when I came home later in the evening, and suggested I use the fan to keep the sound more muffled. He really went out of his way to make me feel at home. The bed was overall pretty comfy, but could use an extra layer for the back like a mattress pad and maybe an extra pillow. Robert graciously offered me coffee and my own little coffee maker, and grabbed some really nice coffee for me along with creamers for my morning. A TV and desk and sofa for relaxing, very peaceful room. I will definitely stay at this lovely location again in the future and hopefully get to spend more time with Robert to hear more about his house and the incredible restoration work he's putting into it! It's a beauty and you you really get a sense of the time period staying in this room, along with the way he's furnished it."

Robert was very pleasant, attentive and helpful and working with him was a breeze.  At $80 a night, I thought it was a fair price for the value.  I would stay here again."

22354,1329512,2012-05-22,276009,Nehemiah,"This is my first Airbnb stay .Nice neighborhood,close to subway,restaurants,downtown.Ont op of that host is very friendly  and has very good knowledge about Boston and surroundings and gave me good information about that.Good room,has a separate bathroom for this room but attached to the kitchen.Worth for the price I paid."
"Thanks to Airbnb for making my trip so cool\"",,,,,
22354,1476583,2012-06-13,2531405,Mark,"Although I was only in my room at night, Robert was polite and respectful at every juncture. The room was spacious and Robert provided a fan, when mentioned that the weather looked like it was going to hot."
22354,1590343,2012-06-29,2698918,Mario,"Great location.   Convenient access to everything, walking distance to Back Bay Metro Station. WIFI was included."
Robert was a great host,even gave me directions on how to get there from the airport using the metro.  There are stacks of books everywhere,it felt exactly like a Half-Price bookstore.,,,
"Great price!\"",,,,,
22354,1618080,2012-07-02,600082,Bach,"It's nothing like having Robert as your personal tour-guide when visiting Boston. It was truly a great experience staying at his place. The house is located in a perfect location in the Back Bay neighborhood, close to good shopping, restaurants and bars. The house is about 4 to 5 blocks from the popular Newbury Street. Robert is a very caring and attentive host. He made sure that i got to see Boston the best way i could while being there for just a short time. I would stay at Robert's place again."
22354,1679258,2012-07-10,2497701,Yip Hung,Robert's room definitely provided value for money in terms of its convenient location.  Robert was very accommodating and kind giving me all the insightful advice about where to go and eat.
22354,1780556,2012-07-23,1753252,Stanford,"If you're looking for a true Boston experience, then Robert's brownstone has quite a bit of charm.  The third floor room is large and spacious, and has a couch as well.  Fairly clean and comfortable."
Just a few gotchas,the first is that the hallways and stairs are narrow and steep,so not recommended for kids/handicapped/elderly.  The lower level corridors also have a doggy smell,but as you go up it fades and is nearly nonexistent in the room.  Finally,the doors have no locks,not an issue for me but might be helpful for others.
Robert is quite an accomodating host,and offered directions from the airport and tips for the area.  There are also tourist guides in the room if you need them.  As a Boston native,the convenience of this location is unparalleled.  Walkable to downtown,chinatown,Copley,Newbury St. and all my favorite haunts
22354,1824305,2012-07-28,3013515,David,"This was my first airbnb stay.  Robert was a great host, helped me with directions, local restaurants."
The room was large and well air conditioned.  I stayed on the third floor and it has a nice large desk with wi-fi high speed internet access.  There is no bathroom on this floor and had to share with the 4th floor but I never had any issue is gaining immediate access.,,,,,
As far as location it couldn't be better,"a block to the subway and in the heart of the city.  As mentioned in other reviews the stairs are a little cluttered and steep and the first floor has a musty smell but it didn't bother me at all.  \"",,,,
22354,1833821,2012-07-29,3053729,Klim,"Robert was an amazing host! Very friendly and full of really valuable information about Boston that he was more than willing to share with me (he even gave me a walking tour of the local area when I arrived). Although my stay at Robert's was only two days, I really did enjoy my time there. The rooms that I stayed in were adequate (large, comfy beds, large windows with a nice view onto the street) and the bathroom was very well kept. The best part of Robert's place is its location, which is amazing! I was able to walk pretty much everywhere I needed to, aside from Fenway Park. During my stay in late July I couldn't believe how beautiful the nieghbourhood was, and the number of little cafes and stores only a couple minutes walk away was definitely a bonus. For the price, the location alone makes this place worth it. Robert's kindheartedness and willingness to share his knowledge about Boston with his guests are what would make me want to stay with him again."
22354,1959321,2012-08-12,506575,Francesco,"Robert has been a wonderful and a very attentive host during my time in Boston, always charming and available for me. He is a very flexible and accommodating person and was especially helpful with regards to my luggage."
The apartment has one of the best locations you can expect: close to restaurants,shopping area and T station. The room itself is big,calm,and very convenient and keeps cool during heat waves.,,
I would definitely recommend Robert's place for your stay in Boston.,,,,,

22354,2048971,2012-08-20,1640487,Yeu Jin,"The location of this place is prime! It was a five minute walk to the public library, where I needed to be. I didn't really get to sleep here, since I had an event to attend and then I packed and went to straight to the airport, but Robert was super friendly and helpful all throughout. My travel plans/ arrival time kept on changing (no thanks to you, Chinatown bus!) but Robert was patient and genuinely kind. He gives very concrete directions, which I guess is a skill he acquired from teaching. The house has an aged charm to it, and I imagine it was a really lovely place years ago. Currently, the carpets a bit old and dusty and there is some animal smell to the hallways, but it didn't trigger my sensitive allergies or bother me. For the price and location, this place is definitely a deal! I'd come here again if I were to visit Boston!"
22354,2281173,2012-09-14,3255705,Emøke,"This PLace is simply NOT suited as a bed and breakfast. It is not just dirty and smelly, it  is actually filthy and the entire house and particularly the hallways and staircases so full of garbage and clutter that it is actually impossible to carry a larger suitcase upstairs to your room. None f the doors can be locked, this including the bathroom/toilet which is a shared facility and full of other peoples toothbrushes, 10 empty shampoo bottles, hair, laundry and other clutter items. No lock on your room other."
I am truly sorry to write this because the host is a really nice guy and very helpful,"but he SHOULD NOT RUN A BED AND BREAKFAST  without getting help for his cleanliness issues.  \"",,,,
22354,2680855,2012-10-22,3430849,David,"Very Good Location in South End, Robert is a good host, room was spacy and wifi worked. Recommended. Will Book again when I come to boston."
22354,3297188,2013-01-07,3953018,Thomas,I simply loved everything about my stay at Robert's house. I went to Boston for a conference and spent my free time exploring the city.
The house is located in a quiet and beautiful neighborhood and near to the center of the city. The location of the house is perfect to explore the old town and the harbor (which I is close enough to go by foot,but can alternatively be reached by taking the tram,which is just around the corner).,,,
The room was big,clean and the surroundings quiet enough to get work done. The house itself has an historic and architectural charm,which I found very appealing. The bathroom was clean and was only shared with a few other people.,,,
Robert is a great host,very kind and helpful. Sadly,we did not get to talk that much,since I was away at the conference most of the time. He provided me with useful information about the local transports,spots to visit and,overall
"I would love to visit again!\"",,,,,
22354,3990545,2013-04-01,5608889,Rose-Marthe,"Robert est un hôte exceptionnel : agréable, attentionné, chaleureux. Il donne volontiers des informations sur la ville et les évènements qui s'y déroulent lors de votre passage."
L'emplacement de la maison est idéal. Le centre-ville est accessible à pied : zone touristique,restaurant,bar,pub... La station de métro Back Bay est à 5 min.,,
La maison est authentique (ce qui doit être rare dans le quartier). La chambre était propre,confortable et privé (même sans clé). J'étais en sécurité dans la maison.,,,,
Pour l'horaire d'arriver et de départ,Robert est très flexible. J'ai pu profiter de mon séjour à Boston jusqu'à la fin.,,,,
"Pour celles et ceux qui aime leur confort matériel s’abstenir!\"",,,,,
22354,4181826,2013-04-16,5348047,Greg,"This was my first AirBNB experience and I had an incredibly pleasant stay at Robert's place during the Boston Marathon. The room was large, I slept well, WiFi worked and it's hard to ask for more from a place that is meant to put you up for a couple of nights in a prime location in the city."
Robert is also a great conversationalist who knows a lot about the city and I enjoyed his company and sharing information and stories that I would not have heard otherwise. It definitely added great value to my stay.,,,,,
I will not hesitate to stay with Robert on my next visit. If you're expecting full on privacy with locks on your door and a sterile environment you might want to go with a fancy hotel. If you just need a place to crash,"you're OK with waking past a kitchen to get to your bathroom to take a shower and get personal with the city in an old historic building this is the place!\"",,,,
22354,4467620,2013-05-06,5989860,Jason,"Spacious room in a great location for an amazing price.  The room is very large and comfortable.  If I come back to Boston, I will be staying here again."
22354,4532949,2013-05-11,5772856,Warren,"My 1st experience with an Airbnb, and it was a great introduction. An interesting, old home full of books and history in the Back Bay area of Boston. Easy to walk to interesting many interesting areas. Very easy to connect to mass transit that goes everywhere. A clean and pleasant room on top floor. Robert was welcoming and helped me get oriented to the area quickly."
22354,4587768,2013-05-13,349652,Carl,"I didn't meet Robert. A colleague or friend of his was there to greet me and help me get my bags up the three flights of stairs. The house is a little chaotic, with books piled high everywhere. I love this sort of thing so it worked well for me. But those who prefer minimalism and scrupulous tidiness should probably look elsewhere. The room was comfortable but (like the shared bathroom) didn't have a lock on the door, which I found a little disconcerting. But on the whole I felt relaxed and welcome at the house. You certainly can't argue with the location, which is perfect for Back Bay and all the best downtown sites. Many thanks for putting me up, Robert!"
22354,4819587,2013-05-27,6445506,Anthony,"When I arrived at the house, Jackie was there to meet me and show me around. While the stairways are narrow, the house is filled with charm and books. It is a beautiful old place and the room on the third floor was in good shape. The place was quiet and the location was ideal. Overall, staying at Robert's was a great decision."
22354,5003070,2013-06-06,6696034,Matt,"Boston is a wonderful place. A room up narrow, twisting stairs, the steps and landings cluttered with books, a room on the third floor, the bath on the fourth, the chandelier in the room ceiling was beautiful but the two other lamps in the room didn't work, the window was broken but sealed with masking tape, computer access was easy, TV access was not, Jaky, my host said he was surprised at me, most of our guests are young he said as I took my 77 year old body up those stairs."
But Boston IS a wonderful place and I love an adventure and I slept well,dreaming perhaps of a night long ago spent at the Chelsea in New York in an altogether different time but not really an altogether different place.,,,,

22354,5425168,2013-06-29,6619450,Allison,Robert and Jacky were both great in keeping in contact with me in the days leading up to my arrival. I was nicely greeted upon check-in and my luggage was graciously carried up to the fourth floor room for me (thank you!). I appreciated the map provided and the genuine interest shown in my reasoning for visiting and staying in Boston. I was so thankful to have found this place. PERFECT location and the price can't be beat. My only complaint would be that the bed was very uncomfortable.
22354,5764109,2013-07-15,5815845,Elizabeth,"Great location, great place, awesome hosts. Really worked well for me. Thanks to Robert & Jackie for their gracious hospitality."

22354,5959857,2013-07-23,3887919,Chris,"Robert's place is great. It is historic and rustic, with hundreds of books lining the walls. He was a great host, sitting down with me after I arrived to tell me of all the important sights and monuments. The room had an air conditioner, which was essential in the brutal humidity. The bed is comfortable and the surrounding neighborhood is vibrant and safe. Definitely worth the money."
22354,5977092,2013-07-24,64436,Mark,Good location. Nice man and his assistant.
22354,6164644,2013-08-01,7671360,Steve,My flight was scheduled to arrive at 10:00pm on Sunday however my flight was delayed repeatedly.   When I learned about the delay I was able to let Robert know and he responded back to me promptly.  When I pulled up in the cab at 3:30 am Monday morning he was there waiting for me.  I was more than pleased to see him...less pleased with US Airways. :)
The location is outstanding,Robert is accommodating,and the room is functional.  The next time that I visit Boston I hope that I'll be able to stay here again.  This to me is the ultimate compliment.,,,

Right around the corner from The huge mall and all of the great shops and restaurants in back bay. He is such a kind person and has a lovely home. With books lining the walls and awesome decor throughout the room an the stairwells it made for a unique experience. Overall, a great time- Highly Recommended!! Thank you :)"
22354,6735881,2013-08-23,6473173,Nicole,"Robert is a very sweet and accommodating host.  He is a professor with great intellect and varied interests and staying in his brown stone in like stepping back into time.  If you are coming into Boston,  you can't be more centrally located to walk around and be connected to everything. I stayed here to attend a convention and it was a great decision.  The sunshine room I stayed in was clean, spacious and a good fit for my needs and I will book here again."
A couple of things that I didn't mind at all but you should know before booking.  You share a bathroom,there is no central air,but there are window units,there are very steep stairs and four flights of them depending on where your room is and the brown stone is very old and moderately updated. Robert is a lover of books,history and art and they are everywhere.  If you mind clutter this might not be the best fit for you.,

Set in a charming area of Boston with the majority within walking distance. The home itself is charming, don't let the entrance deter you. Roberts passion for history and literature is clearly evident throughout the home adds to the overall experience. Thanks again Robert"
22354,7421579,2013-09-19,7963,Harish,Robert and Jacqui were very accommodating and considerate.  Jacqui carried my suitcase to the 4th floor where my room was located.  They even provided me a instant coffee for the morning as I need one to function properly.
The fire alarm went defective the second night and Jacqui came immediately after school to change the battery.  When that did not work,"he dismantled it so that I could sleep in peace. Both Robert and Jacqui gave me lot of good tips.  Their home is in a fantastic location.  I could walk or take the subway everywhere including to the airport.\"",,,,

Only downsides to accommodation (very minor) were that the bed sloped a bit and the room was on the 4th floor. Both were fine for me,"but may be difficult on some more sensitive travelers.\"",,,,

Way too many stairs for someone not in great shape.  Be sure you clarify entry logistics, kitchen location, and third or fourth floor choice ahead of time. 12' ceilings and steep, narrow stairs-every floor makes a difference. Carried my luggage up for me -- good. Very accommodating as to arrival and departure times, even found my phone charger for me. Drawers in picture already full; could use more space for lodger's clothes."

Excellent location for my visit to NU. Definitely not a fancy pad: a quirky home with a few too many books blocking the passage up the many stairs, but anyone with a love of literature and history of the Titanic will appreciate the atmosphere here. Bed a bit uneven. Overall good value for money."
22354,8309409,2013-10-25,8331709,Emilie,"The location was just perfect as I was attending a conference at the Hynes Convention Center, and internet worked awesome which is critical for a business related trip.

Clean home and nice mix of help and privacy from Robert.  As a bibliophile I enjoyed the book piles. The stairs were as advertised, but my suitcase was carried upstairs, very helpful.

22354,9116427,2013-12-08,9968936,Zhi,"Excellent and very convenient place to stay in Boston. I went to Boston for a conference at the Hynes Convention Center, and Robert's place is only a short walk away, most of it indoors through a mall. The only drawback is that sometimes the hot water would run low if I showered very late, but I guess that I'm a bit spoiled by the endless hot water of large apartment buildings."
22354,9213347,2013-12-14,9588370,Ilse,"Lovely room in the heart of historic Boston. It is clean, cozy, quiet, and with a lot of character. Robert was a kind and caring host."

He was quick to respond to my inquiries, was accommodating about my arrival time, sent clear directions, and offered other assistance."
But I was not prepared for the wondrous,four-story ascent through history; personal,Bostonian,nautical. After settling in,I came back to this AirBnB listing to confirm the name of the fellow that carried my larger bag upstairs and realized that,in my haste
Robert tells me he has been in that building for 40+ years,and that it's the only building on the block that hasn't been broken up into individual units. As others have said,there are books piled high in all directions,walls lined with maritime & equine artworks. If your luggage is large,Jacqui (apologies if I've misspelled his name) will carry it upstairs for you. If *you* are large,I can imagine that the stairway would make you uncomfortable.
I'd driven down from Maine through a bad snowstorm--even passing an overturned SUV in NH--so it was wintery & cold outside. The room was warm & spacious,the bed comfortable enough that I slept longer than I meant to,the hot water flowed to the fourth floor bath more quickly than I'd expected. I've stayed at dozens of AirBnBs and I was pleased to find that Robert's fourth floor room has a writing table,and that it's large enough that you can actually get some work done. The wireless network is fast and reliable. A smoke detector in the stairway began chirping while I was there; they quickly addressed the issue.,,
The location is easily accessible by public transit when you arrive & depart,and it's a great base from which to explore this very walkable city during your stay.,,,,
Robert and I talked at length when I arrived,and I regret that my schedule didn't allow another opportunity to sit and engage with him over a cup of tea. He's a knowledgeable and gracious conversationalist,"and I hope I'll have the opportunity to stay with him again on a future visit to Boston.\"",,,

Robert is considerable man,who help me with me dorm check-in,and give me a hand of carrying luggage to my dorm room,which really let me feel warm in this snow day.,,
All in all,"it is one of the most impressive BNB that I have stayed.\"",,,,
22354,9925685,2014-01-20,10031559,Sarah,As others have said before me this is an excellent location for walking to many of the places you might need in central Boston. Robert is certainly very laid back on arrival times and although I hardly saw him or Jackie because I was out so much at least I knew they were there and ready to help if needed. I found the bathroom rather chilly but my 4th floor room was warm and gives good space.
22354,10547067,2014-02-24,9543998,Kevin,"Robert is a lovely and gracious host. I arrived in Boston fairly late, and he had no problem accommodating me. His house is as described: practically a museum and a library. And the location is pretty terrific, too."

22354,10812650,2014-03-09,7556657,Lacey,"I stayed with Robert while in Boston for a conference near Copley Square. It was the perfect location and had all the amenities I needed-- a bed, desk, bathroom, warmth, quietness, cleanliness.  His home also has a ton of character!"
22354,10896177,2014-03-11,9511603,Nate,Robert was helpful about what things he thought were worth seeing around town and flexible about my arrival time. Things were neat and tidy.

22354,11637689,2014-04-10,633019,Carly,"I stayed on the top floor (the room pictured) for three nights. The location was exactly what I needed, a few blocks from the conference I was attending. Otherwise, my stay was fine (but not great). Robert was responsive online before and after my visit, though I didn't meet him in person - Jackie(sp?) took me to my room when I arrived, carried my suitcase upstairs and took the time to point out walking directions on a map. The bed was not very comfortable, but fine for a few nights. The room was clean. I shared a bathroom with one other person, but there was never any hot water. There were other people staying/living in the house but I never ran into them. There are no locks on the bedroom or bathroom doors; I didn't realize this until I arrived and was only given a key to the front door of the house. None of my stuff was moved or stolen, but it did make me a little uncomfortable. Overall, very convenient for this trip but I probably won't return."
22354,12110008,2014-04-23,8604905,Betsy,"This was a lovely place to stay--very centrally located, a few blocks from everything, yet peaceful, spacious and comfy.  I spent three nights here, while in town for the Boston Marathon, and it was the perfect oasis.  My only reason for a 4 rather than a 5 is that the bathroom was shared between 4 guests, so once I had to take a lukewarm shower (post-marathon!)."
22354,12153965,2014-04-24,3667495,Shannon,"Charming!  My only regret was that I did not have time to spend chatting with Robert.  Upon arrival Robert had a map and a Boston magazine for me to help with my itinerary.  He was incredibly thoughtful in making sure I was aware of all the wonderful opportunities Boston has to offer.  He allowed me to drop off my bag before the room was ready so I would not have to carry with me as I toured the city.  After a full day out and about, returning to this lovely home was perfect.  The house was quiet and the bed was perfect for the night.  I could not get over how quiet the city was, even with leaving one window open for fresh air.  The next morning when I was ready to check out, Robert once again offered me to leave my bag so I could be light as I did the Freedom Trail.  When I return to Boston this will be the place I book.  Thank you Robert for such a great experience."

Robert is very kind, knowledgeable and helpful.  Kinda studenty, lots of character, shared bathroom but the other residents were qiuet, discrete and have been there for a while.  A single woman travelling alone... it was OK!"
22354,12353588,2014-04-29,14344485,Matthew,Robert's a great guy who is full of useful information about the city. I'd recommend a stay at his perfectly-located home to anyone who is planning their first trip to the area!
22354,12388773,2014-04-30,10402766,Pamela,"I totally enjoyed my stay with Robert. The location is terrific and within walking distance to the center of Boston. Robert is a kind a gracious host, and very responsive. The room was lovely. I stayed on the 4th Floor. The wifi worked perfectly. Robert and Jackie helped by explaining how to get where I wanted to go, and suggesting restaurants and shopping places I might enjoy. Also, there is free overnight parking from 8 pm to 8 am. Robert fed the meter for me so I didn't have to get out early to avoid a ticket. He also pointed out places I might like to visit. I would definitely stay here again."
22354,12993852,2014-05-16,5419567,Vivian,"It was a delight to spend the night at Robert's place. An eclectic, book-strewn old walk-up in the heart of Boston's South End, it exudes the musk and mess of time gone by. If you are a corporate executive looking for elegance and elevators, this isn't the place for you. If you're happy being a guest in the home of a historian with a flair for old prints of luminist paintings and bas-reliefs of horses, then give this place a try. All the better if you are not in a hurry, for you'll want to spend some time grazing through the mountains of books that are stacked everywhere.  Robert and his assistant were exceptionally helpful, as I was in town for a medical visit, and they made me feel right at home, even though I must have worn their patience thin by arriving near 1 a.m. due to a late flight into Logan. I would have stayed longer had they to been booked, but in lieu of that, Robert secured me another place nearby the next day.  All in all, a lovely visit with lovely hosts. I'd do it again in a heartbeat."
22354,13069550,2014-05-19,12681092,Pablo,Very good place to stay for few days. Robert is excellent!
22354,13234228,2014-05-22,3881973,Andy,"Would not recommend for several reasons: 1. It's run more like a soulless hostel than a community-driven airbnb. 2. Place itself is a hoarder nightmare with no room to walk hallways cluttered with stacks of books and trinkets you'd see at a yard sale. 3. Front entrance is blocked by piles of books and other yard sale so must enter at sub-street level with extremely narrow entrance. 4. Owner does not present himself during stay. 5. Title suggests it's in Copley Sq. but it's about 8 blocks away. 6. Host seems more interested in volume and monetization and less on experience, community and connectedness so this listing is not in the spirit of Airbnb."
22354,13260094,2014-05-23,13789746,Sultan,"Robert was a great host and very friendly ! he gave me directions, tips, and kept a good communications. I stayed in the place for less than 4 hours, but I really enjoyed it. The location is the best 10 min walk from everything and the transportation in Boston is wonderful. Thanks! would come again if I'm back to Boston!"
22354,13391896,2014-05-26,15808913,Joshua,"Rob and Jamie were great hosts.  I was going to a music festive and just needed a place for my girl friend and I to stay for the weekend.  My plans kept changing and so I was not sure when I would arrive but they were very flexible and offered me a train card and advice on getting around the city when I arrived.  Jamie said there was another couple staying that weekend that we shared a bathroom with but we never saw them around.  All in all, if you are looking for a nice place to crash in Boston and friendly, knowledgeable hosts, I would highly recommend Rob's place!"
22354,13527485,2014-05-29,15959008,Ivan,"I had a great stay here. The neighborhood is amazing, in the middle of everything! Only a few blocks to Copley square and major public transportation hub Back Bay Station. The room was at the top floor of a classic brownstone up 3 flights of narrow wooden stairs that reminded me of an antique dealer's shop. Lot's of unique objects, decorations and tons of books. Make sure you have no problem climbing up and down the staircase."

22354,14174744,2014-06-13,544588,Chris,Funky old home and a comfy bed. Robert was accommodating despite my unusual schedule that made finding a time to check in and collect the keys annoying.

22354,14211324,2014-06-14,289496,Raja,Had a terrible time communicating to the host. Msgs sent on airbnb for directions came back with a standard copy paste even more confusing directions in broken English. Email sent to host email address bounced and texts were never responded. Calls rarely attended or returned.
"I had to take this place just for a night and I took this place due to the proximity to my meeting place. I managed to land at the door and while on taxi I called Robert to update him that am on the way and the response I got was \"\"ok\"\"",,,,,
When I landed there I was searching for the door number and then a guy came out from the basement and was kind enough to take the bags to the third or fourth floor of the building. Thankfully it was a small bag else it will be a disaster in that narrow,"dingy steps with thousands of books on the sides. Some scary antique stuff as well. It was like a museum. \"",,,,

22354,14766929,2014-06-25,17162105,Michael,Robert was very helpful in greeting my guest late at night and making sure he could access his room. Very communicative and helpful!
22354,14937860,2014-06-29,8312275,Martin,"Robert was accomodating, helpful, interesting. His house was a dream taken out of a 19 century book. Will crash his place again if needs be."
22354,15021631,2014-06-30,3411661,Phillippe,"Robert's place was great. It's a large, beautiful brownstone that's loaded with books in a great part of the South End. I didn't get to see Robert much because of my whirlwind wedding weekend, but he had a very warm welcome on my arrival"
22354,15240387,2014-07-05,17163682,Jonny,"This worked out perfectly for me. Robert and Jackie were friendly, easy-going and accommodating. The house is a brownstone with a number of rooms for guests. The rooms were clean. The hallways were filled with books, but it was in no way inconvenient, and they were very helpful in moving my bags. The price was excellent for the neighbourhood. I would stay here again."
22354,15259098,2014-07-06,9604213,Andrea,I was in Boston for just one night. Robert is an extremely welcoming host and his house is a victorian jewel in a very nice neighbourhood. I'll definitely come back.
22354,15554515,2014-07-11,17496916,Alexa,"Robert was a welcoming, polite host. The room was exactly as described in the listing: lovely, quiet, comfortable. He gave me an excellent recommendation for dinner, Taste of Siam on Tremont, which was only a short distance away. I would most certainly recommend this location and host to others, and I would definitely stay here again given the opportunity."
22354,15922500,2014-07-18,9487804,Michelle,Robert's home is in a beautiful and safe neighborhood in Boston that is very convenient for sight-seeing! We had everything we needed! Thanks Robert.
22354,16021023,2014-07-20,16628430,Tim,"I was very warmly received by Mr. Bonds in spite of my flight being late and arriving after midnight. The room was roomy, clean and comfortable, and the bathroom was well-equipped and very clean as well. The house is in a beautiful neighbourhood and is a perfect place from which to explore Boston's most beautiful and historic sights, like the Boston Public Library, the Public Garden and others."
Mr. Bonds was very helpful and always responded quickly to all my inquiries both during the booking process and while I was staying there.,,,,,
"I would happily stay in this room again the next time I am visiting Boston.\"",,,,,
22354,16111289,2014-07-22,36783,Kay,"Robert was accommodating from the start and willing to make adjustments in room assignment and check-in/out times to best suit my needs. His home is in a great location, close to multiple T stops, shopping, parks, several neighborhoods in walking distance. I'm a runner and Robert's location is just a mile from the Charles River Esplanade!"
I stayed in the sunny room on the 3rd floor with shared bathroom. It was spacious,had plenty of light - you can't see it in the photo but there's a skylight as well. The bed was comfortable and though I didn't end up needing it,there was an air conditioner available. The bathroom was clean and spacious as well.,,,
I was in town just to meet up with friends and know Boston pretty well so I didn't end up up benefiting from Robert's knowledge of the city but I overheard him talking about the nearby sights to other guests and he was kind,considerate and was providing good recommendations.,,,,
I would be happy to stay with Robert again!,,,,,

22354,16150236,2014-07-22,3463232,Robert,"Robert was welcoming and friendly. The neighborhood is fairly close to the city center, safe, and cozy. The apartment was clean, as you'd expect."
There were a few other rooms Robert was also renting out via AirBnB,but we only briefly saw another one of the people staying as we left in the morning.,,,,

He recommended me some restaurants and places to visit.  The room was on the 4th floor, clean and very quiet.  I slept well.  The location was perfect to walk around or take public transportation to access downtown Boston.   I did not talk to him after the first day but I am extremely happy to choose this place to stay."

Robert was a great host, taking the time to talk me through a bunch of things I could do during my time in Boston. The room was a fantastic place to stay for my time in Boston."
"\"",,,,,
22354,18548366,2014-08-28,17743998,Marlon,"I truly enjoyed staying at Robert's place. Situated one block from Back bay station and Copley square, you could not ask for a better location in Boston. The rooms are spacious and clean. All rooms are uniquely decorated with antiques while still offering a modern amenities. No hassle to check in or check out. Robert has mastered the art of AirBnB."
22354,18889046,2014-09-02,17656146,Ezequiel,"After an exhausting ten hours trip by bus we arrived to the house. No number at the door. No door bell. We knocked hard the door, we shout, we clapped our hands. There was no way to warn our arriving without a local cell phone nor internet. After waited more than an hour a neighbour lady saved us and phoned Robert who was in the inside."
The house was like a big reservoir of books with narrow corridors and closed doors. The room was OK. It was like we expected. The water used to take a long time to heat up. I had to take one of my showers with cold water.,,,,,
"Robert was very kind and explained to us the tourism circuits in the city. The neighbourhood and the street were beautiful.\"",,,,,
22354,19518005,2014-09-14,9650555,Sean,"Robert's house is beautiful antique charm and I felt honoured to stay there. It was comfortable, central and private whilst making me feel part of Boston's culture."
22354,19711936,2014-09-16,21187590,Grace,"Robert was a wonderful host. He was extremely helpful and welcoming when I arrived, and gave me great restaurant recommendations, subway instructions, etc. The room itself is beautiful and as pictured, and the location is very convenient. I would definitely recommend staying with Robert if you have the chance."
22354,19871141,2014-09-20,17546304,Craig,"If you are traveling to Boston by yourself and are looking for a great value with a perfect location, consider this Airbnb. Robert is a kind host, and he provided knowledge of shuttles to the convention I was attending, as well as ideas for what to do in the evening."
The location was excellent. It is very close to Copley Square and all of the entertainment and food for which one could hope,and if you are in town for a convention at the big convention center on Summer St,it is only a 2 mile walk. I loved it for starting and ending my day,as it took me through Chinatown,and I also explored other parts of the city.,
As Robert states,the bathroom is shared,but in my 4 nights there,it was never a problem.  He provides instruction on how to use the shower and to be patient for the hot water,as it must climb 4 stories to get to the shower.,
My two recommendations for guests are:,,,,,
1. When looking for his house number,you will not see it where other houses display,as he uses a side entrance beneath the main stairwell. It can be a little tight.,,,
2. Pack lightly or in smaller bags. You will have several flights of stairs to climb to your room,and as is typical for the era of the home,the stairs are steep and narrow. Also,the halls are narrow,so large luggage may prove challenging. I used a backpack,and I was fine
In closing,I would recommend this Airbnb to light travelers who are looking for outstanding value and location and who are able to climb stairs. Free wi-fi is available. There is no television,but with Boston just outside your door,TV isn't needed.,,
Thank you,Robert,"for your hospitality.\"",,,
22354,19956291,2014-09-21,5176707,Jessie,"My husband and I stayed one night at Copley Square on our way back home from a long road trip in New England. The room was quite spacious - even for the two of us, and the only trouble we had with the shared bathroom was having to wait to get in to use the facilities in the morning because someone was showering."
We did very much appreciate Robert's good communication,flexibility on arrival time changes,assistance with directions,and the convenient,historic location of his rental room. And he was very accommodating with giving us the freedom to leave our bags at the room before and after check-out time,and come and go freely.
But as for the accommodations themselves,we found that they weren't 100% right for us. The room was as pictured,except that the other half which isn't shown is basically a storage area with a huge euro-style floor-to-ceiling closet unit,rolled-up rugs,Christmas decorations and lots of random decor items. For such a spacious room,it felt a bit claustrophobic. And while the linens and rental room itself were reasonably clean
Overall,if you're looking for a reasonable room in Boston (which isn't easy to find),and don't mind staying in a very old,somewhat quirky,historic home with lots of oddities,that has been very well lived-in

My wife and I stayed in Robert's house for 5 days and had have a great memory here. Robert and his copartner Jackie are very kind and helpful that reducing much stress during our journey. Robert is also a respectful person and has deep knowledge in Chinese culture, we had a great talk one night and it's still impressive now. I will surely stay here for my next visit in Boston!

22354,21077683,2014-10-11,19630842,Jason,Robert was a great host as this was my first trip to Boston.  I stayed for one night in the top floor room.  As soon as I arrived Robert was there to greet me and provide me with a few recommendations on places to visit and eat.  He has Visitor guide brochures on hand which helped me to map out destinations during my travel.  I would highly recommend him for anyone looking to visit Boston in the future!

The house is beautiful and the room is exactly like described. It was very nice, comfy and clean. The bathroom had a hairdryer and an iron which any female traveler will appreciate big time. Communication with Robert was fast and smooth. He accommodated my early check-in and late check-out time which helped me a lot.

While the location was good and the room had a comfortable bed which looked out on a nice view of trees, the general condition of the property was run down.  It clearly is a treadmill of AirBnB borders, with four or five rooms rented out at a time. There is no hospitality or interest in making your stay pleasant.  The bathroom only had an old, worn out piece of soap by the sink and none in the shower.  There is no access to any kind of kitchen, refrigerator, or microwave.  I never saw the owner."
22354,21714208,2014-10-22,16058681,Murray,"Roberts place was extremely convenient for central Boston but in a lovely quiet street and only a short walk away from the T or airport shuttle. There were several narrow flights of stairs to negotiate which may not suit everyone, especially with heavy luggage. The room was very characterful and comfortable with interesting eclectic furniture. This BnB worked very well for me just being in town for one night for a meeting."
22354,21790113,2014-10-24,7030529,Thomas,"I arrived quite late at Robert's house as my flight landed at 10pm at the airport. Robert gave me indications to arrive to his adress prior my departure but when I arrived at the location, I was not sure what to do. I knocked on the door, looked for someone. I did spend 5 good minutes in the streeet waiting to be welcomed. I had to call Robert with my cell phone using international credit. Robert was welcoming, the room I was in was on the 3rd floor and hard to reach with a big suitcase and a heavy computer bag. The room was just how it looked on the picture. I was not excepting anything different. The bathroom was a disappointment for me. It was shared with other people so you had to wait in the morning to use it. and it was quite dirty (not to say very). The great location made it up for me and the street of the house was nice and colorful."
Having said that,I felt like I was staying at my grand pa's and that did not felt good to me.,,,,
Robert was very kind,I am not blaming him.,,,,

I stayed in the 4th floor room.  The bed was comfortable, and the room was quiet.  Would stay here again."

Robert's suggestions for seeing the sites and providing me brochures and maps was very nice and helpful. The neighborhood is very convenient to many attractions and easy transportation. This is a very popular Airbnb (Robert quoted > 1000 in 3 years?) So the rooms, particularly the bathroom is showing signs of wear and not quite as clean as portrayed in the pictures and could use a professional scrubbing. I do not recommend for business travelers."

22354,24904057,2015-01-03,9443112,Isaac,"I had a good stay with Robert. Location is perfect for arrivals to Back Bay train station. My room was large, very warm, and had a very useful desk where I could work. The house itself is very interesting, full of books and kitsch artifacts. Robert was very nice, he gave me some maps and explained me a bit about the city. Nice stay!"
22354,25126708,2015-01-07,11427210,Herman,"much as the other reviews describe:  excellent location if you have any business in the back bay, south end area. mine was at hynes. excellent for transport to social elsewhere in boston as it is convenient to the green and orange lines as well as commuter rail and logan express bus.  plus many good restaurants up on boyleston st, 5-10 minutes walk away.  also comfortable, clean bed and room. warm room despite marble floor and horribly cold boston weather (20f) one day. safe location."
not much interaction with robert (unfortunately as i would have liked to hear his take on china,but my schedule was totally packed); jackie was very helpful in providing tea amenities.  the kitchen is not particularly useful.,,,,
hot water ran out one morning where i was the last person (i think) to get into the shower on the top floor.,,,,,
finally as one review above notes:  long narrow stairs and halls packed with books. the books are no issue (i have too any also) but i would agree that if you have any mobility issues at all (i don't) or you like to bring along huge suitcases (again,"never) it would be a difficult hike to floor 4.\"",,,,
22354,26553445,2015-02-15,16876461,Alison,"The room as great, and the bed was comfy. In spite of unprecedented Boston cold, I was warm all night long. The host was very friendly and helpful with T routes and local dinner options. Personally, I loved the stacks of books lining the stairs and halls of this classic Boston townhouse. Good stay, highly recommended."
22354,27808738,2015-03-12,5671333,Celeste,"Had a wonderful experience here! I basically had the room and the bathroom next door to myself. Robert teaches part time and is clearly very knowledgeable. Upon arrival, he handed me a map to orient myself and suggested places, restaurants, attractions to check out. He also loves to chat, and is a pleasant person to  converse with. In addition, he made sure I was doing alright and that my stay was going according to plan. The room as well as the house in general is very well maintained and is BEAUTIFUL. This room was on the top floor, so got a lot of sunlight during the day. The stairs and nearly half of the house is lined with shelves of books. A towel is provided. Robert was also kind enough to give me a heads up about the running water. Leave it running for a while and the hot water will definitely come up. I had no issues during my stay at all."
This location was PERFECT as it was in proximity to Back Bay train station. It is also nearby lots of shopping areas,the museum,and incredibly walkable to chinatown,the north end,west end. I had such a wonderful time in Boston,I actually did not want to leave. I would recommend Robert's place in a heartbeat.
Thank you for a wonderful time,"Robert!!\"",,,,
22354,28991881,2015-04-02,27400818,Tyler,"This was my first stay at Robert’s place, and I highly recommend it. Robert is a gracious host, and helped me settle in as well as make sure that check-in and check-out were easy. My room was great; it was spacious and clean with a lot of natural light. It was also immediately next to the bathroom, which was very convenient. I spent most of my time at a conference, but when I was at the house, it was quiet and relaxing. The house is also in a great location, with many bars and restaurants in the area."
22354,29487444,2015-04-08,26702049,Timothy,"The room was exactly as I expected. Charming, convenient location. Very easy and pleasant."
"The only thing I would note about this particular room is that it is right next to the shared bathroom and is thus noisy.\"",,,,,
22354,29878914,2015-04-13,774978,Melissa And Andrew,"Secure,simple and easy to deal with.close to transport,restaurants and a short bus trip to New York City.just what I needed for my stay."
22354,30439451,2015-04-22,24297129,Tom,"I stayed here for the time I was in Boston running the marathon and it worked perfect for me. Location is central to all attractions, room was clean. Robert was quick to respond to any questions I had. Some people in other reviews complained about the clutter but I found the decorating unique and charming, all the books didn't bother me, just wished I had time to read some of them. Bathroom is minimal and the water could be hotter. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. After all, if your in Boston, how much time do you spend in your room anyway."
22354,30856022,2015-04-28,2269856,Harmke,"Robert was very nice and informative about great places for a tourist to visit. Thanks to his advice, I visited the Museum of Fine Arts for free. Furthermore, he tells interesting details about the history of Boston (and the USA) which enriched my experiences. At the other hand, I had very much privacy and felt free to do what and when I wanted. The bed was fine. The room was quite crowded with stuff, as the stairs were. The bathroom was reasonable."
22354,31222431,2015-05-03,10721766,Jennie,"Although I didn't meet Robert in person, he was very easy to communicate with leading up to my arrival and his partner was very friendly and helpful once I arrived at their home. First, the location is absolutely ideal for anyone visiting Boston -- centrally located in the city with many places to walk to and easy to hop the T for destinations a bit further off. Robert's place is also very comfortable and I was lucky enough to be staying when the cherry blossoms just out the bedroom window were in full bloom -- just gorgeous! I didn't spend much time hanging out in the room because I had other plans that weekend, but the couch and desk made for a very comfortable workspace as well. All in all, a pretty perfect place to stay when visiting Boston, highly recommend it."
22354,31460914,2015-05-05,27516330,Stéphanie,Conforme à la description. Très bon emplacement.
22354,31795876,2015-05-10,7904159,Shana,"The location was ideal.  Centrally located and close to transport,  food and all basic needs.   Robert was helpful in advising about transport and eating tips in the area.  The house is four stories up,  which would have been good to know.  However,  Robert did arrange for my pages to be brought up for me.  Room was very comfortable.  Bathroom was shared with another 'tenant'  and was clean and well provided.   The hosting is a very independent one.  I didn't see Robert after check in.  Felt safe and cozy. Books &  art everywhere,  which I love."
22354,32465668,2015-05-18,25436385,Maria,"A very quirky but comfortable stay, excellent location and super convenient. Was on a tight schedule so regretfully didn't manage to meet the host, met his associate who was very nice and helpful. I am a light sleeper and I slept very well in Robert's house. Unforgettable stay"
22354,33574048,2015-05-30,14887915,Annemarie,"After a few hours of getting used to this place (the books everywhere in the house, the lack of locks on both bed and bathroom), it becomes your home. Robert and Jackie are kind hosts, the location is excellent."
22354,34168817,2015-06-05,34485041,Wang,The room is very nice with interesting furnistures. Location is very convenient
22354,34947324,2015-06-14,20506612,Daniel,"Robert was a very kind host who introduced me to all the interesting venues Boston has to offer. I had a very pleasant stay in the room (exactly as depicted). The bed was excellent! As most US houses, you could hear people on the stairs and in neighboring rooms. I'm always prepared with ear plugs, so this was no problem fpr me. (Airconditioning on hot days will probably brings up the same noise issue). Many thanks for the good time, I'll definitely come back!"
22354,35336889,2015-06-17,19753431,Kansei,"Robert and his staff are very friendly. Also the location is perfect. The room is old but clean and comfortable. If there were some paper cups in the room, it will be helpful."
22354,36238889,2015-06-26,34929400,Harpreet,I had a great stay at Robert's place. The location is excellent. The room and bed was very comfortable.
"If you are a book lover the house is literally full of interesting books. \"",,,,,
22354,36351471,2015-06-27,36575497,Matt,Robert was helpful and flexible and the room was exactly as described. It's very close to everything you would need in boston. Close to the T and use the T for transportation to and from the airport! It's much cheaper than a cab. I didn't know that coming in. $5 versus $35
22354,36612831,2015-06-29,36310826,Stefan,The room and the location are great! Very quiet place and so close to the city center.  We had a great time.
22354,38002859,2015-07-12,4813861,Julia,"The room was great and as described. I regret I didn't have more time to meet Robert as he was very welcoming and seemed full of useful and interesting insights. The other resident Jacki was also extremely helpful, carrying my bags up 4 stories. The location is outstanding, very safe and central neighbourhood with great cafes about. The house is certainly unique and outside of the room and bathroom, which were both comfortable and clean, quite overwhelmed with books and other knickknacks! It wasn't part of the listing but I was able to store food in the fridge, which was very handy, although you probably wouldn't want to use the kitchen for more than fridge storage or a bowl of cereal. There seemed to be a lot of other people staying in the house but it was always quiet and calm."
22354,38732922,2015-07-18,35224897,Charlotte,"Robert was a wonderful host to communicate with, both during the booking process and throughout my stay. It never took more than an hour for him to return my emails and he was very accommodating with my changing schedule. The neighborhood was within walking distance of the Boston Commons, the Boston Public Library, as well as tons of shops and restaurants. Anyone who has trouble with stairs should note that the room is on the top floor of the building and the stairs are a little bit steep. That said, the room was very quiet, spacious and clean with a sitting area, desk/workspace, and air conditioning. However, the room does not have a lock on the door which took some getting used to. I would definitely recommend this room to someone traveling on business or attending a conference."
22354,39043732,2015-07-20,36133818,Meghan,"Robert was a great host! He was very knowledgeable about Boston and had the best recommendations for places to visit in Boston. We felt very welcome staying here. The home is beautiful, as well as the neighborhood. We felt safe in this quiet yet conveniently located neighborhood."
22354,40007625,2015-07-27,17274739,John,Robert was very prompt in answering my e-mails and ensured that I would find his house in the easiest way possible.
22354,40347473,2015-07-30,32984356,Liz,"Robert and his assistant Jackie were so friendly, helpful, and easy to get ahold of.  It is an old house full of lots of interesting books and knick-knacks, and is a unique stay! The location is hard to beat, just a few blocks from the Back Bay (transit) Station, and a few more to some others. Great value and awesome host!"
22354,40982589,2015-08-03,38672653,Egidio,The apartment is well located and Robert is a kind person.
However,I found some issues that I'd like to highlight: the room can not be locked (since there is no lock),"and the whole apartment is full of stuff like an antique shop (in my opinion in this case 'less is more').\"",,,
22354,41643608,2015-08-08,19361610,Taylor,"Great time in a great neighborhood! Checking in was fast and easy. Robert gave us plenty of suggestions. The room was large and comfortable. The house could double as the neighborhood library, so there is plenty of good entertainment if you get tired of sightseeing. Highly recommended!"
22354,42063954,2015-08-10,40305636,Ruyue,This place is 5 minute's walk to the Back Bay Station. It's located in a quiet street. Robert is so friendly and nice and knowledgeable. He introduced me the most valuable place to visit and explained the history of them. The room is very neat and elegant. It was really an enjoyment to live there. And I met lovely roommate in this place as well. Thanks Robert!!

I would certainly recommend Robert's place for folks visiting Boston.

22354,45020286,2015-08-30,6685383,Katherine,Robert was a very welcoming host with many recommendations for making the most of my quick stay in Boston.

22354,46216684,2015-09-08,42678597,Amy & Christian,"Great room in Robert's very cool house.  This was our first airbnb and we had a great experience.  The location was amazing, just as described only a few blocks from the square and subway. Room was clean with it's own AC unit and fan, bathroom was great, only saw another guest once in 4 days. We had to drive so per Robert's suggestion, we parked in the Boston Common parking garage all weekend for a great rate (15 minute walk). Would highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in Back Bay."
22354,46788006,2015-09-13,42816546,Juan,"The location of the house is perfect for those coming to Boston for conferences or meetings at either the Marriott Hotel or Hynes Convention Center.  The house itself is old styled- one could find beautiful glass vases! And a lot of books are stored- very academic style.  The host was helpful.  The shower and the bath tab is not so easy to use, other than that, it was a great experience!"
22354,47204582,2015-09-16,16036605,Emilia,"The place is charming! The room is a great size, the house is lovely and big and the location is absolutely perfect. So close to all the best bits of Boston."

Robert was very accommodating and made some good suggestions of sights to see during my visit. The walls between the rooms are quite thin and my neighbour was quite loud but I'm sure this wouldn't always be the case."

The rest of the time I was on my own. I asked Robert for suggestions about local restaurants and he offered a couple of great recommendations. This was my first experience with airbnb and there were no surprises. The room has exactly as described. It was clean and comfortable, with no frills. I had never shared a bathroom with strangers before, but it worked out well.  I was given a towel, but you will need to provide your own soap, shampoo, etc.  I would highly recommend this location if you are a single traveler who wants to stay in a safe neighborhood that has easy access to public transportation in a great Boston location."

He even had an iron waiting for me (I was in Boston on an interview, so an iron was essential after traveling with a suit in my carry-on!).

The house itself was quite old and there's quite a number of steps to climb to get to the room on level 4. But the room and bathroom was spacious, clean and nice. The host dioes kindly help with the carrying the luggage up and down the 4 floors upon arriving and departure which was very kind. The room is centrally heated hence no control over the room temperature. It can get a little hot or cold at times, but wasn't too bad at all. The location of the place is very central and walk-able to the core of Boston city within minutes. The neighborhood felt relatively safe at night."

The perfect setting for a Dan Brown novel, no telling the mysteries you might uncover. On top of that, the location is FANTASTIC!!! Train and subway stations literally a steps away.  Definitely my goto destination in Boston ..."

You climb a few flights of stairs, but the bedroom itself is spacious and clean. Bathroom is right next to your door. It was quite a hot day and there is no A/C on the top floor, so it was a little toasty, but overall a great place to rest for a night."

The place was in an incredible location - the views of Boston Common and the State House were inspiring. The room was huge and everything was clean and brand new.,,,,,

5215982,34440239,2015-06-08,13720772,Teresa,"Listing was as described, very clean and comfortable, with a modern and clean bathroom and an elevator to sixth floor. Excellent location. Steps to Starbucks, other coffee shops and restaurants. Keith is very responsive and attentive. It was a perfect place for us for a weekend in Boston; we would definitely stay here again."

5215982,34829924,2015-06-12,29084214,Claude,Notre hôte a répondu très rapidement.
Le logement est très bien situé,possibilitè de faire beaucoup d'endroits à pieds,la station de Métro en bas de l'immeuble avec ses 2 lignes est très pratique.,,,
Bon accueil à l'arrivée et au dèpart.,,,,,
"très grande pièce à vivre wifi et tèlè tout OK.\"",,,,,
5215982,35354393,2015-06-17,21843928,Tim,Keith made the entire experience easy and seamless. The locations was incredible and I would def stay again!
5215982,35837272,2015-06-22,2610962,Katie,"Great location, nice studio apartment with a great view of Boston Commons. One of the attorneys, Bill, was very helpful with getting us settled and addressing small issues that came up during out stay."
Main issue with this unit was fluctuations with A/C at night,and thermostat is not accessible in the unit. We wrote Keith and he responded promptly. The matter appeared fixed,but I think it went back to programmed settings on the weekend and the room can get a tad warm even in cool weather. There is no wind,so opening the windows doesn't help much and the area can be noisy at night especially on the weekends. We were not especially bothered by the noise because we have late schedules,but I would advise bringing ear plugs. I'm sure Keith or someone would have remedied the issue if I contacted them again,but it was not apparent until the night before we left.
Otherwise the apartment is really nice. The kitchenette area was much appreciated and the large table provided a great work area. There's a large tv with netflix,which was easy to use. (Volume is on the side of the remote). There is no sink in the unit though,so you will have to use the shared bathroom,which is a little inconvenient,but not a huge deal.,
"I would stay here again if I was visiting Boston and would recommend it to anyone else considering a comparable hotel.\"",,,,,
5215982,38068711,2015-07-12,37033810,Maral,"This apartment is perfect for short stays in Boston, especially if your main priority is the location! The space is welcoming, clean, and comfortable and the host, Keith, is incredibly friendly and accommodating. We really appreciated that Keith stuck around to meet us upon our later-than-expected arrival!"
5215982,39544395,2015-07-24,10218021,Jon,"Came into Boston for a quick 3 day visit, and Keith was accommodating even before we got there, answering some questions and working with us to actually check in early to drop off our bags. In terms of the unit, it is straight up awesome. It was roomy and gave us all we needed.  The view of the statehouse shown in the ad is exactly what you get. It was captivating."
"The unit is within a 15 minute walk of basically everything with  a T stop 30 yds from the front door. Felt very secure with our own key to the elevator to get us up to the top floor of the building after the offices closed. Keith spent time with us upon check in and his suggestions for restaurants etc. were spot on. Great spot.\"",,,,,
5215982,42616626,2015-08-14,28781609,Dena,"The studio is in the perfect location with easy access to everything!   We did not have the opportunity to meet Keith, however Bill was available to give us the keys and answer our questions."
5215982,46327984,2015-09-09,42553508,Sean,"Fantastic location! Truly right beside Boston Common. If you are looking for a place at the heart of Boston, this is definitely the very choice. Keith is responsive and I must say we had a nice experience."
5215982,46490733,2015-09-11,211429,Jung,"Keith's place is centrally located in Boston, with Boston Common across the street, several T stations nearby and walking distance to various neighborhoods. I didn't get to meet Keith but he was very responsive and checking in and out was a smooth process."
As Keith makes clear in the description and photos,this isn't quite your traditional layout. I got used to it just fine. For someone seeking homely comforts,this may not be the best option. However,the location and its convenience can't be beat.,,
"Probably the best aspect of the unit was that you can experience the city just by taking in the views of the architecture and the people traffic outside. Top scores from an urban experience standpoint.\"",,,,,
5215982,47415314,2015-09-18,15651234,Brian,"Keith's loft is awesome, comfortable and in a great location. I would definitely stay again when I am in town"
5215982,48482317,2015-09-26,33908351,Sabrina,Great location and nice size apt. Didn't love that the bathroom was in the hallway which ended up being locked one night...not ideal. Keith was very accommodating and apologetic for the issue with the bathroom.
5215982,48740738,2015-09-28,42065671,Daniel,Absolutely fantastic and easy stay.
5215982,49367484,2015-10-03,10532972,Matt And Drew,Easy book beautiful view. Highly recommended.
5215982,50446604,2015-10-12,27789634,Richard,"It was a bit complicated getting into the apt. We exited the subway at Park stop red line, were instructed to get the keys in the 7-11 across the street.  They had the keys for us but didn't know which direction the apt was in.  A phone call ensued to a caretaker who didn't answer the first time.  Understand we had our luggage with us and my wife was a bit annoyed at the street peoples offering of help. We finally found the apt just around the corner on winter street, one key for the outside door, one key for the elevator, final key for the apt off the sixth floor. Once inside the view of the State house and Commons was fantastic. Being in a busy part of town the street noises could be a problem.  The location for us was great, quite near the Freedom trail made touring very easy.  Keith was available by texting and usually returned answers quickly.  We used Uber back to Logan at 4am for $18, which was very convenient."
5215982,51437181,2015-10-20,28930074,John,It was our first time in Boston and Keith's place was a great place to make our base camp for exploring the city.   Right across the way from the apartment is the Park Street subway station and from there we could be anywhere in minutes.
The apartment was as advertised - very clean,with a bathroom down the hall.,,,,
Key pickup was easy and Keith was flexible for dropping bags early and getting out and exploring.,,,,,
Since it is on a main road,as some other reviewers have mentioned,there can be some noise in the evening,so some caution if you're a super light sleeper,but I slept like a rock here.,
While we didn't meet Keith,"he was available instantly via text message for any concern or feedback we had.\"",,,,
5215982,53934876,2015-11-14,8093527,Jenelle,"My colleague and I really enjoyed Keith's space. It's great to use for professional requirements - we had to work. The long table and desk allowed for us to do so comfortably while out of town. Clean, modern, great view of the Boston Commons."
The only issue would be you can hear even the neighbour sneeze. However,you have no neighbours after 5PM when the offices close.,,,,
"Thanks Keith! We'll look to stay there again. \"",,,,,
5215982,54775733,2015-11-23,18018076,Bryce,"Great location, awesome view and furnished nicely - Keurig, mini frig, the bed is comfortable, wifi. Very secure. Perfect for a weekend."
5215982,55741135,2015-12-05,2101331,Toby,"This is a very light, spacious apartment, with stunning views, in a very central location.   It is a great base to work from, or just visit Boston."
Keith was easy to get in touch with,and very prompt to reply.,,,,
The only downside is that the bathroom is outside the flat,"and because it is on the top floor it can take a while to get hot water (leave the taps to run!)\"",,,,
5215982,60193855,2016-01-20,42416391,Cathy,The host canceled this reservation 87 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

6626933,34813761,2015-06-12,31872692,Raju,Elizabeth operates like a seasoned host. She knows what guests will and may need and gave all the right instructions in a matter of seconds. We got all the privacy we could ask for.
She was eager to make sure we are comfortable and she genuinely likes to ensure that our needs are taken of.,,,,,
We did not have to ask her anything else during our 8-day stay.,,,,,
The private bedroom and the bathroom are both spacious and we had the entire floor with a big dining hall and kitchen to share.,,,,,
The speed of broadband connection was an impressive 100Mbps.,,,,,
"Would come back again if I were to return to Boston\"",,,,,
6626933,36426598,2015-06-28,34940244,Aditi,"Elisabeth has a beautiful place, the room is exactly as advertised and I had a lot of privacy: private bedroom and a private bathroom. Elisabeth also offered me to hang around in the living room if I wanted to, as well as to use the washer and dryer if I needed to. There is a TV with Roku in the room, and I was very happy to catch up on my Orange is the New Black episodes after a long day at work. :). The neighborhood  is pretty nice with a convenience store/great pizza place/bar/red line subway station within walking distance. I stayed at Elisabeth's place for two nights and it was very comfortable. I didn't see her that much because I was there for the weekend and Elisabeth and I were both out, but it was very easy to communicate with her via text and she made me feel very welcome. Highly recommended!"
6626933,36843191,2015-07-01,15032272,Kyle,"Elisabeth was a great host! Didn't see a ton of her as we were out during the days we were there, but she was very accommodating and HGTV'd us out of a pickle. Would happily stay again!"

6626933,37670744,2015-07-09,6208561,Michael,Elisabeth is an amazing host and she helps you with everything you need. I had three wonderful days in Boston thanks to her. The house is very well located. The room and the bath have been super clean and comfortable. I enjoyed my stay at Elisabeths place very much. Especially because it's fun to spend time talking with her. I would always come again.
6626933,38506614,2015-07-16,28588293,Maxi,We had such a good time at Elisabeths' place. We just met her once but she was really nice and such a good host. The apartment was perfect especially our room where we've stayed. Everything was clean and we could enjoy our time there.
The apartment is quite close to the red line which is perfect. You can be in the city in 20 minutes.,,,,,
"Everything was easy with Elisabeth and we would stay there again!\"",,,,,
6626933,39025765,2015-07-20,21568557,Mary,"I enjoyed staying at Elisabeth's place as she was a very nice, accommodating host and everything was as described. She also communicated well and promptly.  Her house is very clean, attractive, uncluttered and comfortable, including a VERY comfy bed."
When she discovered the air conditioner in the guest room wasn't working,she replaced it that day which was appreciated as it was hot outside.  The bedroom has a good sized tv with many on-demand streaming options.   Although I didn't use the well equipped kitchen,Elisabeth made me feel welcome to do so including using her keurig coffee.,,,
Prior to the visit,I was a little concerned about parking and the urban neighborhood,but found street parking and safety not to be issues.   The residential street is moderately busy so not an isolated place and in a gentrified area with people regularly walking,biking or running by so it felt quite safe.  Re parking,3 of 4 times there was a parking spot almost directly in front of the house,the other time around the corner.
When in Boston again,I'd certainly try to stay at Elisabeth's as it fit my needs completely and offered good value.,,,,

6626933,39777193,2015-07-26,5421843,Stephanie,Could not have asked for a more accommodating stay for my trip to Boston!
6626933,40221378,2015-07-29,32211645,Robert,"Elisabeth's place in Dorchester is exactly as described in her listing. She was home to greet us on our arrival and we had a pleasant conversation to get acquainted. She was very helpful with suggestions on our 2 day stay in Boston. We took her up on her favorite neighborhood establishment, The Banshee, and were not disappointed! In fact, we went back again after touring Boston all day and were greeted like regulars, great conversations with the locals, just super nice people!"
As stated,the walk to the Red Line of the T is about 10-15 minutes which makes Elisabeth's place super convenient to getting any where around Boston. The only real concern I had with staying here was the street parking but it turned out to be no problem! Basically,we loved Elisabeth's place,the neighborhood,and would not consider a trip to Boston compete without staying in Dorchester! Thanks Elisabeth,"hope to see you again! Rob & Vicki\""

Near her place there was a bus stop to go metro station, so we took a bus and then we took metro easily. Though we couldn't meet her because she was at work, she replied us really well. Great room, great host!"
6626933,42859534,2015-08-16,6224262,Peter,"My stay worked really uncomplicated and easy. Elisabeth welcomed me after arrival, helped me to get a bit of an overview of the area (nice restaurants, etc.), and after that we hardly saw each other during the following days. As the weather was nice I was out for trips through Boston most of the time, but would have had the opportunity to also use the kitchen and the living room. Not far from Elisabeth's home there was a Boston bike station, which was quite helpful. The room was cozy as described, the bed was really comfortable for a good sleep, and when I had to leave again Elisabeth even drove me to the next station which was really great (thanks again Liz)."

Our bedroom and bathroom were both clean and spacious, and we particularly liked the comfy bed. The traffic noise at night is unfortunately something you have to accept. Elisabeth made us very welcome when we eventually met and invited us to make free use of the living area and kitchen. We would certainly come back!"
6626933,49210667,2015-10-02,37493352,Ryan,The uncluttered home and the rain shower in the bathroom made our two-night stay feel comfortable and luxurious. Not too far from the Red Line of Boston's rapid transit system. The available free unlimited street parking available is unique to this street compared to the permit-only parking we saw in downtown Boston.
6626933,49605313,2015-10-05,15840981,Hillary,"The room and private bathroom were just as described.  Also, the free street parking was really convenient and it was only a 10 minute walk to the JFK/UMass T station.

Immediately when we got dropped off by our cab, Elisabeth came outside and walked us to the house.  She's incredibly nice, personable, and her place was beautiful and very clean.  We felt very comfortable staying with her and she was nice enough to give us a few recommendations around town.  Her place is a short walk to the Red Line T station and the neighborhood where she lives has everything you need close by.  Gas station and convenience store was literally down the street and lots of smaller mom and pop restaurants.  We hated to leave so early but would definitely love to come back!"

O bairro é predominantemente residencial e seguro, com um grande shopping para suprir todas as necessidades a dez minutos de distância caminhando. Algumas linhas de ônibus passam quase em frente, mas o metrô fica a cerca de 10 minutos de caminhada. O quarto é exatamente como descrito, e a possibilidade de uso da cozinha e lavanderia é um ótimo ponto a favor. Eu recomendo."

The listing was exactly as described - I especially loved the private bathroom next to the room, and Elisabeth was a gracious host. The location was perfect for conducting research at the JFK Library, and great for runs along Old Harbor. Access to the T was also quite easy. Elisabeth was especially kind in sharing her kitchen goodies (both food and kitchenware), and in allowing me to do my laundry before I left.

My boyfriend and I felt very comfortable staying in her home for one week as she gave us our own space (bedroom & private bath) but she was also willing to chat & give recommendations for things to do while visiting Boston. In addition, access to the kitchen, laundry, outdoor space made us feel right at home! Overall, we had an incredible stay at this home and highly recommend it to anyone looking to visit Boston."

Her neighborhood had a few cheap food drink places that we enjoyed and we Uber'd all over the rest of the city, which was pretty cheap.

The home is very neat and presentable with everything you need nearby. Lis was great communicating with us in regards to activities"
6626933,88504058,2016-07-24,54233675,Jürgen,"I really enjoyed to stay in Dorchester. Elisabeth was a great host and the accomodation was just perfect. My bedroom had air condition, making it really comfortable for me as Boston was so overheated during my stay. Moreover the subway red line is in just 10 min walking distance and connecting both perfectly down town and airport (just one change at south station). Overall I would fully recommed this nice AirBNB location."
6626933,89229662,2016-07-27,3569531,Zoe,Jolie chambre dans une très belle maison. Situé à 10-15 minutes du métro.  Nous avons passé un agréable séjour.
6626933,94411330,2016-08-15,89932,Claudia,A great airbnb experience! Beautiful house in Dorchester. I really like the neighborhood. Only 3 stops from south station.
6626933,95252980,2016-08-19,83173163,Melissa A,This was my first air BnB experience and I loved it. The house was gorgeous and clean and the neighborhood was friendly. It was less than a 5 min walk to the T which was so convenient. Elizabeth was a great host!
6626933,98259085,2016-08-30,75505508,Jan,Clean and nice place in a cosy neighborhood. We really liked the new Dorchester Brewery which Elisabeth recommended to us. There is a Mall nearby. To the city center it is approx. 25 min (including a 10 min walk to the red line station)
6626933,98538973,2016-08-31,88349010,Svenja,"It was okay, the house and the room have been nice and spacious."
The bathroom was beautiful with the nice rainshower.,,,,,
I can't say a lot about Elisabeth because I only met her once.,,,,,
I was a bit disappointed about the neighborhood because there was a very loud street right in front of the guestroom and I woke up very often because of loud trucks and bikes during the nights. And there is a dog living in the house next to Elisabeths house and he was barking during the night in the yard next to one of the windows in the guestroom.,,,,,
I would recommend this place to people with a deep sleep and maybe not to a women traveling on her own because I didn't felt very save going out after sunset.,,,,,
The walk to the T Station was okay,about 15min to walk along the Columbia Road,you can't miss it.,,,

Andrea welcomed us when we arrived, gave us a tour, and made us feel right at home from the moment we walked in. The place had everything we needed and extremely spacious. The photos are exactly what we expected and the best part was the area of town we were in. We rode bikes nearly everywhere and only a block away from the closest stop. For our first time staying in Boston, I don't think we could have made a better choice! 5 stars, we'll definitely be back! Thank you for the wonderful experience!"
12585455,71744821,2016-04-28,67843064,John,"Daniele and her husband were amazing! When we first got there, they took the time to show us around the area, and answered any questions we had. The apartment is in an incredible spot, and we couldn't ask for anymore."

12585455,72531017,2016-05-03,44815694,Terry,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Daniele!
Her family was very accommodating and made sure we were comfortable. Daniele even allowed us to check in our bags before the check in time so we could explore the city without having to worry about our bags.,,,,,
Even though this was an air bnb we were surprised at how professional Daniele was,the room had everything from fresh towels and mini fridge to ensuring there was enough water for us each day.,,,,
The space was clean,smelt fresh and overall exceeded our expectations.,,,,
Thanks Daniele,"this really is a North end gem!\"",,,,
12585455,72964762,2016-05-05,12615174,Dora,"Daniele and Paul are awesome hosts. It was very easy to get in touch with Daniele, she is quick to answer any type of questions. Their apartment is located in a very central spot in Boston's little Italy. Very clean flat, super comfy beds. Can only recommend and we hope to return one day!"
12585455,73849247,2016-05-10,38961729,Chenoy,Daniele was the perfect host and we enjoyed our stay. It is in the perfect location and my friends felt great staying there. I would definitely be staying with her again the next time I visit Boston. Thank you Daniele.
12585455,73917021,2016-05-11,5515222,Laura,"The hosts were friendly and responsive. The listing was a little confusing; I was originally under the impression that we had the entire floor to ourselves but the room is situated on the main floor so the host was on the floor cooking and using the living room. The fixtures are dated but everything was very clean and I feel like I could have gone swimming in the massive tub when I showered :) The neighborhood is adorable, safe, and close to everything. I am a seasoned Airbnb-er and I do think this listing is overpriced when considering the rather high ($50) cleaning fee. Overall, it was a nice stay."
12585455,74597481,2016-05-16,33247720,Katie,"Awesome location. The host was very flexible and courteous. She was very responsive. The place was clean, cute and perfect for my boyfriend and I. Very easy to get around and close to the airport."

12585455,75090504,2016-05-18,67243238,Dan,Great host.  Daniele was very nice.  The home home was cosy.  The best part was everything was within walking distance.
12585455,75230158,2016-05-20,21912197,Nataliya,"I felt very comfortable at Daniele's place. Everything was clean and prepared for our stay. There were clean towels, soap, and snacks in our room, she even left breakfast out for us in the morning. The neighborhood is full of places to visit and incredible food spots. I would definitely stay again."
12585455,75420751,2016-05-21,7137753,Connie,"Daniella had a wonderful place and it is right in the heart of Boston.  Her family is so friendly and were very respectful to us as  guests.  My husband (who is shy and reserved), really enjoyed talking with Paul.  The beds were extremely comfortable, which was great after a day of walking in the city.  So comfortable we didn't want to get up each day.  We will definitely be back and hopefully they will visit us in Florida someday."
12585455,75925158,2016-05-23,26262588,Yisheng,"Daniele's place was really clean and nice. It definitely felt like home for me. Daniele really helped me to settle down by giving instructions for every important bit and suggestions for the stay. I really appreciate Daniele's warm welcome, and O enjoyed the say."

12585455,76274673,2016-05-26,40833461,Chao-Wei (Steven),Daniele and Paul were very welcoming. Their little girl was adorable! The upsides are: 1) spacial living room and dining room for us to use; 2) the hosts were very flexible; 3) beautiful neighborhood in little Italy.
The only downside is,"the bedroom was  crammed by one queen size bed and a bunk bed and no space left so that we had to unpack on the queen size bed. \"",,,,
12585455,76425816,2016-05-27,29584573,Saskia,"Great apartment in a fantastic location, just a few seconds' walk from loads of restaurants and cafes, as well as a great comedy club called Improv Asylum. The neighbourhood is bustling and yet it was totally quiet at night as the room is at the back. Daniele and Paul were so friendly and welcoming and we really enjoyed chatting to them. They made us feel completely at home. I would 100% recommend this listing, particularly for anyone who's only in Boston for a couple of days. It's just a short walk to all the major sights and a quick subway ride to the airport."
12585455,77181337,2016-05-30,40648952,Frank,"Danielle was a great host who made my friend and I feel at home. She let us drop our stuff off before the check in time, so we could explore the city without carrying out luggage. Being a traveler, the beds were definitely one of the more comfortable ones I've stayed one. The neighborhood felt incredibly safe, and there was a 24 hour bakery right around the corner! Overall, one of the best Airbnbs I've stayed at."
12585455,78179591,2016-06-05,33601699,Dan,Great location within walking distance of quincy market. The hosts were very friendly and flexible. Found it little cramped for 3+ guys in 20's and not the best for partygoers.
12585455,78952170,2016-06-10,69226273,Aaron,"My first airbnb experience and Daniele's place definitely exceeded my expectations. Communication was easy, the beds were very comfortable, and the location prime for a visit to Boston, within walking distance to most anything. Daniele and Paul were great hosts and definitely made my friend and I feel very welcome."
12585455,80292956,2016-06-17,66039477,Jerry,"\"When staying in Boston, location is everything. Daniele's place was perfectly centrally located to easily walk to all the popular sites. It is in the north end right in the Little Italy section so walking through the neighborhood was like walking through a little town in Italy, especially at night when all the small neighborhood Italian restaurants were in full swing. When we arrived, we were exhausted, hot, and thirsty after a long day of site seeing. Daniele had the AC on high and cold bottles of water waiting for us in a little fridge in our room. Our last night was spent watching the Cavs/Golden State game on a 72\"\" HD TV. Only good things to say.\""
12585455,81261179,2016-06-21,51309579,Philip,The stay was amazing. They were so nice to us and gave us tips on where to go in the city. She even offered us dinner. The beds were nice and gave us some snacks. I would stay there again.
12585455,82211714,2016-06-26,78035706,Anne,"Daniele and Paul's place was a great find! The location can't be beat---close proximity to Mike's Pastry and fantastic Italian restaurants, Fanueil Hall and Quincy Market, and other tourist attractions. It's also a quick drive to the airport, only a few turns away from the freeway that goes right into Logan. On top of that, they were so easy to deal with and very helpful when we needed some tips on getting around. They even helped me try to print something from their personal computer! The place was clean and well-stocked with snacks and water, too. Would definitely stay again if I ever need to stay in Boston!"
12585455,88263688,2016-07-23,68871418,Angie,"Daniele and Paul were the perfect hosts! Their place in the North End is surrounded by delicious Italian restaurants, and they gave us great recommendations on where to go eat. It's also the perfect spot to explore the city, near the Freedom Trail and walking distance to the T. Their place is clean and the room has comfy mattresses. They provided drinks, snacks, & breakfast food and were very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. I would definitely recommend staying at their place!"
12585455,88441036,2016-07-24,82580060,Em,Daniele and Paul were very helpful and were gracious hosts. I will certainly recommend them to anyone wanting to stay in Boston!

As I found out, I was actually the first to stay in Alan's studio - it is brand new, and it shows. It is super clean, tidy, convenient, and tucked away in one of the best locations in the city. It was a great place to come back to and rest after a long day. Alan and his business partner Eddie were very easy to coordinate with and did a great job to ensure that I had everything I needed. Thanks again, and I will surely think of you the next time I return to Boston!"
9232355,54189812,2015-11-16,20244412,Jeff,Alan communicated clearly from the beginning and had a very easy check-in process. His property was located in a safe and very convenient location near Boston Common park. It is a small studio apartment that has all of the basic necessities.

Eddie muy atento pero el apartamente posee una cocina muy nueva con horno incluído peroEddie dijo no tener una fuente para colocar dentro y no la proveyó. El lugar es pequeño para 3 personas, y al no poseer mesa para comer ni sillas se dificulta hacerlo en la mesa muy baja que posee. La ubicación es muy buena, cercqa de todo y del subway, la calefacción ruidosa pero suficiente."
9232355,59419656,2016-01-10,6505202,Philip,"Alan was prompt in responding when I booked the room, and his local contact Eddie was very flexible and accommodating in setting up our check-in.  It was a little frustrating when I tried to contact Eddie the day before our trip for specifics.  He had had a busy day with other guests, and wasn't able to respond as quickly as I would've liked.  But when he did get in touch, he was very thorough and hospitable."
The apartment itself was clean & pleasant,and right around the corner from Beacon Hill's beautiful shops,cobblestone walkways,brownstones,and churches.  It's also steps away from Boston Common,"which made parking in the Boston Common Garage very convenient.\""

I had business at the Capitol, which is 2 blocks away -- important when it's 17 degrees out!  Whole Foods 3-4 blocks away.  Apt was clean, comfortable, warm!, and all necessities were provided.  I will look to see if this place is available every time I come to Boston."

Alan was amazing. Quick to communicate and had a team to solve any issues we had. When I booked the location,I had a human error and booked the wrong amount of days. He helped me solve the issue and was still miraculously ready to house me at my super late arrival of 12:30am.,,,,
LISTING,,,,,
The apartment was as accurate as described. Nice cozy location in with all amenities. Amazing wifi too,which I cannot stress enough. I had an international friend with me so that was clutch.,,,,
NEIGHBORHOOD,,,,,
For my first time in Boston,it was such a pleasant surprise to find myself in the heart of the city. Everything was either walking distance or a short Uber ride away. This made life so easy as I was always out and exploring. Never had to worry about not getting back. Never had to worry about safety either. I had even walked around at 4:00am and anyone still awake were incredibly friendly. In fact,"99% of Boston was amiable. \"",,,
9232355,60852771,2016-01-28,38794251,Gretchen,Great location. The property manager was very accommodating.

He was flawless in his communication and Eddie was punctual in greeting us despite our delay in arrival. Eddie went over all the little local secrets, which we really appreciated. The location is PERFECT! in the most ideal area, just across the street from Public Gardens and much much more. It's really such a charming neighborhood with a true Boston local feel. Thanks again!"

9232355,62356134,2016-02-14,52664745,Kelly,"If you are looking for a small place in a VERY convenient location, this is the place. The beds are extremely comfortable. However, if you are getting away for a fun weekend and want to sleep in a bit in the morning, the pipes are quite noisy in the morning. That would be my only negative. Alan and his property manager, Eddie, were both INCREDIBLY accommodating and easy to work with. Thank you, gentlemen!!"

9232355,64615214,2016-03-06,55162802,Jake,"Alan was very helpful, coordinating the key pickup was easy. His property manager Eddie met us and was very friendly and informative on what to do in Boston. The apartment is as shown in the pictures, a studio slightly below ground level. Great location, pretty much close to wherever you want to go. We walked everywhere while we were there. The pipes were a bit noisy during the night but probably not an issue during the warmer months. The place is probablya little too small for 4 adults but a family with one or two kids would probably work well. Fast internet and lots of tv channels. We had a great time in Boston!"
9232355,66447990,2016-03-22,54283159,Aimee,"We didn't get to meet Alan, but Edie his property manager was wonderful/helpful with sight-seeing ideas. There was plenty of space for the two of us, might be a bit tight with 4. Location can not be beaten - the park is literally down the street, as well as the shops and restaurants. It was warm, cozy, and the bed was very comfy. Could possibly do with some new carpet, but that's just me being picky. Pipes at night can be quite loud, but earplugs fix that easy. Overall a pleasant stay :)"
9232355,67219244,2016-03-27,55575377,Andrew,Perfect location right across from Boston Common. Beautiful neighborhood.

9232355,72530756,2016-05-03,12460091,Sheri,"My husband & I were met by Kevin, a friend of Eddie's at the address given to us, but were escorted across the street, behind a locked gate & down some stairs to basement in a different building. I am sorry to say I was very disappointed with the studio.  We found the studio in need of cleaning and repairs. The carpeting was heavily stained and had not been vacuumed. The musty smell was probably from the large leaks in the bathroom which had buckled the paint.  I did voice my concerns with Kevin and called Eddie but he informed me all other properties they had were booked.  They did offer another of their properties for the following night.  By this time it was evening. I could not stay in the condition it was in, and I feared the next place would be in the same condition. We found another B&B and left."
I spent over $700 for 3 nights (the $89 price is seasonal,I guess). When I requested my money back I was informed of the strict refund policy - 7 day cancellation policy. Problem is,I wanted to stay there until I saw it's condition. Alan wrote me to say many other people had stayed there & loved it,so it was just 'my opinion' not 'let me get someone over to clean it',but that I was being unreasonable.,
"The studio is in a great area - close to lots of wonderful places to see in Boston. I would have loved to be able to stay there had in been clean & repaired.\"",,,,,
9232355,73290931,2016-05-08,1989602,Shelby,"It’s basically like staying in a hot, old, dirty, and loud furnace room; stay somewhere else! (We were also surprised that none of this information came out in other reviews and somehow we paid $200 a night for this experience.)"
The apartment was in a great location,but that’s about all it has going for it. It took only a few minutes before we realized how dirty it was. The carpet has taken on a light dirt color and the bathroom and kitchen linoleum was very sticky and gross. The paint in the bathroom has bubbled out and is starting to fall off (no fan for the shower). In the bathtub we were greeted by an alive cockroach stuck on its back waving its antennae in distress. My boyfriend looked for something to end its misery and found a dust pan in the closet. We quickly realized the “maid service” hadn’t used the dust pan anytime recently; when he picked it up there was a dead and dried-out cockroach underneath!,,,,
We decided to leave and drown our sorrows in Italian food and wine. If you make the mistake of staying here and want to do the same,the place is called Grotto and is amazing!,,,,
When we came back we were greeted by what seemed to be the heat of a thousand suns,but was just the radiator. We looked for a thermostat only to realize there wasn't one. There’s only one temperature,“hot and sweaty” and the only way to adjust it is to open the door and let the cold air come in. The cockroach battle was futile,we learned the next morning that they enter through the drain in the bathtub/shower. This could be fixed by installing a 50 cent drain cover,but unfortunately it doesn’t seem like a priority.,
The last thing I’ll note is the noise. There are some pipes which kick on and off every ten minutes and make an annoying pumping sound while clanking against the wall and TV stand. The fridge is old and loud,its compressor kicks on every 20 minutes or so. You’ll hear every time the upstairs neighbor takes a step. There’s also a loud dripping sound that comes from above as well,it lasts for about 5 minutes at a time and repeats in 30 minute intervals. The final noise to note is a really random one that we heard a few times during night,it sounds like ceiling is going to collapse and end your misery. If you want to sleep,"make sure to bring ear plugs!\"",
9232355,74389981,2016-05-15,51543887,Kris,"Eddie was very welcoming and told us about the city. The neighborhood is perfect--safe, charming, and close to everything. The place is as advertised--it's a small studio but has what you need."
9232355,75429052,2016-05-21,8293228,Mike,"Our host Eddie, not Alan, met us at the door which was a basement apartment. During our stay, we had a major flood through the ceiling of the bathroom. Unfortunately, I was going to the bathroom so I was drenched in ick water from the upstairs. We called Eddie at 2:00am and it wasn't until the following afternoon he relocated us to another place out by the airport- across the bay! Eddie was more concerned that we didn't tell neighbors it was Airbnb. We left on Wednesday even though we paid through Saturday. Worst experience ever! Do not stay there!!!"
9232355,76062961,2016-05-24,49173509,Jane,"\"FILTHY, FILTHY, FILTHY. We had to wait to get in so the \"\"cleaning crew\"\" could clean. Wonder what they did?!?! I can't even imagine the last time it was cleaned. A damp rag over any or all surfaces would have helped a teeny tiny bit. Leftover coffee and grounds in the pot. Kitchen sink was dirty. Tub has mold"
9232355,76875402,2016-05-29,62681126,Joe,"Eddie met us at the unit and was there for us if we had any issues. The location was perfect, close to everything right outside your door. The bed and pull out couch were comfortable and the three of us slept well. We weren't in our room much, so for price, location and a good night sleep, the unit worked for us."
9232355,78166738,2016-06-05,21264599,Linda,"\"The great thing about Alan's place is it's location. One block from Boston Commons and two blocks from the Park Ave. Red Line \"\"T.\"\" We couldn't have asked for a better location. Also Alan and Eddie (Alan's manager) were super in there communication with us and making sure to meet us when we arrived."
The unit is clean and comfortable,and the price is reasonable.,,,,
It is a small and below-grade apartment. As a result,the unit is somewhat dark with only one window.,,,,
That being said,"these drawbacks are factored into the reasonable price. \"",,,,
9232355,79673223,2016-06-13,59937685,Julie,This is my first experience with Airbnb.  We stayed for 4 nights.  I want to share honestly with you so that you can make an informed decision.
Alan (host) was very responsive to all of my communications.  When we arrived,Alan’s associate Eddie met us at the apartment and was there quickly.  We went to the listed address but it is listed incorrectly so,as others have mentioned,we were led across the street from the listed location.  Maybe it should be listed as 5-1/4th.  As mentioned in previous reviews,we were led through a gate and down 2 or 3 steps to a “basement” apartment which is common to the area.  My only negative comment here is that the little alley-way the entry sits in is in need of a good sweep with a broom!  It would not take much effort or costs to make it far more inviting – charming even.,
The location is excellent!  It is one block from Boston Common and one block from the Massachusetts State House.  Across the common is the Park “T” (green) stop and in the other direction it is 3 or 4 blocks from the Bowdoin “T” (blue) stop.,,,,,
I made the reservation months ahead and went in and read recent reviews just before we left.  I was alarmed to see the negative reviews regarding a water leak,bugs,and cleanliness issues.,,,
The carpet is oatmeal colored and shows every spot and it was dirty.,,,,,
There were no bugs.,,,,,
The bathroom is atrocious!  Clearly they did not intend for there to be a water leak but it needs to be repaired.  Additionally,the corners and edges around the bathtub were very funky.  Clorox Clean-up and a good scrub brush would work wonders!  There may be health violations where the bathroom is concerned.,,,,
I paid almost $1,000 for this stay and not only was I not forewarned by Alan that there was a problem but I also think that an adjustment should be made to my bill.  They even charged me a “cleaning fee” of almost $100.  I do not have the wherewithal to pay for accommodations twice while going about negotiations to get my money back.  And as a result I felt forced to stay in the apartment.,,,,
I think that Alan should have contacted me (and you) ahead of time to indicate that there is a problem and at the very least offer to reduce the listing price and offer a partial refund IF I were to choose to stay there in spite of the problems in the bathroom rather than charge full price for the stay.,,,,,
And lastly,two of us were there for 4 nights and only 4 towels were provided for our entire stay.  And,please note that the subway runs under the building or at least very nearby and you can hear and feel the movement of the trains.,,,
Safe travels y’all.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
9232355,80179998,2016-06-16,58534125,Margaret,"Eddie was waiting for us and made sure we had all the information we needed.  The neighborhood is lovely, and close to everything.  The description is not as accurate as it could be.  The street shown is not where the apartment is.  It is a fairly dark airless space.  Can't imagine this room in hot conditions.   The kitchen, bedding and towels were clean, but the floors were disgusting.  Continuous dripping hot water tap in bathroom was noisy, and made the room steamy.   Was disappointed in the standard of this apartment for the price."

9232355,86259361,2016-07-15,72036671,Paul,"If you've done your research on Boston you'll see two things; that hotel rooms are super expensive, and that Beacon Hill is pretty much the centre of everything. So Alan's place was pretty much perfect; not too pricey and well located. The flat is quite large with a small kitchenette and bathroom and large lounge & bedroom. We stayed with our 5 y/o and the sofa bed was fine. No AC, but you don't need it as the apartment is lower ground and the supplied fans do the trick. Alan was very attentive to our needs and stayed in constant contact with us to make sure everything went smoothly. Highly recommend staying here!!!"
9232355,87715929,2016-07-21,3905356,Katia,"Alan (and Eddie, who we met and mainly interacted with) were helpful and friendly hosts.  There were some issues (as you can see from the other reviews) with their regular unit, so they were able to put us up in an alternate unit.  I am not going to say much specific about the other unit we were in, since it seems like it is a temporary situation, but they were helpful in making sure that we had a place to stay in Beacon Hill as we wanted.  The location was ideal and Boston is such a walkable city."
9232355,89535633,2016-07-29,13714406,Jeremy,"Rough start, but the host worked hard to make things right."
The BAD Part:  Bait and Switch - the unit I stayed in was not the one that was listed.  It did not have Air Conditioning.  My reservation said it would have AC.  It was a warm summer night.  This ruined my first night of sleep.,,,,,
The GOOD Part:  The host installed AC the next day after I requested it and gave me a $100 refund.  Communication was on point.  Always quick and always respectful.  Very easy to work with.,,,,,

Stay at Ali's allowed me to experience a different part of Boston, though still a 3 minute walk to the T, which allowed me to get everywhere I wanted to go rather quickly. The place itself was small and cozy, though perfect for me as it was a good place to rest my head."

I appreciate that Ali checked to see if everything was going well for us - and he answered quickly when I had a question about parking. (there is some free parking in the neighborhood - a huge bonus in Boston!),,,,,

The apartment itself was very small and in a basement - not the best,but not the worst. However,the space was not clean. There was a pile of socks out next to the kitchen,a pile of shoes right inside the door. When my friend used the shower she said there were little hairs all in it. There were used towels hanging on the back of the door to the apartment that we had to reach under to lock the door. The apartment smelled terrible,like mildew,and the windows were very dirty to the point we didn't even want to touch them to open them. The bedding didn't look clean either.
We were suppose to stay through to Sunday,but promptly made our exit Saturday about 6pm after attending the event we went up to Boston for.,,,,
"I am quite mad at myself for not checking the terms and conditions for making a complaint sooner as my window for requesting a refund has now closed. This host essentially got paid for nothing. This being my first experience with AirBnB has made me very skeptical to use the service again. \"",,,,,

I never met with Kelly, but she provided so much helpful information that I had no trouble at all, and she stayed in contact to make sure I had everything I needed."
9900315,78825629,2016-06-09,13054893,Steven,"Everything was as advertised, Kelly was so welcoming and easy to work with."
9900315,81475925,2016-06-23,48522502,Austin,"The apartment was perfect. It had everything we needed and was quite chic on top of fulfilling our necessities. Clean, cute, comfortable, and the location was amazing. We spent a full day walking around Boston, and being a block away from Bunker Hill allowed us to easily incorporate The Freedom Trail into our visit. There are a lot of good places to eat/drink within walking distance."
The neighbors were quiet,which is always important in apartment life. Charlestown seems like a really good neighborhood to live in at all stages of life.,,,,
Kelly was available for us to contact her at any time,and even checked up on me when I forgot to hit send on my message to her about our arrival. Definitely use her recommendations (she messaged them to us) for dining/drinks nearby.  She was quick to respond to my messages. Great apartment,"fantastic host!\"",,,
9900315,98541207,2016-08-31,50408117,Ari,"Staying at Kelly's place was absolutely amazing! The location is perfect with lots of parks and sights around. The area is very walkable and it was no hassle to get to other areas of Boston. The apartment itself was gorgeous, and even though there was the kitchen construction going on during my stay, everything was still completely functional and not an inconvenience at all. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great apartment in a quiet and conveniently located neighborhood!"

13709190,84219295,2016-07-06,80309411,Jerid,We had a great experience. Seif welcomed us and worked with our plans to arrange the key exchange. The room was comfortable and extremely close to Fenway. The room was a great crash pad after a long day and night exploring Boston. This was our first AirBnB experience and it encouraged us to use the service in the future.
13709190,86101589,2016-07-15,77480304,John,"the living accommodations were up to my standards, very nice part of Boston with lots to do around. seif made my business trip very easy."

13709190,88711613,2016-07-25,8617458,Anthony D,"I was in town for a conference and the location was convenient with a number of great restaurants nearby. Note if you're here during a baseball game, your Uber/Lyft service will be affected. The internet worked well. The window A/C worked well enough, despite the heat wave. Seif was good at keeping in communication, even though we never met in-person. The room was quiet at night."
13709190,89923930,2016-07-30,19163963,Dhruv,"Really convenient place to live and the host is very flexible. We had to check in much earlier and even though Seif wasn't in town, he made sure we had no problems checking in."

I had trouble keeping in touch with the host. I had to contact Airbnb for help, and I was finally able to enter the building after a few hours."
13709190,91176607,2016-08-04,8143495,Amaia,A big mess. Room was not prepared as we arrived and everything was very dirty. We did not get any cover sheet although we repeatedly asked for it as we also asked to clean the dirty bathroom and toillet... The answer was: this is not a hotel!!!!
13709190,91543075,2016-08-05,82926586,Mathew,Good location to Fenway.  Host was helpful.

The apt is in a quiet,"secure building in a lovely neighbourhood. It is across the street from a lovely community garden space and a 3min walk to Gate B at Fenway Park. I couldn't have asked for a better location! Thanks Mohab!\"",,,,

8153848,46103771,2015-09-07,22131142,Charlie,Jay was very welcoming and did everything he could to make us feel at home.
The place is clean,freshly renovated and had everything we needed,it was a whole good experience !,,,
Also,though it is located in Northern Roxbury,the area is pretty safe and really accessible by bike,metro or by car.,,
"We'd definitely go back there next time we come to Boston :-) !\"",,,,,
8153848,46662673,2015-09-12,26290992,Sooyoul,The room was clean and very calm.
"It's close to Downtown with 2 stops by tubes. Host Jay was kind and warm during stay. It's first to stay in Airbnb but my choice was best with the price.\"",,,,,
8153848,47442564,2015-09-18,32980950,Sharathbabu,We had a very warm welcome. Jay showed us the entire property and made us feel home!
8153848,47603281,2015-09-20,31838367,Dipu,Excellent location close to Roxbury Crossing T on orange line. Nice neat clean place good for a short stay
8153848,48611254,2015-09-27,42993587,Katia,"We had a wonderful stay with Jay. He was extremely professional and helpful and the house and room were very, very clean. The location is also very close to an orange line subway stop, making it easy to travel around the city. Definitely recommend!! If we ever return to Boston, we will stay again."
8153848,51057478,2015-10-17,45100551,Nilesh,Very Good Experience
8153848,51211648,2015-10-18,41081742,Nash,"Jay was a great host. It was my first time to the US and he made sure to tell me all the things I needed to get accustomed to the country and the city. The place is great if you are looking for a bed for the night close to the city. The fact that it is within 2 minutes of a walk away from the closest subway station - which is just a 5-10 minute train ride away from downtown center - makes this place an amazing place to stay. Again, if you have a family or are looking for a very upscale place to stay, this might not be your thing. But if you are like me and are looking for a clean nice bed to crash in for the night, this is for you!"
"Thanks for the excellent hospitality Jay!\"",,,,,
8153848,51799473,2015-10-24,45106383,Dai,"Jay was very kind and really great host. The house is clean and cozy, i was relaxed and enjoyed staying. The area is easy to get into the center."
8153848,51982577,2015-10-25,6736800,Caroline,"This was a clean, quiet, and pleasant place to stay. I would recommend it, particularly to any budget traveler. It is a mini-hotel in a home, with multiple guests and bedrooms with locks and separate keys. I didn't stay long, but the other guests were quiet, clean, and respectful. Jay was a good host -- always quick with responses to my questions. I could have used a little more instruction before arrival on the key guard and which lock to use, but it was not a big problem in the end because Jay was quick to get back to me."
8153848,53306404,2015-11-07,22721743,Michel,"Great location, very uncomplicated, excellent communication. Very recommendable!"

8153848,54419461,2015-11-19,21588421,Daniel,"Great location, nice room, house, etc. Jay's a nice guy, is helpful (we got a desk in my room since it hadn't had one at first) and clearly wants people's stays to go smoothly."
8153848,55018213,2015-11-27,21373327,Moritz,"I had a really nice time! The place is as described in the advert, it's very clean and comfortable and Jay has made me very welcome. It's a 3min walk to the subway station and Back Bay is in walking distance through a nice part of town. Cooking facilites are great, there is a big kitchen and living room.  It's quiet, I had no trouble sleeping."
Altogether,"it's a very nice place and I would stay there again.  \"",,,,
8153848,55633798,2015-12-03,49791278,Harvey Kung (鉑凱),"It was a great experience while I was in this cozy, warm and clean room. Great location, good living function, and really meet it`s description. Paradise is perfect choice for a high quality trip."
8153848,56343769,2015-12-12,34747135,Terra,The attic room was nice and cozy.  Bedding and towels were clean and in good condition.  The house host was very kind as well.  Shared bathroom was clean.
8153848,56468100,2015-12-13,49726,Meredith,"Great space for a last minute need! Bathroom was clean, beds were comfy. Easy to access with key code."
8153848,56819388,2015-12-18,51073517,Patrick,We had an excellent time! The room was clean and very warm. The beds were really comfortable. The bathroom was clean. The house is also right next door to the best restaurant in Boston. I would highly recommend to stay here if you visit Boston.
8153848,57066090,2015-12-21,50527655,Chong,It's a really good place to live in. The host is very nice. And the place is convenient to catch the subway.
8153848,57192889,2015-12-22,39107557,Yitao,"Nice apartment, very convenient if you wanna a short visit at Boston"
8153848,57469216,2015-12-26,11052655,Jing Jing,"The room is as pictured and it was just what my friend and I needed for a four day stay in Boston. The bed was comfortable enough, and the room was clean, neat and fuss free.  However, if you do stay in this room, you just got to be careful when waking up and walking around because of the slanted roofs; I guess we weren't really used to that on the first day and knocked our heads a few times."
What I really liked about the apartment was the convenience of being located near a subway station such that it was very easy to travel to places. However,the house was located next to a restaurant and there are often people hanging out there at night. It was quite daunting when we were cat called while trying to return to the house.,,,,
But overall,"I think it was still quite an acceptable experience staying in this house. \"",,,,
8153848,58657107,2016-01-03,15563559,Courtney,"Donovan and Erica were very friendly, despite me not being at the house very often during my stay. The place was clean, steps from the metro, and perfect for what we needed."
8153848,59143488,2016-01-07,18557825,Hayoung,"The house was very nice, it was fully set so we could use everything freely. People were also friendly."
And subway station is located really close. It was comfortable to reach any point of Boston.,,,,,
"We had a great time here :) I'd like to stay here again when I come back to Boston. thank you!\"",,,,,
8153848,59734504,2016-01-14,53944285,An,"He was so warm and welcoming when we arrived, and the stay was lovely. Donovan was really helpful in helping us settling into the star, and the room was awesome. All in all, a five star stay!"
8153848,60283387,2016-01-21,36599223,Joachim Morre,We had a really pleasant stay at Donovan and Erica´s. Would recommend it to anyone!
8153848,60619504,2016-01-25,38486816,Ivan,Donovan was very welcoming! He definitely made us feel at home and I would not hesitate to stay here again.
8153848,61210521,2016-02-01,30501848,Akshay R,Living with Donovan and Erika was super fun. It was close to the Orange Line and the 66 and other buses(less than five minute walk) so it was easily accessible. The room was comfortable and my stay was happily comfortable. Donovan and Erika are fantastic hosts!
8153848,61351949,2016-02-02,50560971,Jack,"Erica and Donovan were both incredibly welcoming and make you feel very much at home. Also dealt perfectly with our arrival and stay, especially considering we booked late and the house is incredibly close to the train. Would definitely recommend to any travellers visiting Boston."
8153848,62533893,2016-02-15,54313777,Yoonjeong,"I had really great time in Donovan's house. Donovan, Erica, and every guest are kind, helpful, and friendly. Location is really amazing. There is Roxbury Crossing nearby the house. It was first time that I visited the Boston and it was really great! :)"
8153848,62932519,2016-02-18,57783197,Teresa,Lovely place and hood! Near the subway and restaurants!
8153848,63311018,2016-02-21,33211809,Aubrey,The place was as advertised. Checking in was a breeze and out was the same. He provided all the necessary linens and bathroom stuff. Good place to stay in Boston!
8153848,63750397,2016-02-26,48872809,Terry,"I had to cancel my first booking because of mice in the house, so that meant I had to book something in a very short notice. Donovan's loft had an instant acceptance policy so everything worked out very well for me."
Donovan was great with communication,the code lock system works great and it's convenient and the location is excellent with a T station nearby.,,,,
Donovan instantly accepted a change I requested to my reservation and he made sure to inform me beforehand about some construction the water company was going to do.,,,,,
"I would definitely book again!\"",,,,,
8153848,64582759,2016-03-05,25246599,He,Very comfortable environment! Good place for backpacker who fisrt time arrive Boston!
8153848,65478480,2016-03-14,22415776,Zhixin,This place is great for people who want to travel in downtown Boston because it is 3 min walk to the nearest subway stop. Nice and cozy room with great wifi!
8153848,65918603,2016-03-18,35105657,Norma,"My daughter and I spent two days in Boston sightseeing and meeting with friends. We felt very welcome in the space, Donovan was available through text messaging and responded promptly, including VERY early in the morning when there was a mixup with towels. The beds were comfortable, as were the kitchen and living room to hang out in. The whole house was very clean."
What the ad does not list is that this is a 3rd floor attic walkup,with a tight entrance into the room,bathrooms on the 1st and 2nd floors,and because of the slanted ceiling,no real place to sit comfortably (except for one chair). There is also no space in which to put clothing or hang up a wet towel.,
HOWEVER,it would be a great space for one or two young people who are carrying very little with them and who don't get up several times to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. I would return to this home,but at my age (62) would need a different room.,,,
"The house is very close to any public transportation you may need to take.\"",,,,,
8153848,66245286,2016-03-20,16523099,Pietro,"The house is in a good position, 10-15 minutes from downtown with the metro. The public spaces in the apartment are good. The room was clean even though kinda smallish (but that is something you can tell from the picture). Overall I think it was a little expensive for what we got. We had a bad experience the first night (even though it wasn't the owner's fault) when an altercation between one of the other person that was in the house and a girl resulted in a window being broken with a stone. We were waken up at 3 in the morning by the police outside of our room. It wasn't a big deal (and to be honest, it was St Patrick's day and these things can happen) but it definitely didn't make our first night the best possible one."
8153848,66960716,2016-03-25,61714514,Yingrui,The bathroom door lock is broken. Had to put a sticker on the door to use the bathroom.
8153848,67098855,2016-03-26,59939062,Brittany,"The listing above is as advertised, a small attic room with two twin mattresses and free wifi. This sounded perfect for an overnight stay for me and my buddy. The building was easy to access and within walking distance to public transit making it an ideal place to stay if you're wanting to explore the city."
That being said,the neighborhood is a little daunting. I felt unsafe leaving my car parked in the street and was cat called by some of the locals hanging around outside of the house. It made it an intimidating experience to walk into the residence late at night.,,,,
I was also under the impression I would be staying in someone's primary residence. This listing is more of a hostel environment. The various rooms in the house are rented out by other bnb guests.,,,,,
The attic was very very hot. We turned on a fan and opened the window but couldn't get any air flow through the room. The pipes were also very noisy throughout the night and I had a hard time sleeping through the clicks and thumps.,,,,,
Overall,I do not think I would stay here again but would recommend this place if you aren't intimidated by the rough feel of the neighborhood and the small,"hot living space. \"",,,
8153848,67782726,2016-03-31,27844331,Romain,"Logement bien situé, prés du métro. Chambre propre et confortable. En revanche nous y avons très mal dormi car la chaleur dans la chambre était insupportable  malgré la fenêtre et la porte ouverte  et  malgré les températures négatives de l'extérieur. Nous avons du supporter le bruit de la rue et de la circulation ainsi que les aller-retours des autres locataires airbnb nous réveillant avec la lumière du couloir durant la nuit. A part ce désagrément, le logement est vraiment très bien."
8153848,68014680,2016-04-01,18966489,Claire,Donovan's place is a short walk to the subway and from there it's easy to get into the city centre as well as over to Cambridge / East Boston. Bed was very comfy and accommodation clean. We also meet some others who were staying in different rooms at the property and enjoyed chatting with them.
8153848,68614387,2016-04-05,39757583,Jay,"The room was not as pictured (one bed was one the floor) and the room is dirty. When I inquired about the bed, I was told it was functional and offered no other solutions. Additionally in the attic is very warm in the spring because the heater is on and all the heat moves up to the top."
This is a hostel type of room with 7+ listings and only two bathrooms.,,,,,
The keyless entry is nice and the wifi was functional. Convenient to the subway (orange line). Neighborhood not the safest at night,"there was lots of noise. \"",,,,
8153848,69054247,2016-04-08,29826261,Irene,As described. Keep in mind there's only one chair plus the beds. Some kind of peg (at least) for wet towels would have been helpful; there wasn't any place for them in the room and I didn't think I should leave my wet towel on the bathroom towel rack because the bath is shared by several rooms.
8153848,69186211,2016-04-09,46812791,Ruslan,Awesome place. Awesome stay. Thank u.
8153848,69829225,2016-04-13,7406939,Tom,"A friend of mine was very concerned about the safety of the area, but it was fine.  We toured the mosque, had dinner at Ashur Restaurant, and walked all over Boston.  We never met the host of the house, and saw only 4 other visitors while we were there.  The room is cramped but the beds were comfortable.  My son had hoped to access the Reggie Lewis track to continue his training but you need a membership or a day pass."
8153848,71174174,2016-04-24,6034082,Matthew,"Pros: Communication was great right from the start. The property is very easy to get to via MBTA and was easy to find thanks to great directions. The property was secure, clean, and overall very comfortable. Neighborhood might be considered a bit dodgy by some, but as 2 guys we felt fine walking around."
Cons: Only one really,but was an annoying one. This room was so HOT it was almost impossible to sleep at night. I understand this room is in an attic,but under amenities was listed 'air conditioning.' We never saw the owner/host to inquire about this. The room was so damn hot every night we were there,"that this alone would prevent me from renting this property again.\"",,
8153848,71889292,2016-04-29,69212933,Larry,Great place! Will come again for sure
8153848,72036844,2016-04-30,8187895,LeAnn,"Very easy check-in and check-out process. Parking was easy to find. Overall, great experience! Thank you :)"
8153848,72154892,2016-05-01,66781419,Joan,This was my first experience with Airbnb. Everything went very smoothly.  The room and bathroom were very clean and neat.  We needed a second towel and left a message but did not get one.  The location was perfect for our visit. We were unsure if the downstairs front room was private or a common room .  I would certainly use Airbnb again on another trip.
8153848,72514892,2016-05-03,69856705,Kirk,I was very pleased and surprised at how nice my stay was the hosts were very pleasant and helpful when asked anything but at the same time were not intrusive at all so I was able to hey the rest that was very much needed and was always upon arrival welcomed with a friendly hello and big smiles

The room is just as described in photos.,,,,,
The room got air conditioning but the window can not be closed. And sometimes there is no shampoo provided in the bathroom.,,,,,
"The house is nice and I will recommend it.\"",,,,,
8153848,77859782,2016-06-04,70519116,Allie,Conveniently located near train station for easy commute. The house was set up like an apartment building and we had the attic room. It was small but clean and there were only two bathrooms shared between 6+ rooms... I think all the rooms were occupied while we were there so we had to wait our turn to use the shared facilities.

Upstairs from a pretty decent restaurant, and phenomenal pricing for the location. Loved the room set up and bathroom on almost all floors! Can't really ask for anything more when traveling.

Everything was clean though one of the showers was broken. Nice common area downstairs. It is not in walking distance from most sights, but close to the T. No complaints for the price."

This place is essentially a renting company who rents out rooms for people. C1 and C2 are located in the attic, basically. Only way you can stand up is in the middle, and that is if you're under 5'10\"\". This is far from being paradise."
The neighbourhood is located on the cusp of the ghetto. I was genuinely surprised no one broke into my car,which was by the way parked on the street. I had to move my car during my stay since it was on the side where the sweeping was done on the 1st and 3rd of every Wednesday.,,,,
"Not impressed at all.\"",,,,,
8153848,91474345,2016-08-05,71345536,Cira,Reaching the Apartment wasn't difficult because it is near the T and easily to find.
We had the room at the attic. It was very hot and stuffy  in the room when wie arrive but you the room has a A/C so it wasn't a huge problem!,,,,,
The bathrooms were not so clean as described.,,,,,
But the room has a big tv with Amazon Prime and Netflix access,that was great!,,,,
A very big fault was,that nobody told us about the change of the password of the front door,so we were stocked outside in the evening with the wrong password.,,,
We were lucky  that we had met our room neighbor one day before. So we'd contact him and he opened up the door.,,,,,
"Nevertheless the apartment is great located and you need only 10mins to downtown.\"",,,,,
8153848,92561799,2016-08-09,74315730,Tom,"The listing was accurate, the neighborhood was a little bit rough but fine (I didn't stay in the room much longer than to sleep and shower).  Very close to the subway, found a parking spot right in front of the building and didnt have to move the car until I left (Friday - Monday).  Was a $10 cab ride from Fenway Park (I would use subway to get back but stayed in the fenway area at a bar each night and the subways dont run when the bar closes)."

We didn't spend too much time in the room. Only downfall was the bathroom. It didn't have soap dispensers and the toilet was clogged at some point. Other than that, the stay was okay."

Very reactive,he was easy to reach and flexible to arrange our arrival time.,,,,
His place was clean and we had a lot of space,with a big living room and a fully equiped kitchen. The bed mattressses were just awesome,very important thing after a long day visiting Boston.,,,
It is a bit far from the heart of Boston,but the price definitely worth it. I would suggest anyone to rent bikes because he has a station close to his place.,,,,
To sum up,I would definitely come back again,"thank you so much Oliver!\"",,,

The room was a good size, and we were provided with towels and other items we needed. The only problem I had was that we we're awaken at 2:30am because of loud conversations inside the house, and all the lights were turned on. I don't believe it was done maliciously, but please be consious of those around seeking to have a good night sleep. I was not able to get one that night."

-Close to the airport which also made it easy to get into downtown Boston,,,,,
- Super comfortable bed,,,,,
- Clean room,,,,,
- Dan was very nice,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
- There were two of us who checked in,but we only got one towel,,,,
- While the bedroom was clean,the rest of the house was very messy. Living room had no furniture,only random stuff/boxes everywhere.,,,
- Also,I just want to clarify for future guests that there isn't a TV to watch if you stay in the smaller room. It didn't matter to us,but I think it'd be helpful to know for future guests.,,,
Overall I'd recommend it as a place to crash. It is very convenient and on the cheaper side. Also,Santarpio's pizza is only a 10 min walk away!,,,,

It was comfortably close to the airport and in walking distance from the trainstation. A table is infront of the room with an microwave,snacks and water for guests.,,,,
Our room was incredibly hot though,they provided us an extra fan to cool us down but the room was still very hot at all times.,,,,

Place was in a great location - easy access to get to other places in boston as well as being in a serene and beautiful neighborhood ! I would def stay here again !

4105704,21904768,2014-10-26,22292860,Christophe,"Accueil très chaleureux,"
Nous sommes arrivés tardivement et Helen était disponible pour nous recevoir.,,,,,
Le logement situé dans une maison victorienne est très confortable et correspond exactement à la description proposée.,,,,,
Cela nous permis d'apprécier pleinement notre séjour à Boston et de profiter de la tranquillité et de l'indépendance à proximité immédiate de la ville (5' à pied du terminus Forest Hills de la ligne de métro orange et de tous commerces et facilités).,,,,,
Helen est très prévenante et veille à ce que nous ayons tout le nécessaire. Les savoureux petits-déjeuners (granola,jus de fruits et muffins mémorables) font partie de nos meilleurs souvenirs de notre séjour à Boston.,,,,
Helen a aussi su nous donner de bons conseils pour les visites.,,,,,
"Un très grand merci à Helen !\"",,,,,
4105704,22332161,2014-11-03,22846893,Roger,My wife Carole and I stayed almost a full week at Helen's place and we were very pleased with the warm welcome of our host and her  constant attention to our comfort. The appartment was comfortable and cosy and well located in terms of access to the subway. The daily morning treats that Helen prepared everyday were well appreciated.  We do not hesitate to recommend the site.
4105704,23546851,2014-12-04,22344264,Roberto,"I really enjoyed a four weeks stay at Helen's apartment. It is a very nice and convenient apartment, big and clean. With a well equipped kitchen, big bedroom and a study. Moreover, thanks to the private entrance, it was like staying at an independent apartment."
Helen and his husband were really hospitable,facilitated my stay with good advices about the area and delicious surprises as a piece of cake or pumpkin bread.,,,,
The apartment is very well situated,near the orange line T stop that reaches Boston center in less than 30 minutes. Moreover,I was able to enjoy the nice surroundings,especially the Arboretum and the Franklin Park,"nice places to do some exercise like you are in the middle of the forest.\"",
4105704,23693224,2014-12-08,23186732,Marilyn,"We loved staying here. The rooms are spacious and warm. We appreciated Helen and Stewart being available to answer questions and bringing warm pastries every morning. Breakfast included OJ, yogurt, cereal and fresh fruit. We plan to come back!"
4105704,23899066,2014-12-14,5165002,Michele,"I had a great experience in this Jamaica Plain studio. It's adorable, convenient to shops and public transportation, and Helen makes sure you're not lacking for anything. She was a gracious and knowledgeable host, and her homemade granola was amazing. I have already recommended this lovely and charming spot to my relatives, who visit our other family in JP more regularly. Thank you, Helen!"
4105704,25354724,2015-01-13,23979928,Can Baris,"We stayed about 1 month in this cute apartment. The apartment is in the third floor and has a private entry. It is well-situated, very close to the subway (orange line) and bus station.  Helen and Stuart were always very warm and helpful. They responded our needs and requests promptly without exception."
4105704,25459523,2015-01-16,3940091,Mitchell,"Helen was a wonderful host-- we made an error and accidentally booked in the wrong part of town, but she was extremely accommodating with our reservation alteration request. She and her husband even woke us up in the morning with fresh-baked muffins, which was definitely one of the most personal touches I've seen in an Airbnb. If ever you need to stay in Boston, Helen's studio is a great place to stay!"
4105704,25763131,2015-01-25,1497952,Heather,"Helen's lovely and bright studio was the perfect home-base for my short weekend visit to my hometown. She was friendly, gracious, accommodating and communicative, the best one could hope for in a host! I loved staying here and will definitely hope to book again when I next pop in for a visit in JP!"
4105704,25977154,2015-01-31,7468183,Christian,The Greys were very hospitable.  They plowed a spot for my car and a path to the door.  There was a nice breakfast delivered to me each morning.  They ensure that I had a confortable stay in Boston.  I would stay here again.

4105704,26819524,2015-02-20,16607649,Andy,Helen met us from the station even amidst the dramatic snow scenes - this was really helpful and welcoming. The flat was lovely and homely and just as it looked in the pictures. Helen was really knowledgable about the local area and shared lots of ideas of where to eat and what to see. There is lots to do just around the corner from the flat - Jamaica Plain has an excellent vibe. The hosts' helpfulness was boundless and they were more than happy to help with anything including fixing the TV. The Orange Line takes about 15 minutes into the centre of the city and its just a 3 minute walk from the flat. The flat and the hosts impressed massively and Boston was an overall big hit.
4105704,27408668,2015-03-03,8566474,Dennis,"\"We had a great trip to Boston to visit my son who lives in Jamaica Plain.  The Greys were perfect hosts.  They were helpful and responsive to our requests.  The apartment was exactly as advertised, spacious, very clean, & comfortable.  Located about a 10 minute walk to the subway made it easy to get around in Boston without a car.  We were grateful for the breakfast items included especially the arrival of the \"\"morning goodies\"\"."

4105704,28121739,2015-03-18,5202987,Katie,"My husband and I had a lovely time staying at Helen's! Helen and her husband were so warm and welcoming. Helen even met us outside to help direct us to parking when we got to the residence and took us in and showed us around. The apartment was even prettier than the photographs and had all of the equipment and spices we needed for cooking snacks that we brought. Helen also went the extra mile by having things like coffee, milk, and her amazing homemade granola stocked. In addition to having a wonderful host and staying in a great apartment we also loved the neighborhood. Jamaica Plain is a cute neighborhood worth exploring when you visit Boston and the train was only a 3 minute walk from the apartment so made getting downtown fast and simple."
4105704,28256967,2015-03-21,6217059,Marla,"Helen and her husband were fantastic. The space is bright and cheerful, and her homemade granola is DELICIOUS. Would happily stay there again, if they weren't booked solid for months."

Helen provides a great breakfast too. It is a three-minute walk from the last stop on one of the T lines about 20 mins from downtown Boston."

4105704,30541500,2015-04-24,5724779,Nikki,"We thoroughly enjoyed our week long stay at Helen's apartment. Her, or her husband's daily visits with fresh pastries and fruit became something that we eagerly anticipated.  We also appreciated the other amenities of a well stocked coffee selection, milk, juice, and granola. The rooms were spotless, the bed was VERY comfortable, and the toiletries provided were pure quality. On the cold and rainy Boston Marathon day, she even provided ponchos for us!  We did have to park more than a half mile away during some of our stay and be aware that it's a three story climb to the room - BUT totally worth it. We WOULD recommend this place."

4105704,30921892,2015-04-29,26426260,Annette,"Helen and Stuart were gracious hosts. They let us know that they were available if needed, but allowed us our privacy. The room was open, clean and did have a private entrance.  There was a separate kitchen, sitting/sleeping and dressing area but still all open. The location was easy walking distance from the T. We were impressed with the beautiful walkway to the private entrance.The stairs were steep, which was fine with us, but would be difficult for individuals with mobility issues."
As mentioned before there was delicious homemade granola,fruit,"yogurt and pastries provided daily. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay \"",,,
4105704,31579981,2015-05-07,26473993,Krystina,"We really enjoyed our stay in Jamaica Plain. Perfect location, close to metro and walking distance to great bars.

...ein Appartement,das den Bildern voll und ganz entspricht und dazu Gastgeber vom Feinsten - kaum zu übertreffen.,,,,
Wir haben uns bei Helen und Stuart sehr,sehr wohl gefühlt. Helen hat uns sogar vom Bahnhof der Station Forest Hills abgeholt. Jeden Morgen wurden wir mit Frühstücksleckereien verwöhnt,das homemade Granola macht einfach nur süchtig. Saft,Milch,Tee,Obst
Das Appartement war tiptop sauber,das Bett sehr bequem,die Küche bestens ausgestattet,im Bad herrlich flauschige Handtücher. Die Lage zum Arnold Arboretum Park zum Joggen,die sichere und gute Nachbarschaft,nur 3 Min. zu öffentl. Verkehrsmitteln mit nur 20 Min. Fahrtzeit nach Downtown

They suggested local spots to visit and were very helpful before and during the stay. The apartment was amazing — clean, comfortable, cozy. To top it off, homemade/local pastries were dropped off for breakfast, along with other treats. Highly recommended!"
4105704,34695876,2015-06-11,3612270,Matthew,"The combination of a beautiful, well-appointed apartment and friendly hosts make this place a real home away from home. A fridge thoughtfully stocked with basic provisions on arrival and baked goods delivered for breakfast were unexpected bonuses, and we really liked the Jamaica Plain neighbourhood, which has a nice community feel within easy striking distance of the city centre. Highly recommended!"
4105704,35068562,2015-06-15,28831068,Linda,Thanks for your hospitality.  We had a wonderful visit to Boston and loved the apartment.

We love to cook, so the kitchen was absolutely perfect for us too! The space is bright, airy, and has tons of victorian character."
The neighbourhood of Jamaica Plain is a little out of the way of the downtown core of Boston,but VERY close to the subway and buses.,,,,

This was my first Airbnb experience and it was extremely pleasant. The apartment is just as described; clean, very cozy and had everything we needed for our stay. I really appreciate Helen's commitment to being green and using sustainable products. Helen's taste for breakfast goodies is spot-on! I loved her banana chocolate chip muffins on our departure day!! She left us ample fresh fruit and other assorted cereal and granola as well as milk and my partner's favorite orange juice. The Keurig took the stress right out of our morning search for coffee. Really Helen has thought of everything. The neighborhood is really special. The Harvard Arboretum is a 5 minute walk away and so worth the morning stroll. There are tons of great places to eat & drink right in JP, about a 10-15 minute walk from the apartment. The orange line train station is a easy three minute walk away and can't be beat when you're looking to watch the Red Sox wipe out the Yankees at Fenway or browse the various tourist attractions Boston has to offer. This location met all of our needs as a couple looking for some fun as well as peace and quiet. Helen's neighbors are great too! I highly recommend this place! Thank you Helen for everything!!"
4105704,38396271,2015-07-15,34322400,James,"Helen and Stuart were exceptional hosts, and made us feel very welcome in their home. The location was just right for us. It's about a 5 minute walk to the orange line train, which takes travelers right to Boston's main spots. In the other direction, about a 10 minute walk, are great shops and restaurants. The apartment is comfortable and beautifully appointed. Helen and Stuart brought pastries each morning, and were excellent resources for places to go in the neighborhood, and in the city."

The surprise daily breakfast treats of croissants and muffins, along with fresh fruit and the coffee maker made our stay even more satifying.We would recommend Helens place, to any (URL HIDDEN) is exactly like it is on site."

Helen met us friendly,showed the house patiently and explained all the conveniences it has. Moreover,she gave us some advice and ideas to explore the city and recommended restaurants and shops in Jamaica Plain. Helen was always willing to solve any problem or give more information if needed,which was very easy as she lives downstairs. Helen was extremely respectful and let us enjoy our privacy,however it was easy to communicate with her before and during our stay. Each day in the morning,she kindly brought up some delicious bakery
As for the apartment,it is upstairs in a house which is located in a quiet neighborhood at about 30 minutes by subway from Downtown Boston,not far from restaurants and shops on foot. It is luminous,fresh,cool,colourful
"I strongly recommend this choice in Boston!\"",,,,,
4105704,40463144,2015-07-31,7077033,Jana And Bill,"We had a little difficulty connected to get access to our room.  Unfortunately, it was very hot that day, a long day (but not late) of driving and traffic beyond our comfort zone. The stairs were difficult for us and unexpected.  Also, there is no parking on the street during the day, but Helen was able to secure parking with a neighbor which was very helpful.  The apt. is three rooms, which consists of the kitchen eating area, and a large bedroom and nice bath.  Helen did connect with us and provided delicious breakfast goodies for us to have each morning.  Juice, muffins, yogurt, fruit, coffee, etc.  It was exceptionally nice.  We got a lot of good exercise and managed thru it."
4105704,43473786,2015-08-20,26842270,Marcus,The apartment was neat and clean and looks just like in the pictures. Helen and Stuart were excellent hosts. Even though they weren't home when we arrived they made sure that we would be let in and shown around by Helen's parents.

She was very good at keeping in touch before and during the visit to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.  We loved the studio at the top of Helen's gorgeous house.  It was spotlessly clean and the breakfast food provided was lovely especially the homemade granola and the warm baked goods that appeared every morning.

We were able to check in early which was great. The studio worked really well for us. Although it was a little way out of the city it was literally a 5-minute walk to the end of the Orange subway line (Forest Hills) and from there only a 15-20 minute ride downtown. It was very well equipped so if you wanted to stay in and cook you could - we walked down to Centre Street and can recommend both Noodle Barn (good value) and Vee Vee (more upmarket). It was a quiet neighbourhood and we felt safe walking back at night."
Stuart and Helen provided excellent breakfasts! There was yoghurt,fresh fruit and juice every day as well as delicious fresh pastries/homemade muffins.,,,,
Stuart was always to hand (via text) when we wanted advice/directions anywhere.,,,,,

4105704,51942363,2015-10-25,42628602,Chelsey,"Would recommend to anyone visiting Boston! Spacious, beautifully decorated studio. Location is a very short subway ride to downtown. Breakfasts were delicious -- Helen made amazing granola and brought us warm baked goods each morning! We felt very welcomed during our stay!"
4105704,52219769,2015-10-27,40235476,Danielle,Hospitality: Helen was so pleasant welcoming us into town. She was so friendly I felt like we were long lost family members. She gave us a nice orientation and explained how to get down to the local restaurants. The kitchen was equipped with breakfast options and absolutely delicious home made granola. I could have eaten that for every meal!
Amenities: The place is exactly as it is represented in the pictures online. Good use of small spaces. Full working kitchen and very clean bathroom. Shower gets hot quickly.,,,,,
"Neighborhood: We felt very safe walking around the neighborhood and loved to look at the old houses and landscaping.\"",,,,,
4105704,52819695,2015-11-02,28778792,Alex,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and it set a very high benchmark. Helen and Stuart were very accommodating, responsive and kind."
The apartment was exactly as described in the listing and photos,and was a very warm,welcoming and clean space. The location is a quick five-minute walk to the Forest Hills stop on the Orange Line,which takes less than 20 minutes to get downtown. The neighborhood was beautiful,and felt safe at all times. The breakfasts every morning were a wonderful addition,as were the little things in the fridge and freezer.
The stairs up to the apartment were a little tight and winding; while we didn't have too much of a problem,it might prove difficult to climb for others.,,,,
We enjoyed our stay in Jamaica Plain,and felt very safe,"welcomed and respected by Helen and Stuart. We absolutely would recommend these hosts to anyone traveling to Boston! \"",,,

4105704,53337702,2015-11-08,27806327,Rebecca,This has been the best Airbnb experiences I've had so far! Helen and Stuart were both very sweet and accommodating. They did a great job of keeping in touch and making sure we had everything we needed.
The space was absolutely charming - exactly like the pictures. Everything was spotless when we arrived and the kitchen was stocked with milk,juice,granola and oatmeal. There is also a keurig so you can enjoy a cup of coffee with Helen's freshly baked breakfast goods. The orange line was a short walk through the neighborhood and took us to most of the spots we wanted to see.,,,
"I will definitely recommend anyone visiting Boston to stay here!  \"",,,,,
4105704,53873779,2015-11-14,37103431,Anica,"Helen was very welcoming and accommodated us with a late check in. The apartment is very spacious, clean and charming. The baked goods brought to us each morning along with a selection of cereals, fresh fruit and Helen's delicious home made granola (which I just had to get the recipe for) made this a truly comfortable stay for my partner and I. We felt very at home. Thank you for a fantastic stay."

4105704,54694860,2015-11-23,35508648,Kristopher,"Jamaica Plain is a great launching point and this house is quintessential Boston. Helen and Stuart both went out of their way to greet us and made our time more enjoyable. They were in no way obtrusive during our stay. The house is about two blocks from a T stop which made getting around a breeze. We loved the space, the location, and the hosts. Everything said in the previous reviews is absolutely true, right down to the delicous baked goods and homemade granola. We would not hesitate to rebook with Helen and Stuart on a return trip."

4105704,59276618,2016-01-09,43958572,Felix,Schon die herzliche Begrüßung durch Helen gab uns von Beginn das Gefühl willkommen zu sein. Bei Fragen oder Anliegen jeglicher Art war Helen immer erreichbar und konnte uns stets weiterhelfen.
Das Apartment ist sehr schön eingerichtet,sauber und verfügt über eine sehr gut ausgestattete Küche. Die Beschreibung der Wohnung im Inserat ist absolut zutreffend.,,,,
Jamaica Plain ist ein ruhiges Wohngebiet mit guter Anbindung an die U-Bahn Station Forrest Hills,welche in 5 Gehminuten erreicht werden kann (Fahrtzeit nach Downtown 17 Minuten).,,,,

It is set up to make you feel like you are at home, but has the amenities of a hotel. Helen left us delicious fresh baked goods every morning, in addition to homemade granola, coffee, tea, hot coco, yogurt, fruit, milk, ect. She was extremely flexible with arrival and departure times, which we were very grateful for! We would not hesitate to stay here again on our next trip to Boston!"
4105704,61132026,2016-01-31,11652884,Todd,"Repeat customer, here... Fabulous experience, as always. Helen and Stuart provide fabulous accommodation and unparalleled hospitality.  Feels like home away from home.  Thank you, guys!"
4105704,62532626,2016-02-15,22824587,Jen,"My sister and I decided to stay at this lovely and bright apartment for our weekend stay in Boston. The location couldn't have been more perfect! There were tasty restaurants, shops and a Whole Foods within close walking distance. Helen was eager to help us locate anything and everything of interest! She even had a basket with maps, guides and brochures about city activities and attractions. We walked a short distance to the T and found our way quite easily around the city. Samuel Adams Brewery Tour and the party bus to Doyle's Bar was just one highlight of our trip. I cannot say enough nice things about the host, Helen. She keeps the place spotless and fresh, uses natural cleaning products (which is important to us), and even brings up warm pastries for breakfast in the morning! The spread she left for us was far more elaborate than any hotel's continental breakfast! Yogurt, homemade granola, milk, juice, coffee, hot chocolate, and an assortment of teas. We felt spoiled! Helen was also flexible and so easy to communicate with. She let us check in and check out late and was even very gracious when we let her know we had broken a wine glass while doing dishes. It's all those details that make her place such a treasure!"
4105704,63897138,2016-02-28,43378272,Wendy,"Perfect.  The apartment is spacious, clean, bright and fully equipped with everything I needed for a comfortable stay, and then some.

Das Apartment ist sehr schön eingerichtet, sauber und verfügt über eine gut ausgestattete Küche. Das Frühstück, dass Helen uns zubereitet hat, war sehr lecker, besonders ihr selbstgemachtes Müsli. Die U-Bahnstation ist in ca. 5 Minuten zu Fuß zu erreichen."

"Vielen Dank.\"",,,,,
4105704,66353992,2016-03-22,27697260,Elizabeth,"From the moment we got to the apartment, Helen was so welcoming. She showed us around, talked us through everything and left food and drink for us (including a coffee machine with refills). She had even written Welcome Jack and Lizzie on a chalkboard by the door. Each morning she left us fresh baked goods (either homemade or from the local bakery) which were delicious and so nice to wake up to. Throughout the trip she stocked up our supplies of fruit, yoghurt, juice, and consistently made herself available over Airbnb with recommendations and advice."
The apartment itself is beautiful - on the top floor of a large period property that has lovely furniture,a comfortable bed,fast internet,cable,a bright airy kitchen,a clean bathroom with a good shower
The location was great - Jamaica Plain is filled with independent restaurants,shops,bakeries. I would especially recommend Fiore's Bakery,Vee Vee for meal times,and 7 Pond if you like a good coffee. The apartment is about 4 mins walk from the station which takes you into the heart of Boston in 15 mins. So easy to connect from Amtrak (less than half an hour) - can't speak for connections from the airport.,
Overall,we couldn't recommend here enough. If we came back to Boston,"we would definitely look into staying here again.\"",,,
4105704,67385984,2016-03-29,51438296,Pam,Helen was a gracious host. Every day she left me a freshly baked item.
The kitchen was stocked with all the basic necessities. The apartment is quite comfortable,spacious and nice,"and the location is perfect for me -- across the street from my daughter and her family.\"",,,
4105704,68286811,2016-04-04,279636,Laurence,"One could not ask for better hosts and a better place to stay than at Helen and Stuart's apartment in Jamaica Plain. It is not just that they show up every morning with a fresh croissant or a muffin or a scone (usually still warm!), but that they are such great people and the apartment is so charming.  While I was there, an unexpected snowfall caught me with only a light jacket and light shoes. Presto, they lent me a heavy coat and some boots. What is more, Jamaica Plain is a vibrant area and the apartment is just minutes from the Forest Hill stop on the Orange Line T: 15 minutes to the centre of town!"

Helen and Stuart made sure we were comfortable by getting us oriented to the neighborhood. The apartment is located in a very quiet residential area just a short walk from a T stop, so navigating our way around Boston was easy without the need for any other form of transportation. We also enjoyed walking to the local restaurants in Jamaica Plain. The kitchen is well equipped, so saving leftovers or cooking a meal was also something we did frequently. And, the fresh pastries that our hosts delivered to us daily were wonderful! We felt welcomed and comfortable during our stay."

The breakfast they provided was super yummy and gave us the perfect start to our day.  The studio was wonderful, extremely charming and very clean.  It easily felt like home.  The location was awesome too, on a quaint and safe street.  The subway station was a quick walk away and it took us everywhere we wanted to go easily.  I would highly recommend this place!"

Every morning, they provided us with delicious breakfast from local bakeries. Helen was very helpful and provided us with suggestions for sight-seeing and travel. The apartment itself was great, with a lot of character. It was great to have a full kitchen as well as an AC unit. The location was perfect and the transit station to downtown could not have been any closer. We thoroughly enjoyed our time in Boston and at Helen and Stuarts'."
4105704,78972993,2016-06-10,23317033,Josh,"With a delayed flight, we arrived at the Studio around 4am. Stewart was there to greet us to let us in and show us around. The Studio is in a quite neighborhood and a five minute walk from the Orange Line T. The place is lovely, it had everything we needed. There's a Charlie Card for the T, an umbrella for the weather, homemade granola (which we couldn't stop eating), milk and coffee. There was even freshly made pastries every morning!

The apartment style home is the perfect amount of space. It is everything you see in the description and the pictures without any surprises. Stuart and Helen keep the place very clean,and always stocked with breakfast items and other treats. Their place is stocked with all the kitchen,bathroom,and bedding essentials one or two people could need for a week or so.,,
Their place is an extremely short walk away from the orange line train station,which can take you downtown in 20 minutes. My wife and I used public transportation the whole week and it was perfect. Their place is conveniently located near a beautiful arboretum,grocery stores,and plenty of restaurants. Jamaica Plain is a beautiful little town with lots of things to do,and it's only a few stops away from downtown.,

4105704,86748443,2016-07-17,53760723,Craig,"Just returned from a fabulous holiday in Boston and wanted to let everybody know about our fabulous host Helen. As soon as we arrived she walked us from the train to her home,gave us the tour and was lovely in every way. As we had travelled a few hours from New York,she recommended a few places locally to eat and drink. As we were unpacking,she came back upstairs with 2 beers and a lime! Just what was required and so kind,we were taken aback. This was a theme that continued for our whole stay. Delicious fresh pastries and cakes left on the landing every morning,delicious home made granola,wee messages sent to our phones to see if there was anything we needed,it was a joy to live there. The place itself is lovely. Spacious,studiously clean and in a beautiful neighbourhood,its situated about a ten minute walk from a whole host of bars and testaurants in Jamaica Plain. We recommend Costelloes,irish bar with great staff,great beer and huge portions of food!"

The apartment is spacious and furnished comfortably. Kitchen is roomy and fully equipped, including coffee maker with coffee stocked. Small, older bathroom, but adequate. Home is in a mature neighborhood about 3 blocks from mass transit, so I could hop on the Orange Line T to get downtown both days."

Waking up to Helen's SCONES, CROISSANTS, and so much more baked goods is amazing by itself....but the location of JP is awesome and the place is kept up very nice a has all the essentials for a nice stay. Your own entrance and exit (in the back of the house)' hardwood floors, Home-made granola, and did I mention the scones???! :-) Helen helps out with food suggestions and parking arrangements right when you get to her home. The subway station is walking distance away from the apartment and is literally a 20 min ride to downtown Boston so it's perfect. I also suggest just walking to the shops and restaurants in JP (Jamaica Plains), because they have a lot of little thrift stores and coffee shops all over. Sam Adams brewery isn't far either which makes it a sweet deal too!"

Additionally, the outdoor lock with a code did not always work--even after putting in the correct code, it took two or three tries for the lock to open up. The actual unit had no lock on it, although the room did. This too felt unsafe. The unit was clean, nice, and convenient to the Maverick T stop."

Unique interior decoration with original artwork pieces,yet conveniently furnished to be a comfortable home. Being there for work,I regret I did not enjoy more the outside private deck than just picking the cherry tomatoes and herbs!,,,
Beverly is very caring and did her best to warmly welcome me. She surely made me feel at home and was very responsive whenever I had issues,"it was even like having my mother living right upstairs.\"",,,,

The apartment is tastefully decorated with eclectic fine art and antiques.  The two floors added lots of individual space; a washer/dryer helped over a long stay.   Furnishings and bedding are quite comfortable and the apartment is inviting. The kitchen is modern and very well equipped; the dining area is spacious.  Beverly was so kind as to ask us what she could bring in for us for our first day breakfast which was a very nice touch.  Even though the brownstone was built in the 1800's, there were no problems the entire month of our stay.  Beverly contacted us to check to see how things were going after a few days and made us feel very comfortable.  I highly recommend this property.  The location is one of the best in the South End and a short walk to just about everything is Boston.  We would certainly return again."

May want to bring a set of earplugs if you're a light sleeper since this apartment is at an intersection that converts from a one way to two way and there's lots of late night honking!  Place was great though.  Highly recommended!!"
10427882,63011401,2016-02-19,27917544,Manuel,Great place to stay in Boston. Very warm place and the staff was really accommodating with early check in and providing information. Everything was really clean. Just how I would keep my place.
10427882,64963735,2016-03-09,17397117,Etienne,"A very well organized arrival. It was easy to find and enter the place. Thank-you for authorizing early arrival. Nice and clean apartment, well furnished and decorated. Convenient. Location is excellent."
"A nice deal.\"",,,,,
10427882,77960914,2016-06-04,110680,Christine,"The host appears to be a rental/leasing company. They were timely and professional and included all of the information I needed to find the location and enter the building/room.  It was very nice not to have to worry about meeting up with someone and I could travel at my own schedule. The location was very safe and quiet for a main street in Boston. Ammenities were excellent and it was a nice touch to find oatmeal, coffee and juices in the kitchen. The apartment was very clean,comfortable and well kept. As a single female traveler I felt very safe in the apartment. The ability to use a roof deck in this location was an exceptional highlight of the experience."
10427882,80329474,2016-06-17,64751564,Danielle,"We had a fantastic stay at the Boston Christopher. Great location in the charming Back Bay/South End neighborhood and conveniently down the street from several T stops, a great Italian restaurant, Giacamo's, a corner store, and a wine shop at the bottom of the stairs."
The unit was exactly as advertised (it even felt roomier than the photos implied - plenty a room for two adults for one week) and well equipped. We were confused about the thermostat. It was situated high on the wall and when we called to inquire they informed us that the temperature is set remotely,but we continued to struggle with regulating the  temperature throughout our stay. This was more than made up for by the lovely rooftop patio,complete with 360-degree views of the city. The perfect place to take your morning coffee!,,,
Inn Boston Reservations provided excellent customer service before and during our stay,including accommodating an early check-in and late checkout (plus holding our luggage). They were quick to respond on the Airbnb site,even though we were booking more in 30 days in advance of our trip,"which could not be accommodated by others on Airbnb. We hope to be able to stay at another one of their properties in the future. \"",,
10427882,82715147,2016-06-29,23203875,Jimmy,"Great location for a short stay in Boston, very accessible to public transport, cafes, bars, etc. Rooftop deck access also a huge plus and fantastic views of the skyline which we really enjoyed. Overall very nice place and would recommend to anyone coming through Boston for holiday and sight seeing."

She was a great host,good conversation for the time we overlapped,lovely home,I'd definitely stay there again,,

1668313,11243074,2014-03-26,11926969,Teresa,Staying with Rebecca was terrific. She was so warm and welcoming and made my stay there a truly home experience. She went way beyond anything I would have expected from a host and I am grateful for her help in getting around and dealing with local conditions. Roslindale is a lovely town with lots of very accessible places to visit. I was able to walk to many places and the public transport was very easy to use. A huge thank you to Rebecca for making my visit so enjoyable.

"rebecca  always makes you feel being in your own house\"",,,,,
1668313,14020695,2014-06-10,13690985,Ilya,"Very welcoming home , with a neat hostess and two sociable cats. Quiet, beautiful area , shops and hairdresser/barber in walking distance. Be ready to separate garbage collection (compost, recycling), the hostess will tell you what to do. She speaks English and Portuguese, and is patient with a low level of knowledge of English. If necessary, she can help you navigate the area and Boston. She will give you a card to use the bus and subway - you only need to put money on it - and it makes travel more convenient and cheaper. The kitchen has everything you need for cooking, and a dishwasher. She provides towels, so you do not need to bring your own. The hostess prepares a healthy and tasty porridge (hot cereal) most (cool) mornings. There is a washing machine and dryer. In other words, there is everything you need for your stay."
"\"",,,,,
1668313,16030594,2014-07-20,16925779,Todd,"My stay with Rebecca was a peaceful, convenient and effortless experience."
She had a calming presence and a sincere curiosity whenever we chatted.  It was comforting to see her take pride caring for her gardens.  Whole Foods may have bigger raspberries,but they can't compete with Rebecca's more flavorful and handpicked raspberries.  She coordinated bathroom schedules with the other guests so there was never a conflict for showers and getting out of the house on time.  The neighborhood was quiet and literally a 3 minute walk to catch the bus to the Forest Hills T station.  l also took advantage of several early morning runs through the Arnold Arboretum,which has scenic rolling hills and a slalom of dogs to get your canine fix.,,,
"\"",,,,,
1668313,16380611,2014-07-26,17289392,Hugo,"Rebecca was helpful, attentive but not invasive; she has experience hosting and everything ran smoothly."

Also,the house is clean and the kitchen,even if it's not too big,has all that you may need to cook.,,
Summing up,"a very good house where to stay and a great host.\"",,,,
1668313,20320059,2014-09-27,20378662,Abe,"Rebecca's home was warm, inviting and very charming.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there and plan on staying there when I am back in town."
1668313,21099839,2014-10-11,21894719,Jorkill,"Rebecca and Owen were very warm and welcoming. Rebecca makes sure that you feel comfortable and safe in her home. The room was clean, quiet,  and comfortable. Safe and quiet neighborhood.  The only bad thing was that the bathroom is not private it is shared with other room occupants on the floor, luckily Rebecca keeps it extremely clean."
1668313,21258303,2014-10-13,7103770,Akriti,Rebecca was a very warm host and made me feel very welcome. The moment I reached her place I felt happy to be there.
So,yes,this is an excellent choice for travellers who are looking for a comfortable and quiet place to stay.,,,
The only thing to keep in mind,though,is that if you have a very short time in Boston,the 30 - 40 minutes on train and bus to get here might pinch you a little. If you have a longish stay in Boston then,it might be just what you need.,
The room,I had the single on on the 2nd floor,is nice - the blankets and sheets are so comfortable you won't want to get up in the morning. The bath is shared. This might feel a bit awkward (it did for me) but you tend to adjust to it. Neither the rooms nor the bath have locks or latches.,,,
All in all,it is a nice place to put up,"and Rebecca is a very warm and welcoming host and very nice to talk to. \"",,,
1668313,24046803,2014-12-18,9123829,Christian,"Rebecca is an incredibly nice and welcoming host, I can absolutely recommend staying at her house. I had a really great time being her guest for two months and would stay there again once I get back to Boston any time."
1668313,44756864,2015-08-29,31876954,Connor,From the moment I arrived to the day that I left I never felt more welcome in a home. Rebecca makes sure that you are completely accommodated for and will always be willing to lend an ear if you need it. To sum up my experience as amazing would be an understatement. I can't wait to visit again!
1668313,49630411,2015-10-05,41638378,Chris (Girish),Rebecca was helpful and did her best to make my stay comfortable.
The room is cosy and in the corner,away from the main road. The neighbors are not noisy. Buses run quite frequently and having a good bus mobile app helps to plan out.,,,,
Food was a bit of a challenge for me as I prefer healthier options.,,,,,
But overall,"I don't have any complaints and this place is ideal for short stays. \"",,,,

The room is comfortable, clean, and quiet.   The shared bathroom was also very clean.  Rebecca was very conscientious of my schedule and ensured that I had access to the shower at the times that I needed it.  I was very pleased by the neighborhood as well - I felt very safe walking around, and shops and restaurants were just a quick walk away.  Parking out front of the house was also very convenient.  I would recommend Rebecca as a host to anyone!"

A short walk to the center of town, she lives on a quiet street with a luscious backyard and garden. Easy access to buses, T and commuter rail. She accommodated all my needs and it was truly a pleasure to share this space!"

It is centrally located, and was safe for walking back at night. Sachin was very helpful both leading up to and during my stay. Even while traveling, he made sure to check-in to see if I needed anything. He also recommended some lovely tourist sites. I would certainly recommend Sachin as an AirBnb host."

3458030,30381957,2015-04-21,26113294,Stacey,My husband and I and two friends stayed with Sachin for the Boston marathon this past weekend.  He was an INCREDIBLE HOST!  From the very beginning he was super responsive and flexible as to when we needed to come in and leave.  The location was perfect for our purposes and set back off the main road so that noise was never an issue.  The apartment was honestly even better than expected (larger!) and the four of us fit perfectly.  It was so nice to have a place that kept us away from the crowds of the weekend whenever we wanted but close enough that we could walk right out of the door for whatever we needed.  I highly recommend Sachin as an AirBnB host - you won't regret it!!!

It was a pleasure to live in the beautiful well-kept space. The apartment is large enough to fit a number of people and is more than comfortable. Every room was clean and lovingly decorated.,,,,,
The location is superb for anyone visiting the Hynes conference center as it just at the back entrance and a mere 3 minutes away. The safe and clean neighborhood and the extra set of keys provided by Sachin made the stay very relaxed and enjoyable.,,,,,

They were very warm, friendly, helpful...asking what kinds of food we liked and suggesting restaurants (and they had fabulous suggestions!), offering coffee in the morning, offering advice on places to visit and transportation options, and much more!   We could not possibly have asked for friendlier and more welcoming hosts and we thoroughly enjoyed not only the accommodations but talking with them about many different subjects.  I had asked if they had a fan, because I sleep better with one, and that was waiting in the room when we arrived.  The apartment is welcoming and homey, and we felt welcome to sit in the living room and not just stay in our room.  And, the rooftop deck is AMAZING!!!   We will be telling anyone we know who is traveling to Boston to stay with them, and if my daughter needs to go back to Boston on her own I would feel very comfortable and secure with her staying there with them on her own.  Also, the neighborhood is a mix of older, beautiful buildings and what appear to be newer buildings made to look just like the old ones, along with some shops that seem more on the \"\"upscale\"\" side.  There is also a CVS conveniently located nearby"

It is an awesome apartment with a beautiful view on the Hancock and Prudential Buildings. 3-minute walk to Back Bay T station and 6-minute walk to Copley Square and Trinity Church. Location is more than wonderful for people who want to have access to downtown,Back Bay and all other fancy places. And don't forget about the roof deck!,,,,

Their dog Pickles is also very cute.  It was very warm and humid, so we greatly appreciated the ac in the small bedroom where we slept.  One thing missing was a hairdryer--there may have been one, but I neglected to ask before we went to bed."

Their dog is so sweet and cute, and was no trouble at all during our stay, I loved meeting her too. The apartment is centrally located, a short walk from Copley Square and the green line, and even closer to the orange line.

She gave us a key to come in and out of the unit and was helpful whenever we needed tips on places to go or things to do. They both were extremely friendly to talk with and their puppy pickles was absolutely adorable! The building could not have been more central to all the major places to go in Boston and the rooftop was out of this world! Overall, we made a great choice staying with them and would do it again if back in the city."
5734770,40313908,2015-07-30,3587521,Ted,"Everything about this stay was easy and comfortable. The place is in a nice neighborhood close to the T, it's very quiet and clean, the air conditioner kept the room cool even on a warm night, and Ashley was friendly and considerate. But what makes this place really stand out is the rooftop. It's spectacular."

Amazing roof deck! The room size was perfect for my needs. Wifi speed was good. They're dog Pickle was also a nice welcome when walking in (very friendly!).,,,,,

5734770,42542862,2015-08-14,36750825,Ryan,Very good experience. Easy to organize with Ashley. Finding the place was easy and its in an excellent location. We had to pay $30 for parking b/c we had a rental car. Best not to have a car. Public transportation is very close walking distance.
Everything was clean and Dennis and pickle were gracious hosts when we arrived in the afternoon. The sun deck is first class and cool spot to soak in Boston.,,,,,

Ashley and Dennis are the best hosts we could ever ask for: not only they are nice and fun to be with, they also went out of their way to make our stay perfect and to make this such a fun experience for us. The place was very clean, comfortable and the rooftop was amazing. They both answered ALL of our questions and recommended us great places to go to. The appartment's location was very convient  in just a few minutes walk from the T lines and surrounded by endless great restaurants and bars. And one last thing- Pickle is just the sweetest dog and was great to have her around. Definitely the best place to stay in Boston!"

5734770,52851610,2015-11-02,2831021,Emily,"I was disappointed that the dog wasn't there as I was looking for puppy love : )  But otherwise it was a lovely room/apartment and great location. Hosts were very accommodating. But for this old gal, the 4 floor walkup wasn't fun with a suitcase. Good exercise though."
5734770,53922885,2015-11-14,19415630,Kristine,"Ashley and Dennis are the best Airbnb hosts we've had thus far! They are really welcoming, and their spot is located in a very hip and accessible area. Walking distance from most of the tourist attractions (like Duck Tour, Prudential Center). They also have a really awesome deck that has a beautiful view of the city. They were very knowledgeable of fun spots for young professionals, like us. :) And their adorable baby puppy, Pickle, was the icing on the cake!"

5734770,58970489,2016-01-05,19412243,Frank,We had an awesome time staying with Ashley and Dennis during New Years 2015/16. They have a lovely place with the best location imaginable: you can reach all the interesting places within minutes and you will find a variety of amazing bars and restaurants close by.
Ashley and Dennis are really nice. They gave us a lot of tips what to explore in the city and we enjoyed celebrating NYE with them and their friends. Ashley,Dennis and especially Pickle,"thank you sooo much for making our Trip to Boston so awesome!\"",,,

Their home is quite comfortable and although it was too cold to enjoy the roof deck we did poke our heads out to check out the view - very nice! Ashley and Dennis provided great restaurant recommendations, the location of their home is perfect for walking just about anywhere in Boston and the T is right there for further destinations. Highly recommend staying at Ashley and Dennis' place!"
5734770,64699194,2016-03-06,6986452,Gurshant,"My stay at Dennis and Ashley's was quite brief - I stayed for two nights. I enjoyed staying at their place for the most part. They are very friendly people whom you can totally hang out with during your stay. They have a clean apartment with a great location in the heart of the city. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable, though it does get a little loud due to noise coming from Columbus Ave. The bathroom was clean as well, and they provided me with towels and basic toiletries. I will mention that this probably wasn't the best weekend to stay at their place because they had friends over and it did get a bit loud at times. They have a cute dog, who stays quiet for the most part. I'd recommend Ashley and Dennis's place as long as you're not a light sleeper and can tolerate a bit of noise."

The best part of the apartment,aside from the natural light that flows through all of the rooms,is its location,"proximate to all of the great places to see and things to do in Boston. I would definitely like to stay there again.\"",,
5734770,71241783,2016-04-24,48990095,David,Ashley and Dennis have an amazing home and were so welcoming for my stay there with my friend when we were attending PAX East.It was an easy walk from the downtown and surrounding areas from their home and they also helped me find a parking garage so I could park my car for the weekend. They were great at communicating with me and went above and beyond to make sure my friend and I were comfortable and felt at home. Their dog Pickle was awesome as well and has to be the cutest home companion. I highly recommend them and I would definitely visit again!
5734770,72858191,2016-05-05,35303607,Loes,It was very nice to stay in the rooftop apartment with Dennis and Ashley. At the start I felt a little uneasy because I did not know if and with whom I was sharing the apartment. But after 2 nights I started to understand and felt welcome and free to come and go. The room  and bathroom were comfortable and it was nice to be able to make a cup of tea (and probably more but I did not try) in their kitchen. I would certainly come back if I was to come for another visit to Boston.

As soon as I entered, they made me feel right at home. The listing description was accurate and the apartment looks just like the pictures in the listing. This was my first time flying to Boston and my first time using AirBnB and it was amazing, thanks to Ashley and Dennis. It was nice to walk into a completely new experience and feel welcomed. The neighborhood was quiet and easy to navigate. I had to attend a wedding at the Boston Public Library and the apartment was literally, down the street! Everything else; bars, restaurants, train and CVS were in close proximity."
5734770,80748978,2016-06-19,32008538,Kennie,Ashley is very accommodating to our needs and kept the place clean. She and her neighbors are very friendly and it was great hanging out on the rooftop deck. The location is awesome! I loved being able to work to many restaurants and shops.

They have a rooftop deck with spectacular views of the city. They're typically up there hanging out in the evenings, and we spent some time with them there. We had a good time with them. The room is comfortable, and thought of some nice details such as including a power strip with USB ports for charging devices. They also provide guests with shampoo and conditioner. The space and the bathrooms are clean. We were about halfway through a two week trip, and they gave us access to their washer and dryer which was a huge help to us. They also provided us with perfect suggestions about where to eat. Their dog Pickle is really sweet and we enjoyed seeing her around the apartment. My suggestion is that if you stay with Ashley and Dennis get to know them a bit. They're really sweet people."

5734770,97139732,2016-08-26,29397385,Rebecca,Great Location!
The room itself was a little disappointing,and as avid travelers we were hoping for a bit more interaction with the owners.,,,,
The accommodation was like a slight upgrade from student accommodation in the UK,for the price we expected more.,,,,
Although we were told feel free to use the communal space it felt like we felt like we couldn't,and it was pretty awkward being in the house. that meant we spent all day out and only slept there and used the bathroom.,,,,
Sorry guys,it was a bit of a let down,"but the location was great and we loved Boston.\"",,,
5734770,98768919,2016-09-01,87313895,Jessica,We had an amazing stay with Ashley and Dennis and their adorable puppy.
To start,the location was perfect. We took a shuttle straight to the neighborhood and easily found the apartment. It was also a quick walk to awesome restaurants,the T,and (our favorite) Public Garden.,,
The apartment was clean,cozy,and beautiful. The best part was probably the amazing rooftop deck,with a great view.,,
Ashley and Dennis were so friendly and warm. It felt like staying with close friends; they made everything super comfortable.,,,,,
Dennis even offered to drive us out to the Cape if our ride was delayed - which was way too generous,but a greatly appreciated offer anyway.,,,,

Il est dans la Petite Italie,donc près de plusieurs bons restaurants et cafés et on peut suivre la Freedom Trail dès qu'on sort à l'extérieur.,,,,

6089865,32838405,2015-05-22,1676927,Roy,"This is a spectacular flat, in a fantastic location, and I'd come back without hesitation.  It's clearly a well-managed location, and it appears that the entire set of units are dedicated to airbnb, but they're appointed with that use in mind.  The furnishings are luxurious and comfortable.  Everything was in good condition.  There were spare toiletries and cookware--things you'd expect from a more personal airbnb experience.  This was a perfect balance between the reliability of experience offered by the nicest hotel, with the location and character of a great airbnb.  I really enjoyed it."
6089865,33128246,2015-05-25,29794343,Stephen,The listing was accurate - and it was even better than what we had read. We loved the character that the apartment had (the brick walls within the apartment) and how extremely close it is to the freedom trail and the best Italian food I have had.
Jose/Jason were very timely in answering any questions we had. I texted them late Saturday evening with a questions thinking I probably would not get a response until the morning,but they replied back quickly and were willing to help.,,,,

6089865,34133867,2015-06-05,29863954,Susan,"I had a 10 night stay at Unit #2.  A great location and all the amenities one needed, in fact more than I expected and was pleasantly surprised.  About a 8 minute walk to Haymarket T so was easy to get around.  All the food options in the area made this is an even better location.  Jose was very proactive with giving me directions and all necessary information like wifi password, and although I'd forgotten he responded back to me quickly."
6089865,34224642,2015-06-06,25073212,Marisa,"Jose's place was awesome! The apartment was larger than expected, was clean and updated, and was in a excellent location. We also really liked that Jose gave us the option to purchase parking in a secure garage just a short walk away. Jose made the booking process extremely simple, and we would definitely stay at his apartment again."
6089865,34862768,2015-06-13,26914312,Becca,I have stayed in a few apartments through Airbnb and this was by far the best.  The location was amazing and the apartment was very well equipped.  It was fantastic to stay in the North End and experience the neighborhood and all the delicious food available.  The apartment itself was spacious and comfortable.  I look forward to coming back to Boston and staying here again!
6089865,35219248,2015-06-16,5763270,Erica,"I wish I had the experience that other reviewers had, but I didn't.  Due to flight delays I got to the apt around 1am and all I wanted to do was go to bed.  Pulled back the covers on the bed to find that they clearly hadn't been changed since the last guest was there, and that they had really enjoyed themselves.  I called Jose and left a voicemail and he called me right back.  There were not extra clean sheets in the apt, so he came by at 1:30am with new sheets that he had just purchased.  I mentioned to him then that the place was pretty dirty, and he said that he would talk to his cleaning people about it, but did not offer to come and do a touch up.  I was so tired that I didn't press the issue.  The next morning I started to see the extent of how dirty the apartment was.  Weird stains on the comforter, the kitchen table had food and crumbs left on it, kitchen had not been cleaned, and dirty utensils had been put with the clean ones (food and hair caked on to them).  I'm not a germaphobe, but I was grossed out.  I did not contact Jose about these issues because I felt so dismissed the first time I brought it up the night before, and because we spent very little time in the apartment."
The location was amazing,"and I loved being in the North End and all that the area has to offer.\"",,,,
6089865,35340255,2015-06-17,35166544,Geoffrey,Communication from Jose was excellent. The apartment was great and in a really good location. Jose worked with our schedule to make things easier on us. We are very happy with out decision to stay here.
6089865,36013640,2015-06-24,20173489,Caroline,We loved our stay at Jose/Jason's place! Nice apartment with everything we needed! The location was amazing and we loved the north end.
6089865,36391791,2015-06-28,24126792,Shannon,The description was very accurate and location was amazing. Very convenient and close to all the action. Right in the heart of little Italy and on the American Freedom Trail.
6089865,37465491,2015-07-07,32701074,Yvette,This apartment was just as described. The best part was the location. This apartment is in a very good location and within walking distance to many sites. Also within distance to the T. This was our home away from home and it made our trip to Boston stress free and memorable.
6089865,37741790,2015-07-10,11796397,Phil,"We had a great time in Boston helped by the location and facilities at Jason's apartment. Everything we needed was there - comfy bed, good shower/bathroom, air-con, 2 TVs, quiet at night, easy to walk into Boston etc. The kitchen is very small but we only used the fridge, kettle and toaster. Jason responded to my questions about keys and access quickly and clearly. We'd definitely stay again and have no reservations about recommending the apartment."
6089865,38601068,2015-07-17,33504609,Jeffrey,"Everything was as described in the listing.  We stayed for a week and had access to everything we needed: wifi, bed, shower, frig.  Everything was inside was modern despite being in the historic north end.  It made us really feel at home!"
6089865,39005433,2015-07-20,25410259,Tim,"My stay in this airbnb was fantastic! The flat was comfy, well appointed & centrally located. Jason was very quick to handle the 1 request I had. I would love to stay there again!"
6089865,39499811,2015-07-24,28572339,Rebecca,"We had a wonderful time during the 4 days we spent in the flat. It was clean, quiet, and was close in proximity to everything we needed. Great food and bars near by, safe neighborhood. Really enjoyed our stay for our first airbnb experience! Highly recommend."
6089865,39753529,2015-07-26,16397749,April,"We loved our time in Boston at North End #2! The location was perfect for exploring the city. The place was cute (loved the exposed brick), the bed was VERY comfortable, and our arrival process was smooth. A window A/C unit in the bedroom made for comfy night temps in July. Thank you, Jose & Jason!!"
6089865,39973811,2015-07-27,11447051,Theresa,"Beautiful apartment in an excellent location right next to Old North Church, all the charm and restaurants of the North End. Some noise from people walking around on floor above but nothing terrible. Otherwise very private. Didn't get to meet Jose but called him when we had trouble getting the door open and he answered right away. Otherwise, we were just able to do our own thing and enjoy a nice weekend! Comfortable bed, very nice bathroom and small kitchen would make this a great place to stay for a longer vacation."
6089865,40346113,2015-07-30,36656990,Denise,"The flat was very nice, clean, and the location was perfect.  A minute from the Freedom Trail and Italian food.  Jose was very responsive and accommodated my request for extra linens."
6089865,40588540,2015-08-01,16998409,Tracey,"Jose is a terrific host; this is my second stay with him, and hope to again in the future."
6089865,41213653,2015-08-05,34586816,Beverly,"This was a great experience for my husband and me. Before we arrived and during our stay, Jose was always available for any questions that we had. The apartment is large and nicely furnished. The location is the best in Boston, walking distance from what we think are the best restaurants in Boston.  The North End is very safe to walk the streets at any time and this apartment is also close to public transportation and many historic sites."
6089865,43040733,2015-08-17,19900271,Louis,Very convenient location. A lot of restaurants in the vicinity. Only 15 minutes walk to the train station.
6089865,43387994,2015-08-19,20705968,Alex,Jason was a great host. Beautiful apartment only steps away from the freedom trail. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed.
6089865,44524472,2015-08-27,33808613,Kerr,"We had a great experience. The apartment is perfectly situated. A short walk to the busy north end streets, bakerys, bars, restaurants and metro line, but is in a quite section of the north end. It is perfectly sized and set up for a couples short break. We loved it."
6089865,44803039,2015-08-29,4734645,Daniela,"Perfect Location in Boston. Little Italie area just around the corner with a lot of very nice Restaurants. app. 10 Min walk to the T. to discover boston. We had little problems to find the Entrance it`s in a tight small street between houses. We called Jason and he helped us to find everything :-) We also booked a parking space just around the corner. This was perfekt! The Apartment was nice, clean, cozy. Fresh Towels were prepared for us. It has a small kitchen which we didn`t use it. Thanks a lot Jason. And we really fell in love with Boston!"
6089865,44948311,2015-08-30,7764765,Rachael,"This apartment and the host were more than we hoped for! The host went well above and beyond, even helping when we had a change in our plans and so thoughtful, very quick responses and easy to contact. The apartment was the cutest and very clean, even better than the pictures. So conveniently located also, showing off great architecture all around! Thanks again so very much!"
6089865,45168288,2015-08-31,9285386,Dion,It was a lovely apartment at an awesome location. It was spacious and the bedding was amazing!
6089865,45471517,2015-09-03,17468463,Joelle,"Die Wohnung war grosszügig, mit sehr grosser Dusche, gut eingerichtet. Wir haben Jason nicht gesehen aber detaillierte Informationen für den Zugang in die Wohnung erhahlten so dass dies jederzeit problemlos war. Die Wohnung liegt im Northend vierteil so dass wir vieles zu Fuss besichtigen konnten. Ganz nahe viele leckere italiener oder auch die berühmte Mikes Pastry."
"Einziger Nachteil: Durch die Lage in einer Sachgasse und die vielen A/C's in der Gasse war es uns leider Nachts etwas zu laut.\"",,,,,
6089865,45862978,2015-09-06,42391178,Patrick,Great location and very comfortable apartment. Jose was very professional throughout the process and made it easy for my first time using airbnb.
6089865,46306805,2015-09-09,7765032,Dana,"Great spot in the shadow of Old North Church. It's down the street from my favorite bakery and in the midst of Boston's famed Italian restaurants. The space has North End character, with red brick accents inside. Spacious bathroom. Clean. Big TVs. Jose was quick to respond & answer questions. I'd definitely stay here again."
6089865,46737545,2015-09-13,4014250,Kayla,"This listing was wonderful. I believe we loved our time in Boston so much more based mainly on this listing's location. Being right off the Freedom Trail and in the heart of Little Italy made us feel we got a real Boston experience. Everything was within walking distance - the water, Boston Commons, and metro. We enjoyed getting breakfast from Caffe Lil Italy on the corner. The actual apartment was very comfortable and clean, perfect for a short or extended stay. Jason/Jose made us feel very welcome. Jose responded promptly when we had any questions. The only downside was we were not able to use the covered parking that was listed with the apartment the entire length of our stay because he said it was needed back. This was stressful to figure out half way through the trip. Besides that, the location was wonderful."
6089865,47244628,2015-09-17,32869947,Kimberly,"Great and easy experience! Was able to do an early check in at noon, which was very helpful. The apartment is a central location—cute area of the North End—easy walk to the metro and literally on the Freedom Trail. The apartment itself was much bigger than I had anticipated! Worked very well for 2 people. It was clean, had a big TV, a window unit for A/C that worked well, and there were even fresh towels and body wash available. Be aware the apartment is on the 2nd floor so there are some stairs to climb with your luggage, but not many and wasn't a big deal for us at all."
6089865,47362830,2015-09-18,20452037,Mike,Great place in the best part of the North End! We were welcomed with fresh towels on the bed and everything was clean!
"Highly reccomend! \"",,,,,
6089865,48062369,2015-09-23,29065547,Darren,I highly recommend this apartment.  Not only was the location amazing but the apartment itself was absolutely incredible. The apartment was incredibly convenient to anywhere in Boston.  The bed was one of the most comfy beds we have ever slept on.  Jose was very quick to respond to any and all questions I had about the location.  My wife and I intend to come back to Boston and will definitely stay with Jose again.
"Two thumbs up!\"",,,,,
6089865,48190233,2015-09-24,12768543,Grace,Great central location in a great bit of Boston. Clean and tidy. Did not get to meet the host in person but easy to reach over email/phone.
6089865,48500673,2015-09-27,34107380,Tom,"Fantastic location right on the Freedom Trail in the heart of the North End: could not be better if you in Boston for tourism. The flat had all the amenities you would expect, a large and very comfortable bed, good size bathroom and was spotless."
"The only slight downside is that noise carries in the apartment building so light sleepers might be bothered by noisy neighbours. But this is a slight niggle and I would recommend this option if you are coming to Boston. \"",,,,,
6089865,48692856,2015-09-28,1761827,Vijay,"Well located, clean apartment in the heart of the North End of Boston. I never actually met Jason and Jose, but they were very responsive and provided clear instructions."
6089865,50614094,2015-10-13,23457023,Gene,Perfect Location!!!   Literally across the street from the Old North Church.  Really fast and great communication with the owners!!!  I would stay here again in a second!
6089865,51527165,2015-10-21,29769307,Kay,A  nice apartment in a great part of town giving us great access to the city.  We enjoyed our stay.
6089865,52481617,2015-10-30,204856,Victor,"Jose was an excellent host. He troubleshooted and corrected a TV issue swiftly. He was available by texting and responded quickly.  The apartment is lovely. Very spacious for one, could accommodate two people easily.  Location was excellent. Walkable to all major sites. Quiet, peaceful neighborhood next to Old North Church. Great restaurants within minutes. Would stay again  in a heartbeat."
6089865,53042369,2015-11-04,5672626,Chris,Jose / Jason was the perfect host - always available and quick to respond. The apartment clean and efficient and the location is perfect - within easy walking distance of historic sites and great restaurants. Our stay was exactly what we expected and more. We know where we're staying on our next trip to Boston! Thanks Jose!
6089865,53201296,2015-11-06,42045873,Scott,"I was quite pleased with my first Airbnb experience. Everything was as shown in the listing (except no ironing board). The bed was super comfortable and I slept better than I do at home. Love the location. The North End is a great area to stay in and this particular building is set back from the road, down an alley, so it is very quiet. Would be a great place for one or two people and I would stay there again."
6089865,53459431,2015-11-09,36447918,Rosemary,"\"When we walked in there were towels laid out for us, and also there was a \"\"welcome to Boston\"\" note with some magazines."
The neighborhood is PERFECT. Many options for food and drinks and if you are ok to do some distance walking,"you can really walk all over the city from this apartment. Excellent option for a city weekend getaway!\"",,,,
6089865,53815919,2015-11-13,43206291,Linda,"Fabulous stay at Jason's and Jose's  apartment. It was everything the reviews described...great location on the Freedom Trail,  safe neighborhood, great restaurants, cozy apartment which was very clean with great amenities, including cleaning supplies, well equipped kitchen, beautiful modern shower, and wifi. Have already been recommending their place to our friends and family."
6089865,54106197,2015-11-16,43888968,Amy,We had a great time ! Our main reason to come to Boston was to watch the Bruins play and we were in perfect walking distance to stadium.  The location was great ! Right around the corner from stores and restaurants galore ! Everything you would need.  The apartment was great ! So much better than worrying with hotels and other guests.   We hope we get to come back again soon !
6089865,54449238,2015-11-20,47271719,Suehee,"The apartment was incredible! Fresh towels were available to us and the bed was incredibly comfortable with lots of outlets all around. The stairs are a bit narrow, so keep that in mind if you have bulky cargo."
6089865,55359356,2015-12-01,4356839,Michelle,"Apartment was wonderful! Newly renovated and clean as well as cozy. The location was superb, in the center of the North End and close to TD garden. Everything was ready for us upon arrival and Jose was quick to respond to texts when necessary."
Only issue was that Jose promised cheaper parking upon reservation and refused to pay for the difference when he no longer reserved a spot (about $12 more expensive to park per day).,,,,,
Overall,"a wonderful stay in a great city.\"",,,,
6089865,55745141,2015-12-05,20810444,Becci,"Lovely flat and great location! We loved the North End - so many fantastic restaurants. Right on the Freedom Trail so great for exploring and easy walking distance to downtown, other sights etc. We didn't actually meet Jose but he was very helpful (let us leave our bags in the apartment for an extra couple of hours after checkout) and always responded very quickly. Would definitely recommend staying here and would go back again."
6089865,55848413,2015-12-06,49888467,Geneviève,Moment mémorable les 4-5 décembre 2015.
Escapade à Boston pour l'anniversaire d'un ami.,,,,,
Facilement rejoignable,Jose nous a accommodé lors de notre arrivé. Je n'avais pas encore foulée le bitume de cette petite ruelle que j'étais séduite. L'appartement était tel qu'espéré et le quartier South End tout à fait charmant sans parler des expressos...,,,,
Les bostonnais,contrairement à ce que j'avais entendu était facile d'approche et ouvert à l'autre. On s'y sens bien,tans près de l'eau,à qq pas de l'appartement ou plus en direction sud-ouest. Aussi bien,le trajet que les destinations nous on fait vivre des petits (URL HIDDEN) vie quoi!,

6089865,56385673,2015-12-13,47659770,Becky,"The description was very accurate in the listing.   The location was perfect (within walking distance to everywhere) and the flat was clean and comfortable.   I made a request which was addressed immediately.  This is an area that does not have many hotels, I highly recommend this Airbnb as the best place to stay in the north end of Boston."
6089865,58302245,2016-01-02,14514694,Joe,"Jose was extremely helpful prior to the trip.  He answered questions about the flat, and even some before we booked.  He also offered us recommendations regarding parking and offered to help in any way he could."
My wife and I use Airbnb frequently for travel,and this was one of the best reservations we've stayed in.  If you enjoy history at your doorstep,great restaurants,and easy access to the major attractions in the city,then you will enjoy staying here.  The freedom trail is literally on the sidewalk outside the door,and there are endless options for good places to eat within the surrounding area.
The accommodations in the apartment were great too.  It was clean,comfortable,and offered additional amenities like the kitchen that you would not have in a hotel.,,,
We had an awesome time during our stay in Boston and I would highly recommend staying in this flat.,,,,,

6089865,59575068,2016-01-12,31607576,Nancy,"This is a really fun neighborhood, with lots of coffee and pastry shops, and pizza galore. It was lovely to be so close to Old North Church as well."
Apartment was very clean,"wi-fi easy to connect to and instructions on access were good. Definitely recommend. \"",,,,
6089865,60671592,2016-01-25,41867804,Amari,First time using Airbnb & it was honestly so easy. Jose's place was so nice & we'll set up. We had a great time & would most definitely book with him again!
6089865,61948647,2016-02-09,4374539,B,Jose was very responsive and detailed in his communication before we arrived. The flat was cozy and in a great location - it was so nice to be able to come back there after a day out and about. We found everything very manageable and felt very comfortable in our borrowed digs.
6089865,62245454,2016-02-13,4044446,Rachel,"\"Excellent location just steps from Old North Church and the heart of Boston's North End (Little Italy) which is full of character and delicious food. The apartment was charming, very clean and the bed was comfortable. The host gave good directions. About a 10 min walk to the \"\"t\"\" sub away system which easily gets you all around Boston. My one complaint is that the heating system bangs a lot and will wake up a light sleeper. I would stay here again and would recommend it to others.\""
6089865,62652922,2016-02-15,3734877,Mia,Great apartment. Very clean and the apartment was warm when we arrived. Close proximity to good food and the orange line. Jose was prompt to response and left clear instructions. We enjoyed our stay.
6089865,63103930,2016-02-20,41102923,Kim,"Jason was wonderful, I had a issue with the lock and he was available via phone.  The apartment was exactly as advertised, clean, comfortable and convenient to all everything."
6089865,63810756,2016-02-27,3804440,Cécile,"I didn't meet Jason, but we had a good communication by email."
The flat is nicely designed,with a very nice bedroom and a brand new bathroom.,,,,
It is a little obscure as it gives on a back yard but it was not too annoying as we were out during the day,wandering in the North End district,the very alive district of Boston,,,
It seems all the flats of the building are short rentals,which has the disadvantage of having noisy neighbors partying some days.,,,,
But overall,it was a good experience.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
6089865,64414035,2016-03-03,37839859,Andrew,I had a great stay and found the location in the North End to be fantastic. The room was quite quiet and it was a comfortable environment for sleeping.
Gaining entry was not a problem at all,"and access was very straightforward.\"",,,,
6089865,64674229,2016-03-06,58730190,Emily,"Great space. Exactly as pictured, beautiful apartment. Exposed brick walls, modern furniture, huge bathroom, and very clean. It is in a private alley off of a quiet street that is very easy to find, and it is steps from the freedom trail which is amazing! There are TONS of restaurants, coffee shops, and gelato shops around and the area is walking distance to almost everything. It's smack-dab in the historic area of town and very close to the water and aquarium. Jose was great with questions and communication. The only cons were the building is very old (yet extremely updated) so there wasn't insulation due to the brick walls, and we could hear our neighbors above and below pretty clearly but it didn't effect our sleep. Also, the lock on the door is automatic and very tricky so it took us multiple tries to open each time we got home. But these things are minor, and didn't effect our experience much. Thanks for a great stay!"
6089865,64733423,2016-03-06,10114847,Gillen,The coolest location. This place had it all for my girlfriend and I. We came to this city just for one night to see a concert. Lightning booked and done. Jose was accommodating and we had all of our needs met. We will definitely return here!
6089865,64913636,2016-03-09,30066342,Shannon,"The location can't be beat, and it's reasonably priced for its location. For the most part we were pleased with the place, however it was so noisy we wouldn't stay again. We could very clearly,  loudly,  and throughout the entire night hear full conversations from other apartments and people going up and down the hallway stairs. Also, the heater unit in the bedroom knocked and rattled non-stop."
We did have an issue with the door,and while we were able to sort it out ourselves,Jose was fairly quickly responsive and he also worked with us on storing our luggage before checking in,which was greatly appreciated.,,
Overall,"it's a shame about the noise because we did like the place.\"",,,,
6089865,64952966,2016-03-09,40427652,Melinda,"I LOVE THIS PLACE! The apartment was very clean, comfortable, and gorgeous. The location was perfect as I was going to TD Garden for a concert and could walk there easily. I would absolutely stay there anytime I am planning a trip to the area."
6089865,65072656,2016-03-10,29446267,Kegan,My girlfriend and I needed a place to crash for a night in Boston and Jose's place was perfect. It's near great places to eat and the bed and bathroom were great.
6089865,65753861,2016-03-16,32467318,James,Loved everything about the place honestly! Have no complaints other than lock box can be a little difficult to operate! Would gladly stay there on my next visit to Boston.
6089865,65956473,2016-03-18,56244615,Carolyn,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Jose and Jason's apartment in this historic area of Boston. The key was in a small lock box at the front door so there were no access issues. The rooms were clean and spacious and the bed was really comfortable.  The immediate area is full of Italian restaurants and cafes and there is a laundromat around the corner.  We walked into the main area of Boston each day and caught a train from the nearby station to head out to a tour of Harvard.  Boston is a wonderfully interesting city and this apartment is a great place to stay.
6089865,66192232,2016-03-20,18069701,Jennifer,"We had trouble finding the place, but only because (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps was very misleading. It told us to go to the wrong street corner. I called our host and he answered immediately and gave very thorough directions. The apartment was a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be. It was very quiet and cozy. The weather was so terrible outside but the temperature was perfect when we got home from a day of adventures. I would definitely recommend this location to anyone who hasn't been to Boston before. There is so many amazing restaurants, bars and sightseeing very close by."
6089865,66704103,2016-03-24,5249678,Francisco,"Our stay al Jose's place was great. The apartment is in the middle of the city, if you want to visit the historical part of the city, this is the place to stay."
The apartment was really nice,with everything we needed and all the comodities you can expect.,,,,
I'ts better than a hotel,so don't doubt it. If you go to boston,"this is the place to stay.\"",,,
6089865,67121057,2016-03-27,14321932,Vanessa,"We didn't get to actually meet Jose, but he was very responsive via email and accommodating at our request for early check-in and late check-out. The apartment is much bigger than the pictures make it look and is very nice.  The location is absolutely awesome.  You walk out of the alley and can go left to the cemetery or right to the Old North Church. There is a small gift shop and coffee shop right on the corners,  and Theo's Cafe is an absolute must.  We became regulars there.  It's a short walk to the TD Garden Center, to the downtown area, Mike's Pastry, the wharf, etc. It's really a great location (have I mentioned that already?)."
One suggestion if you have uber/lyft drivers pick you up from the apartment,set your pickup location as the Old North Church,the actual address of the apartment sends the driver to the opposite side of the block.,,,
"We would definitely stay here again!\"",,,,,
6089865,68668977,2016-04-06,36626161,Dan,We did not meet Jose but he was very accommodating allowing an early check-in and he quickly addressed and resolved a noise issue.  The location of the apartment is excellent.  It is directly across the street from the Old North Church.  Many excellent restaurants and bars within a 5 minute walk.  A small grocery store right around the corner on Salem.  Only a 10 minute walk to the TD Garden and a 15 minute walk to the Aquarium.  The apartment is nice with all the necessities needed.  However it is an old building with thin walls so you can hear your neighbors above you and the floors creak when you walk.  If you are a light sleeper you may have trouble getting to sleep and staying asleep due to the minor noise.  The bed is very comfortable and the heat works well so the apartment was very comfortable.  A great location to enjoy Boston.
6089865,69212006,2016-04-10,31431298,David,Fantastic apartment. Do yourself a favor and stay here!
Host was friendly and responsive. Very clear instructions on how to access the apartment.,,,,,
Location wise you're somehow right in the middle of things and off the beaten path. Steps away from the Freedom Trail and Old North Church and blocks from a bustling street with lots to do.,,,,,
The apartment itself was quite nice. Open floor plan with a private bath. Very clean and well maintained. I would recommend this location to anyone and would stay again on future trips to Boston.,,,,,

6089865,69345128,2016-04-10,65631756,Allison,"A great place to stay! You can't beat this location. I lived in Boston for 8 years, so I know my way around, but this would be a perfect location for someone new to the city. It's right in the middle of fantastic restaurants and a few minutes walk to trains and the waterfront. The apartment was clean and cozy and we had everything we needed."

We will be back again!! 5 stars!!!"

Upon arrival,there was an issue with the key,but our host came to the rescue. The noise travels within the building,but it's a small house so there are only a few neighbours.,,

6089865,71340826,2016-04-24,32195866,Emily,"The apartment was beautiful and we could not have had a more convenient location. Literally on the freedom trail, and across the street from a historic cemetery. The apartment was way more spacious than I had imagined. Lots of room to move around and perfect for the two of us. Shampoo was even provided in the shower. I asked Jose if we could check in early and he said of course, but there must have been some miscommunication because when we arrived, our room was still being cleaned. The woman was very friendly and finished right away, so there was really no inconvenience to us. At night, you could hear people in the alley way as the sound echos and we did wake up each night, however, the bed was so comfortable that it was easy to fall back to sleep. Overall we had a great experience, and if we ever decide to visit Boston again we know we have a great, clean, comfortable place to stay. Thank you Jose!"

Jose was very accommodating and the booking/check-in/staying/check-out experience couldn't have been easier. The kitchen needs a few updates, but you're in the North End, why are you cooking?! The worst thing about the apartment was that I had to leave at the end of my stay. Thank you, Jose!"

The apartment was neat and tidy,and had everything we needed for our stay. The building entrance is down a tiny private alleyway,and the building is kitty corner from the Old North Church. You can't get more historic than that! We wandered around the Freedom Trail during our stay and ate very well at the amazing Italian restaurants in the area,just a few blocks away.,,

Even the towels were folded like a fancy hotel.

Jose solved a couple of arrival issues quickly.  Apt. was exactly as described - great location - small but workable kitchen - terrific shower and super comfortable bed. I stayed one month so really got a sense for the apt., the building, and the neighborhood. Building was quiet even though in a busy and exciting neighborhood. It had easy access to transportation, the waterfront, and so many shops and restaurants. It was fun living right on the Freedom Trail. I would definitely recommend this apartment to others visiting Boston."

This location is AWESOME and the place is big and roomy and perfect for 2 people for a long weekend.  The bathroom is spacious and clean.  The bed was also very comfy.  I can't say enough about the neighborhood.  It was quiet on the street the unit is on but once you got a couple streets down, you were right in the liveliest part of the North End.  I fell in love with Little Italy!  There are so many people there since it has some of the best restaurants in the city.  Energy is great and the local dive restaurants and bars were fun.  I would recommend this place and location to anyone that wants an authentic visit in Boston surrounded by fresh pasta, cannolis galore, and amazing pizza.  We obviously enjoyed eating our way through the city.  Enjoy!"

I believe in honest reviews,and renting from Todd/LifeStyleFurnishings was easy and I would recommend it. They have multiple listings available of varying size/quality/location so I'd rather let this be a review of the unit itself...,,,,
This unit in Back Bay is what you would expect for both the price and location. It is an older building,and somewhat dated common areas but the unit itself was nicer.,,,,
It is obviously not that large of a place,however it was overall clean and comfortable and accommodating with all the fixings you would need. The views were fantastic at night overlooking the Charles and Cambridge on the other side and the balcony was very nice to have use of.,,,,
Our unit had/has a sky light in the bedroom that is covered with drop ceiling/tile (like in an office) and during a storm the changing air pressure caused them to flop around. As we had our 10 month old with us,this was concerning relative to the noise as it woke her up a few times. All other times it didn't really bother us or cause an issue.,,,,
Overall,we had a great stay and I would recommend it as it was hard to beat for the price and the location and Todd is highly courteous and professional.,,,,

7901248,87087447,2016-07-18,82964391,Donovan,This place was great it had a really cozy feel with the decor and recessed lighting. There was a ton of green space for being in a major city and was very private. The hot tub worked great and was very relaxing even on a warm night. The TV was huge and all of the amenities worked flawless. The place was also very clean I really don't have anything to say for an improvement it was perfect.

The location was great (it was very walkable, and it shares a building with Blunch, which is a wonderful little café and a great way to start one's day), and the garden setting of the entrance is very pretty. Unfortunately we were there on a couple of the hottest days of the year, so we can't speak to the spa or even really the experience of spending much time sitting in the garden, much to our great regret — though they were quite tempting."

1147871,5492536,2013-07-02,2411078,Dean,The location was super convenient to the T Train and the Airport Station.  If you are flying in you can get to the property right off the airport and then be within walking distance of the airport station if you want to see the rest of Boston via public transit.
Islam was a very hospitable host and philosophically aligned with affordable international travel / backpacking and is perfect for the experienced budget traveler.,,,,,
If you are experienced with international backpacking,hostels,couchsurfing,and other down to earth methods of seeing the world I wouldn't hesitate to suggest this property as you are basically minutes from downtown Boston.,,
Trade-offs:  Shared bathroom,,,,,
Upside:  awesome location,air conditioning,free street parking,"and a great host.\"",,

1147871,6032923,2013-07-27,6244341,Matt,"Islam was a great host while my boyfriend and I stayed at his place.  Even though he wasn't living on site at the time, he dropped by often to check on us and the house and even gave us a ride to our next airbnb location in Cambridge."
"His place also looked exactly like the picture and was conveniently located near the airport and a short ride to downtown Boston. \"",,,,,

The room was clean, comfortable and roomy.  The location couldn't have been better.  Shops, resturants, transportation to and from Boston and the Airport and a lovely feel for a neighbord straight out of \"\"Cheers\"\""
1147871,7068126,2013-09-05,7316911,Josh,"Islam and his brother weren't just good hosts-- they were AMAZING hosts. They are super nice dudes who end up feeling more like friends than landlords. Everything in the house was taken care of, and when I had the down time they even went out partying and rampaging around the town. I know if I come back to Boston I'll have a place to stay that's safe, reliable, and decently priced."
1147871,7249246,2013-09-13,7986021,Florence,"Islam and his brother were awesome hosts! They made my friend and I feel very comfortable during our stay there. When we arrived, Islam told us everything we needed to know about the sights and eats of Boston and East Boston. The room was clean and complete with a fridge, dresser, TV, desk, and towels. The location was very convenient—only a 5-7 minute walk to the Airport T Station and nearby restaurants. Overall, it was a great house with friendly hosts! Definitely recommended!"
1147871,7334549,2013-09-16,7556206,Louise,"Islam was a great host, giving us great tips for around the city and the neighborhood when we arrived. System to check in/check out was simple and organized. Place was clean and well - definitely recommend!"

Unfortunately we didn't meet him in person, while we were there but the other guests were very friendly and helped us out. The house is nice, clean but unfortunately not as conveniently located as we hoped for. It is very close from the airport, however and a mere 10-15 minutes walk to the next subway station. Our room was well equipped,but a bit noisy due to the AC stuck in the window (the window has to stay half opened)."
1147871,7527305,2013-09-23,6126055,Johan,"When we first arrived, Islam's assistant, Nahshon welcomed us. He was friendly and funny. He gave us his mobile number in case of emergencies which was nice. The living room and kitchen were spacious and relatively clean, so was the bathroom. The house is a 10 mins walk to the nearest subway station (airport station) which made daily commute easy. Our room (room C) was sufficiently big for 2 with a tv, table, chair, cabinet and even a mini fridge. The wifi signal was very strong throughout the house as well. However, the staircase to the second floor to our room was covered with dust and the rug on our room floor was also rather dusty. As my girlfriend is rather sensitive to dust, it made her sleep a little uncomfortable. Lastly, light shone in in the mornings as the curtain was translucent. Overall, we had a decent stay and would recommend this house to people who prioritize easy transport and who are not fussy about cleanliness."
1147871,7698703,2013-09-30,2230532,"Gaelle, Nicolas, Yann And Anaïs",My stay in Boston was really convenient because of this room at Islam's house. Everything happened according from my expectations (description and pictures). The house hosts ~4 rooms and thus I met with the other guests. The place is really close to the airport which was a high criterion for me as I was attending a conference the whole week.I have not much to say about the host himself since I only met him at two short occasions. However everything was easy to find and use. I definitely recommend this room for your visit of Boston if the location suits you.
1147871,7797302,2013-10-03,4841106,Sabina,Great place to stay. The location is ideal. Very close to the airport and a short T ride to touristic areas.

Thank you for letting us stay at your place.,,,,,
"CHEERS Paul and Max\"",,,,,
1147871,8288832,2013-10-23,463670,Nora,Staying at Islams place was a very good option for us cause we had one night only and it was so close to the airport that we didnt need to wake up really early in the morning and rush there.
The place was clean especially the bathroom which was great. The only thing to beware of is if you have heavy luggage which will be a hassle to take up the narrow stairs to the bedroom upstairs.,,,,,
As for the area i have stayed in several areas in Boston before and for me this area is not great. Its ok if its just for proximity to airport otherwise i would go for something more central.,,,,,
I haven't met Islam but he was very helpful by email and responded quickly at all times.,,,,,

It was clean and in a decent area.,,,,,
Not a bad experience,"just not good for someone looking to spend some alone time or stay in all day.\"",,,,

1147871,9525320,2014-01-01,10403777,Jodi,Izzy was exceedingly kind and overly accommodating to my circumstances as I relocated to Boston.
The home in East Boston is a quick 5-minute walk to the [Blue Line] Airport T-station.  You can be in downtown Boston (financial district) within 10 minutes and in Cambridge within 25 mins (via Green/Red Line transfers).,,,,,
Also important,the home is an easy 5-minute walk to a Shaw's Supermarket,Walgreen's and CVS pharmacies,Marshall's,a liquor store and LOTS of diverse restaurants and bakeries.,
The room was of ample size,and the bed was very comfortable.  Important for me (as I was a 3-week rental),there was ample storage in both a large closet and 4-drawer bureau.  The room was also equipped with a small refrigerator.,,,
The bathroom (also large) was shared with other guests -- and there was never a scheduling problem.  The other communal rooms -- kitchen and living room -- were large and comfortable,though my experience was that most guests stayed in their rooms when not out visiting Boston.,,,,
Much was done throughout my 3-week stay to ensure the communal areas of the home were clean and comfortable for me and the others guests.,,,,,
"I will always be grateful to Izzy for helping me with my relocation to Boston and for that was done to make my stay enjoyable and stress-free!!\"",,,,,
1147871,9922380,2014-01-19,10708803,Michael,Izzy's place is a perfect spot if you need to stay close to Logan airport or the city. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The facilities are spotlessly clean and very comfortable. I couldn't ask for a more inviting room. It was nicely furnished and I felt very at home. Definitely would stay there again.
1147871,11141451,2014-03-22,6533406,Mirabel,"There was izzy's assistant when I got there so I couldn't meet izzy personally. The assistant was very helpful, friendly and chill. The room was small but cozy and it was very comfortable place. I guess there are couple of rooms only for the travelers such like a hostel. So it wasn't interact with the landlord and a tenant, but like a motel. So I felt like very free in that house. Location was good since there is a summer tunnel right next to the house which is connected to the Quincy market area, but the toll fee was like $5.75 so it wasn't cheap. But overall it was a nice place to stay, and they were very flexible with everything. Thank you!"
1147871,11210716,2014-03-24,3702560,Richard,Checkin: I booked really last minute (3 hours before checkin) and Izzy was very accommodating. Door has a key lock with a code. No need to get a hold of any keys for checkin.
Location: Location is a 5 minute walk from the Blue line Airport Spot.(remember to exit through the back exit). SUPER CONVENIENT.,,,,,
"House: The house is 2 stories and has 4 rooms. 3 rooms on the 2nd floor and 1 in the basement. Rooms are of different size and mattress quality. The 1st night i was in room \"\"A\"\"","which is very small. 2nd night was in room \"\"B\"\" which is much more spacious and has a better mattress. All rooms have locks.",,,,
They have a dedicated resource that cleans the house. House is generally clean. Basement was a bit messy,but not a big deal since i didn't do laundry or workout (i attempted to do both,but failed). Note: there will be strangers in the house. There is one bathroom on the 1st floor so if you are on a tight schedule plan accordingly (i had to wait for two people to shower).,,,
Overall: Rental is great for the price. My sister and I were touring boston and all we really used the house for was to shower and sleep. Although i never met Izzy he was very responsive to emails. Would definitely recommend and stay again when i visit.,,,,,

The Neighboorhood is not as bad as reviewed here. There are 4 other Airbnb rooms in the House. It was nice to meet other Travelers. With a very cheap Metroticket (18$ for 7 Days) you easily get to the Center in Boston within 15 minutes (5 minute walk to the Airport Metrostation).

The place was easy enough to find - just follow his directions.  Really close to the airport   and the blue line (approx 10mins walk), which takes you to downtown in about 15mins. Neighbourhood was ok - my friend and I (both girls) didn't think the was sketchy at all. I would stay here again."
1147871,13422309,2014-05-27,14338221,Christon,Izzy's house was great! It was in an extremely convenient location with respect to the T and it was quiet and comfortable. The neighborhood was populated with a lot of families so it felt safe and cozy. The other tenants were very nice and sharing one bathroom was not an issue.

There are about 4 or 5 bedrooms in this home on AirBnB and only the manager lives there. Guests get a key to their own room and a key to the house. The neighborhood is very multicultural, pedestrian, there are loads of families, and felt quite safe."
It was very easy to walk to the subway station and get around Boston. For the price,"you cannot beat the ease of access.\"",,,,

1147871,14701334,2014-06-24,322593,Berni & Jeff,My wife and I stayed at Izzy's for 6 days while we toured Boston.  I've read some of the reviews of the area being not safe.  The area was very safe.  It is a multi-cultural community and there is no problem walking the area day or night. We did go to a local restaurant that was 6 or 7 blocks from the house and got back late at night.  The room is as advertized.  Izzy and his brother couldn't have been more accomadating with great recommendations of the area. We liked it because it was close to the T line for our daily outings.  The price and value for Boston couldn't be beat.  Thanks Izzy..........

1147871,15650598,2014-07-13,17426460,Leah,"This was our first airbnb experience.  Izzy’s place is in a great location as advertised. The location was super convenient for us as it is only a few blocks from the airport T-station and we flew into Boston Logan and took the free shuttle to the T station. Having our own keys was great. We were able to check in a little bit early as well, which was very nice. We did not actually meet Izzy, just his roommate and the other airbnb people staying there. The house wasn’t spotless, but was clean enough. Our room had AC and the bed was very comfortable.  The TV in our room did not work, which did not matter to us, but might be important to others.  The room looked like the pictures posted online. Overall we had a good experience at Izzy’s place and would recommend it to others. The only issue I could foresee is having to share one bathroom with multiple people, but it seemed to work out during our stay even though there were quite a few airbnb people there at the same time as us."
1147871,15701036,2014-07-14,721417,Iddo,"I had a great stay at Izzy's house. The room is exactly as advertised (I stayed at room C), and is fitted with a window A/C which did a good job cooling down the room. The house is clean and well equipped and self check in and check out suited my needs perfectly. I've never met Izzy himself, but Izzy's roommate and property manager is welcoming and very helpful."
The location is perfect for airport arrivals and you can reach the house on foot within less than 10 minutes,even with luggage. I did find that the neighborhood tends to become a bit intensive as the night falls,but perhaps I was just being paranoid. All in all,"a great experience. \"",,

It was in a creepy location I did not feel safe, the house was disgusting and a mess, the bathroom was gross. The room had one window we could not open and it was stuffy and sticky inside! We could not wait to leave the place! I travel using airbnb in a regular basis and this was by far the worst place I have ever stayed! My suggestion DO NOT RENT THIS PLACE! Also paying 75 was an absolute waste the next night we got a hotel for 60 that was 110% better!"
1147871,15889948,2014-07-17,12335011,Cristina,"Izzy was very responsive to us. Workers had torn up the sidewalk in front of his house and there were construction vehicles blocking the entrance. We called him to find out if there was another way to get in. He answered the phone immediately and offered to help us if we had any other concerns. His directions for unlocking were completely clear. We did not meet him or his manager. There were other people around; not sure who they were, but we assumed they were renting the other two rooms next to us."
The house and room were as described,although the pictures make it appear cleaner and more welcoming than it actually was. The air conditioner worked well as did the mini fridge. The TV did not work,but this was not the kind of room that you would want to lounge around in. We were staying just for an overnight to catch an early flight out and the place is very convenient for that purpose. The neighborhood appears to be sketchy at first glance,but it's quite okay. Lots of families. Amazing Italian restaurant just down the street. We ate there twice.,,

I didn't meet Izzy, but the other Airbnbers staying there were very nice.  The house had all the basic amenities that are needed.  This is a great place to stay if you are just there for one night, as we were.  It's super easy to get to from the airport on the train.  The neighborhood is safe, but doesn't seem to have much nightlife.  However, the North End is just 2 train stops away which is a great place for restaurants and bars.  Overall, exactly what we needed for a night in Boston."
1147871,16726708,2014-08-01,17224550,Lena-Christin,"The apartment is located in an hispanic neighborhood close to the airport what makes it a perfect place to take a flight to your next destination or back home. Even the airport is that close you can´t hear the planes taking off and landing. There is no big grocery store near the apartment. But you can find a lot of smaller shops like kiosks with a limited selection of grocerys and beverages at each corner.  When you arrive there will be nobody home to welcome you and to show you around the apartment, but with the information you get after your booking you know how everything works. Because there is only one bathroom for 4 bedrooms you often have to wait to get in.  At first glance the apartment looks clean. If you don´t expect to much you will have a nice place to stay in Boston. Close to public transportation and to the beach."

1147871,20616914,2014-10-02,21150638,Anita,"Everything was fine, the location is very good and close to the airport and it's very easy to find the apartment. Izzy is a very good host, he was reachable on the phone and the room was as described. Recommended."
1147871,20913896,2014-10-07,5820735,Alessandro,"We spent 3 days in Boston, which is a very expensive city, but fortunately we found this private room and it was a great choice. The house is 5 minutes far from the metro station (the airport stop, 3 more stops and you are in downtown, in 15minutes). the area is extremely safe (we walked from the metro station to the apartment Sunday evening at midnight without any problem or any bad feeling). the room is very clean and I slept litterally like a baby. Izzy is a very friendly owner and provided us bed linen and towels.  the room has any comfort (tv, fridge, closets). I strongly recomend to rent this room in case you wanna go to Boston."
1147871,21041274,2014-10-10,6839560,Jon,"Izzy was the coolest host on our trip: Friendly, easy going and funny. He gave us great tips. We had a problem with our car and he helped us out. Good guy. I recommend his place."
1147871,21096394,2014-10-11,21738559,Georgy,"Очень доброжелательный и гостеприимный хозяин. Говорит по-русски! По телефону очень помог нам сориентироваться в Бостоне. Чистая комната. Удобная кровать, хорошее и чистое постельное бельё. Единственный минус- общий санузел на 4 гостевые комнаты. Прекрасное расположение. Минут 7 ходьбы от метро, всего в 2-х остановках от центра. Отличное соотношение цена/качество."
1147871,21363948,2014-10-15,22264776,James,"Room was just as described, check-in and check-out were hassle-less even though Izzy wasn't around in person."
1147871,22112799,2014-10-30,18744681,Charlotte,Izzy is very kind with his host and the room was very clean as all the house.
It's very well placed near the airport and not so far from the center of the town (15 minutes by subway door to door).,,,,,
"Thanks a lot for everything !!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!\"",,,,,

1147871,22430617,2014-11-06,2698333,Luis F,"Izzy was always at home willing to help and have a talk. The room we stayed in was lovely. Thanks for everything, mate!"
1147871,22587057,2014-11-10,13226588,Cody And Jack,"This was a perfect location-a few blocks from the train, making in super easy to get to and from the airport and downtown! Izzy was extremely welcoming, offering up suggestions as far as where to go and eat. Great place to crash for a few nights."
1147871,22816430,2014-11-15,22759656,Sarah,Seems extremely friendly and flexible.
1147871,22891969,2014-11-17,21965132,Adam,"Couldn't have asked for anything more. Rooms were clean, there was a full kitchen at our disposal, bathroom facilities were clean and in great shape.  Didn't see much of the other guests because we were all out touristing all day and night."
1147871,23083285,2014-11-22,23758019,Ian,"Very pleasant experience. Easy to check in, fast internet, clean, quiet. Izzy was very friendly."
1147871,23386393,2014-11-30,20611928,Emma,"We never met Izzy but his brother was so lovely and accommodating. The room was lovely, light and spacious, and we felt very comfortable there. The location was wonderful in a lovely neighbourhood and short walk to the T. We arrived late and Izzy was totally understanding and great about it. Would definitely recommend and return again - perhaps when it's a little warmer!"
1147871,23443618,2014-12-01,13771761,Sebastian,"Perfect proof how awesome airbnb can work. We only stayed for about 10h. Most importantly in Boston at Winter, the room was cozy and warm! Towels, sheets, and clear instructions were in place. We couldn't wish for more."
1147871,23618403,2014-12-06,3963754,Billy,"I had a very simple visit. Checked, met two other guests. Bed was good, room was clean, and no problems with the bathroom. Location was convenient to the airport."
1147871,23667208,2014-12-07,8405151,Jan Pieter,"Let me first say that this location is quite perfect in terms of logistics. Easy to get to and from the airport (with perfect explanation by Izzy), a quick metro ride to Downtown Boston. The room is not especially wildly decorated, but perfect for a short stay on a (business) trip. I found it helpful to wear earplugs given the proximity of the airport. I actually liked pretty much all about this place; that's why I came back for a second night on my way back home. I did not meet Izzy personally, but his 'helper' Rose was very kind and helpful! All in all highly recommended"
1147871,23780604,2014-12-09,15536056,Dave,Good place. No complaints.
1147871,23925940,2014-12-14,23587329,Anh,"Great communicator, good neighborhood, very close to the airport."
1147871,24042928,2014-12-17,23684661,Benjamin,"Convenient location, tidy house, neat kitchen and bathroom installations, and very flexible check-in and check-out."
However,I believe it should be clearly stated in the description that this is an offer for a single room and shared common areas with 4 other rooms.,,,,
Izzy's place is a deluxe youth hostel,but he certainly does not live here. Every single guest I met had not anticipated this set-up.,,,,
Overall,great experience,but be aware that this is not an airbnb : you will not stay at someone's place,but in a neutral place shared with other guests (which is cool too,"if you are aware of it).\"",
1147871,24560270,2014-12-30,17999251,Francesco,Great experience!! The house was perfect!!
1147871,24626562,2014-12-31,12873564,Sally,Staying at Izzy's in Boston was great. The room was clean and the house was easy to find. It was super nice having a fully-furnished kitchen. We met two of the other guests and they were very nice. Never ended up meeting Izzy but he handled an issue with our booking quickly and courteously. Would stay there again if we were in Boston!
1147871,24692709,2015-01-01,1507842,Megan,"Excellent! The place was exactly as described, the photos were accurate and complete, and the reviews from past guests were also accurate."
Location: First of all,dead easy and fast to get to and from the airport and public transit. East Boston has a bad reputation,but that clearly has become outdated. I lived in Boston about 12 years ago,and it was tough and scary. On this trip,what I saw was a dominantly Latino family neighbourhood - mostly younger parents with children. If,like us
The place: Check-in/out was quick and easy,despite out weird hours of travel. The bathroom,kitchen and living room all had those little things you wish you had,but forgot,while traveling (aspirin,dental floss
"We will definitely stay here again any time we're coming or going through Logan!\"",,,,,
1147871,24754971,2015-01-02,8305373,Zoe,"The host wasn't there for the duration of my stay, and it needs to be pointed out that this is a listing for a room in a house that functions to all intents and purposes like a hostel, when I stayed the five rooms (all for air bnb) were each being let out, mostly to couples. With there being only one bathroom, and couples being annoying, this was a little overbearing and it wasn't quite clear in the air bnb advert that the listing is more of a boarding house."
That being said,it was an exceptional time of the year (NYE) and I can't fault the room itself or the house facilities. The kitchen was a joy to use and I felt comfortable cooking there. It was warm and the bed was comfortable and private. The other people staying were very nice and all travelling through from different parts of the world. If you are looking for a social experience more similar to a hostel,this is for you. Also great for couples.,,,
The neighbourhood is surprisingly friendly and nice for an airport locale,with a giant supermarket a pleasant and short walk away,some restaurants and the ubiquitous Dunkin' Donuts.,,,
"All in all a useful spot to know and I would consider returning if I was in the Boston area and wanted somewhere that was specifically close the airport. \"",,,,,
1147871,25068640,2015-01-05,20315478,Yen,"We added two more people in our trip at the last minute. The host was very friendly and he helped us to arrange the place for my friends to stay. The extra fee charge is very reasonable. The house was clean and everything was prepared well when we got there. If you drive, it will be a little hard to find the parking slot because it is street parking. We had great time! Thank you"
1147871,25173285,2015-01-08,23588516,Bartira,"It was a really nice experience. Nice place, close to the subway. The room is comfortable. We enjoyed our stay. People who like to stay in hostels will enjoy this experience too."
1147871,25216331,2015-01-09,25429996,Tricia,This was a clean and simple location.   Everything as described and affordable.  The night I stayed was busy with people leaving at different hours of the night.
1147871,25641262,2015-01-21,25751378,Julie,"I didn't have the chance to meet Izzy, I arrived late and I leave early."
The C-room is spacious,clean and comfortable,like the other shared rooms of the house.,,,
"The whole experience was great.\"",,,,,
1147871,25724411,2015-01-24,18607361,Frank (And Meridith),This Airbnb is managed without contact from the owner; that makes it ideal for late layovers from the Airport. You don't have to worry about keeping someone up late.
"Within walking distance from the blue line \"\"Airport\"\" station where the airport shuttle takes you. Good flophouse.\"",,,,,
1147871,26323589,2015-02-09,12681517,Danielle,"The description for this house and room were perfectly accurate. Izzy gave thorough instructions about how to check in and out and what the expectations were for the house. Towels, extra pillows, and some small appliances were in the room waiting for my arrival. I felt very welcome and comfortable being there. My name was even written on the door to greet me! The other people I interacted with at the house were also very kind. I would definitely look it up again if back in East Boston at some point."
1147871,26643212,2015-02-16,27288313,Chris,Everything was great. The place was in a great location and the price was perfect for what we were looking for.
1147871,27418188,2015-03-03,25142081,Marie,Great guest. Izzy and his girlfriend were adorable. Everything as made to help feel at home. Thank you !

Great location for safety, as well as airport and subway access!  I had complete privacy, but was able to meet up with all of the tenants in the kitchen and family room."
I highly recommend staying here if you are visiting Boston!,,,,,
"Thanks Izzy!\"",,,,,
1147871,28632097,2015-03-27,26051121,Benjamin,Was a very nice room. Instructions made it very easy to find and had no problems getting in and out of the property. Everything was provided and the room was extremely clean and tidy. Would recommend this room to anyone and was a very good price.
1147871,28849615,2015-03-30,6154714,Krista,"I didn't end up making it to Boston the night I was scheduled to stay at Izzy's, but I did contact her ahead of time to ask a few questions. She was incredibly prompt and courteous. I am sure this would've translated had I stayed at her Airbnb. Thank you!"
1147871,29138778,2015-04-04,10822797,Jessica,Stayed at Izzy's on two separate nights. Everything was great. Thank you!
1147871,29411694,2015-04-07,27924578,Aurélie,"Très bon séjour à Boston. Nous n'avons pas rencontré Izzy mais il est tout de même arrangeant en ce qui concerne l'heure d'arrivée. La chambre était comme décrite sur le site, une petite ardoise de bienvenue avec nos noms était accrochée sur la porte. Le logement était plus que correct. Le seul petit bémol pourrait être un seul toilette/salle de bain pour 4 chambres."
L'endroit est plutôt bien situé,"le métro est facile d'accès. \"",,,,
1147871,29713256,2015-04-11,15026710,Caroline,"I had a great stay at Izzy's. He was able to accommodate my last minute booking and was super flexible with my arrival time. Checking in and checking out was seamless thanks to Izzy's detailed instructions! The house was well kept and the bedroom was spacious with a nice, comfy bed. It was really neat to meet the other Airbnb travelers while I was there. Everyone was friendly and respectful to each other in regards to noise level, cleaning up after themselves, etc."
His place is in a great location; a 5-10 minute walk from the blue line's Airport station. This station will get you into downtown Boston in just a few stops,and you can ride the free airport shuttle to get to/from the airport. The neighborhood also has loads of great Latin American restaurants and markets.,,,,
One of my favorite things about Airbnb besides the affordability is being able to meet other travelers while also experiencing the local life and culture. You get all of this when you stay at Izzy's,"I'd definitely stay here again!\"",,,,
1147871,29863638,2015-04-13,29959357,Yichen,Everything was clear and intuitive from the posted instructions. Place was clean and the other guests seemed friendly.
1147871,29959482,2015-04-14,27619690,Jake,"Izzy was very helpful, and the room was great- really comfortable bed! Plus, the neighborhood is beautiful. Get out and walk around if you have the chance."
1147871,29999001,2015-04-15,30713797,Kristin,"Izzy was great at communicating!  His instructions for entry were clear and he followed up with messages to ensure we had a proper stay.  Our stay was quick but we did enjoy eating at Angela's two blocks away, it was delicious authentic Mexican food.  The neighborhood was extremely conveniently located and made lugging our large bags from our trip to Europe much easier.  Room and house was clean.  We left our luggage in the living room while exploring during the day we left and had no issues."
1147871,30173040,2015-04-18,3936238,Kieran,Stayed for 3 nights. Never met Izzy but contact was good. Was a bit different to other air bnb we have stayed in as you share a house with other random travellers.
The house was nice and in an excellent location. You have access to a full kitchen and fridge which was great although the fridge probably could do with a clear out more often.,,,,,
"We were happy overall and would recommend as a good value place to stay.\"",,,,,
1147871,30533511,2015-04-23,21453560,Richard,"Izzy's place is comfortable, good value, and very convenient for the airport. This was our second stay and we would happily stop again."
1147871,30830070,2015-04-27,4054560,Félix,"We arrived very late in Boston since we drove there after work, on friday evening, from Montréal. Izzy was very comprehensive about this situation and provided us everything we needed to come in safely. We had a great time at his place. Well situated, next to the airport train station that will bring you in downtown Boston in minutes."
1147871,31537268,2015-05-06,30979805,Alexander,"Staying by Izzy's place went by smoothly. Although the place was simple, but it satisfied all my needs for a short overnight stay! Izzy was very friendly. One thing to note is that the surrounding neighbourhood isn't what one would call perfectly safe, so I recommend arrive to his place earlier than later at night! I would definitely stay again if I get the chance to!"
1147871,32288603,2015-05-16,26896724,Laura,"Unlikely that you will see Izzy when there, the whole place seems to be on AirBnB---really nice place, comfortable bed and lots of space in the room. The place is just a short walk from some good large stores which was really helpful."
1147871,32524814,2015-05-19,14224308,Benoit,"Logement calme propre et bien situé à quelques minutes du métro, à refaire sans hésitation !"

1147871,32701705,2015-05-20,6611135,Sarah,"The listing is as pictured. The host is detailed enough with instructions on how to get to/enter rental, as well as use of facilities. The neighborhood is a little intimidating at first. The rental is an older home, but clean and comfortable. The walk from the airport station to the rental is not exactly short, but it was no problem with our carry-on luggage. The host is easy to get a hold of. It's a decent place to stay if you have a short stopover in Boston. It's cheaper than any hotel I could find near the airport."

1147871,33412306,2015-05-27,17208863,Gayathri,The house was way much better than the description. Very quiet and a wonderful house. Izzy made us feel very comfortable. He helped us at late midnight offering his car park to us and moved his car out to another place. Very next and very clean house!
1147871,33910301,2015-06-02,28111483,Becky,Izzy was a great host. He was very helpful and recommended places to go. The room is a good size and the communal areas are also very nice.

Izzy and his assistant Victoria were really friendly and welcoming, and answered all our questions with patience. The kitchen had a lot of facilities, and the room itself had a TV, fridge, closet, drawers, and desk. The air con was really useful as well. The location was perfect, even as someone who wanted to visit downtown etc - it's so close to the train to downtown, and of course the airport shuttle comes from that train station so overall, a great place to be as a traveller. The area seemed safe to me, if a little unclean, and there was a supermarket nearby to buy food, as well as some fast food places for a quick meal. Would recommend!"
1147871,35511221,2015-06-19,17692277,Sigurlaug,"I arrived late and left early so it  was a short stay. The guidelines were very clear, the house easy to find and everything was easy."

1147871,36546166,2015-06-29,33532275,Mengyu,The room is very nice. The description is accurate. It takes 10 minutes to walk from the airport subway station to the place. We really enjoyed our stay. Will recommend.

Super easy access to the city center & very close to the airport!!!! Only a few minutes walk to the subway system and a couple stops away from the city center, giving you amazingly simple access to everything you want to see in Boston!!

However, Izzys place was very accommodating as I was able to enter after hours. Comfortable room, and my boyfriend was a big fan that they had a chromecast set up :). Cute house as well and clean. Very close to T station 5minute walk."

The room was clean and so was the bathroom even while shared with other guests. What bothered us was the dirty staircase and kitchen. We did not feel like using the kitchen when we saw all the dishes in the sink. Also, the host that was present did not say goodbye to us which was kind of sad. All in all, our one night stay in Boston was okay. Some things could have been better/improved."
1147871,40440374,2015-07-31,14486361,Wendy,Izzy’s house is in a very convenient location and exactly the same as he describes. He prepared a very clear instruction and made me getting into my room without any problem. He has a wonderful kitchen and prepares almost everything you need if you want to cook something yourself.

1147871,43935940,2015-08-23,4311790,Janine,"We slept in room C and thanks to the aircon it was not too hot and we could sleep. The location is good you can easily reach Boston downtown by subway, take a run in the nearby park at Bremen Street and grab some good latino food in the neighbourhood. It got a bit crowded since there is only one bathroom and we had to share it with 8 people but if you are on a budget and planning to stay there only for a short stay, I can recommend it. Parking in front of the house is also free which you would not get somwhere in downtown in Boston."

1147871,44681558,2015-08-28,40133088,Dana,Our stay with Izzy was really nice! The place is located near to the airport but also very close to the city! We met nice people during the time we stayed at Izzy's because there were three other rooms rented to airbnb people. Sometimes sharing the bathroom with up to 6 other people was a bit of a challenge but we always got up really early so we got along pretty well. An extra plus for the air conditionig in every room! We can highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston as a tourist (who has no problen with sharing kitchen and bathroom with about 6 other people) :)
1147871,46481256,2015-09-11,33132340,John,This was a great experience. Izzy was very helpful and kind. They shared dinner with me on a couple of occasions. Nice folks.
1147871,46605030,2015-09-12,30772283,Danielle,"The place was exactly as described! Very close to the airport, which was exactly what we needed. The place was clean and hospitable! Plus there was a fantastic Mexican restaurant a couple of blocks away... don't skip the guac!"
1147871,46884468,2015-09-14,14844807,Lisa,Location es perfect and the room fine & very clean.
Due to the fact that up to 6 guests share the same bathroom it isn't always very clean. Just right after the cleaner was there. She did a great job.,,,,,
"But it obviously depends in you and the other guests ;) \"",,,,,
1147871,47048921,2015-09-15,14538462,Sunshine,"The room was as we expected - super easy access from the airport and all the basic amenities for a reasonable price. We checked ourselves in, explored Boston, slept well and went on our way. If you need a great value room near the airport with no frills, stay here."
1147871,47647363,2015-09-21,36417886,Michaela,Comfortable room and great location! Central to both the airport and not a far train trip to downtown Boston!
1147871,47888385,2015-09-21,43640164,Edgar,Es un sitio con muy buena ubicación cerca de dos buenos restaurantes y del aeropuerto. El anfitrion es muy diligente y servicial en responder a cualquier pregunta y la reservación es una garantía.

1147871,48387102,2015-09-26,17003895,Rebecca,The stay at Izzy's house was just perfect! My girlfriend and I spent 5 days here and it couldn't have been better.
The room was exactly as described. Clean and cozy,a great place to explore Boston - especially since the subway is just a 6 minute walk away. It might get a little hot in the room,but there's an AC so there should be no problem.,,,
Izzy is an awesome host and person - warm,friendly,funny and helpful. If there's any problem,he'll fix it. The communication was perfect; Izzy responds pretty fast.,,
"We would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to see this beautiful city. And since we are two young women who watch too much \"\"Law and Order\"\" - the area is safe","so there's no need to worry if you're coming home late ;)\"",,,,
1147871,49354052,2015-10-03,11445731,Miriam,"Die Unterkunft war gut gelegen vor allem weil wir früh zum Flughafen mussten. Das Zimmer was sauber und geräumig und hatte alles was man benötigt. Parken war ebenfalls kein Problem, auch wenn man mal auf eine Nebenstraße ausweichen musste. Küche und Wohnzimmer waren groß und hatten ebenfalls alles  was man benötigt. Der einzige Kritikpunkt ist vielleicht, dass es für mehrere vermietete Zimmer nur ein Badezimmer gibt, wo es vor allem abend und morgens zu Staus kam ;) Ansonsten hat alles problemlos funktioniert;)"
1147871,49484481,2015-10-04,42814432,Jiapeng,"当我刚进入这座房子的时候,房东先生很热情的跟我打了招呼,包括后来的时候,房东先生帮我们提行李,换上新的床单以及被罩,将卧室整理得特别舒适。房东先生悉心地指导我们入住后的一些细节,使得我们入住后完全没有障碍。这所房子位于很繁华的小镇,离铁路站大概七八分钟的距离,不远处有便利店,乘坐捷运会很快地到达市中心区域,同时,这里距离爱德华劳伦斯洛干将军机场特别近,步行至捷运机场站后乘坐摆渡车即可抵达。这里的床是非常舒适的,它使我拥有了一晚的安心睡眠,我很感激房东对我们的悉心照顾。"
1147871,49908252,2015-10-07,31412319,Laura,"Really good location, near the airport station, at five minutes of Boston heart. The room was very comfortable and tidy. Izzy and his dad are really good people."
1147871,50054449,2015-10-08,32410434,Craig,"The location was awesome! It was so close to the train station, just a 5 minute walk down the street to the park and the Airport metro station is right there. I had a car and I could park it on the street in front of the house for free. I actually arrived around noon and had no place to keep my bags. I called Izzy and he told me to come to the house, leave my bags and then I could go out to see Boston until it was time to check in. Awesome experience, Izzy and his family were very welcoming and helpful. I only stayed one night and had to leave in the morning. I would definitely come back and stay again. The room was exactly was was described in the ad, very comfortable bed! Thank you very much Izzy!"
1147871,50350381,2015-10-11,1898973,Jo,Great location near the airport.  Only a short walk to the T station where there is a free blue shuttle bus to the airport. Also just two subway stops to downtown Boston.  Izzy's place runs like a rooming house with four private rooms for rent.  The price is a great deal for the Boston area.  There is one flight of stairs to the rooms and the shared bathroom is on the main floor. Although it was booked full we only saw two other roomers and had no trouble sharing the bathroom.
Izzy's friend is there and available for any help needed.  Texts were always answered promptly.  The bed was a comfy queen size.   There is also a closet and dresser for longer stays.  We only stayed the one night before our early flight out the next day. Our room was very comfortable and also had a small refrigerator for our use.  You'll need it if you dine at Rino's Place,"just a block down the street. It is an excellent Italian restaurant with gigantic entrees and they don't allow sharing so go hungry or plan to have lunch for the next day! \"",,,,
1147871,50767559,2015-10-14,43303064,Bernice,We were told that Izzy was out of town but his friend was very kind and hospitable towards us. The place was exactly as described. It was a very comfortable 3 night stay. It is also very close to the Airport T station making it very easy to explore Boston.
1147871,51305003,2015-10-19,3755455,Dominika,"Our stay at Izzy's home was great! Room was exactly as pictured, with plenty of storage (dresser and closet), bed, desk, mirror, and towels for use. We didn't get to meet Izzy but he was easily reached by text and responded immediately when we needed to have a light bulb replaced in the room. Never had an issue with sharing the bathroom,  even with all the rooms booked. Very easy to get to and from the airport, and 100% free if you use the shuttle and walk from the Airport T station (approx 5 minute walk). Highly recommended to anyone who is looking for a place to crash close to the airport and T station at a reasonable price. Would definitely stay again."
1147871,51667780,2015-10-22,42694046,Linda,"BRILLIANT location-SO easy to get to from the Airport blue line T-station, and moments from the airport terminals.  Pictures were accurate, bed was super comfy. This is in a family friendly, working neighborhood so parking would be a nightmare on the street after work/weekends. Note there are a potential 7 folks using the single bathroom if all the rooms are rented. Lots of steps into house and up to bedrooms. Very organized host-super clever front door lock. Wonderful restaurants within walking distance. Great easy experience for the budget."
1147871,51966887,2015-10-25,9251088,Eric,Perfect location for anyone looking to go downtown often. Also a plus having the airport real close. The MBTA was real easy to get use to. The room was clean and comfortable.
1147871,52259822,2015-10-27,3839548,Heather,"This place is close to the airport, and transit to downtown, with comfortable beds and clean rooms. East Boston is a mix (including Latino America, Irish American and Italian American cultures); with lots of young families living down the street. I stayed over the weekend and East Boston is lively all night long so if you're looking for a super quiet neighborhood this might not be a good fit. My stay was self check-in and I interacted very little with other people while in this house. We shared a single bathroom, but never had issues using it. Although my room was clean, the rest of the house was a bit cluttered, the bathroom was left messy by the other guests and the kitchen had dirty dishes strewn about every time I saw it. Felt like I was staying in an affordable hostel for younger travelers."
1147871,52994235,2015-11-03,46193380,Soraya,Nice neighborhood no sketchy people and close to transportation
1147871,53231752,2015-11-06,26921732,Ngan,"It was exactly as described. Izzy gave me all the instructions I needed. Very detailed.  His welcome message on the board made me smile. The room is clean, and although basic, was all I needed for one night stay before catching an early flight. The rest of the apartment is not so tidy but it is not a problem. The place is very close to the airport. The walk from the t-station was a very easy 10-15 minute walk, but if you have a lot of luggage to carry I would recommend taking a taxi.  Highly recommend this place if you have less than 12 hours lay over between flights at Logan airport."
1147871,53722311,2015-11-11,23852526,Odeta,"La casa é in una posizione comodissima a due minuti dalla fermatata della metro dove ci sono anche le navette gratuite per l'aereoporto. Siamo stati accolti da Jacopo, un amico di Izzy estremamente simpatico e d'aiuto."
1147871,53788523,2015-11-12,40005614,Axel,Good location if you're flying in and out of the airport. Metro close by.
1147871,54149840,2015-11-16,17143236,S,"A little disappointed. Izzy's house was cluttered, dusty, and kind of greasy. There were heaps of dust under our bed and the sheets had stains in them. The location was great though, close to food, supermarkets and downtown Boston. Front door lock worked perfectly and the house was calm and quiet. However, the house should be cleaned thoroughly sometime, because it was not as pictured on airbnb."
1147871,54469010,2015-11-20,8214532,Rob,"After a great experience this first time, a second time was an easy decision to make. Crazy sweet VIP reception, random guest banter, and comfy bed made for another quality experience!!"

La habitación estaba muy limpia y bien amueblada. Si vuelvo a Boston,"volvería a alojarme en este apartamento.\"",,,,
1147871,55937423,2015-12-07,7366345,Tim,Awesome place. Very close to the airport and downtown via the T rail. My friend and I had a great time staying here. Would highly recommend to others
1147871,56531050,2015-12-14,45262820,Adrian,"Convenient location, clean room, just as described! Izzy wasn't there but gave detailed directions on how to access the room, and his helpful friends opened up for us."
1147871,56749506,2015-12-17,16716339,Leah,Izzy's place provided a perfect spot from which to explore Boston. It's really conveniently located near a metro station and takes no time to get to the centre of the city. The neighbourhood feels really safe (I was travelling alone and felt comfortable coming back after dark).
The room was really spacious and clean and had everything I wanted. I didn't get to meet Izzy,but the house had a really friendly vibe and I chatted to a few other guests in the living room.,,,,
If I visit Boston again,"I'd definitely stay here again. \"",,,,
1147871,56830218,2015-12-18,6623242,Duc,We had a good experience there. The room was greatly cozy and conveniently lose to the airport. Self check-in instruction was provided and we did not bother anyone although we came in late night. I will definitely recommend it.

1147871,57949097,2015-12-30,42431388,Xiaoya,It's a good experience to live here.
1147871,58208729,2016-01-01,51543844,Katy,"Very convenient for access to Logan Airport! About a 7 minute walk to where the free airport shuttle comes every 15 minutes and just a few subway stops to downtown Boston. The house and room were exactly as described, and the instructions on how to get there and get into the house were very detailed and accurate. Sometimes it was a little bit of a wait for the bathroom given that three guest rooms were using it and the room near the street was a little loud at night but these are things that the host can't control much. Overall, a good value."
1147871,58694971,2016-01-03,36083790,Tyana,"Great space for the price. We spent a few days in Boston and it was only a 5 minute walk to the station, so very convenient. I was able to find street parking easily and it ended up being a great trip."
1147871,60165730,2016-01-19,39225456,Abigail,"Description of the listing was extremely accurate. Izzy gave us instructions before we arrived on how to get into the house and room and also left notes around the house to help us navigate. The location was perfect, just an 8 minute drive into Boston. Parking was never atn issue at the house as there's a lot of street parking. Con is just one bathroom, but if you shower at night you'll be fine."
1147871,60440177,2016-01-23,1505737,Claudia,"Izzy's place was very conveniently located. We arrived late at night (midnight) and because of this decided on taking a cab. It only cost about $8.50 for two people from Logan airport. The entry instructions were very easy, and the bed was super comfortable. The station to get in to the city was also extremely close! Thanks for having us!"
1147871,61269313,2016-02-01,15861244,Marissa,"Great room, easy directions for check in. Finding parking on the street was annoying, but that's jut the city for you! There were a few other rooms that were rented out as well. Everyone shares a bathroom, which could be problematic. It didn't cause us any major problems or delays though. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay!"

When we first arrived,we were not feeling well due to our flight there,but Rosa made us feel welcome. She let us stay and rest in the living room (She also gave me blanket~),even though it was not our time to check in yet!!!!,,
The room was big and comfortable. (Although it may not seem that big in the picture lol) They have everything so there really is no need to bring anything other that your clothes and a toothbrush lol,,,,,
Everyone we met during our stay was all super nice and super  approachable. Although we didn't get a chance to get to know all of them until the very last day,I am still very happy to have a chance to speak to every single one of them~,,,,
Our flight was cancel the night before. My friend and I were desperate and don't know what to do,but Izzy was super nice by letting us stay one more night and gave us advice on how to get to airport at 3am.,,,,
This place really made my trip to Boston extra extra special.,,,,,

Personally, I am a private person and I like the fact that the atmosphere was quiet outfitted with clear instructions."
1147871,69774838,2016-04-13,65299863,Elena,"The room looks exactly like on the picture. The house is very cozy and well taken care off; extremely clean. It is a short ride from the airport, about 5 minutes walking distance from a T-station to the house. It felt like a small hotel with the exception of sharing a bathroom with other guests. It was not a problem with me, because I was getting up early in the morning to look for grad schools. The neighborhood is OK, I found a few nice places to eat around. Definitely would stay there again if I am in Boston."
1147871,69866931,2016-04-14,38060930,Ondrej,The location was fairly covinient. House was clean and neat. The host was not present but everything was ready for us. It would have been nice to talk to someone local but we discovered good breakfast place around the corner anyway (Angela's Cafe). We'd stay again if end up in Boston in the future.
1147871,70727747,2016-04-20,35032513,Leslie,"Had a great weekend in Boston staying here!  Easy access to public transit, extremely hospitable host, and a nice house.  We were there for the marathon, and it was great fun to hang out with the other runners from around the country staying in the other rooms.  We met some really neat people, and enjoyed every minute of our stay.  I highly recommend this listing - it's clean, convenient, and Izzy is a great host and very responsive."
1147871,70916404,2016-04-22,60288242,Nehemia,Every place has pro and cons which have to be factored in comparison to your budget.
Cons: 1. instead of a mattress there is a square foam piece,and sheets and pillows are the most basic,so if u r sensitive this will prevent u from having a good night rest.  2. 1 small window allows u only to see light from outside but no real outdoors view possible,which might be bad if u r claustrophobic. 3. weak light-bulb in rm wont allow u to read (apparently installed to save electricity)  4. A rooming house in a very drab working neighborhood so this is not a scenic place  5. room is slightly stuffy but has A/C to offset it,,
Pros: 1. Five min walking distance to the Airport station Blue line which also has a free shuttle to the Airport   2. Ten min walk to Shaws supermarket (large),Fifteen min walk to Y (has gym),East Boston Greenway,and waterfront  3. First floor has decent living room,kitchen and small patio with modern Ikea furniture and all basic appliances so u can hang out there comfortably 4. Rm has decent Ikea style furniture (except for matress which is a piece of foam),mini fridge
1147871,71280781,2016-04-24,417208,Manon,"Very close to the airport and easy to get to. Clean, comfy room."

1147871,74280796,2016-05-14,49919056,Anna,"nice location near the airport, there are 24/7 convenient store and restaurant, so if you are arriving late, you can still get something. The room was really basic and you need to share bathroom with other 3 room, but the living room and kitchen are really nice. I have not meet Izzy, but he has all instruction nicely uploaded on airbnb page and reacts quickly to any concerns, i would choose this stay definitely again."
1147871,75055725,2016-05-18,45539207,Yuhan,"The place is really nice and cozy. Izzy and another owner of the house Isabel are both very friendly. The kitchen is big and sufficient.

1147871,75867103,2016-05-23,20511048,Hari,Izzy's is an excellent place super close to the airport. Commute is a bliss and no brainer. His instructions are extremely clear so we could check in easily. We stayed two one-night stays within 4 days. Room was very neat and well maintained. You've everything you need for a night to be honest.
We wanted a fan for our room which we couldn't ask him because we checked in late. But a small table fan for the room will help apart from AC. My wife was having cold so we couldn't use the AC. So ours was just a one-off case.,,,,,
I wish we had met Izzy too :),,,,,

1147871,85436077,2016-07-11,6715039,August,"Perfect as an airport hotel alternative. Had an early morning flight, uber was only a 3min wait, cost $8 to get to the airport."
1147871,86264369,2016-07-15,65480599,Jason,"We had a great time in room C which was very spacious! The self check in is very easy and the room is clean. The location is great to explore Boston, the subway is very close. If you take the blue line in the other direction a very nice and quiet beach is only a couple stops away! From downtown Boston to the house is $6 Uber Pool ride."
1147871,86575121,2016-07-17,7297765,Svety,"The place is very close to the airport and we had a big room with a comfortable bed, big fridge and a 3d TV :). Everything was clean and we felt welcome."
1147871,87011073,2016-07-18,16500213,Simone,We only stayed at Izzy's house for a night before heading to the airport. The location was perfect as it's only a short walk to the airport shuttle bus. I read in another review that the bathroom was always busy which is true but it wasn't too big of a deal. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the room was not as bleak as in the picture. :-) The walls actually have some color now. The AC was pretty loud but it was ok for a night. I can certainly recommend for a night's stay.
1147871,87498187,2016-07-20,56597334,Takayasu,Izzy and room were really very nice! I wanna come back again someday.

1147871,89431494,2016-07-28,84716561,Paul,Great experience and easy self-check in. Convenient location near airport.
1147871,89863412,2016-07-30,27382826,Albert,"Izzy did an excellent job communicating how to get to the apartment and of the amenities. My flight was delayed until very late (3 am) but this was the perfect place to stay for that reason. It is close to the airport and easy to get to. Taxis are pretty expensive in Boston so having a place you can get to that is a close distance, especially if you get there late and only need a place to crash, this is the perfect place. Great value for the price. Hotels ran for $200+ everywhere I looked, so if all you need is a place to crash while you visit Boston, this is the place for you."
1147871,91206077,2016-08-04,20021990,Antonia,We had a good stay! Close to the airport and it is just quick ride With the Subway to downtown Boston.
1147871,93985083,2016-08-14,26228776,Browne,"We took the shuttle from the airport to the T station, and it was a quick walk to the bnb. Check in was smooth. We didn't talk too much to our host, but she was kind and helpful. The room was good sized and there is an air conditioner and a small fridge. There is also a TV with Chromecast, which was a nice little addition. The house is quick walking distance to the T station and in a safe neighborhood. The bathroom is shared with everyone in the house, which was a little inconvenient, but nothing too bad."
1147871,95134038,2016-08-18,82294247,Courtney,"The room is spacious, clean and comfortable. Didn't find any problems with the bathroom being busy when I needed it. Although the room is close to the airport, I found that that was really all it was close to. It took at least 20 minutes to get to Boston city and would have taken twice as long with public transit. This was a mistake on my behalf for not researching the area. It's definitely great for a night or two. Didn't see the owner but the cleaner was lovely."
1147871,96487413,2016-08-23,36612952,Jessye,"Izzy was a great host, flexible and reactive! His house is very much like a hostel, great place to meet people from all over the world!"

Manuel was super friendly and helpful, happy to direct us to dinner and places to go. Manuel and Soshee's kind faces made the experience truly remarkable. 10/10 would stay here again!"
13513012,86838025,2016-07-17,60796076,Peter,"Vi opholdt os tre dage i Manuels skønne værelse. Vi havde hele 4. sal for os selv. Den store altan var dejlig efter en lang dag på opdagelse i byen. Stedet ligger i et roligt kvarter lige ved siden af U-banen, let at komme til fra lufthavn og seværdigheder."

Room was extremely clean and extra bonus that was not expected was the mini fridge. Snacks was a surprise as well. Host was very genuine, keen on communication and welcoming! Going up the stairs with luggage was a challenge, but wasn't too bad. Nice outside patio for a late night drink or to catch some fresh air. Would most definitely stay again! Great value and location :)"
13513012,92488055,2016-08-08,87336715,Karen,"Manuel and Soshee were absolutely fantastic hosts! Extremely pleasant and most welcoming. The impeccably clean rooftop room, large bathroom and private veranda (with great views) made for a perfect stay. The location could not be better - with the subway to Boston so close by, and an easy walk to great nearby restaurants and the gorgeous Arnold Arboretum. Our hosts went out of their way to make our stay special, offering many extra touches, including tasty coffee, a variety of snacks, and refreshing drinks. I would highly recommend Manuel's place for anyone looking for a warm welcome yet plenty of privacy, in a super convenient location that is perfect for relaxing and/or exploring Jamaica Plain, Roslindale or Boston."
13513012,94673339,2016-08-16,79069360,Anna,We stayed for 3 nights at Manuel and Xoxi's place. The room was absolutely great. Nice bathroom and wonderful balcony. Everything was very clean. Manuel and Xoxi were welcoming hosts who gave their best to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The walk to the subway is very short - great to explore Boston.

13513012,99933441,2016-09-06,8221130,Nicolas,"Our experience was simply amazing. I couldn't imagine a better location to visit Boston for a couple of days. The apartment is right by a train station in a beautiful and calm neighborhood . You'll be in downtown Boston in less than 20min. The place is quiet at night, gorgeous and super clean. Manuel and his sister are exceptional hosts. They were always making sure that everything was going well for us.  Highly recommend this place and the people. Cheers!"

13059,2299103,2012-09-17,1563386,Nina,"Nine of us piled onto the White Elephant to spend a weekend in Boston for a friends wedding. We had so much fun! It was wonderful to wake up on the water and SO much more fun than a hotel. The boat accommodated 9 comfortably (we are an intimate crew of old friends). We had a great time cooking together and BBQing on the roof deck, walking around Charlestown, and spending time on the boat. All the neighbors in the harbor were super friendly. We definitely recommend a visit, and hope to be back!"
13059,2865439,2012-11-12,3783808,Jeff,"We had a great time! We were attending seminars all week but it was great to come back to the boat and relax, or head into Boston. The boat was right in the heart of the North End and we could walk to many bars and restaurants. JJ was helpful and met us at the boat to help us settle in. We all highly recommend staying at the White Elephant, the boat and JJ were the best and made our trip memorable. You'll love it!"

13059,9667718,2014-01-05,2911807,Mike,"Only stayed 3 nights (Jan 1st to 4th 2014) and there was a blizzard which closed most things down! These were exceptional circumstances for sure, but highlighted the uneven heating on the boat: upstairs (2 huge double beds + bathroom) was toasty but downstairs remained cool. Also, if you take the downstairs bedroom, be aware that if it's choppy(we were there in a blizzard), the sounds of water lapping and ropes straining will keep you awake - it's LOUD!!! That said, I thought the boat was lovely: beds were really comfortable and the four of us could fit on the sofa no problem. Everything was done over the internet with instructions on how to obtain keys from lockboxes, one for the boat and one for the gate to the jetty - I personally like to deal with people face to face and all we had was a number to contact if any problems arose.  Once again, I'd like to reiterate that these things didn't spoil our stay - the location was great- a short walk to a good choice of bars and restaurants (the Barking Crab was amazing), shops and the Quincy Market as well as the trolley bus. It was the 14 inches of snow that restricted us in Boston....!"
13059,11577807,2014-04-08,9322832,Angelika,"Wir waren für drei Nächte, eine Gruppe von 6 Erwachsenen (2 Paare und 2 Einzelpersonen) im April 2014 im White Elephant."
Negativ bewerten muss ich die Unmöglichkeit der Internet-Nutzung,das WLAN-Signal war einfach zu schwach. Ebenso ein Minus war die Verfügbarkeit von Warmwasser beim Duschen,zwei Personen konnten warm duschen,dann war die Kapazität der Warmwasserboiler bereits erschöpft.,,
Positiv ist jedoch alles andere,das Boot ist gemütlich,sehr sauber,gut ausgestattet von zusätzlichen Bettdecken bis zur Küchenausstattung. Die Heizmöglichkeiten funktionieren sehr gut. Die Lage ist perfekt für Stadterkundungen,alles ist gut zu Fuß erreichbar. Es ist ruhig,wir haben alle gut geschlafen
"Ich würde das White Elephnat jederzeit wieder buchen. Die Terrasse mit der Möglichkeit zum Grillen muss im Sommer traumhaft sein.\"",,,,,
13059,11787853,2014-04-15,9583489,Michael,"Pros - This inn was in the perfect spot downtown for us. We were able walk everywhere and save a ton of money on cabs. Faneuil Hall Marketplace/Quincy Market was a 5 minute walk. The aquarium was a little farther down and the convention center was about a 20 to 25 minute walk as well. There is SO much to do and see downtown, and a lot of it is within a 30 minute walking radius of the boat."
The boat itself was cozy and comfortable. The master bed was very good quality and I had no trouble sleeping which I was surprised since this was my first time sleeping on a boat. The amenities were great other than two of them which I will discuss later. The boat had everything we needed. Stove/refrigerator /TV w/satellite (not that we used it much). Speaking of fridge,there is a REALLY nice grocery store a block away called,"\"\"The Golden Goose\"\". They had everything we needed there as well",including alcohol. One evening we all bought steaks and grilled them on the deck of the ship.,,
Cons - The internet and water heaters. The internet just didn't work. Mostly because Sleepafloat has numerous boats at this wharf and they share an internet connection. The router wasn't on our boat but a couple boats down. The problem was signal strength. We didn't have internet the entire trip,even after calling maintenance to fix it.,,,,
The hot water was laughable. It lasted maybe 5 minutes and for a boat that holds 10 people that's pretty ridiculous. I have seen other comments about this in the other reviews and am surprised that they haven't fixed this. There are two showers and there SEEMED to be two different water heaters,BUT neither of them were working well.,,,,
But like I said,the overall experience of this boat was a great one. What makes this such a great deal is the amount of people that can fit in it,and the location. Location location location.,,,
After a 5 night stay,"I would recommend anybody staying in downtown Boston to give this a try.\"",,,,
13059,13595334,2014-06-01,14754,Isaac,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying at a place in Boston that was a little off-the-beaten-path. The White Elephant, in fact, was not really on any path, but it was still close to everything we needed access to, including the North End, Downtown, and the T. Inside it was very spacious and comfortable, with large windows and enough space to comfortably sleep 6-10 people. Two of the beds were in fact a little short someone taller than 6'1\""
13059,14148977,2014-06-13,10591137,Jossie,"What a fantastic stay!! My colleagues and I stayed at the White Elephant Inn during a conference at the BCEC in Boston as a way to save money on our nonprofit budget--it worked out beautifully! The layout is a little unconventional for a business trip (some rooms you need to walk through to get to other rooms) but all in all, it was an extremely comfortable and unique way to relax before/after conference hours--the deck was stunning and the kitchen had everything we needed. WiFi worked most of the time and hot water wasn't too bad (saw it mentioned in other posts). The rocking was gentle most of the time, but could get a little rougher depending on the barges going by or any rough weather--noone got seasick though. As a former Bostonian, the location was unbeatable--easy walking access to downtown and a quick T ride or UberX ride away from any meetings. Plus, the site manager, John, was available 24/7 and helped answer any questions quickly and with enthusiasm. Finally, two of our colleagues hopped right off the boat and into a Water Taxi right to Logan airport at the end of the trip--amazing send off! We'll definitely consider a houseboat for the next conference."
13059,17736147,2014-08-17,10230691,Olivier,"We really enjoyed the White Elephant : it was very spacious and confortable (7 persons family), and very well located. We took advantage of the roof top. John was very help full and nice. Thank you very much for all !"
13059,30982681,2015-04-30,28123724,Claudia,"This boathouse is a magical place. Very well located (less than 5 min to the Aquarium T station), in a calm neighborhood very close to the historical sites in Boston, with plenty of restaurant options a few blocks away. The boat itself was very clean and well kept. Very cosy place to stay. We were there as a group of colleagues for a conference and it worked out fine (despite the fact that you have to go through other people's room in order to access the upstairs bathroom, second upstairs bedroom and the deck). We all enjoyed our stay very much!"
13059,40886234,2015-08-03,20805121,Michael,"Wonderful experience!!! Bob and the team that managed the rental were responsive, helpful and helped us get onto the boat without any trouble."
The boat was exactly as advertised,if not even better than expected.,,,,
It is located in the best part of the marina with easy access to the entire city.,,,,,
I'd highly recommend this if you have a big group and are looking for something less traditional that is right on the water,has a Roofdeck,"and access to the entire city at a very reasonable price. \"",,,
13059,86279151,2016-07-15,53268321,Janell,"My husband, friends and I just returned from our stay on the White Elephant and it was AWESOME.  I had some initial hesitations - would the rocking bother us?  Answer... no, it actually made my husband sleep like a baby.  Would there be enough hot water to handle 5 showers per day? Answer... absolutely (and there was great pressure too!).  Would it smell like a fishy boat?  Answer... not at all.   Would the ceilings be too low to comfortably accommodate our 6' friend?   Answer... nope.  Would the parking at Lewis Wharf be as bad as the Yelp reviews suggest?  Answer... definitely not, perfect parking."
David The Boat Manager greeted us in the parking lot,helped us with our luggage (it is a challenge to get the luggage from the lot to the boat - think cobblestones,bricks,pebble paths,gangplank,floating docks)
The boat is on the end of the dock so the views of the harbor are unobstructed.  We watched everything from giant cargo ships to clippers to yachts to pleasure boats pass every night.  We watched the sun set and planes take off (Logan's across the way).   We had dinner up there too - nothing better.,,,,,
And then there is the location... we were 2 blocks from the fabulousness that is the North End,a few more blocks from all things historic,and around the corner from the aquarium and the T.,,,
Overall this was a fantastic experience.  This boat is not the prettiest on the dock,but we love him and if/when we return to Boston,"this will be the very first place we look to stay.  I can't imagine doing it any other way.\"",,,

14125957,93596555,2016-08-13,31246985,Cynthia,Mary is the best! What an amazing Boston Airbnb experience!
Mary was an absolute pleasure,easy to communicate with and graciously allowed us early check-in. My husband and I were celebrating a mini-honeymoon and she went above and beyond to make our stay SO special. She provided chilled French champagne,yummy sea-salted caramel chocolates and a Boston Red Sox baseball hat with the most amazingly thoughtful card to welcome us. She thought of everything and we appreciated her attention to detail.,,,
Her home in the South End was gorgeous and actually looks better in person,if you can imagine that. The air conditioner worked great,even in the August heat and at the end of a long day,the murphy bed was like sleeping in a cloud and didn't mind at all that it was a pull out. Her 1 bedroom/1 bath was clean,modernly decorated,stocked with everything you'd need and more.
She also took the time to provide a great packet of info about the place,our stay,local spots/recommendations (which we loved AND used). We had a smooth arrival process,stay and easy check out. Really,she always was a quick text away. Bonus,she and her family live in the upstairs flat so anything we needed was quickly provided.
My husband and I loved walking and exploring the South End and adjacent neighborhoods. We walked all over,day and night. It was close to the Freedom trail,Newbury Street,Boston Common and Fenway,and we considered it safe,convenient
Mary's place was INCREDIBLE and she was such a blessing. We are extremely grateful. Thank you,Mary,"for making our Boston stay so AMAZING. :) We were so honored to be your first Airbnb guests and can't wait to stay again.\"",,,
14125957,94258787,2016-08-15,12233769,Adley,We had a wonderful stay at Mary and Mark's place!
The location can't be beat - right in the heart of South End and minutes from Back Bay,Tremont Street,and public transit. The unit was clean and comfortable,and a great selection of amenities was provided (shampoo,soap,coffee). The sparkling rosé on arrival didn't hurt either.
Mary and Mark were both extremely warm and accessible. They know a ton about the area and offered some great recommendations.,,,,,

14125957,94905482,2016-08-17,34735234,Petra,"We absolutely loved staying at this charming studio. Mary was the best host you could ask for. She was totally flexible with our schedule, including our train delays on arrival, and made us feel so comfortable and welcome when we arrived. She went above and beyond our expectations. The unit itself is a great space. We were only there for two nights, and didn't spend much time in the apartment, but felt right at home when we were there. Mary had great restaurant and activity suggestions, and truly wanted to show us the best Boston has to offer. She wanted us to love her home city as much as she clearly does. Boston is an incredible, vibrant, historically and culturally rich city and we only wished we could have stayed longer. We will definitely be back, and hopefully will be able to stay here again!"

14125957,98065280,2016-08-29,2222759,Tanya,"Hands down the nicest host I have ever experienced on Airbnb. There was wine and truffles left for us as well as a jar of fresh soaps and bath salts. The extra touches made us feel so comfortable. Speaking of comfortable ... that bed was so so so so wonderful. Jealous I don't have a bed that nice at home. With that being said there was one drawback and that is, you are in a garden apartment (bottom floor), and I could hear walking back and forth all morning that made it hard to sleep in. At one point I thought that they were bowling upstairs but then after meeting their dog I realize he was most likely the culprit. I would definitely stay again, but being a light sleeper bring ear plugs. Totally worth it for the space."
14125957,98445763,2016-08-31,61416327,Shannon,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying here at this quaint Back Bay home during our wonderful trip to one of our favourite US cities, Boston."
Not only is it in a fantastic location but Mary & Mark were very accommodating and frankly amazing hosts... the kind that you know are there and always ready to help but completely respective of your own space - we didn't even see them again after check in but it felt like they were right by your side if you need them.,,,,,
Mary was exceptionally responsive and helpful and had an extensive list of information and recommendations for us to chose from which did not disappoint.,,,,,
This flat is so sweet and as everyone else says,even nicer than the photos although well represented in them but it does seem larger when you are there. Our only problem was we wish we could have stayed a week! It was equipped with anything you would need or want to stay that long.,,,,
Ease of check in and out was fantastic. We also got around quite easily walking to everywhere we went including,Fenway and the Waterfront and North end but using Uber a few times was inexpensive and a breeze from this location which has a great little wine shop on the corner and lots of restaurants and conveniences very close by.,,,,
We can't wait to come back!,,,,,

Both were incredibly warm, friendly and helpful, graciously accommodating their check in times with our flight schedule and giving us a ton of recommendations to make our trip worthwhile. They have so much knowledge and love for this city and it has been one of my favourite travel experiences so far."
The location can't be beat – my partner and I never had to take any mode of transportation (except for a very short train ride to Cambridge,and even then we enjoyed a beautiful walk back). There were so many great restaurants,cafes,and shopping areas nearby and it was a great way to get a feel for the city. The unit gave us plenty of privacy while still being close enough to the hosts to call for help. The only thing I would've changed is that I wouldn't have packed so many things because the apartment had everything I could need! So much better than a hotel,"I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Boston. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay! \"",
5834413,32775746,2015-05-21,14740639,Marie,"While the apartment was in good condition, this was definitely not one of our best stays. Communication with Kara was poor from the beginning. She gave us a fair price, especially considering that it was one of Boston’s busiest seasons with graduations happening every weekend. However, we had to email the company time and time again just to be given key pick-up information - which we did not receive until we were about to board our international flight to Boston, after a few strongly-worded emails. But it didn’t end there - once we showed up at the address we were given, we had to discover for ourselves that we had to go to the front-desk of another building to pick up the keys. Toward the end of our stay, the elevators were out of service for hours at a time, and our apartment was on the 10th floor. The building staff was completely clueless and apathetically unhelpful when that happened. We weren’t sure we wouldn’t be forced to lug hundreds of pounds of luggage down 10 flights of steps at 5AM to catch our flight back home. We're glad we were able to find somewhere priced somewhat fairly to stay for our daughter’s graduation, but honestly, it was more trouble than it was worth. We don’t know whether it was a busy time for the company, or if we were just plain out of luck, but we think we’ll find somewhere else to stay next time we're in town."

Our flight to Boston was delayed and we arrived at midnight on the 4th of July but I had been sent contact numbers for the porters in the block and they were great,they took us to the apartment it was no trouble.,,,,

13622776,88414783,2016-07-24,44207196,Betsy,Brenda and Gino are the consummate hosts. They are made us feel welcome and even stocked the refrigerator! The three room apartment is perfect and the photos don't do it justice. It's spotless and comfortable. It's a five minute walk to the T station which is the way to travel in and out of Boston. The apartment is also a short walk to Adams Village where there are restaurants and other stores. Check out the Ashmont Grill.

Carissa was away when my friend and I stayed at her place and was still able to answer all my questions timely and fully. She was a great host even from afar! In addition, her apartment was cozy, comfortable, and unique. The two cats living in her place were absolutely adorable and loved attention (which was awesome for a cat lover like me). I highly recommend Carissa's Airbnb, you won't regret it!"
3589869,85232413,2016-07-10,78571581,Annalena,In the apartment it was very dirty .
we walked in and there instincts to rotten melon .,,,,,
the sink was full of dirty dishes.,,,,,
the microwave and mini oven were dirty you could make it nothing to eat.,,,,,
on the herd was a coffeepot with moldy coffee.,,,,,
"on the first day of our \"\"vacation\"\" we first had to make everything clean that we can feel comfortable.",,,,,
carissa wanted the city to show us what to do something .,,,,,
But in the week she was not at home,"and when they came home she was for days in her room she only came out to make himself something to eat and dishes piled up again.\"",,,,
3765014,17536883,2014-08-13,19372217,Nuria,Orchid is a nice person and my room was large and comfortable.
It is not the most beautiful zone in Boston but it is really close to the T red line and it is easy to reach the center. There is a huge supermarket 5 min walking.,,,,,
You can also take a beer with other hosts or go to Panchi's,"an irish pub 5 min walking.\"",,,,
3765014,21093175,2014-10-11,3523099,Marco,"Overall the place was ok for a couple of days. The best things were the low price and the location: the subway station is very close and is very easy from there to reach the city center. However, the room was very cold and a mouse came visiting me. Very discreet but still...I don't think was because of the dirty, the room was quite clean. Most probably the house is just old."
The bathroom also wasn't very nice because of molds growing in some corners.,,,,,
In general I would say is up to you: if you wanna save money or you prefer to stay in a nice place.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
3765014,21803381,2014-10-24,16143686,Laramie,"The owner is very nice and place was very clean when I arrived. That being said, there is a mouse that will visit you. haha I stayed for a week and it was sitting on top of my luggage when I woke up in the morning. The man who was cleaning also left the gas on in the kitchen after he was done. These things aren't the owners fault, but you should consider them when looking to stay here."
3765014,31034240,2015-05-01,27317995,Nitchakarn,"Orchid is very helpful. Great location! Only 5 minute walk from JFK/UMass T. The house is a little bit old but clean. Overall, it's appropriate for the price. The bed is quite uncomfortable, but it's OK if you stay for only a couple of days."
3765014,33789090,2015-06-01,13584794,Diego,"I never met Orchid, but met with the property manager (an older Chinese man) who was very thorough explaining everything. I was in constant communication with Orchid and she was very attentive."
The location was great and very close to the T.,,,,,
I stayed for a week for a conference so it was mainly to sleep.,,,,,
The picture of the room is accurate,the other pictures of the outside area is about 1/2 a mile away.,,,,
Pros:,,,,,
-Good price,,,,,
-Close to the T,,,,,
-Use of kitchen and kitchenware.,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
-Dirty( floor,counters),,,,
"-A little noisy due to front door being slammed by people coming in and out of the building(not the owner's fault!)\"",,,,,
3765014,34653464,2015-06-10,17163682,Jonny,"It's very spartan. A bed in a room. A desk. A shared bathroom and fridge. It was all I needed for the conference, the price was right, and I was only there to sleep, so I was pleased enough. It's close to the T and a quick Uber to downtown or the conference centre. My only hesitation in recommending it would be that a towel and a top sheet on the bed  would have been nice (it was just a bottom sheet, pillowcase, and two blankets). But if you're not too dainty it will be just fine."
3765014,39294896,2015-07-22,35444044,Deborah,"The room: The description of the room was quite correct (only a bed and a desk in there) besides the fact that the apartment was dirty and stinking. They also did not mention huge ants (2cm) running around in the room and on the bed. The bed is not a real bed, this is a wrong statement - it was only stapled old mattresses. The bathroom was very dirty and you could not enter it without flip flops. The kitchen was alright in terms of equipment and size, however the trash was not emptied which is why it stank horribly in the apartment. All in all I was worried I would catch an infection staying there."
My host did not respond to my emails one day before I arrived and did not respond to two of my calls on the day of check in. So I was waiting in the heat in front on the porch until a neighbor was so nice to give me water and call him again,when he finally showed up. He explained me how to get to the metro,which was nice but he did not have a city map or other recommendations for Boston. After the check in I never saw him again.,,,
The neighborhood is run down and I did not feel safe walking home alone when it was dark. However it is conveniently located next to the metro - only 5 minutes walk so it is a short risk of being subject to crime.,,,,,
What was lovely was that it is also close to the beach (even though the host said it would not be able to go there - incorrect),so you can have a nice run at a very beautiful scenery.,,,,
You do not get to see the host besides the check in,he seems to rent out the whole apartment to people through Airbnb,"but I barely saw anyone so it was nice to have some solitude when I was in the apartment.\"",,,
3765014,40673733,2015-08-01,14298383,Paulo,"The owners are very helpful and you can reach them easily. Great location! Few minutes walk from JFK station. Overall, it's appropriate for the price."
3765014,90577705,2016-08-01,82580630,Guillermo Andrés,Se trata de una habitación sencilla pero suficiente para un viaje corto o de trabajo.
Inicialmente no supe que esperar del barrio sin embargo descubrí que es tranquilo,"bien ilumanado y muy cerca del transporte publico. \"",,,,
6261296,33203250,2015-05-25,32104962,Saty,Jane is an amazing host and really looked after me. She helped to show us around the city centre and gave us a good run down of the local eateries sites. The room we had was lovely and my stay with her was the bees knees times three !!
6261296,34476086,2015-06-08,31860676,Nathan,Clean.  Quiet.  Peaceful.  Perfect.
Jane and her family are exemplary hosts.  They epitomize what AirBnB should be about - real,heartfelt hospitality.,,,,
The pictures are honest representations,but the ad undersells how great this neighborhood is: very safe,quiet - a small-town feel in the middle of a bustling metropolis.  The area is very walkable with safe streets and everything you need nearby.  And it is an excellent location for navigating Boston.,,,
House rules are minimal and just about respecting your hosts.  Do so and you will find that you feel like you are part of the family.,,,,,
I travel very often for work,almost always with extended stays,and I stay at a lot of different places with varying levels of quality.  The stay here was honestly the closest I have felt to being 'home' while I have been on the road in the last ten years.  And I was able to accomplish a lot because of the quiet neighborhood and the bright,comfortable room.,,
Other things people want to know:,,,,,
1) Classic older home,lots of character,great wood floors,well appointed.,,
2) Fridge space available,but why cook when they have a host of excellent restaurants a 5-10 minute walk away?,,,,
3) Shower - pressure excellent,plenty of hot water.,,,,
4) Laundry - functional and available.,,,,,
5) Jane and her parents - very kind and available to talk,and quick to make recommendations if requested - and point you in the right direction.,,,,
The most important question: Would I stay again?,,,,,
I am very picky,and I can wholeheartedly recommend this room and these hosts.  I would definitely stay again.  I would love to come back and stay again.  Whenever I am next in the Boston area,I am going to see if this room is available.  In my opinion,Jane is undercharging what the market in this area would bear.,,
If you're looking in Boston,"do yourself a favor and stay here.  This place is 'Top Shelf.'\"",,,,
6261296,34593469,2015-06-09,34942162,Cameron,"Jane was super hospitable and their family welcoming. The house is charming in a very cute, safe, and quiet neighborhood. I only planned on staying one night, but it was so pleasant... I extended a day."

I would highly recommend this host for anyone visiting Boston or the Brookline/Roxbury areas."
6261296,40753087,2015-08-02,34741660,Nuanphan,"I was blessed to find a very good spot in Boston. I had spent 5 weeks here. Jane and her parents were considerate, very kind, caring, generous and easy going. They made me feel like I was a family member. They kept asking what they could do to help me. Jane's mum always drove me to buy things and to the church. If I came home late, Jane's mom was always waiting for me with prepared dinner. They took me everywhere such as park, museum, swimming pool, shopping, fruit picking, etc. My packed lunch was also prepared. They always did not accept my payment. They were open minded and always listened."
The neighbourhood area was beautiful,quiet with friendly people and very safe. I always came back in the dark at night.,,,,
It was convenient and about 5 minutes walk to bus stop.,,,,,
The house was beautifully decorated with cosy backyard and an umbrella.,,,,,
"I really felt that this place was my home. It was so difficult to leave them. I am very sure that I must come back to see them again.\"",,,,,

6261296,91874743,2016-08-07,50563885,Heng,"房子所在区域安全,宁静,生活交通非常便利。房东夫妇热情好客,细心周到。接近所能的让我们感受到如回到自己家里一般的自然和舒适。Yedan早在我们去之前,就为我们提前申请了形式多样,丰富精彩的周末活动门票,如博物馆,动物园等门票以及社区游泳卡。Yedan的先生在抵达的第一天开车带我们熟悉周边的居住环境,便利设施,以及孩子参加夏令营的学校位置,最后离开的当天还亲自驾车送我们前往机场,给我们带来了极大的便利。房东的女儿Jane也是热情好客的好姑娘,赠予我们棒球比赛门票,陪同我们出行……。总之这是非常友善,热情,好客的一家,这是难忘,舒适的入住经历,强力推荐给还在犹豫的选房人。"
6261296,98378243,2016-08-30,79421529,Mike And Carol,"The family was very welcoming and friendly and went out of their way for us. The neighbourhood is quiet and safe, there is good public transport into Boston, supermarket and shops are close by.  Very accurate listing, room spacious and comfortable. Really appreciated the AC. When we visit our son, who lives close by, we will be using this accommodation again. Highly recommended."
11036835,62297357,2016-02-13,57276951,Michael,The room is very nice. It's large and the bed is very comfortable.
The apartment itself is also well kept and has a large,clean bathroom.,,,,

6759004,51545243,2015-10-21,22156432,Yasmin,"The apartment was as described. Alicia was very responsive during the booking process and even after we arrived. We had a minor issue and maintenance came in and fixed it at the same day. All housing instructions were clear and accurate. The location is close to everything and very accessible by the T, it deserves every penny spent."
The only catch here is that the bathroom has no attachments to keep a soap,a toothbrush or toothpaste by the sink. We had to keep all our belongings outside the bathroom and take them in when we're going in.,,,,
One more thing is that the apartment is on the fourth floor. We knew about the stairs before hand,but we did not expect it to be that tough of an exercise.,,,,
All in all,"it was a great experience and we would do it again.\"",,,,

The bed,complete with nice linen was very comfortable  which was very welcome after our long fight.   There was  everything you would need for your stay in the kitchen and bathroom  even down to an abundance of hangers.   The position of the apartment is perfect being walking distance to the commons and a lot of Boston's tourist attractions with a subway two minutes away for those who want.   The concierge staff are very helpful.    Our only negative is the apartment backs on to the  freeway and the  railway and the noise at night can be quite intrusive"

The location was fantastic, neat little street on Beacon Hill, walking distance to everything.  Nice corner store and good restaurants in a couple of blocks (try the Kangaroo at Tip Tap).

6778788,37379640,2015-07-06,27014647,Sandy,"Emily was a great host and made us feel very welcome. Our train was an hour late but she didn't at all seem frustrated. She gave us a tour of the apartment and suggested things to do in town. The apartment was very clean and organized, not to mention beautiful. I stayed there with a friend and there was plenty of room for the two of us. The apartment is very conveniently located, 4 blocks away from Charles street (shopping and dinning) and 4 blocks away from Charles river. You can also take an uber for less than $10 to get to all major attractions."
6778788,39408274,2015-07-23,14389036,Zoé,"It was really great to stay in Emily's flat. The place is lovely, and beacon Hill too. Emily is a really And convinient to do the Check in. Thank you again!"

6778788,44947221,2015-08-30,6779173,Camille,"Perfect spot to enjoy downtown Boston. Comfortable, quiet, and extremely clean. Emily was easy to reach and key handoff couldn't have been simpler."
6778788,46144544,2015-09-08,8241000,Camille,Emily was a great host and the apartment was lovely and very clean. The area is beautiful and has everything you would need walking distance. The neighbourhood is such a pleasure to walk through and if you want to see other things then Charles Station is a 5 minutes walk from the apartment and I was impressed with Boston’s Transit System. I found that most of the tourist attractions were walkable and the location was ideal for a traveller. I spent a lot of time discovering this neighbourhood which was a gem and attraction on its own. Overall based on my experience I would strongly Emily’s abode!
6778788,48873116,2015-09-29,37087524,Kimberly,"Beautiful neighborhood and a minute's walk from coffee shops and eateries, as well as some fun boutique shopping. When we arrived, Emily was at work so she had someone meet us at her lovely apartment--which was so considerate, seeing that we did not want to haul luggage around all day! A much more relaxed approach to travel than check in and check out times at hotels--  a lovely area of Boston-close to anything and everything."

We could easily walk or hire bikes (the city has \"\"Hubway\"\" bikes) and ride where we wanted to go. It was great to have the full kitchen so we could make dinner a couple of nights. There were also some nice restaurants not too far away."
Just keep in mind that Beacon Hill is a hill,"so you will have to walk up a couple of blocks from the main road to get to her house.\"",,,,

The apartment was clean, well-stocked with blankets and heaters (this is Boston in January!), and ready-to-go. No food stocked, but there was a Whole Foods just a couple of blocks away."

6778788,72486164,2016-05-02,2483808,Dawn,"Emily's Beacon Hill pad is an airbnb GEM. Lucky you if you get to stay there! From its well-applianced kitchen to its plush and world's-comfiest bed (!) you'll find comfort in every corner of this three-room space. The butcher block in the kitchen is a great place to set up a control center if you're in Boston on business, like I was, or to enjoy tasty meals ordered in, like I did. Emily was gracious when my flight was delayed overnight, kept in close communication, and rushed over to check me in before she left for work one morning, which had to be inconvenient (not that she led on). Finally, I left something really important IN THE TRASH and Emily agreed to sift through and find it and mail it to me! I can't imagine a better host. I really hope I can book Emily's apartment every time I'm in town."
6778788,73673353,2016-05-09,52270887,Anthony,Emily's apartment was a great central location for a weekend trip to Boston. The charming Beacon Hill location is perfect for sightseeing and walking to anywhere in the city.

6240901,34475783,2015-06-08,33937306,Kathy,Host was very responsive and welcoming. Room was spacious and there was a stock of toiletry items and chilled water bottles. Great location for Northeastern University and access to medical campuses.

6240901,39247759,2015-07-21,3511696,Helen,"The young host was welcoming but the accommodation was best suited to an undergraduate student rather than an adult traveller. Cramped. Dark. Cluttered. Warned to lock and chain door of bedroom. Bathroom cluttered with clothing on a rack. No window blind in the bathroom so no privacy. Unable to determine cleanliness or otherwise of the apartment because of the lack of light in the area. However, as advertised - next door to the museum of Fine Arts. The building is run down and unwelcoming. Weird decor combined with incense smell covering cigarette odour. I felt uncomfortable and unsafe. I was unable to find alternative accommodation due to my late arrival on the first night. Good preparation  possibility consisted of an electric hotplate in the bedroom and a microwave in the wardrobe. Fire risk was minimized by having a fire escape outside the window. Unpleasant accommodation. Not recommended. I should have asked for a photograph. After booking the host apologized saying he had been hacked -however it would appear someone of his friends had added comments to the booking dialogue that I could only describe as obscene. If I wasn't traveling on a strict budget I would have canceled. I have emerged to tell the tale but I honestly thought airbnb had certain standards that could be taken as assured. This experience says differently and I am hesitating to try airbnb again. I feel embarrassed that I actually went ahead and stayed at such inappropriate accommodation. I hope to receive an explanation from airbnb why such accommodation is on their books at a more expensive rate than in NY.  Travellers beware!!!"
6240901,39457191,2015-07-23,18815884,Phillip,"Trevon was a great host! He was very accommodating and hospitable. The toiletries and bottled water were great. Place is as described and conveniently located next to the museum of fine arts and the T line. If I come back to boston, I will definitely contact Trevon."
6240901,39589375,2015-07-24,34065264,Alon,"Trevon was nice when I arrived to his place, he showed me the room that was clean and nice and with many things incase I'll need and I liked it."
The only thing that I think he need to change is to put more light because it was to dark for me,"regardless to that it was great.\"",,,,
6240901,39862791,2015-07-26,10264490,Lu,"The room really has its style! I like the music, the scent, the buddhism decorations and the cute lucky cat. Everything is clean and comfortable. Also it's convenient, right at the MFA station. Can't be better."
The host is also nice. I arrived quite late that day,"but Trevon waited for me till midnight. Thank you so much :)\"",,,,
6240901,40517992,2015-07-31,20864084,Corinn,Very convenient location! Close to the T and downtown Boston
6240901,40698419,2015-08-01,39971526,Kristen,"Trevon was a wonderful host!  He greeted me when I arrived and showed me around the apartment.  The room was clean, comfortable, and stocked with cold water.  Trevon had relaxing music playing in the background which created a calming atmosphere. The location was amazing!  Right next door to an art museum and walking distance to Fenway (I even got to see a Red Sox game while I was there).  Great opportunity if you are in the area!"
6240901,41457643,2015-08-07,28590129,Howie,"Trevon does a great job describing and providing his place.  It is very private and stylish.  I had a great stay.  If you are looking for a room with great value in this popular area of Boston, I recommend Trevon's place highly."
6240901,42574568,2015-08-14,10931420,Cynthia,"I booked this room for 5 days because I was going to a workshop very close by.  Boston is expensive, so would tolerate a lot not to spend on those pricey hotels.  The apartment did feel very cramped, dark, with a spooky vibe.  Again, I was going to tolerate all this for the price and convenience. On the second night I saw a mouse.  That did it for me. Next day I found other accommodations.  I asked for a two night reimbursement, which Trevon did immediately.  FYI, I found a great airbnb in Newton Center, which is a 10 minute T ride to the Fenway area.  Wish I had known about that earlier."
6240901,42700362,2015-08-15,18361205,Matt,"Trevon promptly greeted me at the door and buzzed me up to his apartment, and went over the amenities and handed me the keys.  I didn't spend much time in the room as I was there for tourism and was out and about all evening and the next morning."
The listing makes it pretty obvious what you're getting here - a spare bedroom in an apartment building clearly designed for student-types.  All I needed was a comfy bed to sleep in and a place to put my bags.  Trevon gave me that,plus a cold bottle of water right when I needed it - so that makes him a winner in my book.  People who are looking for a five star resort experience should,you know,go book a five star resort (and be prepared to pay five star resort prices).  As far as I'm concerned,"Trevon's place is exactly what AirBNB is designed for - providing extra options to those of us who aren't very needy or on a budget or won't be spending much time in the room.\"",
6240901,42945168,2015-08-16,63200,Christina,Trevon was a really nice host - very helpful with arrival time and directions. The neighborhood was really convenient to public transport. The room was efficient for our quick stay in Boston. The only downside for me was the strong smell of smoke in the apartment - although this may not be a problem for everyone.
6240901,43455675,2015-08-19,26237874,Qianyi,The room is perfect and location awesome. Great place to stay in Boston. Right at a subway station. Reaching everywhere with maximum convenience.
6240901,43521719,2015-08-20,35155522,Michael,"Excellent! My wife and I needed a place to stay for a long layover in Boston and wanted to catch a Redsox game while in town. Trevon was very welcoming - clean and private lockable room, toiletries, cold water... exactly what we needed. He responded to our questions instantly. And the walk to the ballpark was under 15 minutes. Will stay again if available next time coming through."
6240901,44031514,2015-08-23,36474893,可欣,He is a reaaaaaally nice person. And the place is clean and close to everywhere. He also provide bottle waters shampoo body wash bath towels etc.. With a fair price. Highly recommend his place.
6240901,44988425,2015-08-30,35004984,Ying,"An interesting and cozy place! The location is the best that i can think of in Boston. And the price is also Great. The host is a considerate and understanding person. All in all, this is definitely one of the best places of this price."
6240901,45481577,2015-09-03,39012465,Yoshihiro,"Perfect location for Boston MFA, Fenway Park and Boston Symphony within walking distance"
6240901,46486220,2015-09-11,39113101,Delphine,Logement bien situé. Accueil chaleureux. Chambre agréable
6240901,46939511,2015-09-14,42227960,Jack,"The room was perfect for my needs. I was staying for the weekend for a workshop and needed an affordable, clean, and comfortable place to stay. It is exactly as advertised, not the Ritz, but perfect for people on a budget looking for a good place to crash and relax. The location was fantastic. Right next to the T stop and in a very cool area. Super convenient to all parts of the city."
6240901,47831650,2015-09-21,3702167,Sheri,I didn't even see trevon but it was cool cause I had a private safe and comfortable place to stay and he gave me instructions to be self sufficient. The neighborhood is perfect and it was a breeze to stay there.
6240901,48002096,2015-09-22,41118019,Kelly,"I was in Boston for my first Red Sox game and Trevon’s space worked perfectly for me. I’m so grateful, because after facing the sticker-shock of Boston-area hotels, I probably couldn’t have attended a game if not for this option! I wanted something within walking distance of Fenway and his place is. I believe his description of this convenient room in the city is accurate. I found the room private and comfortable and the décor appealing and relaxing. Trevon is very friendly and outgoing. He’s also a great, responsive communicator who assisted me in advance with questions about parking. I surprised him by arriving a little earlier than anticipated (thanks to my parking being actually easier than expected), and he was still very welcoming. I was able to organize my car/luggage etc. while he finished getting the room in order. I recommend this room for travelers looking for a great location and good value."
6240901,48201781,2015-09-24,14244726,Jenny,Trevon lives in a GREAT area directly across the street from the T and next to the Museum of Fine Arts. He made us feel very welcome but also made it clear that he would leave us to enjoy his space and Boston.
6240901,48412371,2015-09-26,18775703,Laura,"Trevon's place was exactly as described. Easy check in and check out and a comfy bed and room after a busy day exploring Boston. Trevon was easy to communicate with and quick to respond to any questions that we had. I would definitely recommend for others needing a cheap place to stay in Boston, the location is perfect."
6240901,48679282,2015-09-28,25794454,Niels,The place is conveniently located near Fenway Park and the museum of fine arts. And the Green Line is literally just steps away. Trevon was there when I arrived and made me feel welcome and was available if I needed any help. The place is perfect for short stay (I only spent 2 nights) Room is private and you have your own keys.
6240901,49063999,2015-09-30,555694,Prakhar,The place was perfect for my short trip to boston. The city is insanely expensive and Trevon's place is perfect to avoid going broke.
I did not know you could fit so many things in a room. It has everything you need - bed,A/C,nice music on the TV when you walk in,water both cold and at room temp (very thoughtful!),extra key,microwave
"Thanks Trevon!\"",,,,,
6240901,49832011,2015-10-06,24461246,Jim,Great and as advertised. Good convenient location
6240901,50241570,2015-10-10,32485662,Alessandro,"Trevon's room was perfect for my needs. Clean, independent and in a great location. My flight was a late, and i checked in at almost 23.00 o clock, but Trevon was great about  it and showed me everything i needed to know about the apartment. Super recommended"
6240901,50636701,2015-10-13,10704759,Alex,I can't recommend staying at Trevor's place. The room is cramped and the floor and halls are not clean. A lot of noise from other rooms.
6240901,50856083,2015-10-15,39617740,Alexandra,"Comprehensive directions/instruction and connection before visit.  Room as described, neighborhood fine.  Very convenient to a meeting in the Longwood area."
6240901,50999557,2015-10-16,28590129,Howie,"This is my second time staying at Trevon's.  Great location, great value, great privacy and Trevon does a nice job of setting up the room... class job."
6240901,51283300,2015-10-19,7185959,Barb,Fantastic location - really can't be beat.  Comfortable bed and quiet room.  Didn't see much of Trevon but he was there if I had a question.  I'll stay with him again!
6240901,51519591,2015-10-20,32243921,Albert,I loved how peaceful the room was. It showed a lot of care was taken to make sure the guest felt welcome. The music upon entrance was a great touch!
6240901,51857200,2015-10-24,46977403,Nick,"Room was as listed, very cozy and comfortable, there was everything we needed and even a fridge full of water! The room smelled nice as well. The only down side was that it took a little longer to get into the room, also the bathroom was a little dirty but not really deal breakers for me. The location was amazing, the T is right outside and there are restaurants and other places close by. I will definitely be back if I need a place to stay in Boston!"
6240901,53058977,2015-11-04,1138186,Cicely,"If you don't mind smoking in the house, cigarettes and other stuff, then maybe you won't mind staying here. If you don't mind buying your own cleaning supplies to tidy up a very dirty, pee-riddled, bathroom, then maybe Trevon's is a decent place. He does provide a comfortable bed, fridge, water, tv, etc. I did not interact much with Trevon, so I can't speak to his friendliness."
Basically,he has a spare room,he does not do much to make it feel like a clean place. You are staying in his apartment,and he lives the way he wants to live--like,if it's yellow let it mellow :(,
If I could have quit and gone somewhere else,I would have.,,,,
"He also seemed to have people over every day. I felt weird there and would not recommend it. \"",,,,,
6240901,53237321,2015-11-06,8214532,Rob,Trevon was engaging and accommodating. The room was private and practical and a great location near green line T(train) and MFA (Museum Fine Arts).
6240901,53803155,2015-11-12,48724428,Kathy,Very satisfying experience. Nice room decoration! will definitely recommend it to my friends
6240901,54183493,2015-11-16,16224002,Carolyn,"Listing was accurate. I didn't spend a ton of time at the apartment, as I just needed a place to sleep between my touristy things. I love that Trevon gives you your own set of keys, and that there are two locks on the door. It makes a girl feel safer as she is traveling alone."
This is NOT the Ritz,ya'll,and despite the neighborhood,this may not be the fanciest,nicest building. If you're sensitive to smoke,don't stay here. Staying at Trevon's felt like staying with my brother. I had my privacy
I was woken up about 4:30 am by loud talking in the other room,so that put a little damper on the next day,but I talk to him about it and he assured me it wouldn't happen again. And it didn't! Thanks!,,,
"The relaxing music helped me sleep through the night by drowning out any little noises that would normally keep me up. (My brain doesn't love new environments.) \"",,,,,
6240901,54503842,2015-11-21,20663688,Min,"Pros: great location, green line train stop right in front of the apartment building. Host provides a fridge with bottled water in the room."
Cons: strong cigarette smell. My throat felt like it was closing the entire time I stayed there. All my clothes were covered with the cigarette odor.,,,,,
Warns: on the day I checked out,Trevon was yelling and cursing loudly with someone in the next room for about 30 minutes. This argument was so intensified that I even thought about calling 911. But I was afraid my schedule had to be delayed if I got involved since I needed to catch the flight. Instead,I left the key,"and sneaked out of the apartment as soon as possible. This is so far the worst Airbnb experience I have ever had.     \"",,
6240901,55086606,2015-11-27,30546141,Mark,"\"OMG. Impossible to put into words how good it was for me. Exactly what I needed, when I needed it, over the Thanksgiving Holiday away from friends and family. Quirky. Artistic. Multicultural. Transcultural. There I was surrounded by the environment, the beauty and sounds and scents of the room, swimming in the artistic landscape just steps from his front door. The MFA, the steps of the New England Conservatory where my kid took cello and where Dr King met future wife and NEC student Coretta Scott, all thanks to a woman at the nearby 12th Baptist Church who made the match. I felt, like the black tea bags Trevon provides, steeped in goodness. Essential. Essence. I fear his place will be so booked up I will never get back. Whatever. It is \"\"a trip\"\""
6240901,55123804,2015-11-28,7684284,Theresa,"Trevon's apartment was perfect for what I needed - I came to Boston just to see an exhibit at the MFA, which was NEXT DOOR, and didn't want to spend a lot of time trying to get to the museum (that said, the Green E line is outside his front door, so you can't get much more convenient than that)."
Trevon's place was also exactly as advertised!  The check-in and check-out process was perfectly smooth - Trevon was there to welcome me.  I very much appreciated the extra touches like a fan in the window,soothing music and toiletries since,oddly,I had forgotten my toothbrush.  The bed must have been comfortable as I slept like a log for 10 hours!,,
"\"",,,,,
6240901,55842545,2015-12-06,14519582,Kevin,The room was exactly as described. I would definitely stay here again. The location was very convenient.
6240901,56686177,2015-12-16,47945339,Alexander,Overall a good experience for those travelling on a budget.
6240901,56826497,2015-12-18,9008834,Jaime,The place was great and the location is fantastic. Trevon is also generous and the place has a good vibe. I was there for two nights and was exactly what I was looking for.
6240901,59296929,2016-01-09,4150297,Aamir,Nice place and very central to most things. I even found free overnight parking right downstairs. Recommended for short (2-3) stay. Trevon was very helpful and responsive.
6240901,59585698,2016-01-12,50959433,Lizette,"Several pros to this place, first being that for Boston it is incredibly affordable and in a great location (literally right next door to the museum of fine arts). Free wifi and I'm assuming cable (however the cable was wasn't working during my stay, which I didn't really care about). Trevon pretty much stays out of your way, gives you your privacy but is also responsive in case you need anything. In your room you can find water, a mini fridge, a portable stove top, a towel and some toiletries."
Now there are also some cons which may or may not be a big deal to some but for me I found this to be a deal breaker (wont be staying here again). The biggest being that the bathroom is disgusting. I'm talking pee stains on the toilet seat,hair everywhere,in the sink,on the window curtain,on the toilet etc. (seems Trevon shaves and does not clean up after himself). The bathroom is seriously grimy everywhere. I doubt Trevon cleans it- ever. It was so bad that I avoided using it unless absolutely necessary. I also didn't shower in there and resorted to stick it out until I left. THAT bad. I understand this isn't the Ritz but c'mon,basic hygiene and cleanliness is not a luxury it's a necessity and should be practiced especially if your hosting folks who are paying for this professional service. The apt also strongly smells of cigarette smoke and Trevon can get pretty loud / seems to have people over every day (although it's his place so he's obviously allowed to do as he likes).
"So there you have it folks- stay at your own discretion. \"",,,,,
6240901,59883974,2016-01-16,11393293,Nancy,Perfect location for a quick layover for me to visit the MFA. Plenty of places to eat and drink in short walking distance. Felt safe which is important for me while traveling the country.
6240901,60822623,2016-01-28,48504448,Samer,The location was great for me I used the green line to get everywhere. The bed was very comfortable and the water and snacks are a good idea. The only problem was that the restroom/bathroom wasn't clean!
6240901,61455684,2016-02-04,13054676,Shaun,"He was friendly.  Great location, convenient prkng. Wld recommend him."
6240901,61681286,2016-02-07,53494614,Fang,"The apartment is in a nice neighborhood, super convenient for sure, with a train station right in front of the building, 10-minute walk from NEC, next door to MFA and Northeastern Univ. The room itself is fine, very exotically decorated which I found interesting. YET, the bathroom was horrible. It was extremely clear that no one had ever cleaned it in a long time. The toilet was so filthy, the basin had plenty of old shaved-off beard on it plus a used  cotton bud...... I wouldn't even mention the floor... Anyways, I'm glad I'm only staying for one night."
6240901,63684712,2016-02-25,48176547,Huan,The host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6240901,63727825,2016-02-26,1355401,Shelly,"I was only in Boston for one night, and honestly this place was great! The room was cute and comfy, it had all the things I needed in one night (shower, wifi, sleep). I thought the bathroom was okay, was clean for me. I ran into the host unintentionally, and they were very nice throughout the entire process. The T train is also LITERALLY in front of the entrance. It was a great place for the price!"
6240901,64431616,2016-03-04,33719475,Philip,"Yanick is extremely accommodating. My plane was an hour and a half late, and I therefore didn't arrive til almost 11pm and he greeted me warmly. The room was exactly what I needed: a comfortable bed right next to the bathroom, and the location of the apartment at the back of the building made it very quiet. It's very convenient to museums (both the Museum of Fine Arts and the Isabella Stewart Gardner), to a trolley stop, and the Longwood Medical District among other things."
6240901,66379722,2016-03-22,52564450,Erin,"Yanick was an amazing host! I was in town for the St. Patrick's Day activities, and stayed here on the night of the parade. After the parade I wasn't feeling too well so I headed to my room. After a nap, I got dinner down the street, and when I got back Yanick gave me some tea and sugar and was more than willing to help me! The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. The room was clean, and the bathroom was right next to it. There is a hot plate, a mini fridge and a microwave. Also, literally across the street from the T, which was fantastic!! Neighborhood was also quiet, which I wasn't expecting because it was parade night. When I go back to Boston I hope this room will be available."
6240901,68197263,2016-04-02,28746038,Joy,"I had a great experience here. The location is very convenient, the room was very comfortable and had a lot of privacy, despite it being a shared apartment. Would definitely recommend."
6240901,69249776,2016-04-10,45946688,卫纲,"The location is very good, just what I want. Yonix is very nice man. but I don't adapt to the smell of the room, bedding looks not clean enough, the mattress is also very bad, I will not have to choose the next."
6240901,69626727,2016-04-12,16614166,Rob,"Location was great.  Room as described,"
bed comfortable and room spacious.  Bathroom not particularly inviting as mentioned in other reviews.  Wouldn't recommend this to a woman for that reason.  With a lot of activity in and out of the apartment,"it did feel a little uncomfortable at times.\"",,,,
6240901,72644303,2016-05-04,67473164,Dan,"This was a good experience overall. The building is about 25 feet from the MFA Green Line stop, which can get you anywhere in Boston. The photograph of that stop is really not an exaggeration. The neighborhood is great -- the art museum is right there, and it's a reasonable walk to Fenway Park and other attractions. Yanick had a process for calling/getting the key that went well. I arrived at a somewhat unusual time (around 3PM on a Wednesday) and there was no problem. The bedroom was clean. The price was honestly pretty good for the location, in comparison to many other options."
On the other hand,the bathroom was a bit icky. Not as bad as a couple of reviews on here have indicated,but definitely on the messier side.,,,
Another thing was the smoking and the noise. There were a few people coming in and out throughout the afternoon and late into the evening. I went to sleep around midnight,and at that point there were still 3-4 people in the living room,and at many points the conversation was either very loud,very graphic,or both. I'm not really sure how late this went on,but a light sleeper might have had a problem. There was also a lot of smoke
I would still say it was an overall good experience,"with a responsive host who was easy to coordinate with. Just be aware of the caveats given.\"",,,,
6240901,73232728,2016-05-07,60170377,Frederick,"Yanick provided what he advertised, a comfortable bedroom with access to a shared bathroom in convenient location at a reasonable price.  He respected my privacy and asked me to respected his. He also provide items that may not have been advertised, like bottle water and an iron and ironing board, which were a nice touch.  All and all, I had a pleasant stay."
6240901,76070555,2016-05-24,10834643,Ian,"The place is a very good deal for Boston, which is extremely expensive for hotels. The room is nice and easy to find, I walked downtown and to Cambridge, both of which take a while but are flat and doable, as long as you don't mind walking. Also right next to a train station. The host was very easy to communicate with leading up to the trip. Bathroom was a little bit dirty and could do with a good clean, but it's still a really good deal overall."
6240901,76661968,2016-05-28,42271217,Max,Enjoyed my stay and it's definitely worth the charged price.
Trevon was responsive enough and distant enough to make me have my privacy in a shared apartment.,,,,,
The place was clean enough as well but did felt like a student joint (which is basically is).,,,,,
The location is good,"right next to a green line stop which takes you anywhere and right across the North Eastern so it is relatively quiet.\"",,,,
6240901,77653065,2016-06-02,22494901,Ryan,"The entire apartment smells of strong cigarette smoke despite the countless air fresheners. I was attending a conference and colleagues were commenting on the scent of my clothes. I found a cellphone in my bed (under my pillow) that wasn't mine during the first night, do I have concerns about how/if the room was even prepped for me. The bathroom was almost unusable as the sink had no pressure and the rest was filthy."
Air conditioning was great in the room however,there was definitely privacy,and the location was central. I arrived very late and the host was accommodating.,,,
If cleanliness ranks low and perhaps have another location to brush your teeth,"then this place is for you. I will not be returning.\"",,,,

6240901,84530444,2016-07-07,16489114,Liz,"The host was very nice and the room was private and spacious. Location was perfect for staying a night in Boston. However, the bathroom was very dirty. I think if I were staying more than one night I would've chosen a different place, but it was good for an overnight sightseeing in Boston."
6240901,85367842,2016-07-11,72868457,Itamar,"Host is very nice. On the day I had to check out he didn't have any other guests so he let me stay later than the official checkout time, which was extremely nice and helpful."
"The location of the apartment is absolutely great! right next to the metro line that can take you anywhere in minutes. There is also a bike rental stop next to it. \"",,,,,
6240901,85955146,2016-07-14,30480476,Margaret,Good value. Trevon was a doll helping me find the place and it's very convenient. It's not the Taj Mahal but everything was as advertised and I would definitely stay there again.
6240901,87318340,2016-07-19,25630581,Julia,This listing description is very accurate. Trevon has an amazing location in Boston!!
6240901,87504230,2016-07-20,18212423,Dan,Great location!!! And everything was as described.  Thank you.  Would definitely stay again.
6240901,91041477,2016-08-03,38451719,Zhiwu,因为航班彻底晚到。我只是过去充电 休息了几个小时 就离开了。卫生环境 简直 实在 是对我 简直是个冒险。但是彻夜无眠 后 有地方睡觉又怎么能挑剔呢。
6240901,91459547,2016-08-05,55821542,Kyle,"Trevon was very responsive and welcoming and allowed me to drop my stuff off before check in time. The place is in a great location. The room was not as nice as I expected, particularly the carpet and smell (although all of Boston smelled bad to me)."
6240901,92951225,2016-08-10,58467543,Roger,"The host was very nice, and gracious. I enjoyed our interactions. The location verses price is amazing. Easy walk to so many great places and $6 Uber rides to practically anywhere else."
"The bathroom was not shiny like the pictures lol. I'm a guy so I didn't really care. The room is a little more \"\"end of semester\"\" dorm room-like than the photos show",as well. The host doesn't really need to change their description,the reviews should prepare any prospective guests.,,,
Once again,I didn't really care about the lived in feel that that much. If I were traveling with someone,I probably would have been more picky.,,,
Toiletries were limited to an open tube of toothpaste and various colognes,and a small bottle of shampoo in the shower. Toiletries are at a premium when traveling with only carry on luggage,so I had to buy some. All in all,I'd do it again. Being in this area of Boston for this price is worth making a few concessions.,,
The door broke and I got locked out once,"but he was around the corner and showed up fairly quick.\"",,,,
6240901,93639432,2016-08-13,82285519,Joey,"great location, close to public transportation, and fenway park if you are interested.The room is fine, bathroom needs work and updating."

8309711,68332090,2016-04-04,55898695,Paul,"Great location in the loverly neighbourhood of Beacon Hill. Walkable to the North End district, metro stations, Boston Common and the TD Garden. John was easy going and everything was exactly as promised. Overall, a great deal. A little tight for two couples (mainly in the morning with one bathroom) but certainly for two or three people it was excellent. Overall, a lovely space for this side of Boston."

Ideal pour visiter la ville à pied. John n'était pas présent lors du check in et check out, ce qui n'a pas posé de problème."

The location is probably the best part. It resides in a very chic part of town. I would definitely recommend going for a walk,especially near the University. Plus if you want to venture out,"it's a very short distance to Faneuil Hall and the harbor.\"",,,

La rue est calme. La grosse chaleur nous a un peu freinés pour utiliser le deck mais nous y sommes allés admirer le ciel quand même. Nous avons apprécié la climatisation."
8309711,89851259,2016-07-30,80456933,Kate,"John was a great host! He was available via text or email. He was quick with answers and even had great suggestions on things to do in the area.

The location is in wonderful Beacon Hill,a couple of minutes walk to Charles Street for restaurants & shopping,and 5 minutes to Boston Common.,,,
We were there on the hottest day of the year in Boston,so were very thankful of the air conditioning.  The area is very quiet at night.,,,,
Access to the roof deck is a real bonus,we spent a couple of evenings up there watching the sun set over Boston.,,,,
"Strongly recommended.\"",,,,,
8309711,92280759,2016-08-08,41105357,Kelly,"The pictures of this apartment were very accurate in showing what the apartment was like.  It was clean & fully stocked with linens, dinnerware, etc. It was also very hot during our stay, so the AC was key!  The rooftop was also very nice & relaxing with a nice view."
We absolutely LOVED the location of this apartment.  It was walking distance to grocery stores,restaurants & shops and anything that wasn't walking distance was not hard to get to by Uber.  We also found a parking garage nearby within walking distance.  It was also close enough to walk to the parks nearby.,,,,
John was very friendly,"helpful & responsive during our stay.  We would definitely consider renting this apartment again. It was an overall great experience.\"",,,,

8309711,93689463,2016-08-13,63641272,Penny,The apartment was great.  It is well located and we were given plenty of instructions on how to get in as we didn't meet the host.  We were lucky enough to get a visitor carpark across the road for the weekend.  Parking would have been an issue if it was midweek as the visitor parking is limited to 2 hours.
8309711,94762186,2016-08-16,31528558,Thomas,Lors d'un séjour sur la côte est nous avons fait escale à Boston. La ville est vraiment magnifique. L'appartement est idéalement situé dans le quartier de Beacon Hill et permet d'accéder facilement à toutes les commodités.

9993602,68550746,2016-04-05,52573163,Jeff,"This is a very solid option for a longer term stay in Back Bay.  Location is A+, no more than a two minute walk to the Prudential Center - close enough for all the fun but quiet enough that you aren't disturbed by traffic. The place itself is a clean, well appointed two bedroom apartment on the top floor of a secure building. It's not fancy, the finishes are very Home Depot and the bathroom and beds are nothing to write home about - but it has plenty of room, isn't shabby, is clean and offers a better solution than spending a week in a hotel room.  Clean, comfortable and appropriate."

The host asks to take off your shoes which is not a problem,but the floor was pretty dirty so take flip flops with you or some sort of slippers to avoide white socks become gray. The bed was amazing,she's got a wonderful blanket. I recommend to bring your own towels. I was provided with something resembling wash cloth that had been recently used,"but I asked the host to get me clean ones and those were delivered later. Shower was ok. \"",,

6065674,33121659,2015-05-25,15910985,Thuy-Dien,"My family of 7 and I stayed here for my graduation weekend and it was perfect. The house looks brand new and so elegant and is located in the best area of the cool Jamaica Plain neighborhood! There was ample space for 8 people, the beds were big and comfortable, kitchen was modern and spacious, and everything was very clean. The house is located right near a big pond so my parents were able to go on morning runs and we were able to walk to many great restaurants in that area. We had a car and never had issues finding parking on the street and were able to access downtown Boston within 20 minutes by car."
David,the host,was extremely timely with his responses and addressed our requests promptly. David sent me the check in directions a few days before our arrival,he messaged me the evening of our arrival to make sure everything was okay,and when I asked him for an iron and ironing board,he brought it over within 30 minutes. Other than the initial communication
Our stay here was so wonderful and seamless. The next time my family visits Boston,"I will definitely book this place again. \"",,,,

Jamaica Pond was also beautiful and just a short walk.  There is a Whole Foods and CVS super close, so very convenient if you need to grab basics.  The place was great for our group.  Everything that we needed was included, and the living room was an awesome space to hang out in with a huge TV.  And two full bathrooms was a huge plus.  Another couple we were with said their bed was uncomfortable because it slanted towards the middle, and you could also hear the people upstairs in the morning because we were on the first floor.  But those are small things and really nothing to complain about.  Everyone in our group loved our stay here and we would definitely recommend staying here and would do it again if we ever came back to Boston.  Thanks, David, for a great, clean place to stay!!"

His communication was on point, reaching out to us in advance to make sure we were all set and sending very detailed notes about how to use everything in his apartment. The location was great - wonderful neighborhood in the South End, within very close proximity to Copley Square and the shops on Newbury St. Plus it was only a 15-minute drive from the airport.

Tim was great, beyond what I can fit into this review, and his condo is clean, easy to get to from BOS via public transit, well appointed, quiet neighborhood, and within walking to great eats and major areas of Boston. I walked from there to North End and saw a lot along the way, but I love to walk when exploring new cities, others who don't can easily hail a cab, Uber or get back on the train. All in all when I have another trip to Boston, Tim's unit will be the first place I look for availability."

The apartment is as advertised, is comfortable and is in an excellent location for visiting Boston. We easily walked everywhere and never needed to use public transport for the whole weekend."
2395326,38120447,2015-07-13,9293553,Rose,"Tim was very tolerant of us as the communication was a bit difficult by email because we were in and out of internet range.  We phoned him as we were heading into Boston, for details about the keys. He was super helpful  and it had been all  set up even thought he was not sure whether and when we were arriving. A great location in a  neighbourhood. Quiet with a very comfy bed and nice linens. So nice to be where someone lives  and away from the touristy areas, yet very handy to the sights and transport"
2395326,38642430,2015-07-17,23051616,Jeff,"Hard to imagine a more comfortable, inviting apartment.  This is an absolute gem of a place, with wonderful access to downtown and quaint neighborhood shops (I already miss the Appleton Bakery and Cafe!)."
Tim's place is centrally located,beautifully furnished and equipped,and boasts a small back porch that looks across a courtyard with big trees and flowers - It was my everyday destination for morning coffee.  It was quite warm while I was in town,but the back porch magically has a perpetual and fantastic breeze which keeps the entire cool and fresh.,,
Communication with Tim was as it should be - thourough,open and frequent.  He checked in several times,made recommendations,and was a pleasure to meet.  This experience just amplifies the difference between an airbnb human experience and a sterile hotel experience.  As short-term renters,we get the benefit of someone's clear love of an area and a home,something you never have with most hotels.
Thanks again,Tim.  Fantastic place,and I will be back when the daughter comes to Boston for college hunting!,,,

The apartment is as described - small but not cramped and everything you need for a couple of days in the city. The deck off of his bedroom is an awesome bonus. Tim was really flexible and responsive. We realized there was a light bulb out when he showed us around, and he immediately went to get a new one and respectfully left it outside the door. The place was tidy and mostly clean, though the bathroom could use a little more attention. We would consider staying at Tim's again!"

Even though we did not get to meet Tim, he was always quick to answer any questions. Even when I asked the same one, twice. His apartment is in a beautiful neighbourhood in a charming Bostonian brownstone building. The interior is welcoming and warm. Nothing is left to chance - from the magazines to the aviation chair. Just lovely! Wifi is good, shower is awesome, the kitchen has everything you need, the bed is quite hard, but large! The street is quiet, but close to all you need.

I received a quick response after requesting to book and we were in communication at that time and just prior to our trip. We planned an earlier arrival due to our flight time and Tim was very accommodating in order for us to have an opportunity to make the most of our day in the city. The apartment is as pictured. We only stayed two nights but it is simple and just what you need for a safe cozy place to stay each night. The location is perfect. Within walking distance to the Pru and the local orange/green lines making for easy access to Fenway and the North End. We used Uber for further travels and that always worked well. We would definitely recommend Tims place and would look forward to staying there again on another trip to Boston.

His apartment is well located, just a short walk to Copley Square and many shops including a large mall. The apartment was as described.

其次,跟房主沟通十分顺畅,他一切都说的很详细,跟我这个英语不怎么好的人沟通也很耐心。,,
最后,房子设备很完善,屋子也很温馨,屋内有新风系统(如果我没看错的话),房东还放了好多波士顿的导览手册,很用心。
总之,"是一次不错的airbnb体验。\"",,,,

Even though we did not get to meet personally due to my work schedules it was very easy to communicate with him and we had a great stay.

He was very responsive before our visit to Boston and was available as soon as our plane landed to give us access to the apartment. He made it known that he would be available the entire time we were staying in his place if we needed anything or had questions. He could not have been friendlier or more accommodating!,,,,,

2395326,77936395,2016-06-04,49500096,Adam,"My wife and I had a great time in Boston staying at Tim's very nice apartment. The location could not have been better - 5 minutes to Copley Square but in a quieter, residential part of the South End. Breakfast, lunch and dinner places were all within a few blocks. The apartment was clean and comfortable, and Tim was communicative and responsive. My wife was in town for a conference, but this was a much better experience than staying in the hotel. It was about 15 minutes to the Hynes Convention Center, so going back and forth between the conference and the apartment was easy, and being in the South End was much better than staying in Copley Square itself. We'd highly recommend it for either work or leisure."
2395326,78340587,2016-06-06,42796517,Lauren,Tim is incredibly welcoming and getting to his place couldn't have been easier or more straightforward. There were fresh sheets and towels for us and we really enjoyed ourselves on the cozy back porch. Tim communicated all of the necessairy details before we got there and next time my husband and I need somewhere to stay for the evening in the city - we'll be staying here! Simply lovely.

2395326,82496151,2016-06-27,3428769,Clotilde,"Great stay at Tim's place, very cosy, feels like a real home! Tim went above and beyond to accommodate my feather allergy and provided us with 2 hypoallergenic pillows. Great location in lovely south end, bear bars and restaurants, cute shops. A small market store is also a 5 min walk. Would come back!"
2395326,82703100,2016-06-29,74356737,Sarah,"Tim was an accomodating and responsive host. He communicated all details prior to my arrival and the check-in was smooth. As for the place, it was tidy, cosy and decorated tastefully. Moreover, the location was very convenient; close to the subway and located in a quaint and charming neighborhood. Overall a great experience. For visitors of Boston, I'd recommend this listing."

We had a great time and felt at ease staying at tim's. He was quick to respond when we had an issue with getting into the apartment and super helpful all around. We had a great experience! Definitely recommend Tim's place if staying in Boston.
2395326,84021611,2016-07-05,364858,Chad & Julia,"Tim was very accommodating! Great host overall, very friendly and available for inquiries about the apartment, city and neighborhood. The apartment is very cozy! We did have some issues with cleanliness - shower had mold in it due to no ventilation, ball of hair was in the shower drain and dust/cobwebs were on the walls/furniture. Other than that, apartment was super charming with great location and a very homey feel to it. We were there for just one night but felt very comfortable and loved the back porch-nice breeze!"
2395326,84741772,2016-07-08,13753625,James Paul,Tim was very helpful with check-in and parking information.  The neighborhood is very nice and a great base to explore Boston.  It is within easy walking distance of sites and the subway.
2395326,86140037,2016-07-15,62561219,Jacqui,"Tim was a really great host, assisting with our arrival and departure and responding quickly to any queries we had during our stay. We loved his apartment, which is really tastefully furnished and decorated and made the perfect base for our Boston trip. The location is ideal and we walked everywhere - it's a short walk to the train or bus, to the middle of the city or to the river. There are lots of local restaurants and cafes in the area. It's a lovely part of town - brownstones and summer gardens in bloom at the moment.  I would highly recommend."
2395326,86812499,2016-07-17,75239779,Sarah,"Stayed at Tim's place for two nights for a busy weekend and cannot stress how great the location is.  5 minute walk from Back Bay station, less than 10 minute Uber to the theatre district, minutes to great food and bars.  Tim's place is cozy and tastefully decorated, and the back deck would be perfect for enjoying drinks on a nice evening but it was brutally hot and humid during my time there.  The apartment does not have central AC which was fine by me (there was a window unit in the bedroom) but might be something to keep in mind.  Also the bathroom is quite small (though functional and spotless) so if you're super tall or a large individual keep that in mind as well.  I will definitely keep this place in mind for future weekend visits."
2395326,87587299,2016-07-20,1714254,Henry,Tim communicated well and coordinated check-in to my itinerary. The location was in a nice neighborhood a short walk from everywhere I needed to be.
2395326,88302930,2016-07-24,77607281,Joe,"Our host was excellent and very accommodating. We arrived about 3am in late July and were very concerned about being able to enter the apartment; however, our host facilitated an easy, worry-free experience, and a comfortable  and informed preparation for our arrival -- and departure three days later. The charming apartment location is absolutely outstanding with nice nearby restaurants, a handy cafe-coffee shop, and nearby local bus and metro stops for exploring other interesting parts of Boston, many of which were walkable from the apartment. All-in-all a very nice, secure, safe experience and with a fast internet. We hope to return again!"
2395326,88427963,2016-07-24,8597150,Liz,"Tim's place is great! My partner and I spent one night at Tim's as a home base for some Boston exploration. It's a wonderful location in close walking distance to many South End restaurants and shops, plus is very central to Downtown. The space is cozy with a comfortable bed and cute back balcony area. Exceeded all expectations."

The little deck out back is perfect for breakfast in the morning and drinks at night. The location is convenient, and the neighborhood is charming. Tim is a pleasure to deal with and super-responsive in his communication. Last time around, we said that we'd definitely stay here again, and now we did. Hopefully, we'll be back next summer."

Even a nespresso coffee machine with various capsules we've had. 6 stars on this one. Thank you very much, Tim."

4662379,31696670,2015-05-09,27469634,Miko,We had a great time staying at this historic house in the Brighton neighborhood.  The place is much nicer than what the pictures might suggest.  (One recommendation is to upload pictures that show how off the place a little better).
Even though Jeff was not available to meet us in person he had everything prepared ahead of time to make for an easy entrance.   He was accessible when needed and responded quickly to any concerns and/or questions we had.,,,,,
The neighborhood has a small town feel to it in that it is mostly residential.  But just a block or so away you can find a really nice selection small shops,cafes,restaurants,banks and the ever so needed drug store.  The local bell goes off in the morning and you can tell what time it is by how many times it is rung.  If you want a place to get away for a weekend or with the family this is a hidden little gem of a place.  I would without a doubt recommend this to anyone considering visiting the area.,,

4662379,55828318,2015-12-06,14795361,Stephen,We are both coaches and we brought a team of 10 athletes from around the Country for a tour of Boston.  It served as a great Team House  in our goal of Team Building.  The dining room table served as a great place for team dinners and group games/homework station.    Healthy fruit/veggie store was a block away and a great neighborhood restaurant (Corrib Irish Pub/Restaurant) hosted our final night in town. (Keep track of the doors to your portion of the house -- separate apartment on side of house... don't walk in the wrong door off the porch ... or smile and apologize if you do!)

She was so friendly and lovely. The location of the place is also amazing. If I visit Boston again I would probably book her place for sure! The place is accurate as shown in the picture.

11121872,83368823,2016-07-02,17558657,Erin,The host Paulina was extremely friendly and helpful and nice. The apartment was spotless and absolutely gorgeous. Definitely would come again.
11121872,88432142,2016-07-24,3258806,Ida,"My boyfriend and I spent a weekend in Boston. Given the limited time we had to visit Boston, we wanted to stay as centrally as possible. Florence's flat was ideally situated. We couldn't have asked for better in terms of location. Moreover, the flat is really very pretty and well kept - everything was perfect! And Paulina who takes care of the flat was flexible, welcomed us with all the information we needed and was very discrete the rest of the time. Everything was clean and perfect - the rooftop terrace was wonderful. I'd highly recommend staying there, and would certainly do so if I were to come back to Boston."
11121872,89217679,2016-07-27,76173442,Lori,It was a lively and bright space with a beautiful roof deck. The bathroom was clean
11121872,98780742,2016-09-01,66942528,Jean,We did not meet our host and did not know that not only the bathroom was shared but everything in the apartment. Paulina was wonderful and really made us feel welcome. It was a great find but also know there are 79 steps to the apartment with no elevator. Not for  unfit people for sure.
12210223,73130458,2016-05-07,68755900,Malissa,"This is a great Boston location, the history and beauty of Beacon Hill can't be beat.  The apartment was a good size, especially by Beacon Hill standards.  The roof deck has a great view and each time I was up there I was totally alone!  The building itself is old, which I expected as I know how most buildings are in this neighborhood, but once upstairs it was a great apartment.  I heard the neighbors just briefly on 2 occasions, which was great.  Rosanna was very easy to reach with any questions even though she was away vacationing."
12210223,85093399,2016-07-10,68305694,Andrea,"Rosie was an amazing host!  She greeted us outside her apartment and showed us around her apartment and its rooftop patio. She had towels, sheets, pillows and extra blankets ready for us along with her very comfortable futon and (self inflating) air mattress. Rosie even cleaned out a closet, drawers and bathroom cabinet for us and left chocolates on our pillows. We were in contact with her with questions about the areas and she quickly answered us, sending a list of restaurants and must see places. I will definitely return!"
12210223,86143507,2016-07-15,24539707,Anne,Well located
12210223,87279884,2016-07-19,78318658,Eric,Rosie has been extremely helpful in arranging a last minute booking. She did her best joogling with check-in and check-out times that she tries to keep as flexible as possible to accomodate her guests.
12210223,87659445,2016-07-21,3170377,Christa,"Rosie was a great and very accommodating host, especially because we arrived late. The apartment is in a wonderful location - close to the T and in walking distance to lots of great neighborhoods. However, the best part is definitely the open rooftop that looks out over the city. In terms of cons, and these are outside of the host's control, it does get a bit warm in the summer, and since it's on the 7th floor, it can be a bit of a stair hike for some. Other than that, would highly recommend it!"
12210223,93156707,2016-08-11,40795357,Mojgan,"Apartment is in a great location, we had easy communication with the host. Space was too tight for s family of four. Second AC was installed quickly by Rosie's father due to hot summer weather. Bathroom is small & outdated. Generally a very old building & too many steps to get to the apartment. Close to nice shops & restaurants."
12210223,95427151,2016-08-19,18049857,James,"Rosie was a great host! She was very helpful and quick to respond to all of our questions. I traveled with my parents and young daughter. Her apartment is in Beacon Hill, a very historical section that is within walking distance of all the sights we wanted to see; Museum of Science, Boston Commons park, Italian restaurants, Aquarium, etc. The apartment is cozy, but completely suited our needs for a nice short trip to Boston. Recommended!"
12210223,96267886,2016-08-22,60935705,Maddy,"Communicating with Rosie was really easy and she made us feel welcomed right away! The place was clean and really well located, we loved the rooftop patio. It was perfect for our weekend in Boston and I would highly recommend it!"

5582163,30453955,2015-04-22,15719024,Hayley,"Tessa was a fantastic host. The apartment was even better than I had imagined from seeing the pictures: spotless, well-decorated and cozy. The location was great as well, we arrived from the Back Bay train station and were able to walk to the studio in less than ten minutes. Tessa was accommodating of our check-in and check-out times, which was great since we happened to have a late travel schedule both days, and was easy to reach if we had any questions. I enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend."
5582163,31107287,2015-05-02,6082779,Laurie,Tessa's place was perfectly located and all I needed for a quick overnight. Super cute and very clean. Geeat neighborhood too. Tessa was accomodating with check in time and very easy to communicate with. Would definitely stay again!
5582163,33590631,2015-05-30,23770848,Tzvetelina,"Tessa's place is so cozy, clean and well located, I would never consider a hotel in Boston again."
It has absolutely everything one needs for a week stay away from home,quality of sleep is amazing there and it is close to many shops,restaurants and sights.,,,
Tessa has been a great host,"always replying my messages and made me feel very welcome.\"",,,,
5582163,34432167,2015-06-08,29557666,Helen,"I really loved staying here. The apartment was lovely and Tessa was very easy to communicate with and understanding when my phone was not working. The area was great, close to the centre of Boston. The apartment was really home-like and very clean. I would definitely stay here again."
5582163,36830465,2015-07-01,19667669,Annabel,Fantastic studio in a lovely neighbourhood
5582163,38168666,2015-07-13,3393347,Jessica,This little apartment was perfect for my bf and I. Clean and centrally located.  Close to the T and really in walking distance to all areas of Boston. There's an Italian restaurant that has amazing food and low prices right behind.  Tessa was so easy to communicate with and very accommodating.  I would love to stay here again! Thanks Tessa!
5582163,38654142,2015-07-17,37262205,Matt,I really enjoyed staying at Tessa's place. It was incredibly clean and in a fantastic location. She was a great host - making me feel welcome and making the key handoff situation a breeze.
"I'd definitely recommend staying here!\"",,,,,
5582163,40235450,2015-07-29,34444014,Daniele,"Tessa's place si just perfect. The studio si very cozy and located in a safe and quiet neighbourhood. At the same time it is only a short walk to the metro station and to good restaurants. The apartment is very nice, super clean and decorated with taste. I certainly recommend it!"
5582163,40660988,2015-08-01,38673196,Chloe,"Tessa was the perfect host. I stayed at her place to take the bar exam (the venue was within walking distance, as opposed to where I live way out in the suburbs) and when she handed off the keys she was the sweetest. She left some nibbles in the fridge, wrote me a little welcome card, and gave me the contact info of a friend who'd just become a lawyer. Tessa is a peach, just lovely. Hopefully I won't need to take the exam again, but if I do I know where I'm staying! The place is clean, well-appointed, and cozy."
5582163,43653908,2015-08-21,2906431,Carolina,"Staying at Tessa’s apartment was a really great experience. She had everything prepared for our arrival, with great (really great) towels and linens, everything was perfectly clean, the apartment had a beautiful decoration (looks like made by a stylist), and the bed was also confortable…we felt just like home."
The neighborhood was amazing; the street is really calm and also very close to the subway station (Back Bay),with great restaurants,cafes,drugstores,etc.,
The listing description was totally accurate,with all amenities and listing that was described. Unfortunately,due to a big delay in our plane (9 hours),we didn’t meet her personally. She is a great host,took care of us,and we kept communicating by messages whenever necessary.
In summary,we had enjoyed very much our stay at Tessa’s apartment and we would love to be back in Boston and would definitely stay again at her house! We totally recommend staying at Tessa’s apartment!,,,,

5582163,46151662,2015-09-08,2960943,Maggie,"My boyfriend and I visited Boston for a wedding, and Tessa's studio was a perfect base of operations. It's convenient to two T lines, though most of the time we just walked or biked."
South End is charming,and there are lots of bars and restaurants nearby. We especially liked DavidsTea on Tremont. I liked feeling tucked away in the neighborhood,but being a short bike/T ride from downtown.,,,
"Tessa was a wonderful host and made the process very straightforward. We  would definitely stay there again!\"",,,,,
5582163,46904529,2015-09-14,3459646,Victoria,"I loved my overall experience staying at Tessa's apartment. It was very clean, had everything I needed for my stay, and Tessa was very responsive when I had any questions. It was easy to check in the apartment and get the keys, and also to leave at the end of my stay. The neighbourhood was the best I could've hoped for, and was very easy for me to access the BCEC for my conference, plus had a nearby grocery store, restaurants, and shops. I will definitely stay again when I return to Boston."
5582163,47677765,2015-09-21,11032029,Anna & Charlie,"Tessa's gorgeously stylish apartment was the perfect place for exploring Boston. It was very walkable to Chinatown and Downtown, and we even walked to Cambridge (although that was quite a long one!) It's 5 mins from two T stations."
The apartment itself is cute and cosy,and beautifully decorated - we may have to steal a couple of design ideas! Tessa was brilliant in terms of contact and generous in check in/out times. We also met her very cute cat Gigi! All in all,"a great experience. \"",,,
5582163,48996273,2015-09-30,28480145,Anne,Tessa was great. The listing was exactly like I thought it would be. She had fresh flowers in each room. And the neighborhood was nice and quiet and close to everything.

5582163,50930612,2015-10-16,9468110,Katharina,"We spent 5 days in Tessa's apartment in October. The flat is small but lovely and perfectly clean, ideal for a couple visiting beautiful Boston. The area is quite, very nice, and only some steps away from the many restaurants and bar the city offers. We would for sure recommend Tessa's flat to anyone interested to visit Boston."
5582163,52587388,2015-10-31,43591033,Seamus,"Loved staying at Tessa's apt. The description and photos are very accurate. The apartment is warm, cosy, very clean and extremely well maintained. It is tastefully decorated and has great character. Its location is excellent for sightseeing and shopping, close enough to walk to everything, just far enough away to feel out of the madding crowd. Thanks Tessa!"
5582163,54050110,2015-11-15,354861,Gillian,"Tessa's apartment is very comfortable and cosy, and nice and warm during the cold Boston weather. Great to be given luxury towels and linen. It is located in a nice area close to restaurants and transport. Tessa was very friendly and flexible with arrival and departures times and quick to respond to any questions I had."
5582163,54764414,2015-11-23,48262842,Tanner,Great little studio in an incredible neighbourhood! Impeccably clean and a perfectly accurate description on Airbnb. Thanks Tessa!
5582163,56885382,2015-12-19,1414656,Andrea,"Tessa's apartment in the South End is truly delightful. Cozy, elegant, unique, clean, and located in one of the most lovely neighborhoods of all the U.S. I would recommend this apartment to anyone! Two thumbs up!"
5582163,58425505,2016-01-02,28089876,Brian,"Tessa's apartment is great for a short stay. My girlfriend and I loved the proximity of the location, the picturesque neighborhood and comfort of the queen bed. We loved that it was only one flight up and was well decorated."
There were a couple comfort issues: We did have trouble with the Wi-Fi and didn't get a working signal (my gf has an iPhone,I a droid,neither worked). Also many of the channels on her tv did not work,so a guide of what is available might help in the future. Also there was no silverware in the apartment that we saw,which made eating take out tricky. Finally we arrived to the fridge having an odor coming from an old coffee that had mold growing in it and had an open lid. We also didn't see any a way to control the heat or a notice on what to expect -- this was important to us since we visited in winter.,
Tessa's apartment is lovely and perfect for an overnight visit or short stay. If you need only a starting point and plan only on sleeping at the apartment,I highly recommend Tessa's. Because it isn't spacious,we found ourselves feeling cramped and uncomfortable when we had downtime in between meals with friends or sightseeing. I think anything longer than 2 nights is pushing it.,,,
"We were able to reach Tessa about our issues the first night which helped but she did not respond to texts when we were trying to arrange check out.\"",,,,,
5582163,59416972,2016-01-10,74177,Richard,"A lovely, cozy space in the city. Conveniently located for both transportation and nice walks. It was a joy to be in Tessa's place. Communication was easy, and Tessa was always available."

5582163,71079902,2016-04-23,52724413,Deidre,"Fantastic little apartment in the beautiful Back Bay area. Very well positioned as we could walk most places and the Back Bay train station was also close by. As we came from New York via Amtrak train, that was an extra bonus. Tessa was very approachable and friendly. Her apartment was absolutely gorgeous."
5582163,72217637,2016-05-01,19441052,Grace,"Tessa was very communicative, friendly, and I couldn't recommend her place enough for a visit to Boston. Right in the heart of the South End surrounded by charming brown stones, her studio is immaculately decorated (seriously, she must be an interior designer- it is so beautiful!) and clean. Location really can't be beat and for the price, I would easily stay here again during my next Boston trip. Highly, highly recommend!"
5582163,73980291,2016-05-12,48780549,Cassidy,The host canceled this reservation 22 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

5582163,81181542,2016-06-21,4835559,Courtney,Tessa's place was awesome. Perfect for a short getaway for 2. Checking in and out was very convenient. The location is great; quiet and located just a couple blocks from the T. Plenty of shops and places to eat or grab coffee near by. Next time I'm back in Boston I would try to stay at Tessa's again!
5582163,81655041,2016-06-24,17595448,Julie,Tessa's condo is darling and comfortable as well as clean and in a fab location. Tessa was a delightful hostess. Great condo for one or 2 people and terrific neighborhood to walk to dinner or have a wonderful evening stroll.
5582163,86556367,2016-07-17,10609523,Farah,"Tessa's apartment was beautiful. The location was great. Tessa answered all my questions and communication was great. However, the only complaint i have about the apartment is that it has no AC. Considering it was summer, the apartment was stuffy and hot. Apart from that, everything was great. I would totally recommend this listing."

2216767,11749456,2014-04-14,11403109,Nicholas,"The apartment is even more beautiful and well-decorated then it looks on picture! The location is just perfect for my girlfriend and I, since neither of us drives; the place is 2 minutes away from the Red Line, 10 minutes walk away from the Boston Commons, and in walking distance to awesome restaurants (Mooo..., Anna's Taqueria, JP Licks, Ruth's Chris, etc.)."
As a host,Liz is very flexible. She keeps her place very clean. She would try her best to accommodate your needs (check-in timing,access to cooking accessories and her kurics,vases to put flowers),and you can tell that she just wants to make sure her guests are having a good time while they are there. I would recommend Liz's 1BD in Beacon Hill to my friends and family,and I would definitely love to stay at her's again.

2216767,13177785,2014-05-21,239992,Amanda,"After a (grumble grumble) delayed flight Liz was graciously waiting for us to check into her place. She gave us a quick tour, then left us to get organized. What a great spot!  Felt right at home. Super easy walk to the 'T' and Boston Commons. Local grocery and beer store just a short walk away. Keurig coffee was a good morning pick me up. Liz left us with a list of local restaurants she recommended, we loved Fig! and was willing to answer any other questions we had during our stay.  Overall a great choice for our 4 day Boston adventure as tourists."
2216767,13954244,2014-06-09,188812,Andrea,"Liz was very accommodating and even let us in early! The apartment was adorable, clean, and exactly as advertised. I'd definitely stay here again."
2216767,15442708,2014-07-09,1371569,Kallie,"Exceptional apartment in Beacon Hill. I really can't say enough good things, and our memorable week in Boston was made even better knowing a cozy apartment was awaiting each night. Some apartments in Beacon Hill are old and outdated, but that is not the case here! Reasonably priced for the location, especially taking into account that the furnishings, linens, kitchenware, etc were of the highest quality. Impeccably clean. Classy. Comfortable. Safe. There were 2 of us and the apartment was just perfect. Though only 1 bedroom, the comfortable queen sized bed and roomy couch made for private space and separate sleeping arrangements. It was wonderful to have a full kitchen and refrigerator, as well as cable TV and a pile of DVDs. The air conditioner kept up well with the summer heat. Bathroom was quite large and the shower was roomy with great water pressure. The 2 flights of stairs were very manageable. Accessable to all things downtown Boston and just 2 blocks from the Red Line. Liz was extremely friendly and a great communicator. She even left us some K-cups for coffee and an unopened carton of half-and-half. So sweet! We felt at home right away. I'll most definitely be back. Highly highly highly recommended."
2216767,16064658,2014-07-21,1559739,Melissa,Beacon Hill is such a cute neighbourhood. And Liz was so welcoming and helpful. She provided a list of recommendations in the area and also made sure we felt free to text her if we had questions about the apartment or Boston in general.
2216767,16864043,2014-08-03,18113863,Robb,"Liz's home was lovely. It was exactly as we had hoped it would be and the location was stellar. She is a warm, personable young woman and could not have been more welcoming. Her home is inviting, tasteful, cozy and lived up to all our expectations. The perfect place to stay in Boston!"
2216767,16978635,2014-08-05,12709708,Jessica,"If you want to sleep on the comfiest bed in Beacon Hill,  stay with Liz."
The downside is you may not get out to see many sites.  This would require you leaving said bed.,,,,,
Liz was a very accomodating host and even met us for an early check in. The house is well kept and has everything  you need.,,,,,
It's tucked on a quiet leafy street and is an easy walk to everywhere. There are local places to eat and drink and the Metro station is a short walk to get you further abroad.,,,,,

Liz's apartment was perfect. I felt like I was staying at my sister's place for the weekend. Super clean and cozy. Bed was amazingly comfortable.,,,,,
The location of the apt is centrally located to everything (no need for a car). Pictures were very accurate.,,,,,
"Thanks for a great stay Liz! \"",,,,,
2216767,21196289,2014-10-13,12485161,Gabrielle,Liz's place was great! She was very accommodating to our time frame as our flight didn't leave till late sunday night. Her apartment is very clean and in such a great area. The streets surrounding her apartment are very quiet and beautiful so it is the perfect place to walk around. The apartment looks exactly like the pictures. We would definitely stay again!
2216767,21647449,2014-10-20,2073025,Patrick,"Liz has a lovely apartment in a great location. Clean, neat, and very comfortable. I would love to stay there again."
2216767,22397103,2014-11-05,12070654,Elise,"This app is in the best location!!! Right in beacon hill, 5 min walk to subway and main attractions. Host recommend a great dinner spot which was to die for :-) the app is a little smaller than the pic but is comfortable for a couple. The bed was the best we have had all trip. Liz was very easy to communicate with and left us clear instructions and recommendations which was very useful. Def stay here again."
2216767,23151659,2014-11-24,18251348,Cathy,"This was my first airbnb experience and I relied on reviews when making a selection on where to stay, so I'd like to pay it forward."
Liz was fantastic to work with,"she was very flexible and accommodating. Her Beacon Hill apartment was exactly as advertised and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. Thank you Liz!\"",,,,
2216767,24180130,2014-12-22,4916246,Abigail,"Liz was a gracious and accommodating host, and her apartment is clean and stylish in a fabulous location. We were also pleasantly surprised at how quiet it was, enabling us a fantastic night's sleep in a comfortable bed. Delicious dinner at Marliave, too!"
2216767,24793720,2015-01-02,9826970,Kate,"We stayed at Liz's place for one night over New Year's Eve and it was a lovely experience. The apartment is exactly as described on the site and perhaps even more charming in person. It's a great location in my favourite part of Boston-safe, quiet and accessible. The bed was super comfy and the whole place was clean, cozy and inviting. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a lovely place to stay in an adorable part of Boston.  Felt like home even for one night!"
2216767,25413394,2015-01-15,18016435,Anna + Micah,"I had the most wonderful experience at Liz's apartment! It is an ideal locale in Beacon Hill, clean, modern and a great layout. The check-in process was smooth (and I even got to meet Liz's cute pup, Harper) and Liz was very responsive. I would love to stay here again!"
2216767,25595076,2015-01-20,24068435,Emily,Unfortunately my stay wasn't as great as I expected. The wrong house number was listed and I was unable to reach Liz for quite a while.  I found out later on she was away skiing for the weekend.
Once I got into the apartment I was please. Very clean and a lovely apartment.,,,,,
Then I the pipes were frozen so we had no running water or bathroom facilities (it's January it happens) I called Liz again no answer.. So I text her to tell her the pipes were frozen. She replied immediately and told me to raise the heat that might help.,,,,,
So Myself and my guest had to leave the apartment to go to our event with not being able to shower or use the bathroom after 5 hours bus journey. At this stage I wished I had book a hotel.,,,,,
My guest came back to the apartment early as she was coming down with a cold/ flu. When it came time to go back to the apartment my guest wasn't aware that there was a buzzer on the door came down stairs to let me in and the door dead bolted behind them! Absolute disaster. I admit it wasn't Liz fault that we got locked out. I've my own apartment in New York so I understand these things happen.,,,,,
So my friend that lives around the corner has a spare set of keys just incase there's ever an emergency and someone needs to get into my apartment.,,,,,
After numerous calls to Liz i finally got threw to Liz and apologized for waking her and told her the situation. She wasn't helpful at a all,"her reply was that we should go book into a hotel and she'd refund us for the night? Are you kidding me. All my belongings are inside my friend is sick standing outside wearing pajamas and no shoes in freezing temperatures. Eventually I lost my cool after 40 minutes and told Liz I'd have to call the cops if she didn't help us(my friend has also spoken to her and said \"\"do we have to break a window to get in\"\" inadmitbthat sounds a little dramatic but We were very upset and cold!) She then told us her friend lives in the 1st floor and we could try his buzzer. Why didn't she just say this in the 1st place?",,,,
When I returned to New York I contacted air bnb and the refunded me my night. Which I was pleased with.,,,,,
It is a lovely apartment and close to everything And what u can gather I had an unusually bad experience,,,,,
I understand that some things were out of Lizs control and the situation escalated quickly,I just wish she handled it better.,,,,
I will give air bnb a second shot but I will ask if the game spare keys if an emergency comes up!,,,,,

2216767,27595618,2015-03-08,6233699,Rishikesh,Liz's place is nice and cozy. It is exactly as shown in pictures and she was very helpful during the entire booking process. The check in and checkout was smooth. While she was out of the city during my stay she shared with me details of people to reach out in case of emergency! This was very useful.
As I had a lot of luggage because I was on a long term travel (with many warm clothes!),it was slightly inconvenient because apartment is on the second floor with narrow stairs. And there is very less wardrobe space.,,,,
Overall,the stay was perfect,"neighborhood is nice and I would recommend this place for a short term stay\"",,,
2216767,28924328,2015-04-01,6352200,Lori,"Great locstion, Liz was available through text if we needed her.  Very clean and comfortable.   Definitely woulds stay again."

Only 3 blocks away from Charles/MGH red line T stop and very walkable to Commons, downtown, Back Bay. Would highly recommend this location!"
2216767,32155299,2015-05-15,11886989,Ashley,"Liz met us at the apartment for check in and we felt immediately at ease. The apartment was just as described, perfectly lovely and it was nice to be able to meet Liz to get some details on the area. The apartment is truly perfect for a couple, it has plenty of room for 2 people and is very cozy. The bathroom is surprisingly large, and beautiful. This apartment was a fantastic location, a short walk away from Charles Street and the Boston Commons and Garden. We loved it!! Liz was easy to reach when we needed her, and was an overall wonderful host. You will not regret staying here!!!"
2216767,32489850,2015-05-19,20337015,Penny,Liz was very organized and welcoming to me when I visited Boston for my niece's graduation from BU.  She made it very easy to stay at her beautiful home.  I slept like a baby in the comfy bed and the central location within walking distance of the train made my visit to Boston hassle free. Thank you so much Liz!
2216767,35284056,2015-06-17,1645533,Rob,We loved spending our time in Liz's apartment.  It was exactly as described and as depicted in the photos.  We were very comfortable. It was an easy walk to Boston Common (although steep in places) and Charles Street.  There were some good restaurants close by.  We loved the character of the area.  Getting a large suitcase up and down the narrow stairway was a little challenging.  Liz was great in responding to emails and gave some useful suggestions of places to visit and recommended some great shops in Charles Street.  Highly recommended.
2216767,38091347,2015-07-13,24618516,Mike,"This is a great place to stay. The location is utterly fantastic; it's walking distance to the Garden and the medical center. Plenty of cool shops and hang-outs around the corner. Liz's apartment is awesome, too. Her place has a wonderful contemporary feel yet is also warm and cozy. It is obvious she takes pride in it. Finally, I only had one question during my stay and she was very prompt in replying to me."
Do yourself a favor,"if you need to be in the heart of Boston rent Liz's place.\"",,,,
2216767,39260525,2015-07-22,24440980,Jesse,"Liz was a great host that was very flexible with our trip.  She was not able to meet us on arrival, but made arrangements for us to get into her apartment.  The apartment and building were great and on a nice quiet street.  We were able to walk or get a ride easily anywhere we wanted to go.  Liz also gave some great recommendations for places around town that really helped make our trip great.  If we travel to Boston again I would definitely repeat."
2216767,39929675,2015-07-27,30241469,Jamie,"Liz's apartment is BEAUTIFUL!!  Having never been to Boston before, Beacon Hill seemed like the perfect neighborhood to stay in.  We were able to walk to the Commons, Freedom Trail, Back Bay and the Library.  Liz provided us with wonderful recommendations for restaurants in the neighborhood, and was very responsive to our questions.  She also did a wonderful job of communicating the house rules with us.  I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to experience Boston!"
2216767,41990820,2015-08-10,37940113,Rodney,"We had a great experience.  The apartment was very cute, comfortable, clean, and in a great neighborhood.  We would definitely stay there again."

Liz is a fantastic,helpful and accommodating host. I would recommend her and her flat to anyone. I have never felt so welcomed.,,,,
"Thank you Liz!\"",,,,,
2216767,47340933,2015-09-18,169529,Leslie,"Everything about Liz's apartment was perfect! Location great, furnished beautifully, and so quiet. And Liz went above and beyond by letting us know after we'd checked out that we'd left a jacket behind which my husband very much would have missed on the rest of our trip. She arranged for me to get back in using a lockbox even though she had to make the arrangements in the middle of her workday. We cannot thank her enough for being so thoughtful."
2216767,48676158,2015-09-28,19439342,Simon,We stayed at Liz's apartment in September and we had a great time.
The apartment was easy to find and is in a very beautiful and quiet neighbourhood on Boston with great shops in walking distance.,,,,,
Liz was very good with her communication and was easily reached when we had a small issue with the wifi.,,,,,
"This is a great place to stay and Liz was a awesome host\"",,,,,
2216767,50615892,2015-10-13,128190,Ally,"Unit was just as described and even more beautiful in person.  All the best creature comforts in a historic location.  Liz gave many great recommendations of places to eat nearby and now we have a new favorite bakery/cafe! Perfect location for exploring Boston, walking distance to many top Boston attractions and very easy and convenient location for transportation.  Can't wait to visit again"
2216767,50888853,2015-10-15,2535885,Rok,Great location and a good spot. Liz was very accommodating getting me setup! I was there for business and would recommend.
2216767,51619795,2015-10-22,43047008,Brian,A great apartment in a wonderful location.  We couldn't have picked a better place to stay.
2216767,52392346,2015-10-29,8750041,Paloma,"The appartment is really nice and comfortable, and the neighborhood is perfect!! Everything was working perfectly and Liz was really nice to us, she gave us great information about places to eat and she offered help in case we needed it. Some things in the kitchen were not that clean, but this was not actually relevant considering the nice place. We would really suggest staying at Liz's place!"
2216767,54843026,2015-11-25,4289704,Nathaniel,"This is a lovely space in idyllic Beacon Hill. Liz's apartment was the perfect home away from home while I visited Boston for a conference--I loved its convenience to great restaurants, to running paths, and to a Whole Foods. Liz was easy to communicate with; she was able even to accommodate the extra night's stay that my schedule required. I would definitely seek out this listing should I find myself in Boston again."
2216767,56237656,2015-12-11,1317703,Gail,"Liz's apartment in Beacon Hill is very convenient, located in a terrific quiet neighborhood.  Liz was lovely and easy to communicate with.  The maintenance of the building is poor (soiled carpets up the stairs, but once inside, her apartment was very clean.)  As many others have said, the bed was great. This is LIz's primary residence, so the apartment is very personal, filled with her photos and personal items.  It is small (as most apartments are in this neighborhood) with no room to hang our clothes and very few places to put things.   The fridge was filled with her food and leftovers.  If you stay here, you need to be OK with living in someone else's personal space."
2216767,57883919,2015-12-30,29212221,Brooke & Ryan,"We spent 3 nights at Liz's place in Beacon Hill and absolutely loved it! The neighbourhood is gorgeous, with cobblestone side walks and old grand homes. It's quiet, but also close to restaurants, etc.  Liz's apartment is beautifully decorated and has everything you need. It is very comfortable for 2 adults. Some have commented it is on the small side, however it's fairly typical (and perhaps even spacious) for an apartment in any big city.  The queen sized bed is very comfortable and the bedroom gets quite dark with the blinds closed so is great for sleeping.  Keep in mind that the apartment is on the third floor of a walk-up building so you need to be able your bags up."
Liz was a great host and the key pick up was very simple. She was easy to get in touch with in preparation for our stay. Liz also had some great suggestions for restaurants,etc in the area.,,,,
"We absolutely recommend staying here and hope to be back soon!\"",,,,,
2216767,60048619,2016-01-18,12770761,New,"I rented this airbnb because I had friends coming to stay and my apartment is simply not big enough to fit all of us. Liz was wonderful and her apartment was beautiful. I live in Beacon Hill and this was one of the most pleasant, updated one bedrooms that I have seen in the area."
2216767,61851406,2016-02-08,29118801,Gerardo,"I just felt just at home. Great apartment, great host."
2216767,62720673,2016-02-16,7429375,Mallory,"We loved staying at Liz's beautiful Beacon Hill apartment! The location was perfect -- easy walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go -- and the street and neighborhood were incredibly charming. The apartment itself was very comfortable and we slept very, very well in her super soft, comfy bed. The bedroom was a bit tight but we expected that from the photos and from the size of other airb&bs we had looked at in Boston. In addition to the location the real selling point for us here was the interior -- totally updated apartment that is very well-kept and well-decorated! Definitely a much nicer place than others we considered in this price range.  Lastly, Liz was flexible and very accommodating with our arrival and departure times, which was greatly appreciated.  Had a wonderful time in Boston and we cannot recommend this apartment enough!"
2216767,64428632,2016-03-04,54082719,Donna,"Liz's place is so wonderful and so well located. It's beautifully renovated, cozy, and comfortable. The bed and the bathroom were luxurious.

2216767,68669590,2016-04-06,41099241,Greg,"\"Liz was great and her place was great. Cozy, comfortable, quiet and convenient. We were in town for an event at TD Garden and Liz's apartment was less than a 15-minute walk. We also walked to the North End. As other reviewers have noted, this is Liz's primary residence.  So it sort of felt like we were staying at a friend's house, but the friend wasn't home. It's filled with personal pictures, belongings. It looked \"\"lived in"
2216767,70765810,2016-04-20,31869401,Johnna,Liz promptly replied to my questions before our trip. She was waiting for us when we arrived and was very welcoming. We loved staying in her beautiful apartment. It was immaculate when we arrived. Very quiet building and neighborhood. Within walking distance of everything we wanted to do; close to Boston Common and the shops on Charles St. I would definitely stay here again!
2216767,73731194,2016-05-09,6693028,Helen,"This apartment is absolutely lovely and immaculately kept. The space is roomy enough for a couple, with a decent sized bathroom and excellent shower. The Queen sized bed is devine - just so comfortable after a day of sightseeing."
The apartment is on the second floor (3 rd floor in the US) with no lift,but I managed the narrow staircase with my suitcase without problems.,,,,
The location is excellent with a very easy walk to MGH station and walking distance to Boston Common. The neighbourhood is so picturesque and a delight to walk around. There are good restaurants close by within walking distance as well.,,,,,
We didn't get to meet Liz unfortunately,but she was very contactable and replied promptly to our queries.,,,,
"We highly recommend this place as a great base for exploring Boston.\"",,,,,

She made us feel very welcome. My husband and I felt very comfortable and safe in the apartment and walking around the neighborhood. We would absolutely stay here again if we find ourselves in Boston!"
2216767,88808325,2016-07-25,9094375,Brandon,"Liz was wonderful leading up to our stay, giving us detailed instructions on where to find and how to get into the apartment.  The location is perfect.  We we a 15-30 min walk from everything you could want to do in Boston.  Beacon Hill itself is a gem and has a ton to offer in terms of restaurants and entertainment.  We had such a good time."
2216767,94766225,2016-08-16,49095574,Samantha,Liz was really helpful and checked in to make sure everything was going well. The apartment is really lovely and clean.

13054720,78248942,2016-06-06,72730104,Eslie,"We had a great stay! Jennifer, our host, was there to greet us and answer any questions we might have which was nice. The apartment itself was very clean and neat, quiet and in a nice neighborhood. Comfort-wise it was a little sparse (meaning no television or couches),  but for the price we paid it was more than suitable for our needs. I would definitely stay here again :)"
13054720,78820842,2016-06-09,70838456,Mekenzie,"The place was clean and well-kept, Jennifer was an awesome host who responded quickly. Would definitely book again!"

13054720,80242985,2016-06-17,69013231,Shelly,"Jennifer greeted us and shared the house rules. She was very helpful explaining the layout of the city and made herself available if we had any questions. The apartment is just as described and pictured. We really enjoyed our stay! The orange line is about a block away and we also found it easy to use Uber, making it very easy to get around without a car."

"Owner was very accommodating !  she helped with parking and directions!\"",,,,,
13054720,80932941,2016-06-20,17795653,Kim,Our stay at Jennifer's Brownstone was lovely! It has been very neatly restored/renovated into a wonderful studio style apartment. The exposed brick is beautiful. It is a wonderful location...approximately 2 miles to Fenway and 2 miles to the waterfront area. Very convenient. The accommodations were clean and comfortable. We loved the extra touches of a couple nice portable fans (we can't sleep without the fan noise!) and even a couple bottles of water. The neighborhood is very neat and per Jennifer the largest Victorian neighborhood in the states. It was nice chatting with Jennifer at check-in and again one other time after running into each other in the hall. I would absolutely stay again and recommend this comfortable and affordable option in Boston!
13054720,81150959,2016-06-21,75807139,Lindsey Morgan,"Jennifer was FANTASTIC! She was incredibly accommodating and made sure we had a place to stay in Boston (after prior Air B&B-ers cancelled on us). She made us feel very welcome. The place was exactly as described and in a perfect location; during a nice day you can leisurely walk to Fenway, otherwise it's a very quick cab/uber ride. Great experience overall."

The apartment was very well kept with clean towels, sheets, dishes, etc.  There was free WIFI which was a nice addition.  Jennifer was very friendly and helpful, responded very quickly to any questions that I had.  Neighborhood was quiet and friendly.  Great location and very easy to walk everywhere.  Jennifer's apartment was close to many excellent restaurants and bars in South End Boston.  Highly recommend and I would definitely stay here again."

13054720,90726513,2016-08-02,3692914,Laura,"Jennifer è stata accogliente e disponibile nel fornire tutte le indicazioni necessarie per il soggiorno. La posizione è comoda perché si trova vicino alla stazione Ruggles per raggiungere in poche fermate il centro di Boston. Inoltre a 5 minuti a piedi si trova un supermercato ben fornito. Unica nota, se soggiornate in periodi estivi nell'appartamento trovere due ventilatori ma non l'aria condizionata."

The appartment is as shown on the pictures. Really cosy and well equiped. The orange line is just 5 minutes walk, and all attractions and the Airport are easy to reach. I would definitely recommend to stay at Jennifers place."
13054720,93985757,2016-08-14,62023381,Megan,"Great little apartment and space. Very private. Clean and modern. Exactly what we needed for a short stay in the Boston area. Only drawback is that there is no a/c (I'm sure the listing states this, but I didn't even think to check it!) There are fans and that made it as comfortable as possible. Overall glad we chose to stay here - good value in comparison to hotels in the area for sure!"
13054720,94684309,2016-08-16,37038961,Andrea,We had a great stay at Jennifer's apartment! Everything was clean and as described. The apartment is walking not distance or a short drive/ cheap uber  from all the Boston sites. we really enjoyed our stay!
13054720,95354274,2016-08-19,13622777,Allison,"Staying at Jennifer's apartment was wonderful. It's a small space that is comfortable and well decorated. Jennifer provided numerous restaurant and activity recommendations. We didn't have a car during our stay, but it was a 20 minute walk to the Back Bay Area. We would definitely stay with Jennifer again!"
13054720,96588543,2016-08-23,47182707,Andrew,"Jennifer met us in person to give us the keys, show us the place, and took time to tell us about nearby restaurants, bars, and coffee shops. The place was immaculately clean and it's a close walk to the Common. Wonderful experience! Communication was great! As long as it's under 85 degrees outside, we would certainly stay there again."

13054720,98080151,2016-08-29,33862897,Dakota,"What a great stay we had! The brownstone building is absolutely gorgeous. On the inside, it is a perfect little one bedroom/studio apt right on the first floor. There is a small kitchen, so you can cook or store your food in the fridge. Everything was very clean. There is no a/c, but she has two fans that keep the air flowing and it was not an issue for us on an August day. We drove from NY, and we were able to park right outside on a weekend for free. We were late due to traffic, but luckily Jennifer was very understanding and sweet. Lastly, we walked to go to dinner about 15 mins, where there are a ton of amazing restaurants and bars, as well as  shopping. We sell at Sowa Vintage Market, and that was just a few short minutes away! I recommend staying here, and will definitely want to stay here again next trip to Boston."

13054720,99822280,2016-09-06,37364670,Ellis,"Jennifer was great - She accommodated us very well during the check in and check out processes. The space was perfect for two. Plenty of windows for natural light, which was nice. Although it was fairly hot in Boston during our time there, the fans were adequate for cooling down."
Much of what we wanted to see - The MFA,Gardner Museum,and several awesome bars and restaurants - Were within walking distance. Everything else was just a short cab ride away. At the risk of decreasing its availability,"I would highly recommend this space. \"",,
4293597,24268313,2014-12-24,23396969,Chris,"I highly recommend staying at Cindy's if you are looking to stay in the Boston area. Located on a nice street in a safe neighborhood, Cindy's house is also right near the green line train and many cool places on Cambridge Street."
Above all,the main reason to choose Cindy's is because she is a great lady that is really interested in helping out the folks that stay at her place. She is on top of her game and always checking in and making sure everything is up to par. One other really nice thing is that she always makes herself available to her guests. I got in touch with her a few times when I had some questions,and she was always great about getting right back to me.,,,
It has been a real pleasure staying here. Thanks,"Cindy.\"",,,,

In fact the entire house was well secured, so I also was not concerned about safety. The location is great. Everything I needed was in walking distance and the green line train was less than 2 blocks away. Cindy was very helpful and accommodating as well.

Her place is in a pleasant residential neighborhood with trees, about a 15 minute walk from the T transit system, and about a 10 minute walk from a bus to Harvard and shopping and restaurants.  The place was homey.  I enjoyed staying there and recommend Cindy as a host.   Did not get to talk too much with her due to my short visit but what I did was enjoyable."

4293597,35786574,2015-06-22,12658670,Brian,"This was a great experience. Cindy was there to check me in and show me around, and then I saw her only when she was there to do laundry or cleanup around the house. I felt at home, and very comfortable. Free coffee, laundry, fresh towels every morning, and my own key for my door. Nice neighborhood and a 5 minute walk to the Green Line. Would definitely stay here again."
4293597,37122245,2015-07-04,17174773,Joseph,"\"The description was mostly accurate, with one crucial inaccuracy. The host indicated \"\"free parking on premises.\"\" Much of the surrounding area is street parking by permit only. Half of the remaining street parking is no parking Friday from midnight to 9 a.m. This was not mentioned in the description. I was staying on a Thursday night. All available parking spots were likely taken early. There was no spot to park my vehicle and I had to find alternate accommodations at a late hour. The host agreed to a refund"

The bathroom was clean and nice. It was only 10 minutes by foot to T train station Warren street. It was convenient but keep in mind that it may take up to 40 minutes to reach city centre. Overall I recommend this place!!!!

I asked Cindy whether I can leave my luggage there early in the morning when  I arrive ( because this maybe before the prior tenant leave), she kindly said yes and let me put the luggage in a locker. What's more, Cindy provides simple breakfast like coffee and oats. The house is clean, and it really worth the price!"

I strongly recommend it if you are planning to spend your time doing other things, and not staying in the room. The WiFi signal was a bit weak at times, and I expected something more varied for breakfast but it was OK. The only sad thing was I did not have the chance to meet Cindy."

Upon arrival, she highlighted all of the essential need-to-know items for my stay and made sure I knew she was available for contact in case any issues came up.  In addition, my room was commensurate with the listing description and had already been prepared (bed made, room cleaned etc.).  As I spent most of my time exploring the greater Boston area, I was only around the house in the evening.  However, Cindy was great at checking in via text/email and was even helpful in providing local recommendations that suited my interests.  After completing my stay I really couldn't come up with any complaints.  I was uninterrupted and was able to spend my time as I pleased.  Cindy's home provided a great launching point and was a comfortable crash subsequent my expeditions."

Everything is clean and quiet and there is no road noise. The Warren Street T-stop is a 5-7 min walk. It's super close to Harvard Ave and everything else you'd want in the area. It's also not far from the bus line to Harvard Square (much faster way to get to Cambridge). I came and went at all hours with no issue whatsoever.

But, if you are new in BOSTON (or US), please asked the guidance of Cindy and the (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) map, because the place is quite 5~10 mins walking from the train station (warren station). That if you knew the place, it would be very hard if you are not familiar of the place. You will be lost. So its better to asked Cindy if you are not familiar of the place.

La casa es muy cómoda,"limpia y ordenada. El barrio es muy tranquilo y seguro. Hay una estación de Metro muy cerca. Es un lugar muy recomendable.\"",,,,
4293597,70802850,2016-04-20,37662589,Alden,"I've said it before and I'll say it again...Cindy's place is great! Wonderful location, comfy bed, and a fair price."
4293597,70887675,2016-04-21,62651384,Peng,It was a very nice place. Everything is clean and well-organized.
4293597,71464728,2016-04-25,57098801,Chase,"Wonderful host! Location was great! Not very far from the T, and the room was clean and comfortable. Staying there made for an enjoyable weekend. Cindy was great about making sure I had everything I needed, and always messaged me back quickly when I had any questions. I'd definitely like to stay there again next time I visit Boston! :D"
4293597,72025592,2016-04-30,25005741,Jing,"The room is very clean and the space is more than enough for one person. Cindy is a great host, very friendly and quickly responded to my questions."
4293597,72083963,2016-05-01,11440123,David,"Room was small but comfortable. Bathroom was clean with plenty of hot water. Overall, my short stay was very pleasant."

4293597,72937190,2016-05-05,20920940,Celia,"Lovely house, near tramway station and supermarkets.. Very good time in Boston!!!"
4293597,73003062,2016-05-06,23987282,Rana,"Cindy was very accommodating and was extremely easy to contact, whatever request I had she was there for me."
"Will definitely stay with her again!\"",,,,,
4293597,74579694,2016-05-15,112741,Pia,"Cindy is a great hostess. I am sorry my son graduated this weekend so I don't know when I'll return to Boston. I would definitely stay at Cindy's again. This was perfect for me. I brought my 94 year old mother with me for graduation. The house in in Allston and everyone knows that neighborhood is perfect for cafes, bars, convenience stores."
"The house is on a Dead End so extremely quiet for the city.  Walk a couple steps and down around the corner to the bus. The bus connects to the (green line) \"\"T\"\" and will take you all the way into the major places of interest in Boston.",,,,,
All the amenities of home are available. Cindy makes it so convenient to drop your bags and feel at home. She offers a well stocked kitchen well beyond what I expect for a host to provide.,,,,,
She is super friendly,helpful and very kind.,,,,
I've stayed here 2X and would stay again if I ever get back to Boston.,,,,,
This house is so convenient.,,,,,
I prefer not to drive in Boston so I parked my car for my extended weekend: Thursday - Sunday.  I only had to move it once for street cleaning. The signs for cleaning are visible and you will note when all the cars move to one side of the street. Even tho my car was parked on a main street it is perfectly safe. Allston like Boston is a walkable neighborhood so please park the car and walk or use readily available public transportation.,,,,,
There were other guests in and out of the house but everyone was super mindful of being quiet and use of the kitchen and shared bath.,,,,,
I had to bring work with me during this visit for graduation. So it was perfect for me: great wifi and space to sit and call clients.,,,,,
My son is graduating so I may not be back to Boston in the near future; but I highly recommend staying at Cindy's house for sure! My mother loved it - she really enjoyed staying in a house vs a hotel. She could get up in the morning and have her breakfast in peace and quite vs eating in a public hotel restaurant or making lukewarm coffee in a hotel room.,,,,,
"I only use Airbnb. I love it and will most likely continue to enjoy staying in lovely places such as Cindy's house. You can have a conversation with other travelers or keep to your own privacy. I fit somewhere in the midst of that definition. \"",,,,,

4293597,76771091,2016-05-29,11965842,Mario,This room in Boston was really cozy and cute! Perfect for 1-2 people. It was a bout a 9 minute walk from the train and not far from the center city at all. The neighborhood was really nice and quiet and I felt safe. The check in process was fast and easy! I was able to enter and leave whenever I pleased.
4293597,77158695,2016-05-30,40118344,Jelisaveta,Cindy is wonderful host. I had great night at her place. Nice and small cozy room.
4293597,78105016,2016-06-05,63859785,Alan,"Only saw Cindy towards the end of my stay but received a welcome email as soon as I arrived. On the Friday, there appeared to be a party upstairs that woke me."

4293597,82261982,2016-06-27,70580715,Soumitra,She was very polite and helpful. She responded quickly to the problem I had regarding the room being locked from inside.
4293597,82629851,2016-06-28,71131764,Melissa,"Cindy was very attentive, friendly, and helpful. This was my first experience using airbnb and I am very willing to do so again after this. She was up front about the space, kept it neat and clean with fresh bedding and towels in the bathroom.  She provided me the guidance I needed on utilizing public transportation and finding places to dine. She also kept some breakfast items stocked so I didn't have to rush out in the morning.  I am very glad to have stayed here and would do so again, should I ever be in the area."
4293597,83111954,2016-07-01,5739927,Angela,Cindy's room is cozy and clean and the bed is very comfortable. Transportation is convenient. She is very kind to let me leave my luggage in the house because I arrived at the city in early morning.
Thank you Cindy for that.,,,,,

4293597,89738886,2016-07-29,57198794,Edward,Cindy's place is a nice home at the end of a quite street. The room is small but easily big enough for one person and all their gear. You will be renting one room in a house of many airbnb style rooms within many other guests. Overall a great place a great experience and Cindy is very helpful and kind person.
4293597,92516755,2016-08-08,64367233,Quehao,Very quite and comfortable. And Cindy is very nice. Satisfied.
4293597,94110002,2016-08-14,15147250,Marina,Cindy is very friendly.
The neighborhood is nice but too far from downtown Boston. It is a cul de sac with no lighting. At 8pm the street is already so dark that hardly see anything .,,,,,
In announcing the apartment it said that they are included breakfast cereals,but the second day of my arrival there were no more and nobody replied cereals all week.,,,,
The floor of the room was not clean,and all objects were sticky (sockets,windows,fan,lamp,etc. )
One of the windows in the room was broken and could not be closed . The last night I could hardly sleep because of the party noise of the house opposite.,,,,,
If I go back to Boston,"I'll look for another alternative to stay.\"",,,,
4293597,94367305,2016-08-15,7242990,Garth,"Brief stay, but it was clear Cindy was thoughtful and conscientious. Comfortable bed and good coffee in the morning!"

Very responsive hosts, and arriving to a little welcome pack of snacks was a fabulous surprise after my transatlantic flight! Highly recommended! I would definitely stay here again."
6323935,34451924,2015-06-08,2309379,Janet,"Our stay at Dave's place was great. First, the location was ideal for our trip. Very convenient to public transportation, loads of restaurants, and other entertainment opportunities, yet a wonderful neighborhood feel. The place was very clean and quiet. Dave was very helpful and resolved some small details quickly. We didn't cook at the apartment but the kitchen was very well equipped if we had wanted to. The bed was comfortable and the shower worked great. Thanks, Dave for a wonderful weekend in Boston Back Bay!"

The place was great, the neighborhood was AMAZING and the valet service to meet with the keys was responsive and punctual. This was an overall great airbnb stay! The place wasn't huge but it was 100% accurate to the pics and for the money, way better than hotels in the area. It was conveniently located near all the things I needed to do while in Boston. The owner was extremely communicative."
6323935,35573640,2015-06-20,33757461,Tam,A+ experience.  Will stay again with my husband!!  Great experience!

6323935,38148147,2015-07-13,28298726,Michael,This apartment was exactly was advertised. A cute little place with easy access to the Orange Line and the Prudential Center. Very walkable neighborhood. Dave's staff was very helpful with checking in and out.
6323935,39315110,2015-07-22,10591085,Elisa,"Dave was a terrific host, very responsive.  The space was exactly as depicted.  Very clean, and well appointed.  The location is fantastic (as a former Bostonian, I couldn't have asked for a better location to visit all my favorite places).  I look forward to staying here on my next visit."
6323935,39982893,2015-07-27,9217309,Bijan,"Was a great experience staying at Dave's place. We liked staying there, even though, it was a bit pricey."
We got there after midnight with a little bit of delay,they were helpful to show us the apartment. The place is cozy,new,small studio located in the heart of the city. Walkable to main spots,15-20 min to airport. The neighbor hood is nice,you would enjoy walking back home late in the day. The apartment was very look and looks new from inside.  You will have necessary appliances
One thing that may need to be improved by the host(s): There the AC was a bit too noisy,and the thermostat doesn't make the fan stop working. So you would have to manage turning it on and off during the night,if you have trouble sleeping with a noisy AC. Fortunately,the weather  was not very hot in Boston during our trip.  We stayed at unit #8,that may not be the case in other units.,
"Overall: Recommended!\"",,,,,
6323935,40174700,2015-07-28,22920381,Elisabeth,"Great neighborhood, key handoff was perfect, and the flat was perfect for the two of us. Close to Northeastern University so I could walk to events on campus. Close to T as well. Would definately stay again."
6323935,40479357,2015-07-31,981673,Jason,"A great stay. Apartment is described accurately. It's not a big place - but it works great for short stays and as a place to rest your head. Clean, efficient and had everything that I needed. Would def stay again."
6323935,41562650,2015-08-07,10969148,Colby,The apt is very tiny but very adequate. I enjoyed the proximity to South Boston.  I would stay here again.

6323935,46502219,2015-09-11,2947565,Allie,"Experience was great! Spot is super lovely, neighbourhood is excellent. The space is small, for two of us on a busy conference schedule it was perfect. I would definitely consider a second stay."
6323935,46844801,2015-09-13,12876355,Andre,"I came to Boston for a conference at MIT over the weekend. The studio was very nice and the area was quiet but close to everything. Really enjoyed my whole experience staying here, especially the complimentary chocolate bar, that chocolate was amazing. Definitely recommend it."
6323935,47267652,2015-09-17,39308994,Ian,"This was an Airbnb first for me in that I was greeted by a caretaker rather than by the host, but nonetheless the caretaker was pleasant and fitted in with my last minute changes in arrival time. There was also a lot of useful information about the area in the arrival pack."
The location was great,close to bars and restaurants in the Back Bay area,and on a quiet side street.,,,
The room itself was a bit small,but Boston is pretty expensive and so you can't expect a lot in this area. It was well fitted out and comfortable.,,,,
Also the room was up 2 flights of stairs which was not a problem for me,but should be taken into account,,,,
"\"",,,,,
6323935,47417717,2015-09-18,21571385,Roland,Everything was great with this airbnb stay. Nice apartment in a nice neighborhood. A bargain compared to the outrageous prices at Boston hotels (more than $600 a night). I met Dave's guy with the key right on time and the whole interaction was easy and pleasant. Near the South End and Back Bay.
6323935,47485449,2015-09-19,40298188,Jeremy,The location of Dave's place is perfect. Dave was very accomodating and the management company is on top of everything...I would DEFINITELY stay at Dave's place in a future visit to Boston!
6323935,48127613,2015-09-23,27665208,Mike,Great location and rental as described. Perfect accommodations for my business trip.
6323935,48410053,2015-09-26,39701801,Shoshana,The apartment- or should I say the room- was very well located- close to many things of interest in Boston and in a very nice and quiet neighbourhood. Also it was clean and well equiped with all the necessities.
Also Daves maintenance person- I think it was Michael- was kind and helpfull with everything we asked for.,,,,,
"However it was too tiny and crowded for us- two people with all of our luggage- two big suitcases plus a trolley  and a backpack. It is more suitable to my opinion for one person or for two with no luggage at all. The pictures make an impression of a spacious place. I think it should be emhhasized that it is only a room with kitchen corner and a bathroom.\"",,,,,
6323935,49106729,2015-10-01,8622723,Lucy,"My mother in low stayed in the apt for 5 nights. The neighborhood is wonderful, close to major attractions."

6323935,52070147,2015-10-26,43130695,Stephen,"Our stay was exactly as advertised. The studio is clean, compact, quiet and has all that is necessary. The Kind bars, artisanal chocolate and good coffee was a treat. Communication was easy, everything done as promised, but most important the location was perfect for us. We walked everywhere and loved the neighborhood."

Loved the notes,highly recommend B&G Oysters restaurant.,,,,
Dave was proactive in his comms,had to get air con fixed but it wasnt an inconvenience he even changed the time to suit our schedule when we were out.,,,,
Only small things:,,,,,
Bring your own washing detergent,,,,,
Get heaps of quarters for the washing machine,,,,,
"I'd stay here again and recommend it to any couples.\"",,,,,
6323935,52788242,2015-11-01,33166820,Sanaz,"Dave was a very considerate and accommodating host, he stayed in great communication and did everything he could to make us feel comfortable.  Keys were dropped off by a key service just as planned and the neighborhood was delightful. Thanks for everything Dave."
6323935,53478908,2015-11-09,14950549,Yevgeniya,"This was the perfect place to stay: a calm and quiet neighborhood just a short walk from the convention center, with various stores and restaurants nearby, and easy access to the T. Check-in and check-out were very smooth, and the whole process was very streamlined and well-planned. The apartment and everything in it was professionally cleaned and organized and had everything I needed, including soap, shampoo, lotion, linens, etc., as well as some bonus treats I hadn't expected. The wireless internet connection was nice and fast and didn't have any glitches or delays. Overall, it was a lot like a hotel, except better in every way. I'll be happy to come back if I'm in the area again!"
6323935,55728162,2015-12-05,4924455,Sangmoo,"The location was amazing, very close to Newbury Street, Prudential Center, and Boston Symphony."
The neighborhood seemed great. Really quiet and safe.,,,,,
The house was well-maintained,but I think it could be better. For example,when I checked-in,there were some small bread pieces left around the kitchen corner. And,the drain at the shower booth had full of hairs,and I had to clean them out to have a shower.
The host,Dave,"and his housing staff were very responsive. I really appreciate their quick response on my requests.\"",,,
6323935,56142948,2015-12-09,19661809,Christina,Two words: quaint and cozy. The key concierge service was very prompt with delivering my keys. There is no elevator so be prepared to carry your luggage up three short flights.
"Dave's \"\"charming south end\"\" definitely lived up to its pictures. Everything was clean and modern",which is exactly how I like it. Surprisingly,I didn't even need the heater because the apartment was already sufficiently warm. This is a rather particular thing but I appreciated that the towels were not the thin,scratchy ones. The view was a nice bonus because I could see the part of the skyline.,,
Dave provided a very detailed guide that I found extremely helpful,especially with the restaurants (Toro was so delicious). The apartment was walking distance to Northeastern and several restaurants and sights so I never had to request an Uber.,,,,
Overall,I enjoyed my stay greatly. Dave was accommodating to all my various needs and was timely in responding to my messages.  The only caveat of my stay was the refrigerator noise...personally,"I'm a very light sleeper so that was on my end to have taken account of the space. I'll just be sure to bring some sleeping aids next time (because I hope there will be a next time)!\"",,,
6323935,56517937,2015-12-14,1742871,Baird,"Great location, clean, quiet and comfortable. Just what I was looking for."

6323935,57248382,2015-12-23,27934355,Jess,The place was clean and well located.  It's located in the South end near tremont st with shops and restaurants and also newbury street and Copley sq. We could walk to where you buy trolley tickets in prudential center and also walk to the orange line to head to TD center for a bruins game. The flat is managed by a company so felt more like dealing with a hotel. Would recommend it.
6323935,57904672,2015-12-30,9836921,Michael,"We stayed at Dave's place last week, and loved it. The place is cozy and well laid-out, and located in a GREAT neighborhood, a real oasis of quiet and calm right in the middle of the city. And because there was no one staying there the night before we checked in (and our flight landed at 6am!), Dave arranged for our early arrival with the keys in a lockbox...all of which went off without a hitch and was a real lifesaver. Can't recommend this place more highly!"
6323935,58409249,2016-01-02,50302781,Yejun,Completely satisfied with the studio!

6323935,61858762,2016-02-08,28211132,Ihsan Fadhlur,Perfect location and hospitality for a short stay. Despite of heavy blizzard Dave and his assistant provided me with clearest information and made sure that I have arrived and got everything I need in the airbnb. He also resolved some of my questions regarding features in the apartment. Got some nice info from the papers that he prepared for the guest too. One of the best value for a stay around Back Bay area!
6323935,62572739,2016-02-15,20045608,Andrea,The apartment was clean and cozy. We really enjoyed our stay here over the long weekend. Great location and great comfort. Everything matched the description.
6323935,63052866,2016-02-19,17106422,Nataly,Perfect apartment and location!
6323935,63393916,2016-02-22,16113563,Damon,"What a perfect AIR BNB.  Prior to arrival, Dave and his staff provided clear and consistent communication on how to get in to the building.  Once inside, lots of info about the house, the kitchen, things to do in the nearby areas.  The space itself is cozy, comfortable, close to a lot of shops and activities, but off the path enough that you're not inundated with unwanted noises."
Great bed,great amenities,great shower,"can't rave enough about this.  Next time I'm in Boston this will be the first place I'll see is available.  \"",,
6323935,63939558,2016-02-28,11652884,Todd,Clean. Quiet. Quick to respond. Perfect location for my needs.  What more could you ask for!
6323935,64885008,2016-03-08,1919364,Whitney,"This studio was exactly what I needed! I appreciated how clean it was, and how easy it was to get the key and extend my stay by a day. Dave and those working for him were responsive, professional, and kind. Good location, and great little apartment!"
6323935,65097446,2016-03-10,3677603,Michael,"Great spot! Was in town for a conference and this was a great substitute for a hotel room. Dave and the team were extremely responsive. Place is exactly as described, and they even provided a few delicious snacks on arrival (chocolate was fantastic!). Location is in a quite neighborhood but close enough to walk or get a short ride anywhere in the city. I would definitely stay here again."
6323935,70796162,2016-04-20,21983076,Carissa,"The apartment was close to everything either by walking or taking the T only a few blocks away. It was clean and though small, every little item like scissors and a hair dryer were available. We were met immediately at our arrival for a key exchange and the whole process was very smooth. I'm likely to use the same spot next year!"
6323935,71145799,2016-04-24,56552531,Cristina,"Very welcoming, he arrived earlier than I expected.  Allowed us to check in early and was very kind."
6323935,71619289,2016-04-26,41975525,Adrian,"Very good place, well situated close to everything in central Boston by foot.  Quiet, comfortable, clean, perfect."
6323935,72583502,2016-05-03,59484714,Jem,"Thanks Dave - a wonderful place to stay; very peaceful, quiet and a great location.  The flat although compact has everything you could want and a Dave arranged for a warm welcome.. Location is great for the Symphony or Mass Ave T or just walking into Back Bay.....cannot recommend to highly."
6323935,72956522,2016-05-05,7801524,Evan,"Dave was a great host. He had someone meet me at the door and was accommodating when I arrived early. The place is clean, in a great location, and has everything you need. The neighborhood is central to restaurants, coffee shops, a Barnes & noble is within walking distance with a small cafe, and a great breakfast spot 3 minutes away by foot. I would stay here again."
6323935,74082729,2016-05-13,46395038,Dan,"Clean, comfortable, quiet and a great alternative to staying in a hotel for business. Liked the warm weather and the trees by the window."
6323935,74804260,2016-05-16,44951795,Jean,"This is a cute, comfortable apartment, just right for two people.  It is in a charming building very well situated near the Prudential but tucked nearby in the gorgeous South End residential area.  Dave was very prompt to respond to our messages and the key service quickly responded when we arrived earlier than planned. It was perfect for our stay during our daughter's graduation weekend at BU."
6323935,76388566,2016-05-27,64945475,Michael,"The apartment was in a great location - a quiet neighborhood close to restaurants and other city attractions.  Additionally, it was a stones throw from public transportation.  The apartment itself was great and had everything needed for a comfortable stay."
6323935,78633914,2016-06-08,2309379,Janet,"This was my second stay here. Having a comfortable convenient place to stay can really make for a good trip and my stay at Dave's place was perfect! Dave made sure I had everything I would need and more - snacks, directions, recommendations for restaurants, wifi, kitchen amenities, and more. The bed is comfortable, the street is quiet, Dave's help was prompt and friendly. Staying at Dave's was just what I hoped it would be in every way. I will surely stay here again and again when I am in Boston."
6323935,79060172,2016-06-11,36963604,Ryan,"This apartment was located in a convenient, central, safe location in a beautiful neighborhood.  The studio apartment is small, but it was sufficient for 2 people.  Cleanliness was good, but not spotless.  Overall it was a great location, apartment was sufficient and a nice stay in Boston."
6323935,79255984,2016-06-12,17523341,Ope,Properly managed by very relatable professionals. I highly recommend this place.
6323935,79958120,2016-06-15,10812146,Jonathan,"The neighborhood is stunning and charming - a great place to walk, whether for a scenic stroll, or to go out to eat, and just a few minutes from Symphony Hall."
The apartment is beautifully appointed.  Both the apartment and the building have obviously been redone recently.  Fixtures,furniture,everything is high quality.,,,
Go in realizing that the place is *small*.  The picture on the right is the ENTIRE PLACE - and shows the bed folded up.  I estimated that there was maybe 150 sq ft tops of floor space - much of it taken up by the bed.  So just go in expecting this to be a comfortable place to crash and use as a base to see the city.  Don't count on relaxing there.,,,,,
From what I can tell,this is not a home that is occasionally rented out.  It's an investment property.,,,,
There are pluses to that.  Dave tosses in little things - candy bars,water - in a desire to make visitors have a sort of hotel experience.  The same room in a hotel in this area of Boston would have cost much more.,,,,
"Also - don't come with a car.  There is no (practical economical) parking available.  The good news is that you can see everything in the city you want to by foot or \"\"T\"\" subway","or at worst commuter train.  I returned my rental car a day early and saved money.\"",,,,
6323935,81484431,2016-06-23,12096866,Eniko,"I only stayed one night at Dave's place and everything was perfect. The place is very clean, the location is perfect, very quite and safe."
6323935,81852641,2016-06-25,48776269,Menglong,It's in a great location and worth for the price. Within around 40 min to the airport by metro. Everything you need is well prepared. Thanks very much !
6323935,83075048,2016-07-01,24975111,Wenzhen,"Very nice and clean space, close to everything. Will stay again!"
6323935,84603610,2016-07-08,58624093,Irina,"El apartamento es extremadamente pequeño, pero con absolutamente todo lo necesario para habitarlo."

6323935,84858132,2016-07-09,24470801,Charles,"We were very happy with Dave's apartment. It is very small but is well laid out for its size and is nicely appointed. The location is excellent, a beautiful neighbourhood and walking distance to plenty of attractions. The check in process is handled by professionals and was very smooth. Overall a great experience and I would definitely recommend."
6323935,86109667,2016-07-15,79153795,Stephanie,Perfect place to stay in Boston! Located close to the subway to get you to many of the historical locations. Walkable distance to the north end of you like to walk too. Very clean room and helpful staff. Highly recommend!!
6323935,86626045,2016-07-17,63534832,Brittany,"Apartment and host were both wonderful! Dave was great at getting back to me asap with all of my questions about the area. His studio apartment is kept extremely clean. Dave was nice enough to leave waters in the fridge, and some snacks on the table with a guide about the area. For me, it was walking distance to everything in Boston (but very accessible to the subway line, and the main roads with bus stops). 24 hour check in was a big plus! I was coming from nyc after work, so I didn't get to Boston until 10:30pm. A very friendly girl from air bnb caretakers was there to greet us, and help us inside. Check in and check out were both extremely easy. Definitely recommend!"
6323935,87888596,2016-07-22,8478725,Debrup,"Good neighborhood, good condo"
6323935,88264588,2016-07-23,27740621,Ashwin,The apartment was in a great location and has everything you need. It was very clean and tidy and was good to stay in. However the flat itself is very small. We waited over an hour issue was waiting over an hour for the keys from the management company. Otherwise Dave was a fantastic host.
6323935,90047258,2016-07-31,7321005,Dan,The apartment and and location were great. Just what I needed for a short trip to Boston. It's the second time I've stayed with Dave and will definitely reach out to him the next time I need to travel to Boston.
6323935,90832844,2016-08-02,50452175,Alex,This studio apartment in the back bay area of Boston was exactly what I was hoping for. It was very conveniently located near copley square and about a 15 minute walk from Boston Common and the public garden.
"The bed was comfortable and I was provided with some free snacks and toiletries so I felt service went above and beyond expectations.\"",,,,,
6323935,92122916,2016-08-07,60272286,Jeremy,"My wife and I had a great experience in Boston.  Dave's place was very clean and tidy.  He has a management company run it.  They were very responsive.  They were very accommodating with us so we could drop our luggage off after our flight, and we were actually able to check in hours before our scheduled check in time.  The location was great, very walk-able to great locations.  I would definitely recommend this."

6323935,94910019,2016-08-17,59221603,Troy,Quality snacks and water were available on arrival. Very late phone call (3am!) with a question about the TV was answered politely and professionally. EXCEPTIONAL location - quiet and convenient.
6323935,97229100,2016-08-26,12145426,Thorben,Great place to discover amazing Boston
6323935,98428688,2016-08-30,90826363,Damien,"Everything was great, very clean,Kira greeted us on arrival. We were running 20 min behind due to traffic( I felt terrible) but didn't seem to bother Kira.. As my first airbnb experience, I'm glad it was in the Back Bay. We walked to everything( Fenway, Restaurant's, and public parking lots) Would recommend to my family and friends."
6323935,98625998,2016-09-01,36866709,Lane,Great apartment in a lovely neighborhood in Back Bay.
990668,4952943,2013-06-03,1402212,Amaia,"I live in Boston and my parents stayed at Edward's penthouse for 4 nights last may, when they came to visit me. Not only the house is amazing but also Edward was the most kind and helpful host ever."
"We had another reservation but the host cancelled it and then I contacted Edward for a \"\"last minute\"\" reservation. He was incredibly nice and made a great effort to work this out. Edward even kindly invited me to see the house before booking. The penthouse was still under construction works",as Edward was renovating it when I first got the chance to check it out,but he managed to have everything ready in just a few days,to make my parents' stay really comfortable.,,
Regarding the penthouse,the only thing I can say is that it is amazing!! It is in a great location really close to the main tourist areas in Boston (perfect for visitors) but conveniently located in a really quiet neighborhood. Edward has recently renovated it and the spaces he has generated have been designed with great detail and in a very creative way. Especially the atrium and how the rooms look toward it and get the light from its skylight is incredible!!!,,,,
As my references to my friends about how kind Edward is and how great the house is were so positive,"now they all want to contact Edward for future stays of their families!! :) So... I would not recommend it to my friends or to anyone... I ALREADY DID RECOMMEND IT!!!!\"",,,,
990668,6098812,2013-07-29,7747994,Charles,"I enjoyed my stay at the Penthouse very much.  The host was friendly and very helpful.  The location was excellent, within walking distance of many great restaurants, coffee shops and stores.  Bus and subway stops were also within walking distance so I could get to anywhere in the Boston/Cambridge area with no problem.   The room was clean and comfortable, with lots of natural light.  In fact, the recent renovations Ed has done are amazing, making the place feel very open and spacious.  The new large windows, sunlight coming in both sides morning and afternoon, and the many trees, ivy and other plants surrounding the building made it feel like I was in the country.   And despite the fact that I was in the heart of Boston's South End, it was very quiet.  Ed told me he is installing a fountain in front of the building and a waterfall in the back which will add to the natural feel of the place.   I would recommend Ed's place to anyone who wants to experience the historic side of Boston but who also enjoys the quiet convenience of a modern apartment."
990668,7563139,2013-09-24,8680757,David,"Julie and I have stayed in many B&B's around the country and abroad and each one is different.  Our favorites were special because of the welcoming host who made the experience like visiting an old friend.  Edward is one of those special hosts whose casual demeanor puts you instantly at ease.  Which, as I was staying in his home, not just a business, made me feel at home too."
Boston is a very walkable city,bring good shoes and get in shape before you come as there is so much to see.  Edwards place is an easy 5 min stroll to the Prudential subway stop,where with a 7 day pass we were able to go anywhere in zone one on the commuter rail as well..  Concord was a little extra in zone 5.  The ferry to Quincy was only $8 each way and is a great harbor cruise for cheap,go round trip or come back on the red line with your pass.,,
I have been to most of the big cities in the US and the last time in Denver three different people tried to run me off the road; as a game I guess.  We were very impressed each and every day with the genuinely warm people we met in Boston.  The pilot of the Samuel Clemens harbor tour,the waitress at the Fat Cat in Quincy,the docent at the MFA,the cafe barista across from the North Church,the bouncer at the Bee Hive and so many more.,
"I would not visit Las Vegas unless I had a business trip but I would definately go to Boston any time.\"",,,,,
990668,7796002,2013-10-03,8616093,Stephan,"We came from Oxford, UK to visit Boston. Edward's apartment is ideally located for sight seeing and close to nice restaurants and bars. The apartment is very modern, clean and quiet."
990668,8223192,2013-10-21,3510819,Anne Marie,Had a great weekend in Boston visiting our daughter at Northeastern University.  Ed was a wonderful host providing us with detailed directions to his place and restaurant suggestions in advance of our visit.  Ed was very quick to respond at every phase of the experience.   The accomodations were comfortable and clean and overall much more interesting than staying in a hotel.  Got a great history lesson on the Southend as only could be provided by a long time resident.  The condo is lovingly renovated with high quality materials and fixtures and is located on a very pretty and quiet street (well except for some short term construction noise early Saturday morning...)  We would definitely stay again.
990668,8294338,2013-10-24,8679935,Linella,"After a hectic tour of New England, we arrived in Boston exhausted. Stepping into Ed’s penthouse was like entering a beautiful, elegant oasis in this historical district of Victorian homes. Ed’s home is filled with art and books and is equipped with every modern convenient. The spacious bedroom and bath are filled with light. As an owner of ski property in Park City, Utah, I appreciated the attention to detail that made the suite so user friendly. Great lighting, mirrors, loads of storage and outlets everywhere."
Ed is a gracious host who made us feel welcome and comfortable. He provided useful information on how to see Boston by walking and by using mass transit. His place has a great central location within walking distance of the Museum of Fine Arts and the Gardner Museum. For the downtown Historical sights we could walk to the end of block to catch the bus or walk another minute to Starbucks.,,,,,
As retired teachers used to traditional hotels,we were a little apprehensive about trying Airbnb. However,my son who recently used Airbnb in New York assured me this is the way for modern travel – and he was absolutely right. I will definitely stay here on my next trip to Boston. Airbnb and a great host like Ed allow luxury travel with a personal touch at an amazing price.,,,
"Jen and Lin\"",,,,,
990668,8383492,2013-10-28,7705978,Arthur,"Edward was kind, accommodating, and eager to find information if he did not have it offhand.  His townhouse is beautiful and, aside from some construction equipment from his renovation (that is just about finished) it is neat, clean, and quiet.  There is also access to a lovely kitchen.  The location is terrific with great local restaurants and many attractions being within walking distance.  Easy access to the subway, as well."
"\"",,,,,
990668,8604481,2013-11-07,9539526,Jade,"I flew from Oregon to meet my Irish classmate in Boston and had a phenomenal time at Edward's. He was an extremely friendly and gracious host with lots of excellent suggestions for the South End in terms of dining and gave personal reviews of most of the plays ongoing at the time. We enjoyed ourselves so much that we asked to come back and stay after our road trip to Cape Cod and Mr. LeMay was very accommodating to the request. Would definitely stay there again, looking forward to seeing it when the renovations are done!"
990668,8677652,2013-11-11,8552751,Mary,"A perfect spot to meet up with a friend from uni (half way between Ireland and Oregan!). Can't say enough of good things about Edward & his fantastic apartment. It really is the perfect location -only a short walk (few blocks)  into town & to the subway. There are loads of fantastic places for brunch & dinner really close including Masa, Hamersley's Bistro, The butcher block, Union bar & grill, Charlies, Giacomi's etc. The apartment itself is gorgeous, nicely decorated, spotlessly clean and good value.  And best of all Edward was a joy to talk to - he gave great advice as to what plays to go see, which museums were worthwhile, nice walks to take and where to eat. He was an absolute pleasure to deal with before we got there as well as during our stay. We liked it so much that we re-booked the place for our return visit on coming back from Cape Cod a few days later!  I look forward to my next visit"
990668,8782291,2013-11-18,8002149,Jeffrey,"Ed is an excellent host and his listings are simply beautiful. I booked the Duplex and the Penthouse for my family visiting from the Netherlands and they absolutely loved it. We live in the South End ourselves so Ed's place is conveniently nearby. What they got in return was a beautiful home in a lovely neighborhood at the same cost of a hotel stay (especially when you're visiting with a larger party). My family will be staying at Ed's place whenever they come back, and I will highly recommend this listing to anyone that's looking for a place to stay."
990668,8872550,2013-11-23,2717428,Ellen,"\"Ed's home is so lovely.  I had a wonderful stay in \"\"the penthouse\"\".  The room was comfortable and clean.   The home is very well located on a lovely street in the south end.  My key thing was that the house was so close to my brother's place on East Brookline.  So I was shopping for a place to stay while visiting family.  I highly recommend it.\""
990668,8914915,2013-11-25,8132434,Emily,Ed was welcoming and responsive and his home was lovely.  A wonderful visit.  Thanks!
990668,13527885,2014-05-29,15243254,David,"The house is absolutely beautiful and brings together a wonderful combination of modern decor with that classic historic Boston look. Ed, the owner is a very kind man and was extremely accommodating. Location wise this place is perfect. It was easy to get to, near the T, and I enjoyed walking around the neighborhood which is very safe. The unit was very clean and better than most hotels I've stayed at in the past. I'll be coming back here for sure!"
990668,14018706,2014-06-10,7631571,David,"Ed's place is a delight to stay in. Boston is my second home town having lived there, and I always want to enjoy the place alongside Bostonians. Ed's place is in South End, a great local neighbourhood area. Ed had lots of recommendations for us where to go locally, including a breakfast at the very pleasant South End Buttery at the Union Square. The house itself is great, simple and stylish while perfectly functional. We spent some time talking to Ed about our lives and places we went to and it was always very interesting. This was also the first time I took my daughter to Boston and to my class reunion and staying with Ed made our stay only better. I would definitely recommend the place to others."
990668,14234097,2014-06-15,15234145,Charles,"If you are interested in an 1860's quiet neighborhood getaway in South End Boston, this place is great! It is located within walking distance to Back Bay station, shops and cozy bars and restaurants. This place was recently renovated with clean, neat and up-to-date furnishings and fixtures. I definitely will re-book when in the area. Thumbs up from me!"
990668,14762480,2014-06-25,8716024,Jack,Thanks Ed . The place looks amazing especially with the New rooftop balcony!
990668,15739551,2014-07-14,14538985,Neva,Edward was simply fantastic. Very friendly and helpful. Made me feel incredibly welcome and was very responsive.
The space is recently renovated and beautifully done. The roof deck was one of my favorite spots. I had dinner up there every chance I could get.,,,,,
The neighborhood is great - lots of local places to eat a great meal and the T was close.,,,,,

"A great place in a great city! We'll definitely come back at Ed's the next time we're in Boston.\"",,,,,
990668,18494092,2014-08-27,18977311,Jane,"We spent 5 nights in Ed's beautiful home and what a privilege it was to have the opportunity to share it, if only for a few days. The photos do not do it justice. It is superb, a visual delight with art work everywhere you turn and adorning ever corner of his penthouse, designed and works overseen by himself. It was an excellent base to admire the magnificent city of Boston and it's hard to pull yourself away from the roof deck, as the vista of the city both day and night are wonderful. We like walking and although we had long days most of the historic and memorable sites were 'doable' from South End. If not, the T is an efficient way to travel across the city. South End itself was a lovely area to explore and we had some fabulous eating and drinking experiences across the city, helped by Ed, in our selection. He was very kind in recommending a super, small restaurant called 'Carmen' for our Anniversary, next to Paul Revere's House. the Appleton Cafe became are usual breakfast haunt. Ed's response time is second to none and he is always accessible for information/advice if only by text. A wonderful experience. We can't recommend this immaculate, quiet, show house highly enough."
990668,18624546,2014-08-29,18385883,Philippe,Edward has been a great host for our three day stay in Boston. We truly enjoyed his advice and felt at home in his superb appartment. Outstanding location.

Edward was very welcoming - he showed me to my room, gave me a tour of the house, and made me a cup of tea as we talked.  Edward offered restaurant recommendations, explained where everything could be found in the neighborhood, and really couldn't have been nicer."
The EastSuitePrivateBedBath is on the top floor,has a private bath and is perfect for one or 2 guests.

The room and apartment look just like on the pictures, very tasteful, very clean. The house is a quiet one in a quiet street and a beautiful historic neighbourhood. We very much enjoyed it. The view from the new rooftop terrace is amazing, especially at dusk! And it makes for beautiful sitting."
Ed left a folder in our room with guides and ideas about things to do. We had full use of the kitchen,could make coffee and tea and also put our things in the fridge. All in all a very good airbnb experience and Ed is a great host.,,,,
One thing I'd suggest - we were in the east suite and while the morning sun was wonderful,it also woke me up rather early :) Maybe some blinds that block out the light might be good. But then my husband slept anyways,so it really depends on the person.,,,
We spent three nights,are a couple,"from Switzerland.\"",,,

Der Bus hält fast direkt vor der Tür,und zur nächsten Ubahn Station sind es 7 Minuten zu Fuß.,,,,
Die Suite sowie auch das übrige Haus sind wie auf den Bildern zu sehen außergewöhnlich schön,auch wenn wir die Dachterasse leider nicht nutzen konnten :-),,,,

990668,21414039,2014-10-17,11939735,Rose,We loved staying with Edward! His house was lovely and the room we stayed in was so comfortable and very clean. The area was also great as there were loads of fantastic bars and restaurants nearby. Edward was a great host and really lovely to chat to. He also made us instantly feel at ease in his home. I would recommend his place to anyone visiting Boston!
990668,22258976,2014-11-02,22370673,Jacqueline,We made a great choice to stay with Edward in his beautiful penthouse in what turned out to be a lovely location with good local transport.  Ed could not have been more welcoming and helpful and we enjoyed his company during our time there and hope to stay in touch. We chose not to use his lovely kitchen/dining area as there was so much choice locally for breakfast/brunch etc.  We were very comfortable and would highly recommend.
990668,22640126,2014-11-10,7912714,Alverson,The whole experience of renting Ed's space for my b birthday party was beyond any expectation. Everything was perfect and all the guests expressed how they admired the beautiful house and pointed out Ed's friendly presence.

990668,28355986,2015-03-22,29317606,Rich,"Ed is very welcoming and informative. The days that I stayed there, he was very busy, but still made time to meet me and chat. The location of the suite is close to some restaurants and not too far from the MBTA (around 10 minutes walk). The neighborhood is mostly quite, with somewhat of an old feel to it. Overall, I enjoyed this stay very much and will probably do it again, especially when I need a place to stay in town."
990668,28907056,2015-03-31,236385,Jennifer,"We had such a wonderful time on this trip.  Edward was so friendly, welcoming and helpful.  The property was beautiful and as listed in the description.  My favorite part was the immense amount of natural lighting, the open space, the apartment decor and the rooftop terrace.  We felt very comfortable and welcome.  The apartment location was perfect!  So many shops and restaurants nearby in the South End.  Our favorites nearby were the Beehive and B&G Oysters. And only a 10 min walk to the Prudential building and Boylston street/Back Bay with more shopping, restaurants and bars.  It's easy to get to all the neighborhoods in central Boston and Cambridge. I highly recommend staying at this property when you come to visit Boston!"
990668,29769142,2015-04-12,8844214,Vanessa,"My friend and I stayed with Ed for a weekend and simply loved it! The place is beautiful and exactly as shown in the pictures and described in the listing. Due to its location in the South End there is a ton of restaurants and little shops in the area. Ed was a wonderful host! He's a very kind man and takes very good care of his home. He was flexible and accommodating and I very much enjoyed my conversations with him. I'll definitely return if I get the chance! Thank you, Ed!"

Die Wohnung ist wunderbar und die Aussicht von der Dachterrasse atemberaubend. Ed hat uns wieder zahlreiche gute Tipps gegeben; wir haben die Gespräche mit ihm sehr genossen. Es gibt hier absolut nichts zu bemängeln. Vielen herzlichen Dank und hoffentlich auf bald!

The house is lovely and met all of our needs.  The East Suite is very private and nicely appointed.  Clean, nice bed linens, comfortable bed and very nice private bath.  The roof deck as beautiful and quite a bonus on a lovely Boston afternoon or evening."
990668,31590760,2015-05-07,8716024,Jack,Spring made this stay much nicer than being stuck in the snow. The apartment was refreshed for the spring.

990668,32965110,2015-05-24,28163246,Charlotte,"Edward was a great host: welcoming and friendly and also with helpful tips about Boston as a whole as well as the neighbourhood. The apartment is amazing, almost like living in a gallery - Edward has some beautiful pieces and it felt a privilege to be staying there. To top it off, the roof deck is stunning - just a shame we weren't there long enough to take full advantage. The South End of Boston is a perfect neighbourhood from which to explore the city, and a fun but relaxed place in the evening."
990668,33575462,2015-05-30,29489631,An,"what a great place to stay at when in Boston! Ed is the nicest of hosts, very helpful (both before arriving and during the stay), quick to answer questions, always ready for a chat. I didn't think the house could possibly be as nice as the pictures suggest, but it was! the room is spacious, clean, the bathroom is perfect and the roof deck is a wonderful place to relax or work."
The south end is a great neighbourhood to discover Boston: it is central with easy access to public transport,it has lots of nice restaurants and it has a friendly,relaxed vibe.,,,
"enjoy your stay!!!\"",,,,,
990668,34585352,2015-06-09,28632375,Shannon,"I had brief but wonderful stay with Edward. The location cannot be beat with a short walk to the hustle of the popular shops and restaurants but nestled on a charming quiet street of gorgeous brownstones in the historic Back Bay/South End. Major bonus is the newly finished rooftop deck with a stunning unobstructed view of Boston. Bed was heavenly, everything was clean and pristine as described. Edward was a kind, warm, and gracious host!! Enjoyed talking with home about he city he calls home!!  I will absolutely be back for a longer stay in the future!"

Le suite con bagno privato sono comode e funzionali, la sala ampia e la cucina una piacevole opportunità di relax e la terrazza sul tetto un'esperienza davvero unica."

990668,49028220,2015-09-30,37965122,Iris,"Edward's house is really nice, very clean, with art-filled decorations, located in a peaceful community. There is a lunar eclipse took place at 28 September 2015, I was sitting on the rooftop of Edward's house, and witnessed a wonderful eclipse moon. The sea wind below from Charles River at the quiet night. I can't tell how grateful I am for having such a beautiful memory when stay at  Edward's home."

It is conveniently placed in an historic district in the heart of Boston. I could go almost anywhere in Boston on foot,which I really liked. I also enjoyed quite a few quality restaurants and shops in the neighbourhood.,,,,
I really enjoyed the cosy and friendly atmosphere of the neighbourhood at Halloween,with kids and parents walking from door to door for treats. It is a really quiet place,ideal if you need some privacy to work or relax.,,,
Ed was very effective in our communication and provided quick feedback on any inquiries. Although I was unlucky enough to have to alter my departure date and leave earlier (due to family illness),Ed kindly offered a discount for our next visit.,,,,

990668,60978316,2016-01-30,39981273,Augusto,"To date, this is the best AirBnb I've stayed at. You think the pictures look amazing? Good, because trust me Ed's house is amazing! I had the pleasure to stay here for two weeks, and it made my business trip worthwhile. I actually looked forward to going home and sleeping in my comfy bed. I had the East Bedroom Suite and it had its own private bathroom, which is great! The whole penthouse is very clean and well-maintained. I also had a nice view of the neighborhood and Boston skyline from the rooftop. The penthouse is located in South End, and I would say its the center of everything in Boston, and its easy to get around with all the bus routes and the T being about 12 minutes walk away. I didn't see Ed until the end of my stay, but he is a very kind and hospitable host. He also has a lot of good stories about his penthouse, so don't be afraid to have a conversation with him."

The rooftop has a beautiful view of the beautiful city of Boston, though due to the weather we were not able to enjoy."
Edward was a pleasure to get to know,clearly very interested in making the space beautiful and comfortable for us and other folks who stay there.  The place was immaculate with fresh white tulips decorating the wall and table in the living space.,,,,
Our room was not spacious and not what I'd call really private,as it looked over the living room and across to Edwards bedroom separated with a curtained glass door that could be opened or closed.,,,,
It was great to be able to use the one parking space in the alley behind the house,though the spiral staircase was a little scarey.,,,,
This was a perfect place for us to stay during our weeklong conference at the downtown Hyatt.,,,,,
"Restaurants in the area were superlative (Thai and Ethiopian)\"",,,,,
990668,66540388,2016-03-23,56868720,Sydney,Had an amazing time at this Airbnb. Edward was great and very helpful if needed!

990668,69833104,2016-04-14,54990658,H Sharp,"Ed was a fantastic host and great first AirBnB experience for our two night stay in Boston. We felt welcome and safe in Ed's home and the surrounding neighborhoods. Before we arrived, communication through AirBnb was top notch, leaving little for us to wonder about. Once we had checked in, Ed continued to help keep us informed, answering questions about what to do and where to eat."
We can't wait to visit Boston again and would build our trip around staying with Ed a second time. Thank you,"Ed!\"",,,,

We had already planned out most of our stay but prior to, Edward was very willing to give recommendations and was always quick to reply to questions that I had. The location is great, it was just a quick walk, uber, or Bus ride away from many of the great places Boston has to offer. The neighborhood was quiet, and safe, and we were happy to walk around the area to many restaurants, shops, and stores."
Edward's place is beautiful and was exactly as the picture depicted. It was easy for the noise to get around however,"so if you wanted more privacy it may make sense for you to get the whole place! Overall our stay was lovely and it was in a great location for our Boston trip! \"",,,,
990668,71816455,2016-04-28,33566739,Brandon,"Staying at Ed's home was an amazing experience!  I was in Boston on business for almost a week. After checking the price of hotels in the area, I checked out AirBnB. Ed's home felt so welcoming; and he made me feel even more welcomed with his detailed instructions about getting around from the airport, accessing his home and my private suite."
The penthouse boasts a great view of the city from the roof top deck. The bed was extremely comfortable and since I forgot towels,I was relieved that Ed already had the bathroom well appointed.  If you are a traveling professional looking for respite after a long day,this is where you'd want to stay. I almost wanted to stay a few more days just to enjoy the zen space Ed created throughout his house.,,,
The neighborhood is quite safe,friendly neighbors and great restaurants within walking distance. I found a Whole Foods ½ mile away and stocked up on my fav breakfast and late night snack items. I enjoyed a coupe of nights camped on the couch watching Game of Thrones and sports after my long days.,,,,
Meeting Ed was the highlight of the stay. We talked about our international travels and music.  There's even a record player in the living room if you fancy hearing a vinyl or 3.,,,,,
Thank you Ed for sharing you pristine and inspiring,"yet comfortable home. Cheers!!\"",,,,

The place itself is beautiful and in a great location in Back Bay - the description and pictures do not lie. You're right around the corner from several good restaurants and bars. Also, it's a quick 5min walk to Back Bay train station, by which you can access anything else."

990668,76859110,2016-05-29,11011086,Vanessa,"Ed's home in the South End was everything I had hoped for... welcoming, clean and in a prime location. I'm so glad that I decided against the Sheriton in favour of Ed's place. Our daily catchups and advice on what to see and do was greatly appreciated. I must be blessed to continually pick the good eggs."
990668,77521118,2016-06-01,23521997,Ana,"This was the first Airbnb experience for me and my boyfriend and it couldn't have been better, we had an absolutely wonderful time at Edward's! Before we arrived, Edward sent us all the information we could possibly need, from how to get into his house, to the wifi information and what's available for use in his home. His home is very beautiful, clean and modern, we had our own bedroom (with the biggest and comfiest bed!) with an ensuite, which was very useful, and we also had unlimited access to the rooftop deck -  the views from there were absolutely amazing especially early in the morning and late in the evening. We had everything we needed and more at Edward's, so every night when we were getting very tired from exploring Boston, we could not wait to get back home! Edward is an amazing host as well, he was always there if we needed help and he gave us lots of advice on where to go and what to do in Boston. He even provided us with an international adaptor, which was super useful! Also, the neighbourhood is absolutely beautiful, very quiet, but just around the corner there are a lot of little cafes, shops and restaurants. We had a fabulous stay at Edwards and I would definitely recommend staying at his home - you will have a great night's sleep, you will be welcomed by a kind, caring host and you will have an amazing view of the beautiful city of Boston! Thanks Edward xx"

Wir waren ständig in Kontakt und konnten ihn so z.B. uber unsere Flug-Verspätung informieren. Bei der Ankunft wurden wir mit der Wohnung vertraut gemacht und in ein paar Regeln eingewiesen, sowie mit Tips zur Stadtbesichtigung und Stadtplänen versorgt. Wir hatten ein Gastzimmer mit Bad in seiner Wohnung bezogen und das Zimmer sowie Bad waren sehr sauber und geräumig. Grosser Pluspunkt war die Dachterrasse mit herrlichem Blick. Die Lage ist ausgezeichnet; die Nachbarschaft ist schön und hat viel zu bieten: Abwechslungsreiche Cafes und kleine Restaurants sowie Geschäfte."

Ich reise viel beruflich wie privat und dieses Mal war ich auf einer 10-tägigen Geschäftsreise in den USA mit einem Zwischenstopp in Boston über das Wochenende. Ich bevorzuge es in den Innenstädten meine Unterkunft zu beziehen damit ich möglichst alles zu Fuß erkunden kann. Ein guter Freund von mir – ein anerkannter Experte mit viel Erfahrung in AirBnB - empfahl mir doch einmal diese Art der Unterkunft auszuprobieren. So kam ich über die AirBnB Suchmaschine auf diese fantastische Unterkunft von Ed in Boston.,,,,,
Ich hatte also bisher überhaupt keine Erfahrung aber das Erste was mich sehr beindruckt hat war die Art der Kommunikation,wenn es um eine Frage ging. Ed hat alle Fragen quasi in Echtzeit über die AirBnB Chat- oder Emailfunktion beantwortet. Sehr professionell !,,,,
Bei der Ankunft hat man überhaupt nicht das übliche Gefühl schon wieder ein neues Hotel einzuziehen. Es ist eher das Gefühl einen guten Freund an einem sehr schönen Ort in einer bisher unbekannten Stadt zu besuchen.,,,,,
Grundsätzlich hatte ich das Gefühl das Haus von Ed ist in einer eher wohlhabenden und sicheren Ecke von Boston. Alles ist sehr ruhig und sauber um sich sofort sehr wohl zu fühlen. Ed erlaubte mir neben meinen luxuriösen Privatgemächern auch das Wohn- und Esszimmer,die Küche und das Terrassendach zu nutzen. Mein privater Bereich mit Schlafbereich und Bad war ebenfalls absolut perfekt. Man möge mir glauben,ich habe schon viele sehr gute und luxuriöse Hotels überall auf der Welt über die Jahre gesehen. Häufig war der Preis sehr hoch und es gab im Vergleich zu Ed viel weniger Platz und Komfort.,,,
Rund um Ed´s Haus findet man sehr viele Plätze für Frühstück,Mittagessen und Abendessen oder auch zum Einkaufen,wenn man den Küchenbereich und die Dachterrasse von Ed benutzen möchte. Darüber hinaus ist Ed´s Haus der ideale Startpunkt um die ganze Stadt zu Fuß zu erkunden. Ich hatte leider nur einen Sonntag Zeit,aber ich konnte bei fantastischem Wetter den Freedom Trail erkunden. Darüber hinaus empfehle ich die Parks „Boston Common“ und „Public Park“ !,,
Ed ist ein Guter ! Er hieß mich bei der Ankunft herzlich willkommen und wir hatten viele gute Gespräche in diesen wenigen Tagen. Er erklärte mir,wie ich am besten zu den beeindrucktesten und interessantesten Plätzen in Boston kommen würde. Ed ist ein echter Gentlemen,gut gebildet hat einen weltoffenen und internationalen Hintergrund. Letztendlich kann ich sagen,alles war perfekt von Ed organisiert.,,
Dieser erste AirBnB – Aufenthalt bei Ed war richtiges Glück und ich bin mir sehr sicher,dass ich in Zukunft diese Art Unterkunft wesentlich häufiger machen werde. Es war ein großartige Erfahrung und noch einmal vielen Dank an Ed. Bei der nächsten Reise würde ich gerne meine Familie mitnehmen und dann gemeinsam ein paar Tage Boston erkunden. Wenn wir Glück haben,klappt es wieder bei Ed !,,,

990668,87811167,2016-07-21,20756926,Paul,Edward is rated as a super host and it shows the moment you have contact with him on email and in person. He is always willing to help with advice about thing to see and do.  His place is in perfect condition and is only 8 minute walk from the T station (subway) and some of the best shopping in the city at Copley Center. There is a full size Star grocery store at Copley Center with fair prices.  We felt very safe walking in and around his neighborhood.  We are veteran Airbnb travelers and rate this as one of our most enjoyable experiences.  Paul and Dianne

I had the pleasure of staying for a month. Ed is a responsive and accommodating host. His apartment is 8-10 minutes walk to a couple of T stops,and a short walk to a large supermarket (Star Market at Prudential Center). There are restaurants nearby - and a Caffe Nero as well!,,,,
It was my first time using airbnb,and Ed has set the bar very high! Communication was easy,and he made sure that I was aware of any other guests who might be staying in the apartment while I was there.,,,
If I were to visit Boston again,"I would certainly hope Ed's place is available!\"",,,,
14086516,87610822,2016-07-21,84783552,John,I was traveling to a conference in Boston and could not find a room for my last night.    Althea took me in on short notice and made my stay very comfortable.
14086516,88097270,2016-07-23,75125990,Andrew,Great host. She was very welcoming accommodating to my schedule while I was in town. I was thankful to have a good room and full access to my own bathroom. I was even personally driven to the station to catch my flight home on time. I highly recommend and would stay here if I find myself in Boston again!

The house is good,clean,"quiet.Hope to stay again.You may take bus 21 to get there from subway station.About 15 minutes.\"",,,
14086516,89643458,2016-07-29,76478359,Sarah,Althea is a great hostess and the location was very convenient for me. I would definitely stay with her again!
14086516,90965657,2016-08-03,85210740,Nekky,"It was a nice experience with Althea  on Air b& b in Boston. Althea and her husband are wonderful hosts,it was my first time with Airb&b and I had a wonderful experience with them.Althea is so kind and caring she made sure everyone is ok and she helped me with a lot of things and she kept checking on me to make sure I am ok.The house and the rooms are so spacious,clean and nice!! and is exactly as in the picture.Althea place is located in a beautiful neighbourhood and it is so close to the metro and bus station.I will surely stay with her again!!!."
14086516,91898826,2016-08-07,83385873,Ifeanyi,"Althea is a naturally talented host. From the moment I arrived, she was friendly, accessible and showed me around. She is a very clean person and does a phenomenal job of keeping the house looking gorgeous and homely. My significant other came to visit and she welcomed her so well. She even made us dinner. My wife said she felt at home away from home. As my first experience with AirBNB, Althea made it worthwhile and definitely encourages me to want to use the service again for my future travels. I got to stop writing but Althea was definitely the best host in town. Her husband was great to chat with. Really cool couple with a heart for hospitality and grace. They know no strangers!"
14086516,92659608,2016-08-09,49510457,Andro,"Lovely family, very clean, welcoming, friendly and helpful. Everything was perfect! I enjoyed my stay with them and I will definitely recommend Althea to my friends and will stay at her place in my following visits to Boston."
13266133,81022808,2016-06-20,36878122,Simon,"It was such an awesome experience that I will never forget, the layout of the whole room I was amazed when I first saw it, it's just so artsy! She is a very thoughtful person that she knows what you need. The area is close to downtown by taking subways. I strongly recommend visitors to stay in her place and you won't be disappointed at all! Her personality is gorgeous, a loving personality and an attitude of loving the life. Once again, I strongly recommend her place!"
13266133,83767005,2016-07-04,28477063,Eduardo,"Alexia's place was great. Everything on the pictures is accurate. I didn't get a chance to meet Alexia but we were communicating before and during my stay.   The bed was really comfortable and the whole place itself has a great vibe. Once I entered the room I was surprised with a nice goodies basket, so great. The bedsheets, towels, bathroom and overall place were very clean and tidy. I was received by Minshu, Alexia's roommate, and she wait for me to open the door at 2am as my flight got delayed. Unfortunately I couldn't get to talk much to Minshu or Giulia as my travel purpose was for work. I wish I could've enjoy the place more. There was a porch with a hammock that looked so relaxing and Alexia has a great book collection. I recommend Alexia's place to everyone. Alexia you are a great host and will stay again on my next trip to Boston."
4216208,30385263,2015-04-21,27857515,Nate,Elaine was very welcoming and had information for us set up when we arrived. She was able to answer all our questions as well.
She gave us space; the unit was on the third floor of a three-apartment house. The apartment looks like it was recently renovated and is spacious. The house was in a neighborhood south of Boston,right near a commuter rail. The commuter rail does not come as often as the T,but it is nice (comparable to Amtrak) and runs on time.,,,
All in all,"I highly recommend staying with Elaine.\"",,,,
4216208,30724486,2015-04-26,29010651,Reece,Nice Appartment. Close to public transport in nice neighborhood. Host is lovely with good communication to make sure you feel at home.
4216208,31796300,2015-05-10,30370900,Jiyong,"She was a wonderful and well prepared host. We arrived very late, but she welcomed us. Also she made us happy by some gifts and careful memos. She was a good communicator too."
4216208,32534145,2015-05-19,2989582,Susan,"Laine gave us extensive info about how to get in, where to park, what to expect, all of which smoothed our late- night arrival. The listing was accurate, though in my opinion understated the amount of space in the apartment.  The beds were comfortable and we felt at home.  Laine was attentive and helpful, as well as gracious.  The space was a little rustic, in the sense of slightly unfinished and not exactly sparkly clean, all the while supplying our needs well.  We couldn't get the TV to work, but weren't really disappointed, as we had a lot going on.  The stay was a real value."
4216208,32987714,2015-05-24,30817443,Anatol,"We liked the place very much. The house is authentic which we loved. We felt save in the neighbourhood and were able to park right outside the house. The apartment was bright and spacy and laine welcomed us with orange juice and muffins in the fridge. There even were childrens books for our kids, which we appreciated very much. We could have used a few more dishes and equipment for cooking/eating in. Definetly can recomend staying at Laines!"
4216208,36380514,2015-06-28,31180773,Cristiano,"The experience was wonderful, the house is very well located. The hospitality Laine is amazing, very helpful and friendly. She spent all information and tips. The house is excellent and very safe, with very easy access to subway and train for the entire city. The house is close to markets, restaurants, pharmacy and car rentals."
4216208,37874539,2015-07-11,6216235,Eric,Laine was a great host. Everything we needed was right there. The third floor apartment was spacious. One great benefit was the easy of accessing public transportation. The commuter line into South Station was a five minute walk. The space was in an urban neighborhood which was great for former city dwellers. We would stay again when visiting Boston.
4216208,39284698,2015-07-22,33978165,Jessica,"Elaine was AMAZING, one of the sweetest people I have ever met!"
The appartment was very clean when we got there,we were given fresh towels and face cloths and had plenty of clean dishes to use!,,,,
She made sure we had access to all important information like what restaurants were around,different transit booklets,etc.. She even helped us clean up when we accandetally smashed our own window to our car. She made us feel very safe and welcome and was an absolute pleasure to speak with!,,,
The appartment was close to a Walgreens which we were able to get the basic food for a week,and was extremely close to everything - it was a 25$ cab ride to Fenway park,and a 10 minute drive downtown.,,,
All in all,"I would reccomend staying with Elaine as everything about our stay with her was perfect!\"",,,,
4216208,41072712,2015-08-04,1826554,Lijsbeth,"Great apartment with lots of room, spacious. Great kitchen, huge fridge, nice dining room etc. But best of all, Elaine was super welcoming and great tips for where to shop, where to eat out etc."
The one thing that wasn't as expected was the wifi,"but it turned out that it was okay if  you didn't use more than three devices at the same time (admittedly we are heavy users ;-))\"",,,,
4216208,41493054,2015-08-07,7334059,Rachel,"Elaine was very attentive (replied quickly to all phone and email communication) and helpful throughout our stay.    The apartment was spacious, and in a very friendly and quiet neighborhood.  We loved the third floor balcony!!   We were a bit disappointed that the apartment was not actually in Boston (the listing said the apartment was in the city itself, when in fact, it was in Dorchester), and we would have preferred a kitchen that was more stocked with cooking tools and had more counter space, but all in all it was a good home base for our travels!"
4216208,42127140,2015-08-11,32863844,Quan,"Laine is a very kind host, she met us upon our arrival and gave us muffins and orange juice for breakfast.  She took the time to answer our questions about the unit and about what to do in Boston. Laine was very responsive to us when we contacted her during the whole stay."
The unit is on the 3rd floor and a spiral staircase to the unit.  The apartment is spacious with 2 bedrooms,one with a queen bed and the other with 2 twin beds.  We stayed there for 4 nights.,,,,
It seems that the apartment was going through various repairs but not-yet completed,which are not shown in the pictures.  The walls have patches of dry wall repairs,some patched have been covered up with drywall mud but not yet painted.  At some places the repairs are still exposed.,,,
The front door has one busted dead-bolt and another dead-bolt was added above the broken one.  The living room has an old sofa,the coffee table has one broken leg with a note taped to it to caution us.    There is an old tube TV with over-the-air channels.  The dining room has a dining table with 4 chairs,they are in good condition for daily use.  There is WiFi service but the speed is very slow.,,,
The kitchen is spacious but not clean.  There is no microwave.  There is only one pot,a large size,and one pan,also large.  There is a wooden trash bin but no trash bag,we had to use the empty grocery bags to collect the wet and food trashes.  We used the wooden trash bin to collect the plastic bottles for recycle since they are dry.  There are four sets of bowls and dishes to use with enough utensils for the guest.,
Each bed room has a fan since the unit has no A/C. The mattresses were reasonable firm and comfortable. The queen bed still has plastic cover for the box spring but the plastic got torn up in various places.  The walls in the bedrooms have patchy repairs therefore make them look old and not clean.,,,,,
The bath room is probably the worst spot in the apartment.  The sink is very small without any power outlets or room to place any personal care items.  The wall has repair spots,the sink,the tub and the floor are not clean.  The bath tub drained very slow.,,,
I had no problem with parking in front of the unit.  The street is quiet most of the time. Traffic on the side street could be noisy at night if you leave the window open.,,,,,
"It's a spacious apartment but not clean.  Furniture are old and some are broken.  The pictures do not represent the true state of the apartment.\"",,,,,
4216208,43375106,2015-08-19,36376143,Emmalee,"The Host: Awesome! She got us a jug of OJ and some muffins from the local market. She provided us with some soap and shampoo, a couple of toilet paper rolls, and nicely folded towels with a little bar of soap on top for each of us (very hotel-like!). There were even tour brochures that she had left for us. This was far beyond my expectations!"
The Apartment: Very simple. The building itself shows the true history of the neighborhood. For the price we paid,we didn't expect it to be a 5-star-looking hotel. The place was clean and bugs free! (very important) The living room had a good old working CRT tv and the kitchen had everything we needed. There were even board games! The beds were ok and the washroom was pretty neat. It would've been awesome if there was AC! Also,we think that the place can look even better with a new paint job.,,,
The Location: I would say about a good 20 minutes drive from the city center,but that never bothered us. To be honest,when we had first arrived,we were kinda intimidated by the type of neighborhood we were in. However,we eventually all agreed that everyone there greeted us with such friendliness and respect that we started to think that the people back home were more rude.,
In summary: We loved the hostess. We enjoyed the place. AC would've been nice,but we survived =P. And being in that location really made us come out of our comfort zone and it was a fun experience for us (if that made any sense at all haha).,,,,
A BIG thank you again,Elaine,for making our very first AirBnB experience a very pleasant one. Hopefully we can one day come back again (and this time with AC,"maybe? =P)\"",,
4216208,44437092,2015-08-26,50211,Celia,"Hi! Some comments about the appartment that I think other travelers should know. It is not located in Boston, but in Dorchester. It's in a popular neighbourhood, mostly african american, and with some services around, such as a Wallgreens or a Dunkin Donuts. It is close to an Amtrak station where you can take the train to central Boston. It only takes 20 minutes. But be puctual, because there is only one train per hour!"
The appartment is located in the last floor of a wooden house. It's a very old building that Elaine and her husband are renovating. For the time being,it's in the middle of the process. The appartment needs to be painted urgently. The walls were full of plasters,and some doors were stained with humidity. The kitchen would need extra utensils if you intend to cook something. There's also a question of cleanness that we talked to Elaine,and that I think whe is now aware of. Finally,some of the furniture is also very old or broken (as the TV,for example
I have to say,though,"that Elaine was a nice and helpful owner. She bought us an extra fan because we arrived to Boston in the middle of a heat wave and the appartment was really hot. And she invited s to muffins and orange juice! Her appartment is a good option because it's an affordable and well communicated option. But it needs some improvement to make it more comfortable.\"",,,
4216208,47048999,2015-09-15,4831355,Bart,Laine was a very helpful and good host. She welcomed us personally with orange juice and muffins! The house is well located near the commuter train to Boston. It is also easy to park your car in front of the house. The appartment has a lot of potential. The kitchen needs some small improvements to make it a perfect place to stay when visiting Boston.
4216208,48020801,2015-09-22,38490961,Ammy,"Thanks for everything from Laine. The house was beautiful with good ventilation. Laine was so nice and friendly, thanks so much for bring us the breakfast. The house is very well located and safety. I highly recommend the place to live."
4216208,48706728,2015-09-28,39967073,Veronica,Laine made us feel very welcome. We got there a little early but the cleaning team allowed us to leave our stuff. They were very friendly. We had a place to park and we were a block from the bus stop and the commuter train. This was a great place to stay.
4216208,49699261,2015-10-05,36426043,Marie-Laure,Les clés nous attendaient dans une boîte à code : Laine a très bien organisée notre venue un peu tardive ... et nous a apporté des muffins pour nous accueillir dans son charmant appartement.
Laine est très accueillante,et également très réactive lorsque nous avons eu besoin de chauffage.,,,,
"L'appartement est agréable avec son parquet en bois et très bien situé à coté du Commuter Trail : 20 mn de South Station au cœur de Boston.\"",,,,,
4216208,51013715,2015-10-17,38432546,Frank,"Der Empfang war sehr liebevoll. Laine hat uns gleich Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und U-Bahn gezeigt. Pizza, Snacks, Getränke waren zu Fuß erreichbar. Ich kann nichts Negatives sagen. Die Verbindung nach Boston über öffentliche Verkehrsmittel war nah und gut zu erreichen. Ich / wie haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Ich / wir würden die Unterkunft wieder buchen bei einem nächsten Besuch von Boston."
4216208,51437531,2015-10-20,14792200,Thomas,"Expérience très positive de notre séjour chez Laine. L'appartement est spacieux et situé dans une maison typique au sein d'un quartier populaire de Boston (proche du centre ville en transport en commun) Laine nous a sympathiquement reçu à notre arrivée et est restée disponible durant notre séjour, nous avons apprécié son accueil chalereux."
4216208,52577985,2015-10-31,41593489,Andrej,"We stayed there 5 days as a family of four. The apartment is large and we had plenty of space. The equipment is basic but it was sufficient for our needs. Laine the host was very forthcoming. She checked back often to see if we need something. We arrived by car and while there is a commuter rail station just around the corner (trains run every hour) we preferred to take the car one mile to the Ashmont T station from where the trains go every 5 to 10 minutes. Laine also told us about a bus connection to the Ashmont station. Around Ashmont there is resident parking only but we parked on a parking lot which seemed to be public, next to a church."
4216208,54287839,2015-11-17,13717923,Chris,Enjoyed our stay. Very easy to get to down town Boston. Very large older wooden home. Good place to stay for the price.

4216208,57510083,2015-12-27,1677937,James,"The house was fabulous for a long stay in Boston with three people. It felt like home. Laine was gracious host, very friendly and great energy as was Nam. I grew up in Boston and this location was perfect for being close to family and going into the city. The beds were super comfy and the neighborhood was very quiet. Dunkin donuts, two bodegas, a BBQ take-out restaurant, a Chinese take-out restaurant, and a sub shop were within three minutes walk of the house as well as the commuter rail into Boston. I will stay here again. Thanks Laine & Nam"
4216208,66606958,2016-03-23,6410590,Bianca,The Apartment was huge and lovely furnitured. Also well Equipment in The kitchen and bathroom. Our host was really nice and helpful and gave us recommendations for Shops and Public Transport. Because it needs 45 Minutes to go to downtown and there are no restaurants or Shops nearby. A good cost/effectiveness.
4216208,67495023,2016-03-29,42323693,Charline,"L'appartement est spacieux et bien situé (à 5 minutes de l'arrêt de train), il n'y a qu'un train par heure. 20 minutes pour se rendre à south station. À 5 minutes des cafés, fast-food et supermarché. Bien accueillis avec muffins et jus d'orange. Le wifi n'a fonctionné que le premier jour. Le lit 2 personne pourrait être plus confortable. Les lits simples sont très bien."
4216208,68673140,2016-04-06,32018155,Sam,"We absolutely adored Boston, and Laine's apartment suited us perfectly. Situated within walking distance of the subway, commuter rail and supermarket (about 20mins away), the apartment had everything we needed. The bedrooms, bathroom and kitchen were clean and had all we needed, and the apartment was warm at all times. It accommodated four of us easily, and communication with Laine was excellent. Highly recommend to anyone looking to visit Boston and wants an experience in staying in a residential spot as opposed to the city."
4216208,69267361,2016-04-10,55144465,Navin,Laine was great as a host and we were delighted to be welcomed to a warm and friendly gesture with Cookies and Juice. The flexibility extended to all the way till check- out where we were allowed to use the house for a few hours beyond the required check- out time as well. The house was well stocked with all essentials and the description was 100% accurate. Its actually more beautiful than what was shown in the pictures.
Its fairly well accessible with a train station at a short walking distance,however trains to this station are not as frequent as other stations. Buses to South station which is big hub and connects all lines is a 2 min walk. We traveled for the first time with a baby and it was very comfortable.,,,,
Good Luck Elaine and hope to meet again in the future.,,,,,

4216208,70629681,2016-04-19,27349819,Matthew,"Laine and Nam are awesome. They are both super friendly. Laine came by and welcomed me on my first evening. I really felt like a welcome guest.  The apartment is great.  Light and airy, easy to use, and well located. I would definitely recommend."
4216208,72387969,2016-05-02,28183719,Christophe,"Bright and very spacious apartment on the third floor in a quiet neighbourhood, yet two blocks away from the train line that takes you directly to downtown -great location."
Although this is an older home which requires additional renovation,the apartment is very clean and functional,"perfect for a family vacation.\"",,,
4216208,73875829,2016-05-11,43723004,Lisa,The host canceled this reservation 23 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4216208,74966127,2016-05-17,55746877,Audrey,Le séjour c'est très bien passé. L'appartement est plutôt rudimentaire mais propre et confortable. 20min à pied du métro. Laine avait tout préparé et était dispo en cas de questions.
4216208,76857517,2016-05-29,57319508,Terry,"This apartment shows signs of effort and renovation will eventually be in much better shape than it is currently.  Currently it is missing doors, has holes in ceiling, and not all the vent covers are in place.  It was extremely challenging to keep a nearly 2 year old out of the room with cleaning, painting, and tools out of trouble since the door was missing.  There was no cooling other than a ceiling fan and 2 electric fans.  Unfortunately, it turned hot during our visit and being on the 3rd floor made it pretty uncomfortable at night to sleep.  The mattress in the master bedroom should be replaced.  The price was a bargain so we were not expecting 5 star quality, but this was rough with kids.    Transportation was also an issue.  We were not as close to the T as we though we would be and with the two small children we opted for Uber for all of our trips.  However, we did see signs of ongoing work to make this a nice place.  Also, Laine did stay in touch via text and email during our stay and was very welcoming and friendly.  This was my first stay at an Airbnb so I don't have anything to compare to, but this was not quite what I expected."
4216208,81603023,2016-06-24,2946896,Brandy,"Laine is such a kind, friendly host! My birthday was during our stay and she even surprised me with some amazing cookies! She was flexible and great at keeping the lines of communication open while we were in Boston."
My boyfriend and I absolutely loved the apartment. It's a veeeery spacious third floor unit full of character. We walked to the commuter rail every day (maybe a 5 minute walk) and took the train into Boston. We never felt unsafe on our walks and the 20 minute train ride into downtown was a nice way to see more of the area. We had driven up from Florida and had no problems finding parking around Laine's place.,,,,,
I definitely recommend this apartment to anyone looking to save money and still feel safe on a trip to Boston. Thanks for everything,"Laine!\"",,,,
4216208,82855338,2016-06-29,72428288,Mert,"This is a full third level section with two bedrooms. One had a double size bed and the other had two separate beds. Laine, the owner, arranged the beds positions for us since we were two couples but the size and heights of the beds were different so it was a different experience for me and my wife. The bathroom was renovated but it was a bit small and the shower head was lower than me but please notice I am almost 190 cm height."
Laine was kind to us. She informed us about an issue and offered full refund if we do not want to stay due to that.,,,,,
Since this is an historic and old house,do not wait a totally modern,clean and shiny place. The space was enough big for us. There was available park spots in front of the house. The neighborhood was not really quite when we were there but eventually neither we nor our car had any harm or problem. Boston is very expensive so this place is nice if you're gonna spent short time in the city. First make your search carefully,"then list your options and finally make your decision. \"",,

Elaine checked in on us throughout our stay to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed!"
4216208,89256824,2016-07-27,69049927,Isabelle,"Beaucoup d'espace, près du train de banlieue et aucun souci de stationnement. Laine a été très disponible à nos besoins avant et durant le séjour. L'appartement n'est pas de la première jeunesse, mais pour un court séjour c'était suffisant. Il n'y a pas d'air climatisé, ce qui a été problématique puisqu'il y a eu une canicule tout au long de notre séjour."
4216208,90617794,2016-08-01,26649851,Patrick,This place is amazingly beautiful. Clean and there is plenty of room. Laine is very kind and does evrything to help.
The location is safe. We were travelling with our two kids and never felt danger in the area,even near midnight.,,,,
It is close to buses (1 min.),"so it is easy to go downtown Boston.\"",,,,
4216208,91940673,2016-08-07,68406397,Liesbeth,We enjoyed our stay in the apartment and Laine is a very friendly and helpful host. She had some good tips for transport to downtown Boston and nearby eateries and large supermarket.
4216208,94134166,2016-08-14,60616931,Deborah,The host was very kind and always  available. Unfortunately internet wasn't working properly but she always tried to find a solution. The neighbourhood was safe and well communicated.
4216208,96413254,2016-08-22,46579980,Chiara,"Appartamento spazioso al terzo piano di una casa storica nei sobborghi di Boston. Ha due camere da letto, una con letto matrimoniale e l'altra con due letti singoli, due verande. La casa non è fresca e non essendo presente l'aria condizionata, sconsiglio di pernottarci in periodi particolarmente caldi. Laine è stata disponibilissima e sempre presente per ogni esigenza."
1494726,18761984,2014-08-31,837122,Rea,"Maria was so warm and welcoming, she made us feel like we were home. She went above and beyond simply providing a room to stay and made sure we had everything we needed to feel comfortable. Being a couple newly moving to Boston, Maria went out of her way to help us connect with realtors and to get settled into our new apartment. The accommodations were private, clean, and homey, much like having a small studio with a private entrance and bathroom. You do have access to the kitchen in the main part of the house and if you have the opportunity, make sure you get a chance to spend some time with Maria and Mike in her eclectic kitchen or beautiful back porch."
1494726,32641304,2015-05-19,29822967,Brawn,"\"Stayed with Maria and Michael for 5 nights. They are very nice people who went out of their way to make it an enjoyable experience for us. I checked in late with my wife and Maria was there to greet us despite having to go to work early the next morning. She gave us a detailed orientation of the place and clearly articulated the house rules. The advertised room is essentially a private suite located in the basement (but very well maintained, decorated, and spacious) with water bottles, cups, and utensils available to use, a couple of Charlie cards, info. about and discounts for museums, and a private fridge conveniently located outside the room. You have your own private bathroom, roomy living room, and a queen sized real bed. They made sure we had plenty of bottled waters, tea bags, cups, candies, oranges, etc. The place also have a well tendered and scenic garden (with lights on at night, it is Christmas every day), is close to public trans, and is within 40-50 minutes to downtown Boston. Laundry, light cooking, and hair dryer are available upon request and our privacy was always respected. I told Maria she is underselling her place as her posted pictures do not fully depict her lovely place and I stand by that statement. Maria and Michael enjoyed talking with us and Michael even thoughtfully gave me a John Grisham novel prior to our departure. The description of the place should more accurately read \"\"Private deluxe suite with private bathroom"
1494726,34595185,2015-06-09,31416492,Maryam,It was more than a clean and quiet room; I had an extremely great time with
"Maria & Michael. They are lovely & kind. I was blessed to meet such incredible people.\"",,,,,
1494726,35613769,2015-06-20,34736011,Akilah,My five night stay with Maria and Michael was excellent. From the moment my son & I arrived Maria explained basic house rules and made us feel completely welcomed in her home. Privacy downstairs was not an issue at all and we were more than welcomed to join them upstairs. The space downstairs was enough for 2 and the bed was very comfortable. Thanks again to both Maria & Michael for having us and it's great knowing we're welcomed to stop by & say hello.
1494726,39904371,2015-07-27,15477172,Peter,"Very accommodating hostess; allowed us to use the back deck with a lovely garden. When we opened he refrigerator, we saw it was stocked with drinks. This basement apartment is within walking distance to Roslindale Square, which has many restaurants and a farmer's market in the summer months."
1494726,43455511,2015-08-19,19199011,Tim,"Maria and her husband  were gracious hosts.  Both provided helpful information on directions, food and transportation.  The accommodations were as clean and as represented in the listing.  The refrigerator with beverages was a welcome perk."
1494726,52719060,2015-11-01,3552337,Russell,"I stayed at Maria's place for a month and had a wonderful experience. It's a lovely place to stay!! The room is in the basement of the house. It's a large suite that you have to yourself with a comfy bed, full bathroom, mini fridge, and a table with chairs. I couldn't have asked for a better setup."
The place is a s another bus stop 10 minutes walk away which another 3 buses pass that take you to Forest Hills. You can also walk to Roslindale Square in 15-20 min where there are a lot of nice restaurants and bars.,,,,,
Maria and Michael were the best hosts as well - always willing to help with anything. They offered excellent suggestions for what to do in Roslindale and Boston. Visit their wine shop in Roslindale square if you stay with them!,,,,,
Overall,"I would stay at their place again in a heartbeat. You should too!\"",,,,
1494726,66621417,2016-03-23,3406441,Geoffrey,"\"I was searching for somewhere near Futura Studios and found this AirBnB.  Maria (Columbian) and Michael (Irish) were the best hosts ever.  They made sure I had a constant supply of water, fruit juice and unsweetened coconut and soy - and even went against a decades-old tradition of no bacon.  They are great company, excellent conversation, and were generous with their time and rides down to the studio next to the liquor store they own.  The room was exactly as described, with a fun LED shower head in the bathroom.  I don't know where they buy their towels, but they were incredible...  Although there are two adorable (and not demandingly sociable) cats upstairs, there was absolutely no trace of them in my area.  I can be allergic to things, often in lower levels, but this place was totally spotless and actually more comfortable in some ways than my own home...  The only slight drawback to the space was a beam - and if I was any taller than 6 feet, I might have had trouble.  Not recommended if you are 6'2\"\" ... but on the whole the package was just lovely and I hope to return.\""
1494726,83383234,2016-07-02,39288459,Annette,Maria and Michael were the consummate hosts. I was welcomed with fresh flowers and a variety of refreshments. The only thing lacking was turn down device with chocolates on my pillow at night!!
4054079,22533815,2014-11-09,16644413,Maria,"My trip to Boston was wonderful! & because I had a great place to stay at it made my trip even better. The place is sooo close to the Stonybrook Station (less than a 5 minute walk) & there are at least 3 convenience stores in that area if you need any last minute items. Oh, the Sam Adams Brewery is literally right behind this building! You are so close to it & yes, I went (& it's also free with beer tasting!) Also, the main street with all the restaurants and shops is not a far walk from this place. It took me 15 mins (mind you, I have short legs.. lol)."
All in all,I had a great time. Liz met up with me when I arrived there and she was very nice. She provided me with small things I needed like shampoo and soap and a hair dryer. The place had everything that I needed to feel comfortable during my stay. The wi-fi went off for awhile but she responded to my messages right away and fixed it pronto.,,,,
"You will not regret staying with them if you decide to visit Boston `:)\"",,,,,
4054079,22953457,2014-11-18,13637574,Martin,"Had an amazing time staying at Liz and Dale's studio in Jamaica Plain; it is a cozy, well lit, comfortable space that is INCREDIBLY close to the T. Liz met me there and was extremely accommodating with the wifi and showing me around.  She was even flexible with the check in and check out times which was much appreciated.  Great place, great host, great time and we will be sure to look them up next time we are in Boston."
4054079,23043143,2014-11-21,16965279,Christine,"I booked this for my parents when they came to vist. Liz & Dale are super friendly, accommodating and sweet folks. There was a glitch with the heat the first night, but they were quick to try to fix it and offer alternatives, and they moved my parents to their other AirBnB in JP at no extra charge the next day. Both places are super clean, nice, and have all the basic amenities."
This specific location is very close to the train station (Stony Brook) and is easy to get to. It's also close to the Sam Adams brewery,and a local coffee shop and restaurant.,,,,
I will definitely book with Dale and Liz for future family and friends who come to visit. I highly recommend staying at either of their AirBnB places.,,,,,
"Thanks for being great hosts!\"",,,,,
4054079,23190908,2014-11-24,12981752,Aileen,Our host was wonderful! She let us check in early and helped us by giving us some feedback of what is good near the area. You can literally walk to the station and we were 2 girls and felt safe even when taking a walk from the station or a lyft. Definitely recommend this location!
4054079,23599383,2014-12-06,23126261,Amir,"My girlfriend and I were there for a week and enjoyed the place. The location is great, as promised just a two minute walk from the T. The apartment really had everything we needed."
The host were very nice,"responsive and helpful. Overall a good experience. \"",,,,
4054079,26327383,2015-02-09,26743465,Erica,Dale and Liz were very timely with their communications with me and provided wonderful support during my stay. They even went above and beyond and helped me out when my flight was cancelled and I needed to print my new train ticket. A huge perk was being able to use their parking space as recent snowstorms left the side streets impossible for parking. I recommend this studio apartment!
4054079,27423953,2015-03-04,22469769,Quentis,"Liz was very helpful getting me settled in. The place was nice, clean, and had everything I needed. I went to Boston during February so there was a lot of snow making parking difficult in a congested area. Of course Liz and Dale couldn't do much about that. I would recommend."
4054079,28513233,2015-03-25,4006733,Frank,"Although I didn't meet Dale or Liz, they were very good hosts. The apartment was clean and tidy and very close to the T. We could reach them anytime and they were extremely quick in responding to requests or inquiries. Would definitely recommend this lodging for couples wanting to experience JP!"
4054079,29108695,2015-04-04,17923638,Michael,It was a nice stay here in Jamaica Plain. Good communication with Liz and a nice home for a while. Thanks for everything. Michael

There is no real kitchen but everything (little microwave, fridge etc) to feel you do not need one. Dale and Liz gave us a warm welcome and were always available. They have a webpage with all useful info on the neighborhood and beyond. Thank you Dale and Liz for being such great, kind and thougtful hosts. Take care. Jennie & Yohan"

Dale and Liz provide a list of local favorites if you're looking for some inspiration. The hosts were quite friendly and accommodating; they allowed us to drop our luggage before check-in since we had arrived on an early train."
4054079,41985878,2015-08-10,37492449,Thierry,"Exactly as described, but bigger, and even closer to the T than expected ! :)"

4054079,52971189,2015-11-03,40775521,Ryan,"Dale and Liz were awesome. We could not have asked for better hosts for our trip to Boston. Their place is clean, comfortable, and literally seconds from the T. A great experience all the way around. Thanks!"
4054079,53209085,2015-11-06,11940385,Laura,"Dale & Liz were on the job with answering our questions regarding the apt and even contacted us before our arrival to explain the bathroom floor, which was purely cosmetic. The apt was spotless and parking was easy, which was important since I was traveling with my 81 yo mother. The location was convenient with food and drink just a few blocks in every direction. Made our stay in Boston a breeze!"
4054079,54870088,2015-11-25,22367659,Martin,"We had a great time in Boston, this location was really convenient, you can be in the train in one minute, and it's really easy to go anywhere using public transportation."
Liz and Dale where really helpful and responsive,we arrived early in the morning and they helped us leave our bags in a small private area while we went out for the day.,,,,
The apartment was really clean and it has everything you need for a short stay,we enjoyed watching movies in their TV while eating pizza we reheated in the small electronic oven.,,,,

I didn't actually get to stay there as I had reserved it for my brother and his wife over the holidays (my home is around the corner and only has 1 guest room which went to my mother) but both brother and sis-in-law said it was very comfortable and had everything that they needed (good coffee included)! From my perspecitve, Liz and Dale were both extremely responsive and very helpful & nice throughout the entire process of reserving it!  I highly recommend their air b&b!"
4054079,58969645,2016-01-05,10971094,A. Minetta,"The apartment is great and perfect for anyone visiting the city for vacation.

Communication before we arrived was clear and we felt comfortable going there.,,,,,
The apartment is spacious for two,close to the T,close to a coffee shop/cafe with healthy foods,and in a quiet,but not deserted neighborhood. All the things we could need for this short stay were here. SUPER comfy ergonomic chairs!,

She was very helpful and knowledgeable with answering all of my questions. The apartment was exactly as expected. It was very easy to find, clean, and cozy. I would highly recommend staying here, and we cannot wait to stay here again for our next trip to Boston."

4054079,69815581,2016-04-13,4365826,Sarah,"Everything was as described. I care a lot about the bed quality and this bed was super comfortable-seemed to at least have a memory foam top. Didn't look to see what type it was. Street parking was easy. Love the super close proximity to the T station- you can hear the train, but it isn't intrusive. Was able to get into the heart of Boston in 15 minutes or so but enjoyed walking to some restaurants in the nearby area. It is walkable to a Whole Foods (my fave grocery) and on the same street as Ula Cafe (which we knew and loved prior to our stay) and Sam Adams Brewery. Would stay again. Another bonus is having keyless entry so you don't have to fiddle with a key. I want to do this for my house. My only issue is that they had a Glade plug in being used when we arrived. I had to unplug and air out because artificial scents like that really bother me. Causes me to cough and sneeze. Once we unplugged the plug in, it actually smelled better the next day."

The studio was bright and cozy, and was in perfect order when we arrived. Loved the shower and the location. A very short walk to the Orange Line, and several great restaurants nearby (try Chilacates!). There was an awesome fair in the park across the street over the weekend with live music! Free parking was also a huge plus, but keep an eye on those street cleaning signs."
The door literally opens up to the sidewalk,so expect noise from passing people and cars. If you're not used to city life or are a light sleeper,you may want to bring earplugs. The people upstairs were particularly stompy. The bed wasn't the comfiest,but we made do.,,
Only things I'd recommend adding are a box of tissues and a Brita filter for the mini-fridge. The only running water is in the bathroom.,,,,,

4054079,74818857,2016-05-16,54532734,Lee,"The studio apartment was exactly as described. Liz and Dale were very accommodating. When I called to explain that my wife is sensitive to soap with fragrances, Liz delivered a fragrance-free soup to us. She also suggested some activities for us, including the May festival in Cambridge, which we very much enjoyed. Dale set up at place for us to keep our luggage after checking out so that we were unencumbered until we had to travel to the airport."
The apartment was equipped with cable TV that included access to quite a number of premium channels,with on demand TV also available.,,,,
The location of the studio apartment was very convenient to public transportation,just one short block from the MBTA station. The apartment was,however,on a busy street,"and traffic noise could be heard from within the unit. Footsteps could also be heard from above our unit late into the night. I've given this unit a three star rating; I would have rated it three and one-half stars if I could.\"",

4054079,75351561,2016-05-20,13495085,Cynthia,We loved the place. The studio is more spacious than the pictures show. It was the perfect space for us. We loved the location. It was close to the T and also the Sam Adams brewery. That is what sold us initially. We ended just hanging out and walking around the Jamaica Plain area one morning. The neighborhood has everything within walking distance
The space itself has everything you need. Liz and dale have thought of everything. They did a great job of decorating the space for style and function. The shower and water pressure are great. Location of shower head is not really for shorter people but you can pull it down and use it as a handheld shower. Also,inside the space,you might hear street noise and traffic. We travel with a sound machine so we don't notice that as much.,,,
Don't miss eating at the Chilacates restaurant close by. All in all,"it was a great place and we would not hesitate to stay there again. \"",,,,

Liz & Dale were quick to respond when we had an issue figuring out the toilet. (It has a wave sensor instead of a flush button and it took me a few tries to figure out how to use it.)"
4054079,84695765,2016-07-08,68708927,Anton,Liz and Dale's place is really great. We were totally jet laged when we arrived but the surrounding is so quiet that we could recover very quickly. We wish we could have met them in person but we were busy with work and conferences so we didn't have a chance. There's a wonderful mexican take-away right at the corner.
4054079,85503988,2016-07-11,51598768,Elizabeth,"Excellent space, very close to the T. Nice and clean, plus everything you need. We would definitely stay here again! Easy access with a door code made arrival stress free."
4054079,85981090,2016-07-14,76448945,Michelle,"We enjoyed our stay at Liz & Dale's. The apartment was just what we needed for our short stay in Boston. It was so close to the metro. I know some may say they want a place they can walk from to get to the main attractions, but there is no need to pay an astronomical amount like that when this place is available. I honestly think it made travel easier being a little bit outside the main downtown and the metro is easy to follow. They also made getting in extremely easy and communication with them was prompt and clear. They checked on us during the stay to make sure everything was going well, which was so thoughtful. This was our first Airbnb experience and I didn't know what to expect. They definitely set the bar high. And the house is just off a street, but honestly, it was such a quiet street so we were never woken up or anything. We loved the decor too!"
4054079,86764913,2016-07-17,49579168,Julie,"Liz and Dale were great. The place was perfect. Quiet area at night, close access to the T and great local restaurants in walking distances."
4054079,87792755,2016-07-21,56889632,Stacey,Liz and Dale's studio was the perfect place to stay for our needs.  The photos and description were a perfect depiction of the place.  We felt like we had already been there when we arrived and we knew where everything was.
The studio is well laid out and equipped with anything and everything you could possibly need for your stay- including wifi and central A/C!,,,,,
We were traveling with our 16-month old son,so noise and safety were key factors for us.  We felt completely safe in the studio and around the neighborhood.  We walked from the T station back to the studio after a late Red Sox game and felt completely safe. The streets are well lit. The studio is located on a busier street but was quiet enough inside not to wake us or the sleeping baby.  Liz and Dale provided us with a pack n play,sheets,blankets and even a baby bather for the shower.  The room divider was a bonus as used it to separate us from our sleeping son. Parking is on the street but we never had a problem finding a spot.,,
Liz and Dale kept in contact with us from beginning to end: we received emails from them prior to our arrival with our personalized entry door code and other useful information.  After we arrived,we received an email from them checking in to see how we were settled and if we needed anything.  They are such gracious,caring hosts and we will definitely stay here again next time we are in Boston.,,,
If you stay here,make sure to eat at Chilacates! (take out is best because they have only a few seats inside and Liz and Dale's AC is much better). :),,,,

4054079,91784834,2016-08-06,8982474,Begoña,"Liz y Dale fueron muy amables  y rápidos  en contestar cualquier duda. El apartamento era como en las fotos, muy limpio  y con todo lo necesario. A 3 minutos de la T, muy bien comunicado. Si tuvieramos que volver a Boston iríamos  a The white house de nuevo, sin dudarlo."
4054079,93359008,2016-08-12,64767671,Bethany,Our stay with Liz & and Dale was more than we could have imagined! This was our second time visiting Boston and we couldn't have picked a better place for our first Airbnb experience. The studio had everything we needed and more. It was spotless and so welcoming! The walk to the T was literally 1 minute as described in the description. This was a huge advantage that allowed us to not only explore the city but to come back to the room as we needed! We loved the area and how accessible this location was! Counting down the days to book trip #3!

The place is in a perfect location to walk to just about everything and was clean. It is a small place with a lot of Beacon Hill character which was perfect for what I needed.
1827762,13414085,2014-05-27,5775111,Mary,"Lindsay's apartment was a perfect location for a long weekend in Boston. Just enough space to provide us a comfortable place to return to after long days exploring the city. Lindsay was a wonderful host, very easy to communicate with and flexible with our schedule. We were very happy staying here!"
1827762,15597147,2014-07-12,11337320,Adam,"Lindsay has a very cute place in the middle of Beacon Hill.  It was walkable to everything and very comfortable.  If you plan to cook each night and use this as a home base, I'd say it is too small for the that. The kitchen is very tight and there is no differentiation between the dining, living, and kitchen, they all blend together.  Comfortable bed and nice size bathroom.  All in all, great place for 1 or 2 people and perfect location to everything. I walked to work everyday."
1827762,17053211,2014-08-06,4617336,Jenna,"Lindsay was very accommodating for our check in/out schedule. The apartment is almost a studio, small and slanty, but a great location in Beacon Hill, between MGH and Bowdoin transit stations. We didn't have any issues with noise, and the neighborhood was safe and easy to navigate. Would definitely recommend."
1827762,18494716,2014-08-27,19542933,Justine,"Lindsay's place was perfect for me and my husband! It's cute, nicely decorated, the bed is really comfortable, and the living room windows look out into a beautiful garden. We were able to walk and take the subway everywhere we needed to go from her place--it's in a very convenient spot. Lindsay was great. She's was really quick to respond to my questions, and was accommodating with our check in and check out times."
1827762,19966546,2014-09-21,2135344,Nina,"Lindsay was great! She was easy to reach via email and was always so kind with every exchange. Her place was adorable and in such a great neighborhood. The place was right by everything you'd want to be near. Just a few blocks from the commons and public gardens, and a short walk from downtown crossing and Faneuil Hall. Clean, adorable, and quirky, her place was the perfect place for me and my husband to spend our 1-year wedding anniversary. Highly recommend."
1827762,21248292,2014-10-13,21232404,Sam,"Lindsay was very communicative -- initial concerns re: accessibility were quickly allayed upon arrival. Charming apartment for 1-2 guests with all necessary amenities. Neighborhood is absolutely gorgeous, two-three blocks' walking to great restaurants, T train, Hubway (public bikes), and an easy Uber to any part of the city. Felt completely safe walking around at night. Lindsay's apartment looks over a quaint garden and gets good light. I will definitely stay here again next time we visit Boston!"
1827762,22867659,2014-11-16,16262584,John,"Our host was very welcoming. She provided us detailed directions and greeted us warmly when we arrived. The place was exactly as described. The location was perfect walking distance to everything in the city -- and the couple times I took a cab home, it was very inexpensive."

1827762,33724720,2015-05-31,2959142,Brett,Everything was as expected from the listing. Lindsay was very accommodating and helpful. She let me add an extra day when my plans changed.
Pros:,,,,,
- Excellent location on Beacon Hill,,,,,
- Very easy access to transport,the Common,etc.,,,
- Host was great to work with.,,,,,
- Bed was comfortable. Air conditioning in the bedroom,which was nice (it was hot and humid when I was there).,,,,
- Good value.,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
- Just be aware it's a very old building - narrow staircase to second floor,sloped floors in the bathroom,etc. Charming,but be aware...,,
- Potential for static with the landlord (a common issue with AirBnBs). I didn't bump into her,"but if you do be prepared to pass as a \"\"friend\"\" or \"\"cousin\"\".",,,,
- Very small. Pictures make it look a bit bigger than you might expect. I only slept in the room so it was fine. But don't expect to do a lot of hanging out.,,,,,
"I'd stay there again. \"",,,,,
1827762,34251335,2015-06-06,34501811,Harriet,"Charming apartment in a fantastic location. Lindsay was great; helpful, friendly with clear instruction making our 2 night stay such a positive experience. Great place to base yourself whilst exploring this welcoming city. Thank you!"
1827762,34556391,2015-06-09,33222325,Olivia,"What a great little place! (But it is little!) Comfortable bed, though and all clean and tidy, so perfectly fine for a couple. Very arty, lovingly decorated apartment in an absolutely gorgeous part of Boston. Super easy to get to from the airport, and then into town (you can walk in really easily!), right near a Whole Foods and a couple of great bars, and good places for brunch. An excellent spot for exploring the city, and a nice calm place to retreat to for a cup of tea and a relax before heading out again."
We had a great weekend,Lindsay was great at staying in touch if we needed anything but we had the place to ourselves for four days and really enjoyed ourselves. The place is mighty small,but really full of character,and Beacon Hill's so pretty that you don't even notice.,,
"A really lovely apartment for a short break. \"",,,,,

The place was clean, convenient, and had lots of charm! I was so impressed with Lindsey as a host. She was quick to reply and very accommodating. I hope to stay again on my next trip to Boston!"
1827762,38206992,2015-07-13,8073858,Nicole,Lindsay was an awesome host! She was very easy to communicate with and quick to respond to any emails/ texts. We really appreciated her effort figure out how to get us the keys since she wasn't going to be in town during our stay and she made it as easy as possible for us to do so. She was really quick to get ahold of during the stay when we had questions. Overall a great host!
The neighbourhood has real charm and is so close to all of the popular sites of Boston. We really enjoyed being about to walk through the streets of Beacon Hill on our travels around the city. Parking is at a minimum around the apartment so travelling by foot is the best way access between Lindsay's place and the city. We parked out car in a city lot between the Charles River and Boston Commons for the weekend.,,,,,
The apartment was exactly like the photos. It is a clean and cozy place and was perfect for our 2-day stay. We loved feeling like we got to experience living in such a historic area. The apartment is a two-storey walk up and the staircase was on the tiny side so pack lightly! There is an air conditioner in the bedroom and plenty of fans to keep the bedroom cool in the summer.,,,,,
We really enjoyed Lindsay and her apartment and would recommend her place to anyone looking for a great host,"great neighbourhood and great apartment! Thanks so much Linsday!\"",,,,
1827762,39340112,2015-07-22,37268692,Kevin,Linsdey is a great communicator and you can't go wrong with Bacon Hill.
1827762,39998423,2015-07-27,24787859,Andrea,"People’s expectations for Airbnb stays can be different, and what bothers one person may be no issue for a different kind of traveler, so I will just mostly state the facts about my stay and let future guests draw their own conclusions."
Lindsay represents her apartment truthfully in her listing. She has done a good job with paint and fabric of making a charming space. The bed is very comfortable,and fresh sheets and towels were provided. That being said,be aware that it is a 200 year-old building that has been chopped up into apartments and is largely unrenovated. It is mostly as clean as you can make that type of space. As you would expect,storage space is minimal,so the space is more cluttered than it appears in the pictures with things hanging on hooks and tucked away behind furniture. The air conditioning unit in the bedroom is stuffed in with towels. There is white acoustical ceiling tile (which is visible in the listing pictures) throughout the apartment.,
Lindsay mailed me keys for the apartment in plenty of time and did kindly provide a hair dryer and iron that I asked for. Her e-mails and texts were friendly and welcoming; however,the lengthy additional instructions for her place were e-mailed after midnight of the day I was arriving. Several sentences were needed to explain  how to get the key to work in the tricky lock. They also said I would be texted a picture showing the location of a key hidden nearby that worked better,although I did not receive that picture until three hours after my known check-in time. In the instructions I was also asked to misrepresent myself to any neighbors in the building or people I saw in the lane about staying through Airbnb. That being said,while the lock was tricky I did get in,the hidden key worked much better,and I did not run into anyone who asked me why I was there.
You are definitely living amongst the host’s possessions here,and no space is really cleared for guest belongings. Lindsay also texted me apologetically at eleven o’clock the last night I was there to ask if she could come into the apartment the next morning at 9:15 to get something she needed.,,,,
In summary,this apartment functioned as an adequate “crash pad” for me to sleep in during a busy weekend visiting my niece near her own small apartment on Beacon Hill. Being close by to experience her new home and neighborhood was important to me. I did have to make the reservation only about two weeks out,so this was the only more reasonably priced Airbnb stay in the neighborhood still available. I do think there are better values in other Beacon Hill listings that are even lower in price,and I will likely seek them out for my next stay.,,

She was a very warming host who made sure you felt as if the place was your own. She popped in a couple times to pick-up some things, but always made me aware before doing so and it was during work hours, so I never actually saw her. I did however, receive fresh towels and sheets so that was really nice. Her apartment is exactly as pictured - cute and quaint nestled within the cobble-stoned streets of Beacon Hill. It's within walking distance to everything from the \"\"T\"\" to shopping and fabulous restaurants and bakeries on Charles Street. The apartment is small"

And even though it's in a highly populated neighborhood, I never did hear any disruptive noises from outside or from other people in the building.  She went out of her way to mail the keys to me ahead of time since she was going to be out of town when I arrived.  And then she really went above and beyond when she discovered that I left an important item behind, and she took it to FedEx and had it expedited to me.  I was profoundly grateful for her help.

6444148,54860830,2015-11-25,12923368,Fei,Great location and neighborhood. The host should have mentioned that it's a basement apartment though.

The location was absolutely superb, everything was within walking distance. I didn't have to take any taxis or uber to see any local attractions. The host was really nice, though I didn't get to meet him personally, he sent me prompt replies to my messages. I had a couple of small requests to make and they were granted with no questions asked. Highly recommended!"
6444148,75412571,2016-05-21,38163155,Károly,Our host was very helpful with every question however just a few emerged only during an eleven day stay. The location of the basement apartment is perfect for tourist and business trip as well.
6444148,76050434,2016-05-24,6804196,Nicolas,The apartment was very clean and perfectly located. We walked almost everywhere and the T stop was right there when we needed to go a bit further. Communication with the host was excellent and I would highly recommend this listing for anyone who wants to visit and enjoy everything Boston has to offer!

It was in the perfect location for us - we were able to easily walk to Back Bay and the North End and it was a quick tax ride to/from the airport.

Having a kitchen was great, but it lacked a microwave. This is a great deal for the money compared to hotels in central Boston."
6444148,92887732,2016-08-10,62484583,Jay,Great!
6444148,98550056,2016-08-31,13917002,Joe,This place is in a great location in the Beacon Hill area of Boston. There's plenty to do locally and also good transport links.
Unfortunately I tried three times to communicate with the host (via email and through my air bnb account) before a text on our day of arrival finally got a reply. We were getting a little worried by that point.,,,,,
The best option it seems is to contact the cleaner,whose number is on the itinerary,if there are any scheduling problems.,,,
"Other than that a wonderful apartment in a lovely city.\"",,,,,
8011545,47410778,2015-09-18,41885855,Becky,Nice place! Just in the downtown and you can see a lot of tourists around your apartment everyday! It's very convenient to everywhere!
8011545,47521259,2015-09-19,22008246,Nicola,"L'accoglienza da parte di Enzo è stata ottima! Lui è la sua coinquilina Fernande si sono fatti in quattro per rendere la mia permanenza piacevole. Mi sono sentito molto ben accolto e con loro abbiamo chiacchierato molto e ci siamo divertiti a conoscerci. Vado via dopo aver conosciuto due nuovi amici! La casa era ancora un work in progress, ma Enzo e Fernande mi hanno lasciato il letto migliore e c'era tutto quello che era necessario."
In più,la cittá a settembre è bellissima e piena di vita,little italy in particolare modo.,,,
Bref,"vivamente consigliato!\"",,,,
8011545,47937596,2015-09-21,44498390,Carina,"Enzo is very friendly and helpful. He's easy to reach via email/sms and respond quickly. The bedroom was a bit more plain than the picture listed, but I can't complain because the bed is huge and comfy!"
Also,everything I need was provided: Towel,shampoo,and even map! The map was very helpful indeed!,,
What I love the most is the LOCATION! It's at the downtown regoin,and is walking distance to many attractions/ subway/ food markets/ restaurant. Also the neighborhood is safe so you don't have to worry going home late.,,,,
"What I paid was definitely a decent price for a place in such a prime location.\"",,,,,
8011545,47945415,2015-09-21,35028016,Frank,Enzo was absolutely awesome. He was willing to stay up to facilitate the late flight in and did everything possible to get me comfortable. The location suited me perfectly.
8011545,48334311,2015-09-25,43211638,Paul,The bedroom and bathroom were simple and clean.  Enzo was very welcoming and accommodating to my varying schedule.  He gave friendly tips on his knowledge of the neighborhood and beyond.
The neighborhood is very interesting.  It is small and historic,in bustling Little Italy,but at night it was still quiet enough.  It was a delight to stay in that area and with Enzo,"and highly recommend it.\"",,
8011545,48908948,2015-09-29,41168748,Mary,"I had an awesome stay at Enzo's place last weekend! Enzo was incredibly hospitable and welcoming, and his place was perfect. He made sure he was available on my arrival, and took the time to demonstrate how to use the keys to get in and out, and check that I knew how to get around on the T, even providing me a handy reference map. When my plans changed and I had to leave a day early, he was very accommodating and even let me stash my backpack at his apartment for the day before my train arrived. The room was great, and the bed was extremely comfortable. If you're looking for a spot in the North End, definitely check him out!"
8011545,49079257,2015-09-30,44511734,Arielle,Enzo was a fantastic host that went out of his way to make me feel welcome. The flat is in great location in Haymarket surrounded by delicious Italian delis.  Would recommend!
8011545,50217369,2015-10-10,29959509,Sarah,"A lovely stay in the perfect location! As a female traveling this is not only a super safe street and area (North End) but so many great restaurants either on the same street or walking distance (Neptune Oyster, Ward 8, Etc.) Enzo was the perfect host + I would highly recommend + stay again. oh and I had my own fire escape, the brick buildings were gorgeous. Thank you again!!"
8011545,50684735,2015-10-13,9213468,Emmanuel,"I stayed 3 nights at Enzo’s apartment. You can’t expect a warmer welcome, you feel like you were visiting friends."
He and his roommate are nice,funny,generous and smart people. The whole place was clean and the bed was very comfortable.,,,
The location is amazing too,"in a vibrant neighborhood. I know where I’ll stop by next time !\"",,,,
8011545,51947477,2015-10-25,15200411,Barbara Soledad,"La descripción fue tal cual, en realidad la habitación me gusto más que en la foto! La cama muy cómoda ( comfortable bed ) . El no paro de preguntarme si necesitaba algo, muy amable y correcto! ( so kaind ) . La zona es súper accesible a todo! ( near a lot of places and subway ) !!"
Much as gracias Enzo!,,,,,
"Thank u x everything ! Nice to meet u! \"",,,,,
8011545,52122454,2015-10-26,42484672,Kevin,"Enzo was an awesome host and was extremely nice. The room was clean and cozy. The location in the North End was perfect. It was right next to the freedom trial, old north church, several bars, restaurants and close to a main public transport station. I really enjoyed my time."
8011545,52649625,2015-10-31,46643939,Ankur,Enzo was a great host and let me check in early. He lives in an amazing area and his room/bed was nice and comfortable!
8011545,53077304,2015-11-04,46987534,Sherynn,Enzo was very friendly and kind! He made sure I knew how to use the key to get in and out. The room was clean and tidy. The location was fairly close to the subway station and there are many restaurants.
8011545,53201129,2015-11-06,19360811,Micah,"Enzo and his roommate were amazingly warm, hospitable, and incredibly helpful! I arrived right at lunch time, and they invited me to eat with them - something that you just can't find with your regular (boring) hotel stay."
From there,it was off to explore Boston! This apartment is on the same street as the Old North Church,a historic U.S. landmark due to its involvement with Paul Revere's famous ride. Coming from the west coast,there is just so much storied history within these streets,and it was an amazing feeling to walk on those cobbled streets,check out the old brick and wood buildings
"I recommend this room to anyone who's going to spend the majority of their time exploring Boston rather than hanging out in their room.\"",,,,,
8011545,53619180,2015-11-10,1912785,Paul,"Enzo is a fantastic host. He made me feel right at home, and as someone who was new to visiting Boston, it was much appreciated. He gave good recommendations for restaurants and points of interested and helped out with the T. When I come back to Boston I have my fingers crossed that Enzo's place is available again."
The room was small but cozy and great for sleeping. The neighborhood is phenomenal,"I felt like I was right at home. \"",,,,
8011545,53848877,2015-11-13,4098047,Matthew,Enzo was an excellent host. He provided everything I needed and was friendly. He even carried my bag up the stairs. Apartment is small but adequate. Probably gives you a good idea of what it's like to live in the North End.
8011545,56007201,2015-12-07,25479191,Emil,"Enzo is the perfect friendly host, willing to help with anything.  The room was fine, the apartment was fine, but the neighborhood is outstanding.  The room is in the old Little Italy neighborhood, filled with old colonial sites.  The smells from all the restaurants are amazing and worth every penny. I'm definitely going back!"
8011545,56217070,2015-12-10,18405565,Corey,Enzo and his roommate are wonderful! They made me feel at home and we held great conversation in the evening. I slept very well at night in a comfortable bed and quiet neighborhood. You cannot beat the location — it was incredibly easy to get anywhere downtown by walking (and the T is accessible if you prefer train). This airbnb is perfect for anyone planning to spend their time around town rather than in their room.
8011545,56647586,2015-12-15,30340622,Luis,Ricardo Enzo was a fantastic host! He was very responsive through airbnb message and text message. He and his roommate were really helpful in providing suggestions for restaurants and places to check out in the surrounding neighborhood. Very friendly hosts!
The location in the North End was pretty convenient. It was close to the T if you don't want to walk,however,I walked everywhere during my stay to see the neighborhoods. The location may not look too central,but I found it to be very walkable - even out to Back Bay. The flat has many nice restaurants less than 2 minute walk from it. So if you get in a bit late,you don't have to spend much time looking for somewhere to get dinner.,
The private room was super clean,had outlets,"and a desk + chair if you needed to do some work. Towels and toiletries were provided as well. All around great experience - I would highly recommend staying here!\"",,,
8011545,60052778,2016-01-18,52193025,Karim,Host went out of his way to come home from work to greed and welcome me to his place.
"He was very pleasant and kept checking if I needed anything. Thank you Enzo \"",,,,,
8011545,60342420,2016-01-22,49755910,Emanuel,"Great friendly host. Stayed with Enzo and his 2 house mates. Extremely helpful, always responded to messages and even carried my luggage up to the room for me. Located in an old building and neighbourhood with lots of great restaurants. He was always willing to work around you and goes the extra mile to ensure your stay is as comfortable as possible. Don't expect flashy accommodation but can't complain when the location is so good!"
8011545,60851871,2016-01-28,4129854,Jon,"Enzo was very welcoming and a wonderful host. The location was amazing and within walking distance of everything. Room was sparse but bed was comfortable, desk usable, and Internet fast. What more could you want?"

He is very accommodating and very easy to talk to. His apartment was immaculate and a great location. If I go back to Boston I will be sure to look for his listing!"
"Thank you!\"",,,,,
8011545,70646863,2016-04-19,2032438,Adrian,"Enzo was a great host, the room was basic but clean and the location is perfect for walkable enjoyment of the old town area and little Italy.  I would be happy to return."
8011545,72644558,2016-05-04,67147113,Sharleen,"I booked one night with Enzo after my flights got messed up and I ended up flying in the night before my hotel booking! Enzo was very accommodating and went out of his way to help, I very much appreciated it. The room was clean and perfect to get some sleep for the night. The location is perfect too, very central. Thank you Enzo."
8011545,77711453,2016-06-03,58247753,DaYoung,This room has perfect location. It is in the north end and near the freedom trail. So it is very convenient to travel. The room is small but it is not a big deal. It is because the host is so nice and friendly and the room has every basic items.
8011545,78777114,2016-06-09,57889817,Arryn,Enzo's place was great and he was very accommodating. The location is in a perfect spot near some great restaurants and shops. The bed and apartment were very comfortable and cozy. I will definitely stay here again if I pass through Boston.
8011545,81090186,2016-06-20,14842468,Stephen,"Thanks Ricardo, I had a great stay. The location was perfect right next to the freedom trail. The room is small but comfortable. Ricardo was very friendly and a great host."
8011545,81398960,2016-06-22,5575330,Li,Enzo was a fantastic host! He was always extremely helpful and thoughtufl. It was also very inspiring to chat with him and his roomate. And the location of his apartment was unbelievable great!
8011545,82308393,2016-06-27,22347643,Brett,"Enzo had some items set out for us (lotion, hot chocolate, tea, shampoo, etc) and met us at the apartment shortly after we arrived. The apartment was impeccably located in the heart of the North End of Boston, in little Italy. It is literally steps away from the Old North Church. The room was very small and he suggests only 1 person, but we mentioned as a couple that my wife and I needed a space and Enzo obliged."
"Bathroom was clean and usable but again small as most places are in this iconic historical area. Enzo did mention he was moving within a month or two so this place won't be available for rent much longer! \"",,,,,
8011545,84212792,2016-07-06,23469925,Dan,"Enzo's place was fantastic, the location was great and everything I wanted to do was in walking distance. Would definitely stay again if I were traveling in Boston"
8011545,85543129,2016-07-12,35392647,Alexander,"Staying with Enzo and his girfriend was really awesome. The room was as the description, good communication. Enzo was replying the messages immediately. The place is in North End, one the most picturesque areas of city center of Boston. Definitely recommended by me!"
8011545,85964508,2016-07-14,72383365,Kim,"Enzo and his family of friends make the entire Airbnb experience so worthwhile. They provided a small, comfortable bedroom plus immaculate bathroom/kitchen facilities. He even set out evening tea! They really care about their hosts. I loved chatting about our experiences in Boston and his life in native France."
8011545,86325204,2016-07-16,28855088,Line,"Enzo is amazing. This a perfect place to stay in Boston, lovely area, lovely room and a nice host. If you're considering to try out Boston you should defiantly contact Enzo!"
8011545,86850909,2016-07-17,45626204,Alan,"As a guest in Enzo's home, I felt like I was visiting as a friend and not as a guest. Enzo kept in touch the entire time before flying into Boston to ensure that all the accommodations were arranged. When I first came in, he was very hospitable and made sure that I was comfortable throughout my stay, by offering maps, toiletries, towels, and water and even letting me borrow his iron. Given his multi-cultural background and years in academia, we had lots of interesting conversations, and I was able to learn and appreciate something new and different that he had to offer. I'm confident that anyone who has the chance to stay with Enzo will never feel disappointed with their decision."
As for the home,the location is great,right in Little Italy next to Paul Revere's home. Plenty of good food and places to visit with quick access to nearby bars,comedy clubs,and restaurants on the main street. And if you're like me and didn't have a chance to get a haircut back home,"there's plenty of Italian barbers in the area to choose from.\""

Enzo and his lovely girlfriend were incredible nice and just normal, very polite, adequate people you immediately feel at ease with. The room and amenities were immaculately clean, you can eat off the floor-that's how clean it was, and I was supplied with everything I could have possibly needed."
8011545,90408923,2016-08-01,72956727,Jeremy,"Enzo and his housemate were excellent hosts. I was greeted with some food on the first night when I got there which was great because I had been travelling for 28 hours to get there from Australia. The room was clean and all the promised facilities were provided. Salem St in Boston is a great place to stay because you can walk to a LOT of the tourist destinations of Boston, and it is very safe even late at night, and very close to public transport. I definitely recommend staying here if you get the chance!"
8011545,90980378,2016-08-03,14863965,Steve,"Enzo was very accommodating and hospitable.  This is a small room with a comfortable bed in a small 2 BR apt.  Simple, functional close to historic area and a moderate walk to Mass General Hospital.."
8011545,91527529,2016-08-05,14359905,Darien,"Great hosts and great location. Everything as described etc. The room is small, so if you want a lot of space it's the only drawback, but most certainly wasn't an issue to me and really enjoyed staying here for the night I was in Boston.  Thanks Enzo!!"
8011545,91713488,2016-08-06,54602780,Enrico,"Enzo was an excellent host. I felt very welcome and comfortable since the first moment we met. He helped me with my luggage, and gave me a bottle of fresh water, which I really appreciated. He showed me the room and the rest of the flat and gave me useful indications about the neighbourhood and local transportation. The flat is clean and the bed is very comfortable. The flat is in the heart of the historical Little Italy, historical district, offering lots of good restaurants and bars."
"Enzo is a careful and considerate host. I strongly recommend him and his place.\"",,,,,

8011545,93959004,2016-08-14,17396053,Daniel,"I stayed in the apartment for two nights. The room is good and quiet, the bed was excellent and comfy. The hosts were very friendly and helpful. We had dinner together, which they organized, and which was a very nice experience. We talked a lot during my stay, which was very positive from my point of view. When I arrived in Boston, there was a heatwave, and I was disappointed that there was no AC in the apartment. However, within hours, a portable AC unit was installed, which really impressed me. To sum it up, my hosts made every effort to be hospitable, friendly and helpful, and they succeeded in that very well. I recommend them thoroughly."
45987,83633,2010-08-23,205715,Lily,"We stayed here for 2 nights last weekend and really enjoyed it. The location is great. It is within walking distance from north end and only steps away from the bunker hill monument; the orange line station is just a few blocks away. Atef, the host, is extremely friendly and helpful. The room is comfortable and spacious. The garden is smaller than I expected but very lovely, a great spot for having breakfast or evening drink. Highly recommended!"
45987,87385,2010-08-30,198870,Zazu,"Incredible experience.Atef,the owner is one of the most kind person I've ever met.Always willing to help.The studio is amazing.Clean, comfortable and you have in it everything you could need.I would repeat a lot of times."
45987,106201,2010-09-27,204210,Jonathan,"Atef was an amazing host! Extremely helpful and easy going. His place is adorable, both my wife and I decided we could live there if we ever moved to the city. This was my first time to Charlestown and it was a very welcoming little area, with nice restaurants, a neat little pub (Sullivan's), and a quick walk to the T and to the north side of Boston."
When we arrived the water wasn't quite hot enough for our showers,so I mentioned it to Atef and he had it fixed immediately. He also setup a fan for us Saturday when it got really warm because we had a bunch of ladies in the apartment preparing for a wedding.,,,,
Atef is quick to help,reachable by phone and email,"and loves to give recommendations and walking/driving directions. Can't recommend him and his place enough!\"",,,
45987,110487,2010-10-03,200206,Tina,"The apartment was absolutely wonderful. The space is big, clean and has all the amenities you can think of (full kitchen, nice shower, washer/dryer). We took our breakfast in the beautiful inner courtyard. Don't be put off by the location; the historic Charlestown is just 4 stops away from downtown Boston.

45987,228959,2011-04-17,452113,Michael,"The Apartment was more than I expected, clean, comfortable and convienent to all the best Boston has to offer. Beautiful neighborhood that is right at the end of the Freedom Trail that takes you thru a lot of historical places around Boston.About a 25 minute walk to Quincy Market and Fanuiel Hall and the beautiful North End of Boston. Atef was a wonderful host, friendly,gracious and there to give directions and advice about Boston. I have already recommeded this place to friends and will be going back as soon as possible myself."

The bathroom was very clean and several sets of towels were provided. The owner,Atef, lives nearby and was helpful, reliable and easy to contact without being obstrusive. He provided tea and coffee and a loaf of home-baked bread!   The location was great, a very quiet and scenic old-fashioned street just  yards from the Bunker Hill monument in Charlestown. It was 20 minutes walk across the bridge to Central Boston, or 5 minutes by bus on the frequent routes 92 or 93. There was a 24 hour convenience store, a larger supermarket and 3 or 4 restaurants within 5 minutes walk , making it easy for us as we did not have a car. We would definitely like to use the same apartment again on any future visit to Boston. Thanks Atef!"
45987,266707,2011-05-16,172410,Cecil,"The area was amazing, lovely and exactly where you start the famous Freedom Trail. Atef was very kind and helpful to find great place where to eat, and all the instructions were on the fridge. Perfect for a short stay !"

Quiet and comfortable, but quite basic compared to other places I have stayed.  Atef very nice guy and a pleasure to talk to.  Lots of one way streets so give yourself some time to get used to getting there.  Public transportation available but still need to figure it out a bit.  Can walk into city but give yourself a half hour easy to get into the thick of things in the city."

The location is great too; right off of the Freedom Trail's starting point and a reasonable walk to a grocery store and T stop, it was great. We even found it an easy walk across the Charles into the North End. Great find!"
45987,596517,2011-10-04,868394,Lauren,My friend and I stayed at Atef's studio during our trip to Boston. We were there for about a week and loved it! The studio is spacious and open with a quaint little garden patio right outside the door. The location is perfect. You are steps away from the Bunker Hill Monument and just a short walk to the T station. Atef is a great host and we will definitely have to make it back soon!
45987,607808,2011-10-08,20848,Flavio D.,"Atef is a great host, he recieved me and gave a lot of info about the city hot spots.

The pictures don't actually show off how nice it really is. The building itself is on a beautiful street in Charlestown close to the local mall and the T with the Orange Line able to get you everywhere you need to get to quickly. Downtown and MIT are also walkable from the unit within about 30-40 minutes."

45987,1420715,2012-06-05,520792,Adrian,"Atef was a very polite and correct host. His place had everything we needed for a short stay, and very convenient transport to Downtown Boston. We had a great time. Highly recommendable."
45987,1549593,2012-06-24,2466662,Kaushik,"Going by the description and pictures, I expected this to be a great Victorian/ Edwardian studio with a beautifully landscaped garden and old-style fittings. But alas, I was tricked by what seemed to be a beautiful house."
The house itself is pretty and old,but what is being rented out is the basement of what was probably the servant quarters in olden days! It has very little lighting,very little ventilation. The kitchen appliances (fridge,stove,etc) are probably more than 30 years old.,
To top it all,the door don't close as expected (it was claimed to be an antique having 'a mind of its own',but I wasn't ever able to close the entrance gate).,,,
And let us not even think about the entrance. You have to open the gate and basically go through the service entrance. This is next to the dumpster and is filled with flies. The flies somehow find their way in through the bathroom too,so we had to battle a couple of flies every day.,,,,
Disgusting enough? Yes,that pretty much sums it up. For the price that I paid,I could have stayed in a comfortable hotel.,,,
And if you have a car,then street parking is a pain. The nearest garage is a good 10 minute walk from the house.,,,,
I've been an AirBnB user before and have had a great experience at other places. However,this place by Atef is just not worth the money.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
45987,1628069,2012-07-04,2116733,Beatrix,Nice apartment in a nice area. We enjoyed our stay in Atefs house.
45987,1660466,2012-07-08,1453130,Matthew,Atef Is a wonderful host with a beautiful place right near the center of Boston.  I took my new bride on our honeymoon through here during the 4th of July week and before I got there he had great communication truly caring that we made it in okay.  A true servants heart Atef made sure we had everything we needed and took great care to brief me on the easiest ways around and the best places to eat.  He made for an enjoyable stay and an easy one as he was very personable and easy to talk with. Would highly recommend to anyone seeking a rental in Boston.
45987,1790050,2012-07-24,2734468,Dave,"This apartment is clean, quiet, spacious and an easy walk from the train station and also into the city. The Freedom Trail is very close by and is an excellent way to introduce yourself to Boston. The Trail, combined with the Bunker Hill Monument, means you'll never lose your way home! Atef is a polite and considerate host and gave plenty of helpful advice about how get around town and what to see. I would certainly consider staying here again the next time I visit Boston."
45987,1820352,2012-07-28,832680,Chris,Atef is a great host!  He had everything planned for a great stay.  I highly recommend his apartment.

You got everything you need even for cooking and there is a nice huge table for dining with two bar stools. Unfortunaetly we did not meet Atef in person, but he was nice and caring. Also the check-in went smooth as we arrived prior to the official checkin time. His friendly housekeeper let us in and showed us everything. The neighbourhood is perfect for exploring Boston. It is beautiful and quiet, there is a large supermarket in walking distance, and there is a good connection into the center. We had a great time. Thank you very much!"
45987,2272356,2012-09-13,2018989,Geraldine,"Just returned from a week in Boston, staying at Atef's studio. The studio was exactly as described, entry is via the courtyard garden at the back of the house (access via a private alleyway at the side of the house).  The studio was clean and comfortable and certainly large enough for one person.    There is a cooker (which I didn't use), refrigerator and microwave (which I did use!) as well as a range of kitchen implements.  Lots of storage space and a comfy sofa to sit on.  Access to the laundry facilities was very useful (and it's just outside the door so handy too!).  WiFi availability was a great bonus.  The studio is at basement level, and 2 of the windows (glass blocks rather than traditional windows) are at pavement (sidewalk) level on the street.   Despite this, it was very quiet, there was very little traffic or other noise from outdoors."
The location of the studio is very central,and is within walking distance of downtown Boston and other sights - less than 10 minutes to the nearest T stop,approx 10 minutes walk  to North Station for trains to Salem & Gloucester.  Charlestown itself is lovely,it was very safe and comfortable to walk round (important for a single traveller like myself!).   Bunker Hill monument is at the top of the street - a great landmark so you won't get lost!,,
I met Atef (and Lulu the cat) when I arrived,and both of them made me feel very welcome. I had no problems with the doors (which another reviewer commented on).   The courtyard garden looked very nice,I didn't use it myself,although guests are free to use it if they wish.,,
This was my first AirBnB experience,and I was delighted with the result.,,,,

The flat is kept absolutely spotless by the charming Charles.,,,,,
A great position in a quiet residential area,with easy access to a supermarket and lots of local eating places. We walked into central Boston most days,but it was close to the bus when we were tired out from sightseeing and shopping.  There is a ferry a short walk away which takes you straight in to North End.,,,

As well as access to a washer and dryer. The ten minute walk to the subway made for easy access to all of Boston and Cambridge and beyond. You can buy a weekly pass at the station for only $18 (in 2013).
It was great to have some stainless steel cookware,including a nice big pot with a liftout colander for steaming vegetables and cooking pasta.,,,,

Despite this fact, tourists do not seem to use his street for access to the monument.  It is also an easy walk to grab a rental bike from the Hubway station and/or to catch the T anywhere else in Boston."

45987,5345482,2013-06-25,5865972,Matti,We had a pleasant stay in Atef's place. The place is affordable in Boston standards (which are high in comparison to other US cities). The apartment is a bit dark but it shouldn't be a surprice since it's in the ground floor. The studio is located in the historical part of the town and the neighbourhood is very beautiful. Check in went very smoothly and the apartment was as described. Kitchen equipment was basic. We met Atef shortly just when were leaving and he seemed like a nice guy. Thanks a lot.
45987,5425124,2013-06-29,4808787,Marco,"So I was in Boston still with the continuing saga of trying to find a place to stay during the Stanley Cup Finals (that not being my reason for being there), and really running out of options.  First place I stayed at was lovely, but as it was a bit too close to the stadium my stay was cut short.  Cue Atef, whose place was cozy and incredibly well-placed in a quiet area in Boston unfamilar to me (making me finally use the reasonable and pretty reliable T), and who got back to me lightning fast and saved my bacon.  Place to stay, check.  Quiet, charming, check check.  Good local pub, check.  No TV, PERFECT.  On my list for my next trip to Boston, and highly recommended for anyone looking for a great launching pad to explore the city."

The location is great--half a block from the Bunker Hill monument, and the start of the Freedom Trail.  It’s an easy walk into the North End and points beyond in central Boston. Street parking in the area can be a challenge, but we were able to find spots on the streets bordering the monument without too much trouble.

There is also a good, large food store, including some organic food and a CVS pharmacy and some other shops within a 5 minute walk, and a large shopping mall (Cambridgeside Galleria) is within about a 15-20 minute walk.

The location is amazing. Charlestown is clean,quaint and only a 10 minute walk from the North End.,,,,
The apartment is very much as advertised: spacious and clean with a comfortable bed and a decent shower. However,since it is a basement apartment,if you have rainy weather like we did during our stay,the natural light does struggle to fill the space.,,
NOTE: wifi is available but not included in the rental price. Also,there is no TV or monitor in the unit.,,,,
The washer and dryer are located in the hallway directly outside the apartment. During our stay it seemed as though they were running non-stop. During the spin cycle the din can become quite loud. However,they were never in use before 8am or after 9pm,as per the house rules.,,,
Since the apartment entrance is at the rear of the house and down a narrow cobblestone path we would not recommended it to elderly renters or people with mobility issues.,,,,,
"Overall we had a pleasant stay and would recommend this rental.\"",,,,,

45987,28755844,2015-03-29,23868165,Selina,"Atef and his caretaker charlie were very gracious and helpful. The listing is a self-contained spacious underground level apartment. The location is fantastic for those who like to walk and see the city. The apartment is within meters of the historic freedom trail (which is a must). All apartment facilities were good although heating is centrally controlled in another part of the building. During the cold weather the blankets provided and extra heater in the bathroom were sufficient. Overall a fantastic location, great facilities and spacious apartment that is quiet and private. We would love to stay again."

45987,30437805,2015-04-22,22924587,Kevin,"This was a great place! The studio is spacious, clean, and close to Bunker Hill as well as restaurants and Whole Foods. Atef was an excellent host. I was in town for the Boston Marathon and before we arrived, Atef sent me articles about the race and information in the local news - very thoughtful! He let us know where to go for food, coffee, etc. We would definitely book here again when coming to Boston!"
45987,32083515,2015-05-13,21534272,Jeff,"Accurate description of property. Great location and nice area of Boston. Atef was very attentive, met me at the door, and answered all my questions.  Space was quiet and comfortable. Recommend for those who want to check out Boston and Cambridge but don't want to be downtown. The monument and historic attractions in the area make it a nice option."
45987,32510160,2015-05-19,28315689,Sam,"Great private place, Having great experience there. The place is even better than the imagine shows and the garden is beautiful. The location is also good, very near the Gate of MA, and lots of store like whole food, cvs around it."

The neighborhood is very safe - I felt perfectly comfortable walking to whole foods to get groceries. Charles, the housekeeper, was very helpful during my stay. I highly recommend this place! I won't hesitate to rebook if I am in Boston again."
45987,36238556,2015-06-26,30966378,Meagan,"I stayed in this apartment for 4 nights while in Boston for work and it was a perfect homebase for my stay. The neighborhood is absolutely lovely, and the apartment is half a block from the Bunker Hill Monument. There are a number of restaurants, shops, and bars within walking distance so it was very convenient. The apartment itself is very cute and clean, and quite spacious for a studio. Atef was a lovely host as well, friendly, helpful, and flexible with a change in my arrival time. I will definitely stay here again when I return to Charlestown."

It was very quiet for being so near to the Bunker Hill Monument.  Charlestown is a great area to explore from with the subway a 10 minute walk away, and one can walk over the Charles river to the North End in 20 minutes. Very safe and friendly area and I will definitely stay her again."

The sofa is not comfortable at all for sleeping,the WIFI only work for two hours first day out of the 6 days we stayed. Forced us to buy a TMobile SIM card. Offer us that we go to the library!,,,,
The old fridge which is in the main room is so noisy you can´t sleep.,,,,,
Too expensive,"and definitely not worth 200 Euro night.\"",,,,
45987,46410929,2015-09-10,36493178,Mikey,Atef's studio is located in a very nice neighborhood. The studio was clean and had everything we needed. The location is nearby the orange line which makes it simple to get around.

For travellers without a car it was ideal,close the T (subway),shops,and in a very safe and quiet neighbourhood . We were even able to walk into the CBD Boston.,,

45987,52687693,2015-11-01,5169277,Helen,I stayed at this lovely studio apartment for 9 nights while i was working in the area in Boston. The neighborhood was really pretty and i felt safe walking around by myself at night. It was great that the kitchen had everything i needed to cook with. I felt really at home staying there. It was an easy location to catch the train into the city.
45987,57212049,2015-12-23,11806127,Yuko,"I stayed at Atef's place 10 days. His property is so clean and everything was tidy. It was a pleasant stay. It's a walk distance to the centre of Boston and there is a big shopping mall nearby, which is helpful for a longer stay."

45987,64055116,2016-02-29,25274084,Antoine,"Good location, the studio is nice and clean. However, the wifi was not working during the stay which was a big bummer, especially at that price point and for someone coming from abroad with no local data plan. Also, the host didn't offer any sort of solution or discount for the inconvenience and was not pleasant to deal with."
45987,68795125,2016-04-06,39038125,Grady,"This has been by far my best experience with airbnb, and I have had no bad experiences with it. Atef was an amazing host. We both went our separate ways but whenever I needed anything he always went above and beyond the level anyone would expect. He even changed my linens for me after being there several days. It is a great size with a huge island for working, cooking, and eating. Nice sized refrigerator. Very safe location with a easy walk to two different bus lines and a 10 minute walk to subway as well. Great area with easy access to downtown."
45987,72994856,2016-05-06,68414647,Michael,"This was a great experience when I visited Boston for the week on business. The location is not only gorgeous, but easily accessible to just about everything. All facilities were kept clean with the utmost of care and Atef is a true gentleman host. I was able to come and go during my hectic schedule and feel comfortable throughout my stay. Highly recommended."
45987,76506375,2016-05-27,2243253,Mark,"\""
I enjoyed my stay at the apartment of Atef.  The apartment’s location was excellent and safe.  I didn’t have any big problems there but I should point out a few items: 1) use of WiFi would have cost $50 more (but I had a mobile hotspot); 2) parking on the street is very limited (but Uber works great,much better than renting a car); 3) I heard about a cat,to which I’m allergic,but fortunately I didn’t see or sense it.  On a more positive note,I was happy to take advantage of the local restaurants (“Figs” is excellent!) and Atef’s washer and dryer.,

45987,77825922,2016-06-03,19703691,Luis,"The Studio was very nice and clean, in a beautiful and historic neighborhood. You cannot beat the convenience of this neighborhood at this rate.  I would highly recommend this booking to anyone. Atef is very conscientious  in handling unexpected issues. I can also vouch that I am allergic to cats, but the wood floors and cleanliness of the room saved me from any reaction."
45987,87928240,2016-07-22,10036295,Soraya,"The location was great--easy to walk to all parts of Charlestown (I didn't leave the neighborhood due to the trip's purpose, but feel like it would be easy to get to the rest of Boston too.).  The room served its purpose well for me.  It provided a comfy bed, which was all that was really needed as I was out most of the day.  It met all of my needs."

It made our stay less stressful. Her first floor flat was clean, spacious, and cozy. My daughter loved her decorating style!  Tania's place was a stones throw from the Savin Hill Transit station, and was only minutes from downtown station. I was pleasantly surprised (and amazed) on how quiet the neighborhood was. If you have a trip planned to the Boston area you must inquire about the availability of Tania's flat."

She was easy to connect with if we had any questions and she was very organized- she provided us with a binder full of info on her house and local eateries and transportation.  Pictures do not do her place justice- the place is quite spacious.  The best part of it was that it was a short walk to the \"\"T\"\"/subway!  Thanks Tania for making our trip that much more memorable! \""

12049787,71423456,2016-04-25,30310674,Erin,"The neighborhood is great. The studio itself was very clean and nicely kept. However there were plumbing issues. We also had difficulty communicating with the host, as Marie works for an agency and is not actually the owner of the unit. She is apparently not reachable via AirBnb. At one point, the owner showed up unannounced to address the plumbing issues, but then decided it wasn't something that he wanted to deal with. We were then left with an non-working bathroom sink and a bathtub that wouldn't drain. They were also very inflexible with the check in and check out times. They said they would store our luggage, since we had to check out at 11am, but it was kept in an non-secure hallway inside the entryway of building. There was no where to lock it up to ensure that it was safe. I was pretty disappointed in the hosts' level of service, especially after paying quite a high nighty rate."
12049787,73299762,2016-05-08,36652370,Jake,My wife and I had a great time in Boston and it's partially due to the location of this listing.  We were able to walk everywhere with ease (even to the aquarium!).  Granted it took a half hour but we had the time to do it.

The studio was perfect for me and included fast internet and cable TV (which I never got round to using). It's location both in the City and in the apartment block were ideal.

Clean, airy, the fully-equipped kitchenette with the addition of a few basics to cook a meal. Dave truly is the perfect host. Meeting me to make sure that I was comfortable, always available to respond to any questions, and the added touches to make all welcome -- coffee, cold filtered water in the fridge, lotions/shampoos in the bathroom.

Parking was very easy - we parked in the lot right across the street and didn't need to move or use the car again until we left town because we were so well located that everything was within walking distance. (Do note that you pay for the convenience with the parking lot fee). All in all this is the perfect place to stay in the North End and I would definitely recommend staying here!"
8471852,97466866,2016-08-27,7778337,Mimi,Great communication. Great location.

Centrally located in the North end, clean, easy to park across the street. Dave was high on the communication end with lots of helpful hints for those of us that hadn't been to Boston before and very quick to respond. Highly recommend!"
8471852,98911929,2016-09-02,86280116,Jonathan,Host was responsive and accommodating. Excellent.
12351909,70866711,2016-04-21,8970264,Nasim,"Alex was the consummate host. He made us feel welcomed and was very attentive to all our needs, going above and beyond suggesting things we might do with our three year old and even giving us some passes to the museum of science to use. The studio apartment was well appointed and clean. Cleanliness is very important to me and this place was spotless! The studio is in s cute brownstone on a quiet street technically in Roxbury. Having lived in Boston years earlier, I can say that this is not the safest neighborhood in Boston but things may have changed. I never felt unsafe while there, but I probably personally would not stay in the studio by myself if I were a single woman traveling alone. The studio has an electric range stove and refrigerator and we cooked almost every night. The one downside was I did not find the bed comfortable. It was both lumpy and soft so when my husband slept on one side his side sank and I was sleeping on an incline trying not to roll. People have different tastes when it comes to mattress preferences so this might be just right for someone who likes softer sinking in mattresses but I did not personally find it comfortable. There was an ikea couch that my daughter slept quite confortably on. All in all, this was an excellent stay and an excellent find, mainly because the studio was so clean and well appointed and because you couldn't ask for a better host than Alex."
12351909,72097487,2016-05-01,58970010,Konrad,"Alex ist ein großartiger Gastgeber. Das Appartement ist nagelneu, sehr sauber und bietet genug Platz. Ein kurzer Fußmarsch zur nächsten U Bahn bringt einen sehr schnell in die Innenstadt. Alex ist ein extrem angenehmer & hilfsbereiter Gastgeber, sowie ein super Ansprechpartner für die diversen Sportveranstaltungen in Boston. Wir würden bei unserem nächsten Aufenthalt in Boston definitiv wieder bei Alex unterkommen wollen."

The apartment is incredibly spacious and newly renovated, and in a quiet neighborhood. The orange line is just a short walk away, making transportation around the city very easy. Alex texted us before we arrived and while we were there to make sure our stay was comfortable. I'll be sure to keep Alex in mind the next time we visit Boston, and can't recommend this apartment enough!!!"
12351909,74878695,2016-05-17,64976747,Kamakshi,We had a nice stay at alex's place. The appartment was indeed just a 7 minute walk from the t station and recently renovated. The appt itself was quite nice and spacious. Alex was a good host who answered all our questions and even helped us with tickets for a red sox game!
12351909,75435883,2016-05-21,8108319,Nicola,"The description of this listing is very accurate. It is recently renovated, clean, and quite spacious for a studio. The kitchen appliances are  modest, but adequate for a short term stay. My husband and I were there for three nights and were entirely (URL HIDDEN) is actually not a very busy street and was quiet at night. The bed was comfortable. It is a short walk to public transportation and not far from Northeastern U. either by foot or public trans. Parking can be tricky, as cars must be moved before 8 am. Otherwise, the street has very available overnight parking."

L'appartement en lui même était spacieux et bien équipé, propre et récent. Alex a été un hôte parfait, présent pour rendre service tout en respectant notre intimité. Je le recommande et y retournerai avec plaisir lors d'un prochain séjour à Boston."

12351909,80277383,2016-06-17,20183197,Matthew,Amazing spot! One of the nicest places I've ever stayed at so close to Boston's center. Very easy walk to either the Roxbury Crossing or Jackson Square subway stops.
True to the posting,the space is newly renovated and feels quite homey. Really spacious and clean bathroom. The kitchen is simple yet still covers all the essentials for staying multiple days!,,,,
Easy and safe entrance with coded entrance.,,,,,
And easy parking just a street away.,,,,,

12351909,84110654,2016-07-05,51408207,Meaghan,"Being that this was the first time to visit Boston, Alex made things really easy when it came to checking-in and checking-out. The apartment was just as described in the photos...Very clean and freshly renovated! It's definitely a quick walk to the nearest T station (Orange Line) -  as well as ample amounts of Uber drivers nearby should you go that route. There was only two other apartments in the building, and those neighbors were quiet, so it was pleasant to stay as well as we felt safe knowing there were other people in the building. The neighborhood is great during the day, but if you are out late, taking an Uber directly to the apartment would be your best bet. All in all, I would definitely book with Alex again at any of his Airbnb locations. He was responsive and made himself available if needed. Thanks Alex!!"
12351909,84467672,2016-07-07,7041588,Eva,I had fantastic time at Alex's  apartment.

12351909,87718938,2016-07-21,26183431,Yewming,"I had a wonderful time in Boston partly thanks to Alex's apartment. I faced some issue during check-in and he was quick to come to my help. He was respectful of my privacy while still attentive to my request. The apartment is located at a great location, near T stations and supermarkets are easy to come by. It had everything I needed, what you see in the picture is what you get. If I ever come back to Boston, I would choose Alex's in a heartbeat."
12351909,89807272,2016-07-30,37826495,Vanessa,"Alex's apartment is really nice and very convenient to the Orange line (5 - 10 min walk).  Alex's place is spacious, has an updated bathroom, all the basic kitchen amenities and was very quiet.  The check-in/check-out process was super easy and convenient.  Alex was very responsive and always there to help. Overall I had a really great experience."
12351909,90574697,2016-08-01,2404547,Andy,Alex was great host.  The studio apartment was clean and functional - Fine for two but would be cosy for 4.  5-10 minute walk to neighbourhoods where you can access food and restaurants.  Access to T is good but we found Uber as cheap for 3 pax and used that more.
12351909,92354353,2016-08-08,73211143,Brian,Had a great time in Boston. Location was great to Fenway Park
12351909,92891085,2016-08-10,82363324,Martin,This is a great airbnb.i would highly recommend this residence on your trip to Boston. The unit had so much to (URL HIDDEN) was like staying in your own hotel suite. The area is quite safe and we were walking late at night after a ball game without any trouble. The establishment is within walking distance to the subway which will take your into the heart of Boston.
12351909,94160036,2016-08-15,66114512,Lindsay,"Alex was a great host! Accessible, flexible, and kind.  We used this space as a home base while my boyfriend went on a bunch of job interviews and it was close to the action of downtown but out of the hustle and bustle so he could get some rest at night. Parking was a breeze (free on street right out front on evenings and weekends) which was another plus! I would definitely recommend this place!"

6939126,36472932,2015-06-28,35676223,Craig,Tara's place was perfect for our time in Boston. It was clean and had a nice spot for parking.
6939126,36619122,2015-06-29,6978037,Greg,"It's a fantastic, spacious studio apartment in a beautiful part of Boston.  Tara stayed in touch before, during, and after check-in and ensured that everything went smoothly.  Highly recommended!"
6939126,38174437,2015-07-13,36473299,Alvaro,Tara was very nice and helpful.
6939126,38660050,2015-07-17,2650694,Mike,Great location.  Easy to get around.  Street parking wasnt too bad.
6939126,38749107,2015-07-18,21006161,Sang Yup,"The neighborhood was absolutely lovely! The area was gorgeous, really close to the Prudential center, and even better than the listing. Tara was very accommodating, even through a lot of logistical details while making the reservation. She was a very nice and friendly host, and the space was absolutely lovely. Definitely would recommend anyone stay here while in Boston."
6939126,39465921,2015-07-23,5280382,Charles,We had a very nice stay at Tara's place and all worked very smoothly. Communication was very good and it is a great neighborhood. We would do it again!
6939126,41382283,2015-08-07,16770598,Nick,The apartment was in a good location a short walk from the Silver Line and a market down the block.  Tara was super accommodating with an early check in. We weren't totally happy with the interior but for the price it was a great deal in Boston.
6939126,42280642,2015-08-12,34540540,Lexi,"This was a terrible experience. The location was great, but unfortunately I have nothing good to say about the rest. The place smelled like old cigarettes, the bed didn't have a mattress- it was a 4 inch foam pad, there were no sheets or comforter, the kitchen wasn't clean, there was food all over the walls and cupboards, grease splatters on the kitchen walls, a pan of grease sitting in the refrigerator, the TV and cable didn't work, and no pillowcases. There was very poor communication and she changed our check in time the morning of. Parking was terrible If you have a car. I would never recommend this place to anyone."
6939126,43443713,2015-08-19,2045118,Jason And Stephanie,"We didn't meet Tara in person, but she had a clever way of leaving us the keys. She was quick to respond and made it clear that she was available for anything we needed. The neighborhood was quite nice, which explains the high price. It was tidy and modestly equipped. Served our simple needs well, as we only stayed one night. Thanks!"
6939126,46604986,2015-09-12,38368160,Lauren,"Great neighborhood and perfect for anyone attending a conference at Copley Square.  Everything went well and I had no problems. Though they were provided, I chose to bring my own sheets and towel and they came in handy."
6939126,47643693,2015-09-21,12996111,Gretchen,"On the positive side, the neighborhood was close in and safe, the price was “right,” the TV was huge, and Tara was very accommodating.  On the negative side, Tara needs a handyman and should make a trip to Target.  The air conditioner was loud, which may be true everywhere.  However, it drained into a sopping wet beach towel wedged under the a/c unit and dripped onto a wooden seat below. The mattress was soft and not very thick, the sheet was nylon, and the bedspread was an inexpensive fleece blanket.  The front of the bed frame was perforated by about a dozen sharp staples which snagged anything touching them.  There is a huge Sony TV with Showtime, but it became too painful to watch when the cable service continually cut in and out.  The bathroom faucet yielded only a pencil thin trickle of water.  Some of the eating utensils were of dismal quality and could easily be upgraded with a garage sale purchase.  All in all, we probably got what we paid for, but some modest upgrades / repairs would have made us more comfortable."
6939126,48938751,2015-09-29,33245905,Jessie,Great location! Tara was very easy to get ahold of and always quick to respond.

6939126,74445928,2016-05-15,28162225,Jenae,Tara was a great host and the listing description is exactly as in the photos and as described. She checked in with me during my stay to ensure that everything was okay.

She also left the light and television on since I was getting in late. I really appreciated the communication and the space was great and reasonably priced. The neighbourhood was fairly quiet and easy to get in and out of in a hurry with easy access to everything. The apartment was clean, bed was comfortable and there's really not much more I could ask for in that regard. Thanks for letting me stay with you Tara! I will definitely be booking this place if I'm ever back in Boston!"

I was able to park right outside the front door, and then walked everywhere I wanted to go. Overall, a great stay!"
10764250,66415241,2016-03-22,49437205,Darren,Kathy seemed like a very nice person.  She stocked the fridge with food for us to eat which was amazing.  The house was very spacious and the beds were very comfortable.  A little far from downtown but uber was very fast
10764250,80458221,2016-06-18,15983543,Jan,"This is a great appartment, conveniently located close to the trains into Boston. Within 10 min walk you'll also find some shops and food outlets. Kathy was very responsive and helpful with additional information for transport. Being able to use the driveway for your car is an extra plus."

14110129,89649223,2016-07-29,51145736,Xavi,Qing was an excellent host. The place was extremely well kept in addition to being in a great location. I highly recommend staying here.
14110129,92220326,2016-08-08,11852682,Daniel,"The location was perfect for Boston Commons, getting to the Northend or Chinatown either by walking or public transit. The apartment is very close to Boston Commons, just about 50 feet away. The inside of the apartment is very clean. AC in the bedroom is very powerful, careful how you set it or may find yourself quite chilly but it's nice to have good AC in the Boston summer! There's good food in the area, especially in Chinatown which is only a block or two away and there are metro stations very near by. The bedroom had a fairly comfortable bed and there is a fridge and freezer if you want to save any leftovers. There's also a CVS, Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, and walgreens all with in walking distance. There are a number of people who loiter and a few homeless people who seem to sleep on the street the apartment is located on, so just be prepared for it if you aren't used to being central in a big city. That said, we had no problems with anyone when staying here. All in all, good experience, would stay here again."
14110129,92888095,2016-08-10,72704404,Christian,"Daniel's review below accurately describes the apartment, surroundings, and convenience. This was a very nice place to stay. Qing and her manager are what earned the 5 star rating. Before we arrived I asked if there was a coffee machine. Qing responded that there was not but she immediately offered to buy one. Not just buy one but asked if there was a model or style that I would prefer...and sure enough it was there when we arrived!! Qing's manager was very kind and friendly and greeted us when we arrived and gave us a quick tour of the apartment. The apartment was very clean and felt comfortable from the moment we arrived. We felt safe with my children there and it the convenient location and subways made it easy to get anywhere in Boston or Cambridge. Overall very nice and I thank Qing and her manager for making it a great stay! I suggest this location as a great value in Boston for a safe convenient place to stay."
14110129,95975587,2016-08-21,79990710,Sat,"Location is very downtown. I walked in Boston common park in the morning every day, (many homeless in the park, but they didn't interrupt me). Qing was very responsive thru mail. Also, i had to reschedule my trip, Qing refunded the last night for me. Very impressive. The unit will be best if tv has English language (all in Chinese language). Not fit for woman alone cause of having St. Francis house for homeless on the opposite. But there was no problem for my trip."

2778656,12031762,2014-04-21,10408877,Delwin,This place was fantastic for 3 people. Location was very convenient since it is pretty much right next to the airport (walkable distance to the T).

Literally a short walk through a park to the train station, and free shuttles from the train to the airport. Very Convenient. Neighborhood was nice. Great restaurant a few blocks away-Angela's Cafe."

On top of that the train station was two minutes away which made it an extremely easy commute in addition the train led straight to the beach!

"Thanks Josh\"",,,,,

The space is tight and needed a few small spaces for personal items inside the bedrooms.  We stayed there while the owners were away for the weekend. Since the photos show pictures of only beds, it wasn't as easily understood that all that is available is the bed. There are so many personal items everywhere in the bedrooms and bathroom.  We felt like we were intruding and piled in. I"
Spoke with Joshua after he returned home about my concerns and he was cool about it.  I'm an active host in Chicago and my boyfriend lives on the road using Airbnb with frequency,so we aren't 'nit-picking'. Although a few arrived early to drop bags,the house smelled from the garbage needing to be emptied. The tub needed a scrubbing badly. The fridge was full and had an odor and as I wrote,we had no space to put a personal item next to the bed (like charging a phone overnight). My friends from Europe commented that they felt like we were intruding in someone's house. There were other little things about cleaning as well,but I'll just end it with this.  The flat could go with a really good cleaning and organizing. These being addressed in the near future,"it's a good location to stay. \""

El sector es muy cerca al metro para fácil acceso al centro de Boston (15min). Sirve como lugar solo para dormir,ya que es desordenada la casa y el edificio es muy viejo.,,,,

2778656,30629069,2015-04-25,6722535,Robert,My wife and I were not too pleased with our stay here.
As soon as we walked into the condo,we were overwhelmed with the smell of pot (one of the rules for this condo is no smoking,part of why we elected to stay here).,,,
When bringing this up to Joshua,he intimated that it was coming from the tenants below us - not sure,we didn't smell it at all on the 2nd floor landing,only INSIDE of Joshua's condo.,,
My guess is the international student staying here,but I guess I'll never know,,,,
Once we got all of our stuff inside and settled,we went to lay on the bed - and immediately rolled to the middle.  It was a completely sunk mattress.  Just something to be aware of if you're staying here.,,,,
Within 1 hour of our arrival,my wife shrieked twice - cockroaches.  Small ones,but still.,,,
The kitchen was nice,though we didn't really have cause to use it.,,,,
Living room seemed comfortable for lounging.,,,,,
Bathroom was passable.,,,,,
Up until this point in this review,I would probably not recommend this place to a friend.,,,,
But it gets worse.,,,,,
In Joshua's instructions for us and our arrival,he said the following:,,,,
"\"\"As we are not going to be there after you leave and before the next guest arrives","we ask that you leave the place in the same condition as you find it when you arrive.\"\"",,,,
So you're telling me that whoever comes next is not going to get clean sheets like we did (IF we did...)?  How about having any clean towels/washcloths,cause we're going to use the ones that are set out.  So do they get sloppy seconds? So if they're going to get ANY of these standard amenities,it's going to be because I played housekeeper?  That to me is unacceptable.,,,

With only a few subway stops to downtown, his location made our car-less experience in Boston very fun and easy. Up to the point of our trip, and even afterward, Joshua was in good communication with us and very accomodating. We accidentally left a jacket in his home and he was kind enough to mail it back to us right away."
2778656,70670859,2016-04-19,22207215,Matthew,Great host and location! It was a convenient (2 minute) walk to the train station to get to downtown in 10 minutes.

This was my second time staying with Jason and both condos far exceeded my expectations.  For this most recent stay, I was travelling with my college age son and we both loved Jason’s brand new condo – the bathroom and kitchen were tastefully renovated and the open kitchen to living room floor plan was great for hanging out."
The location of the condo is just around the corner from Newbury Street and Boylston Street,the Hynes Convention Center Subway stop,and so many shops and restaurants I look forward to trying on subsequent visits.  I will be coming back to Boston with some regularity and Jason’s condos will always be home base – his Back Bay neighborhood locations are exceptional and I can’t wait to take him up on the harbor cruise offer if I make it Boston over the summer months. Thank you Jason.,,,

12092499,71277513,2016-04-24,45556205,Lindsey,Apartment was perfect!  It was in a great location and everything in the apartment was clean and fresh.  I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Boston.  Jason was a great host. He provided detailed instructions about the apartment and even recommendations on food in the area.  He was available if we had any questions or issues.
12092499,71874534,2016-04-29,2656987,Mike,"Beautiful one-bedroom apartment in Back Bay. Super clean, easy to access. I was with clients at the Hynes Convention Center; which was about a 10-minute walk. Jason was fantastic, sent great materials in advance on the place, how to access it late at night (which is when I was arriving) and all the nearby places I'd need to know. Checked in on me, made sure I had what I needed. All around, a great experience."
12092499,74628278,2016-05-16,11426319,Diana,"Our stay at Jason's was lovely and comfortable. He was super responsive and accommodating prior to and during our stay. The space is exactly as pictured and having the option to purchase a parking spot in the back (with ability to come and go as you please) was a convenience we were happy to take advantage of. The neighborhood is also gorgeous, and Jason provided great insight on local eateries and more. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Boston."

12092499,76320470,2016-05-26,66471308,Leslie,Jason was right there when we had trouble in the dark opening the key lockbox.  The apartment is sunny and light--and immaculately clean. Very good mattress!
"It is literally a couple of blocks to hip restaurants and Newbury St. shopping.  The MBTA is also only a couple of blocks away. Cab to theater district or waterfront also won't break the bank.  A good find!\"",,,,,

Jason was a friendly and welcoming host who dealt promptly with our few requests.  We'd love to spend more time in Boston and would definitely stay here again.  Thanks so much Jason - and hope to see you again."
12092499,78790144,2016-06-09,59360629,Juan,The description of the listing was very accurate. I definitely enjoyed my stay at Jason's place. I highly recommend staying at his place. Also he has HBO so for the people that are currently watching GOT you're in good hands.

12092499,81321412,2016-06-22,23417391,Fred,Great apartment in beautiful Back Bay; highly recommended. Jason's recommendations regarding restaurants and things to do were very useful.
12092499,81957142,2016-06-26,29418544,Michael,The apartment was wonderful. Very clean and new. Great place to stay in Back Bay that's literally around the corner from Mass Ave. Also a 10 minute walk to Fenway Park which was convenient. Would highly recommend staying with Jason!
12092499,82635479,2016-06-28,5660272,Ted,"For our first visit to Boston, we were thrilled to stay in such a great location in a first class apartment.  Jason was easy to deal with and eager to please.  We enjoyed being able to walk to many key sights, pick up groceries, wine etc two doors down and take an evening stroll along the river one short block away."
12092499,92387625,2016-08-08,70881565,Sue,We had a great 5 night stay. The apartment is just as described and was spotlessly clean. The arrangements for collecting the keys worked well.  We loved the area; so many beautiful streets to stroll around and great shops and restaurants on the doorstep. We took up the offer of an afternoon's sailing with Jason's dad and this was one of the highlights of our trip.
"The only downsides were that I would have liked a full length mirror and the carpet on the stairs in the communal areas is looking tired.\"",,,,,
12092499,92613871,2016-08-09,35654003,Jason,Jason was a wonderful host.  He was very prompt with all communications from the initial reservation all the way through to the in-stay inquiry to make sure everything was going well.  The unit was very clean and representative of the posting.  The location is PERFECT.  Very close to Newbury / Copley area and a 10 minute walk to Fenway!   I would definitely stay again!
12092499,93495832,2016-08-13,87981767,John,"First time using Airbnb and was extremely pleased with the experience.  Jason was very accommodating and the apartment was everything I had hoped for, excellent location, very clean and comfortable.  Jason himself was a great host who made the visit a piece of cake.  I would highly recommend staying at this location and will not hesitate to go through Jason on my next visit to Boston."
12092499,94141127,2016-08-14,19421353,Ao,"Jason's place is amazing! Great location, beautiful and sunny apartment. Communication was very easy, I also got great restaurant recommendations from Jason!"
12092499,95459284,2016-08-19,40898160,Yasunao,"We were visiting family near Boston and took the opportunity to say in Jason's property in Back Bay. It was very easy to communicate with the host and the check in information provided was more than our expectation. We arrived late in the evening but no trouble getting the keys and accessing the apartment. Property was clean, room was made up and all amenities were ready to be used. The neighbourhood of the apartment is a very safe area and the building was  secured which made us feel safe at all time. The attention to detail was beyond expectation."
We particularly appreciated the host providing their recommendations and local insights on the restaurants and shops nearby making it very convenient for a family with small child.,,,,,
In sum,"host was hospitable and accommodating. We felt very welcomed and will definitely return as well as recommend it to our friends.\"",,,,

1059604,5618329,2013-07-08,2301337,Ryan,"Living on the boat house was a unique way to experience Boston.  The house was in great condition and very comfortable to stay in.  However, the location is far from ideal.  While East Boston is a relative safe area, it is far from most of the attraction and restaurants."
1059604,17099412,2014-08-07,16664556,Linda,"We had a great time on the house boat.  The pictures are exactly as it is in real life.  It was clean and spacious and my kids loved the loft accomodations.  The location was within close proximity to a grocery store, liquor store and pharmacy.  It was close to downtown Boston about $15-20 by cab and about 10 min by water taxi.  The only issue we had was the water taxi.  They definitely were not available at various times and actually one day refused to pick us up.  We finally coordinated our times with a neighbouring renter however became frustrated when we were given different ways to secure a way home by the various drivers and on our last day ended up taking a cab as they refused to pick us up before 8:30 pm.."
1059604,19418578,2014-09-12,2327383,Maria,"Really nice stay. Ryan is really nice and helpfull, and we enjoyed our stay. It was perfect for a family!"
The wifi didn't work that well.,,,,,
When we figured out the bus/subway system,it was easy to get around from the houseboat,and we went by watertaxi one day as well,that was lovelly.,,
"All in all a wonderful stay!\"",,,,,
1059604,19843146,2014-09-19,9301756,Alex,"Staying at Ryan's houseboat was an absolute pleasure, we only wished we could have stayed longer. The keys were waiting for us when we arrived and Ryan talked me through finding the boat on the marina and getting in. The boat itself was very spacious, and functional, with 24 hour hot water and heating which was very convenient and just as comfortable as staying in an actual house. The sunsets from the balcony were phenomenal and it was easy to get cabs into town. I would highly recommend Ryan's houseboat to anyone visiting Boston."
1059604,20365041,2014-09-28,20913127,Mary,"The houseboat was great time and I have told friends and family about this little gem. Having the water taxi made it a great location. Just wished that we had more time to relax and enjoy it. Thanks so much for getting us the new coffee maker! We should have told you earlier but no big deal. Also, thanks again for lining up the taxi to get us to the subway. We will check into Airbnb.com before we ever make a hotel reservation again! I highly recommend  this houseboat and had my best 3 night sleep EVER!"
1059604,20634452,2014-10-02,496822,Jens,"An unusual place to stay; I loved it. I almost don't want to share this secret gem. Ryan's Houseboat is exactly why AirBnB is great - I would never have found such a place on a business trip otherwise: A houseboat in a less than fashionable but weird and wonderful part of town. Maybe not for everyone, but highly recommended if you're up for something special. It worked very well as accomodation: The houseboat is better equipped than most rentals, a utilitarian construction as such, but with a good kitchen, good furniture, good appliances, clean, everything in perfect nick and extra touches such as a quality Bose sound system. On top of that Ryan is a pro host, fast, polite, easy to communicate with and very helpful. The East Boston port comes complete with draw bridge, a scrap yard, it's a working port - it's actually a pretty romantic setting. And it's really well situated: You can actually walk to the airport in 15 Minutes (Airport T Subway stop on Blue Line), the only city in the world that I know where that is possible."
1059604,21093033,2014-10-11,13703145,Leslie,"I had always wanted to try out staying on a houseboat, and Ryan made it very easy. I had everything I needed to have a very pleasant experience. It would have been much harder to find if he didn't give superb directions. It was within 10 mins walking distance of the Airport subway stop and shuttle busses, which I appreciated greatly."
1059604,21529915,2014-10-19,9115834,(EMAIL HIDDEN),It was a good and nice two days on the houseboat.  The Description in the Inserat are total alright. It was very nice to come back from down Town and have a nice Place to spray.
1059604,22061405,2014-10-29,19185392,Alice,"We arrived late on a Sunday night but were able to get Ryan on the phone to help us get to the right houseboat at the Marina.  When we could not find any towels on the houseboat, I called Ryan again.  He arranged for towels to be delivered to the Houseboat within a couple of hours."
The next morning,"Ryan stopped by the Houseboat to check on us.\"",,,,
1059604,22589544,2014-11-10,4176196,Kang Min,"I didn't stay at this exact boathouse (we were upgraded to a larger boathouse which was excellent) so I can't comment on this boathouse, but what I can comment on is Ryan's excellent customer service! He was prompt in replying to emails. Also, as there were some transient issues with the heating on the boathouse, after we mentioned it to him, he was at our boathouse within half an hour carrying two portable heaters (in the rain!) so we wouldn't be cold! I would strongly recommend rentals managed by Rock On Rentals - unbeatable customer service!"
1059604,34229438,2015-06-06,26072832,Roger,"The accommodation was adequate, in hindsight maybe not the most suitable for my Aunt, too many stairs. The water taxi was limited and really only fixed one, pick up and drop off. Unfortunately the accommodation is not he one listed so the review does not really apply to the actual houseboat."
1059604,49397048,2015-10-03,28937340,Carolyn,"\"I made my arrangements late in the game, so I ended up being switched to Zphyr instead, as Ryan has a few boats in this East Boston marina.  Thus, where I stayed does not match the photos here, but if you go to the Zphyr page, I would say the photos are an accurate depiction of what the place actually looks like, except I think there's an additional couch now under the TV, which is nice for the added seating. Generally, Zphyr was comfortable and clean, with working TV and appliances (AC worked great in the humidity leading up to the tropical storm), a little kitchen table area I don't think you see in the photos, and there are 2 bedrooms and baths split between 2 berths, both with 2 twin beds apiece.  I opted to use the public showers and bathroom for the added space, but anyone wanting to stay on the boat for this purpose could do so.  The \"\"neighbors\"\" in the other boats were friendly and welcoming of my dogs.  The harbor was used to having dogs around"
1059604,63291225,2016-02-21,59183577,Asa,Great Host. Great place. Nice view on the water. Will definitely stay again!
1059604,68547877,2016-04-05,44496663,Emily,Overall - pretty decent experience. Ryan was responsive and it's fun to be on a houseboat at the end of the day.
"Couple things to be wary of though - the houseboat isn't located in the best part of town - not a ton around. Also the internet/cable doesn't really work (didn't for us at all but definitely wouldn't be good enough for streaming etc.). Wouldn't count on the TV for entertainment so bring other sources! \"",,,,,
1059604,69401646,2016-04-11,4550672,Isabelle,"voilà une merveilleuse façon de se loger à Boston façon Marina!!! L'accueil a été charmant, le logement original, quartier proche du centre, les bateaux passent, les ponts se lèvent à leur passage... vue imprenable, le top du paysage!!!! Et tout confort!"
1059604,70428909,2016-04-17,26365919,Emily,"Staying on a houseboat in Boston was awesome. We felt like we were in a floating tiny house, and that was exactly what it was. Perfect size for two people. There is a loft that can sleep more, but I would have been claustrophobic up there. Kitchen with everything you need (except coffee cups, but I'm creative so it worked out), bathroom, living room, two decks (upper and main level) and surprisingly good size bedroom with. Comfy bed."
We didn't need it,but there was a washer and dryer with detergent - nice option!,,,,
Our favorite thing was the adventure of staying there. We weren't stuck in a stuffy hotel. We had windows and screen doors and had an awesome breeze. Plus,waking up and seeing water and boathouses was incredibly relaxing and neat.,,,,
I slept so soundly that I woke up two hours before my alarm.,,,,,
Super cool option: taking the Rowe's Wharf Water Taxi. Good option for traveling since you're right on the water.,,,,,
Ryan gave specific directions on how to get there. Pay attention because GPS will get you close,but not quite there. Many of our uber drivers had never been to this location before.,,,,
"My only regret is not getting to stay longer. \"",,,,,
1059604,74175207,2016-05-13,70303572,Dave,"Thank you so much for letting us stay in your house boat for our stay. Such a nice boat, clean and comfy. It had everything and more than we needed."
1059604,76362826,2016-05-26,28357447,Christine,We wanted to come to Boston for a few days to see a Sox game and spend some time in the city.  Unfortunately our days off coincided with graduation times so hotel prices were astronomical.  Finding the Adventure Houseboat was a great solution to our dilemma!
Ryan was very friendly and professional,responding quickly to our questions; booking was easy.  Ryan checked in with us regarding our arrival time to make sure someone would be on hand to meet us.  Diego greeted us,gave us a tour,answered our questions and was also very friendly and professional.,,
The houseboat was just as pictured.  It was clean,bright and airy,much larger than most hotel rooms.  Both the kitchen and the bathrooms were well stocked with staples; there were plenty of clean towels and bedding.  The mattress in the bedroom was extremely comfortable (we didn't use the loft beds or sofa bed,so I can't comment on those.) AC was great,easily controlled by remote.  We enjoyed sitting on the deck and communing with the resident Mr. and Mrs. Mallard,whom we named Mildred and Kirby (they were just building their nest nearby.)
You are on a boat,so you will feel rocking at times: with passing boats or someone going off or on the deck.  It didn't bother us in the least.,,,,
The neighborhood was working class,but we felt safe and our car was fine in the parking lot.  We appreciated the free parking.  Getting in and out of the heart of Boston wasn't difficult,but it can get costly.  Uber was between $16 and $26 dollars,depending on time of day,traffic and the level of car available.  We used daily T passes in the city and if we'd been there longer we'd probably have investigated the bus from the marina to Maverick T station.,
Overall,the only hesitancy I would have about renting again is the proximity to where we go in the city.  Otherwise,we very much enjoyed it,"would stay here again and fully recommend it to others.\"",,
1059604,76605735,2016-05-28,15156535,Celeste,"Cozy houseboat in Boston Marina!  Ryan is a great host with excellent communication and responsiveness.   All beds very comfortable, the master exceptionally. Fully equipped galley. This was our first houseboat experience, and would do it again."

Ryan was very helpful with any questions I had and fast to respond, definitely recommend this accomodation, despite it being a little bit outside the city."
1059604,80458898,2016-06-18,76940463,Jake,"Overall, my friends and I had a great time on Ryan's boat! The digs were nice, and sitting out on the roof, watching the sunset (and a duck with her new baby ducklings!) was pretty great! The only issue we had was that one of the tanks on the boat was filled too high, which meant we were dealing with a 6 or 7% tilt (I measured with my phone's level). Other than the tilt (which was more amusing than problematic), the boat was very nice, Ryan was a pleasure to deal with, and our trip was great!"
1059604,81023651,2016-06-20,24752269,Momme S.,Ryan and Diego were very helpful upon arrival. The boat is everything as promised.
If you rent a boat you need to be aware that you live close by other houseboats. This is like camping and is okay.,,,,,
But,"please be aware that there is the Andrew McArdle Bridge very close. Car and truck traffic continued all trough our first night. Cars and especially trucks create a thumping noise when they cross the bridge.  We could not sleep for most of the first night and left immediately in the early hours of the following day. \"",,,,

Thank you so much, Ryan!!!"
1059604,85343377,2016-07-11,29564336,Anna,Tack Ryan för att vi fick bo i din husbåt. Det var en bra körbeskrivning som du lämnade oss. Tyvärr hade vi inget bra väder i Boston när vi var där så vi hade inte möjligheten av att njuta av utomhusmiljöerna. Det var en del oljud från bron och bilarna som var störande.  Wifi fungerade inte.

The interior was extremely clean and very comfortable, it's a perfect layout for a family visit which kids would love (especially sleeping in the loft) or for a couple or friends looking to get away... the upper and lower decks are amazing, we enjoyed watching the sunsets, the views of the water and feeding the local family of ducks... Ryan was an amazing host as well, responding to any questions I had immediately and made us feel extremely welcome... the neighboring town is a bit hit and miss but provides good local pizza (Broadway), liquor and convenience stores... the location is a short lyft/uber/drive away from the heart of Boston too (15-20 minutes depending on traffic)...  this experience was so much better than a hotel and I cannot recommend it enough!!! 5 out 5 stars all the way!!

The house has many design details, including some nice furniture and has a great patio with seating to make a barbecue or have breakfast under the trees."
The house is not near any metro station,however there is a bus stop right in front. parking is off the street,and we had no problems parking nearby. There are many nice places to eat and shop within walking distance.,,,
We liked our stay here,however there is a detail to be considered,the beds are not good at all,they are too small for couples and the mattresses very uncomfortable and outdated.,,
If the beds where replaced with good and comfortable mattresses we would not hesitate to return to this place. There are no design features that can replace a good nights sleep.,,,,,
The owner (or the broker,"we don't know) was very attentive and provided plenty of tips and was readily available on the phone when required.\"",,,,

We stayed here with a large group of twenty- and thirty-somethings,and it was a great place to hang out in between our busy schedule during the week. Several nights,rather than head out to the bar,we were content to grab a few beers at the bottle shop down the street and relax in the house.,,
Jeremy was very accommodating - I called him with a request before checking in,and he handled it easily. Check-in and out were both clear and easy.,,,,
My only cautionary remark would be that,because the house is older,"it's very much \"\"alive.\"\" The creaks give the house superb character in the daytime",but can be a bit noisy at night,if folks are light sleepers (and others are night owls). Still,this didn't cause much of an issue
All in all,"a highly recommended place to stay!\"",,,,
50032,10013861,2014-01-25,4133689,Brian,"I stayed at the house for work with a group of coworkers. It was the first time we as a company used Airbnb and It was a success. The house is great. It is an older house with tons of charm, and the kitchen has been remodeled amazingly. The neighborhood was also a fantastic asset. We finished work after long days and were able to walk up the block to a bunch of great restaurants. I would recommend the house for sure."

The house is perfect for large groups of people. Our group of old friends came from all over the U.S.,and the space,especially the large shaded deck,was perfect for relaxing and reconnecting. The charming home has character and a relaxed luxury fitting of the neighborhood.,,
"The proximity of the T and convenience of a week-long pass allowed us to get from Jamaica Plain to downtown easily. Cab rates are not outrageous. Boston's bike share program has stations near the home. And loads of marked bike lanes in and around town make riding safe. \"",,,,,
50032,35955729,2015-06-23,29046957,Caitlin,Jeremy was super prompt. The house is beautiful and in a great location - lots of walking distance restaurants & a Whole Foods. There was some slight plumbing issues with the unit upstairs but it didn't effect our stay & jeremy was very accomodate.

50032,63152867,2016-02-20,40653376,Mindy,The host canceled this reservation 33 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
50032,79397415,2016-06-12,24801296,Tiffany,Stayed in the house for a weekend with family while in town for a wedding. Great for large groups. Except there's only 2 bathrooms (I really wouldn't expect more though) so there will be lots of waiting for bathroom access. The host was quick to respond to any concerns we had.
14072256,90736783,2016-08-02,83394956,Edna,"He responded to my concerns in a timely manner. They made it feel like home with snacks, water and breakfast. It was great!"
14072256,90900864,2016-08-02,84517197,Harrison,"A quick and easy last minute stay close the airport. Not a very fancy/nice apartment, but super close to the airport and great for the price."
14072256,91440938,2016-08-05,10260339,Rob,"No-frills stay in a slightly down-at-heel neighbourhood, near to convenience store, subway stop with easy access to airport or downtown.  Room was basic but clean with a comfortable bed. Apartment is shared with other air b'n'b guests (communal kitchen, tv room, no host on site). There is air-con but no wifi."

14072256,97243124,2016-08-26,56363268,Andrew,Very satisfied with my stay. Convenient access to the airport. Nothing too fancy but very worth it for the price!
14072256,99096150,2016-09-03,91810118,Sarah,"Everything was as it was described. Place was very clean and organized, nice common room style area with a TV and the kitchen was great. the front door keypad made me feel very secure and the additional lock on the actual bedroom door was another perfect way to make me feel like I had my own area. I could not hear the traffic of the street in front of the apartment which was also great."
14072256,99643879,2016-09-05,92351138,Claudia,Appartamento che ha rispettato cio' che era scritto nella presentazione! A due passi dalla stazione della metro e dall'aereoporto. Host molto disponibile!
14072256,99945929,2016-09-06,23211126,Henry,"SP was a great host, very responsive and allowed for a painless last minute stay in Boston. Place was tidy and well located near the T station. Would stay again."
11202183,80289423,2016-06-17,76223669,Maryna,"Norah is a very nice host , everything is clean and new. Great location , walk distance to everywhere..our plans were changed and we needed to leave earlier , we even didn't think about refund . Because check-out time already gone,but Norah sent request to Airbnb about refund for us by herself . It was extremely kind of her. Thank you very much"
11202183,80623655,2016-06-19,72167705,Adam,The unit was a nice private basement studio a short walk from Boston Common. Norah and her boyfriend were very friendly. I enjoyed my short stay while I explored the charming Beacon Hill and Back Bay neighborhoods.
11202183,80974246,2016-06-20,77776233,Aaron,"Meeting up to let in went smooth, quick walk from the Commons parking garage. Lovely neighborhood and a cozy and comfortable space."

11202183,84079168,2016-07-05,14795914,Scott,"A great place to stay in Beacon Hill! Everything we did was in walking distance of the home. Safe old neighborhood with plenty to see and do in area including downtown Boston, Little Italy and much more. Comfortable accommodations, awesome host and beautiful city made for a great visit."
11202183,84399285,2016-07-07,5106411,Tristan,"Norah and Riley made me feel at home; and wanted me to contact them for any issue that may arise. The place is so very cute and nicely decorated. The neighborhood is beautiful, steps away from some of the most beautiful homes Boston has to offer and the park!"
Little things really made it: a keurig,bottled water in the fridge,"bed tv :P\"",,,
11202183,85647944,2016-07-12,60660908,Lacie,"Norah was friendly, welcoming, and accommodating. She was regularly available for any questions I had. The space itself was beautiful, homey, and very clean. It is in a great location and I would stay there again!"

11202183,87361727,2016-07-19,73815823,Maurice,This is a great and recommended place to stay when visiting Boston. Conveniently located in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood. Close to many tourist attractions and Boston Common.
11202183,87525650,2016-07-20,79269989,Kasim,"We stayed only for one night but the apartment and its location were both perfect for us. The apartment itself was clean, neat and had all the amenities as listed. The location was great since it was located within walking distance from the Boston Commons, the Freedom Trail, and many amazing food places. Norah was very accommodating and let us come in earlier than our check in time so that we could drop off our bags before we explored the city. Overall, it was a lovely and cozy place. We would definitely book again whenever we come to visit Boston again. Thanks Norah and Riley!"
11202183,89322322,2016-07-28,77792468,April,"I enjoyed this charming studio apartment for an entire week while I visited historic Boston! There is lots of room to move about, and the apartment had everything I needed to enjoy my stay.  It is very clean and comfortable, especially the bed which had down pillows and comforters! I slept like a baby after a busy day of seeing the city. For touring the city, the location could not be better; situated in beautiful Beacon Hill! My hosts were charming and attentive, and I would rate my stay 5 stars on every level!!"
11202183,90493831,2016-08-01,82010354,Kurt,"Great place to stay, Norah was an easy person to talk to and her home was a great place to stay while visiting the city."
11202183,92396930,2016-08-08,58112771,Chris,Norah was very friendly and the location was amazing. The room was reasonably priced and very clean. It was a great experience!
11202183,92663793,2016-08-09,2759178,Rune,I had a great stay here. The apartment is really cosy and the neighborhood is incredible. Would definitely stay again.
11202183,93442687,2016-08-12,74963280,Andrew,"Norah made checking-in very easy, as she was there to meet me when I arrived. She, and her partner Riley were both very friendly, and also respectful of privacy, and were quick to respond to any queries I had. The apartment itself is quite nice, was very clean, and actually a little larger than I expected. It's a great space to have, in a perfect spot, only a short walk to the Boston common, and to Charles st where you'll find a few Cafes for breakfast. Can absolutely recommend this place to a couple or a solo traveller. Many thanks to Norah and Riley for making my stay in Boston a nice one."
11202183,94065906,2016-08-14,88758764,Korinne,"Honestly, this Airbnb is top notch. Wonderful, scenic, historically located, close to everything including the T. I highly recommend staying here. Norah thought about everything and then some. The space is emaculate and beds are very comfortable. Thank you Norah!"
11202183,94478666,2016-08-15,13883469,Richard,Norah was great. She wasn't intrusive but very helpful. The place is lovely. Beacon hill is gorgeous. A lovely retreat from which to explore the city
11202183,97998408,2016-08-29,15744080,Kara,"Norah (and her boyfriend) were amazing hosts. The spot is in the PERFECT location for Boston, in my humble opinion. I've travelled to Boston many times and it's an easy walk to Newbury, North end, lower beacon hill and and easy T ride (or Uber) to other places like the art museums and Fenway. I loved this Airbnb and I would definitely stay here again."
The house itself is beautiful,winding staircases and old wood paneling. I loved every minute of it.,,,,
The only problem (which I didn't care about) is that since the house is old and you are only the bottom floor,you can hear people walking around; a really simple fix with ear plugs. :),,,,
"Overall - just amazing spot! \"",,,,,
11202183,98912504,2016-09-02,81469832,Andrew,Well equipped and pleasant accommodation in an excellent central location. Norah was very welcoming and accommodating and made our stay relaxing and enjoyable.
3294775,15082611,2014-07-01,4234694,Krissy,Jessica was super helpful! My plans changed and I had to cancel my plans to stay at her place. She was incredibly helpful  in finding a workable solution! I hope to stay with her next time!!!
3294775,15351600,2014-07-07,11730792,Lina,Jessica is a very friendly and easy going host. The place was clean and you can reach the city centre in a short time. Altough we only met Jessica on our last night we felt very welcome at her house. It was like a home during our stay in Boston.
3294775,16275871,2014-07-24,14640216,Mona,"Great experience ! The host answered really quickly and was very kin, everything was prepared for my arrival. Beautiful and large room, wonderful view and house. The neighbourhood doesn't not seem to be very safe for a girl alone at night, but I came back late sometimes by the subway and I never had any problem. Subway station Savin Hill, on the red line, is at 10 mn by walk."
3294775,16670425,2014-07-31,17341738,Elisa,I'm still staying here and have nothing but good things to say about Jessica and her house. I highly recommend staying here.
3294775,16857986,2014-08-03,17215928,Valentina,"Jessica was a Great host, kind, helpful and really nice. She Made our staying Great!"
3294775,17164950,2014-08-08,3895230,Erick,"Jessica was a fantastic host, and the place was lovely. It's cozily packed with books and artifacts, but clean enough for someone with a dust allergy."
3294775,17910683,2014-08-18,19972261,Laura,"Jessica is wonderful and the house is beautiful. Take a cab if heading back to the place at night. Overall, a nice stay."
3294775,19089218,2014-09-06,6043727,Nicolás,Jessica was a great host. She couldn't be there by the time that I arrived but she left everything done a arranged for me. My room was perfect and the place was ok for what I was doing that week. Just 10 minutes away from the T red line.
I would love to stay again at her place and chat more about life and music :),,,,,
Thanks for all Jessica!,,,,,
"Nico\"",,,,,
3294775,19345651,2014-09-10,19501865,Stéfan,"Jessica was very accomodating during our stay. We didn't see her as much cause we ride the city and she works a lot. Everything was as described, i recommand! Boston is an amazing city to explore."
3294775,19603849,2014-09-15,16990942,Fiona,"Jessica's a great host, everything was clearly explained and the room was lovely - way bigger than I was expecting. I came home late a couple of nights and didn't feel even slightly intimidated by the area. Handy location only 10 mins walk from the red line, I'd happily come back next time I'm in Boston!"
3294775,19833345,2014-09-19,10953883,Sergey,"Lodging at Jessica's Victorian style house was a nice options while I was at INBOUND 2014. It is located just 10 min walk from Subway Red line and 4 station south from South Station. Usually it takes me 30-40 min from door of house to door of convention center. Room was large and clean, queen size bed was  comfortable,wi-fi has a good speed. Sharing bathroom was only thing that bother me, but it is OK if you need to have a shower late in the evening and early in the morning. Jessica offered to use a kitchen and refrigerator, but I have not time to do it. If you don't mind to stay at Victorian style house, with old features and related issues, I would recommend Jessica's apartments for sure."
3294775,20061756,2014-09-22,8913661,Kerstin,Everything was fine!!!
3294775,20662355,2014-10-03,20948251,Ricarda,"Had a nice time at Jessica's place. The house is cosy, well equipped and close enough to the Metro to explore Boston easily without car."
3294775,20865549,2014-10-06,17832663,Saskia,"Jessica was a great host. The house is lovely with a nice ocean view. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable and the house is situated near the subway. We had a great time in Boston!"
3294775,22272655,2014-11-02,22859107,Vesna,"I have stayed at Jessica's home for 7 days. The room was nice and comfortable. Jessica was very helpful, accomodating and kind host. I felt cold the first day I came since in Europe we usually keep our homes very warm in winter and Jesica gave me a thick warm blanket ti keep me warm. Thank you for being so nice."
3294775,22528304,2014-11-09,21730002,Tatsuya,"Jessica was such a great host who takes care of a tourist as nice as her friend. I had stayed for a business purpose and iron and other necessities are there and well-structured once I arrived at her place. Furthermore, the view from the house is amazing too if the weather is nice. I recommend your stay at her place."
3294775,27675270,2015-03-09,7709511,Briana,"Jessica was extremely accommodating, was gracious when I arrived at 7:30 in the morning, showed me my room, provided me tea, as well as full access to her library, her kitchen, and the rest of her beautiful home."
Not only did she afford me my privacy when I desired it,but she was always warm and willing to talk about anything I had on my mind-- she was a great listener,and had lovely stories of her own to tell.,,,
The room was comfortable,sufficiently lit,well cleaned,and came with all of the information I could have possibly wanted on a desk when I first entered the room-- from maps,to house etiquette and everything in between.,
If you're ever looking for a place to stay in Boston,stay here. You'll not only feel right at home,but the home is beautiful,well kept,"and the tub in the 2nd floor bathroom is to die for.\"",
3294775,29144367,2015-04-04,8342005,Alina,I am glad we stayed at Jessica's beautiful house. Jessica was very kind and there for us when we had questions. I can absolutely recommend staying at her place!
3294775,29876773,2015-04-13,14885120,Leslie,"Jessica is an incredible host. I've stayed with her twice now, and would make it a point to stay with her again. The first time I stayed with her, she gave me a lovely tour of the area and of the local beach. Her home is full of character, charm, and is conveniently located. Having street parking is a great plus, but the T is not too far away either. It's always a pleasure to stay with Jessica."
3294775,30442096,2015-04-22,26070684,Manuela,"Jessica is a great host, she is a very nice and open person. After the cold and wet marathon Jessica welcomed us runners with a hot chocolate and hot water bottles - thanks again! It was my first experience with airbnb and it was a very good one. Jessica welcomed me the evening I arrived and introduced me to her home. It's a nice building, the room was spacious with a nice view; extra blanket for cold nights was provided. It was very uncomplicated, we could use the fridge and the kitchen freely. I stayed for 4 nights and next time I come to Boston I will come back to Jessica!"
It is located close to the underground,"and one can have a short run to the beach with a nice view. \"",,,,
3294775,31594691,2015-05-07,16060306,Sara,"I really liked staying at Jessica's house.  It was very much as described, a big house on a hill in a great neighborhood, convenient to the T.  There's a nice combination of opportunities for socialization with Jessica and with other guests, but plenty of private space for those who aren't feeling chatty.  I liked sitting out on the deck and looking at the trees and the distant ocean.  The shared kitchen had lots of refrigerator/freezer space to store stuff, and full cooking facilities."
Jessica was very warm and welcoming,went out of her way to help me arrange activities in the area.,,,,
"I would definitely stay here again!\"",,,,,
3294775,32037886,2015-05-12,11216053,Albert,Jessica was an excellent host and helped me get settled in despite my extremely late arrival. The property matched the description well and had a fully equipped kitchen. My bedroom was comfortable and clean. The internet connection was fast and reliable. People with allergies should use caution because an open window with a fan is the method of ventilation and cooling.
3294775,32373875,2015-05-17,1373291,Daren,The host made us feel welcome.
3294775,32706291,2015-05-20,31628627,Morteza,It was a beautiful and safe neighborhood to walk. 10 minutes to train station.
3294775,33448351,2015-05-28,16050279,John,The room was big and location was a 5 to 10 min walk from a BART train so easy to get around. Good value.
3294775,33700424,2015-05-31,21381711,Nathalia,"Jessica's place was great, everything was super clean and the directions to get to places were accurate and easy to follow. The house is beautiful, quiet, and centrally located. I enjoyed my stay at Jessica's place."
3294775,35318690,2015-06-17,20610824,Luise,"The accommodation was good, the furniture was old but the room was very spacious with lots of windows. the bathrooms and the kitchen are small rooms but everything can be handled."
3294775,35706033,2015-06-21,34650922,Aurelie,"We were in Boston for 2 days and Jessica's place is a great deal. it's well located on a nice house, easy to find with metro if you don't have a car as well like us. House and room were clean and fully matching description. we had a nice room with a nice rocking chair as well. We did not use the kitchen."
Jessica welcomed us on arrival and provided us immediately with all needed information such as house rules,keys,wifi and a bunch of useful information on the neighborhood and restaurants. She was very kind and everything well in place.,,,
"We recommend this place to stay in Boston.\"",,,,,
3294775,37800170,2015-07-10,6526784,Aaron,Authentic Southie room in an authentic home in an authentic neighborhood.  Walking distance to trains a big plus.  Jessica makes everything easy with well detailed instructions and suggestions for things to do in the city.  Lovely room and lots of charm!
3294775,38064708,2015-07-12,18634981,Carmen,Jessica was a great host! Everything was exactly as she described in the listing and her home is lovely.
3294775,38751973,2015-07-18,16259788,Jessica,"I had a great time at Jessica's place in Boston! I was going to a conference nearby and all the hotels were far away and super pricey, so this was a great find. I loved the neighborhood, which was eclectic and diverse and full of interesting finds. The room I got was (I think) even bigger than the one pictured here, with a comfortable bed, chairs, desk, towels, lamps, fans, a big mirror, dresser, two closets, lots of windows, free Wi-Fi."
The only thing I would have done differently is be able to give the cab driver better directions from the airport,as he had never heard of the street. (Of course,I still don't understand why he couldn't just plug it into his GPS,"which was sitting right there...)\"",,
3294775,39463312,2015-07-23,3965142,Samuel,"Avec plusieurs chambres proposées, on est amené à faire des rencontres, forcément sympa. Jessica est adorable. Le logement est simple d'accès par le métro (à peine 10 min de marche, en ligne droite). Vraiment convivial!"
3294775,40365965,2015-07-30,34818093,Yangkan,"Everything is perfect, there is so many useful information! Thanks a lot, very enjoy my time in Boston!!!"
3294775,40687239,2015-08-01,19575596,Jeff,I had a wonderful time staying at Jessica's house. The room she provided came with a nice work station as well as a few comfortable chairs. Checkin and checkout were very easy. The train station was less than ten minutes walking distance. I would stay again!
3294775,41436980,2015-08-07,6243362,Rebecca,Jessica was easy to communicate with and it was simple to make a reservation. Her place is in walking distance to the subway which made getting into the city convenient.
3294775,42189046,2015-08-11,37063438,Natalie,"Jessica was an outstanding hostess! She made me feel very welcomed from the time I walked into her home until I left Boston. Her home is very warm and has the feeling of being at grandma's house. Jessica's home is filled with beautiful art, books, and furniture. The train station is a 10 minute walk from the house. Along the way there are several places to eat and pick up any items you might need or want. I will definitely make plans to visit Boston and stay with Jessica."
3294775,43045203,2015-08-17,33839039,Kaitlyn,"This was a great experience!  Jessica made us feel welcome and was always quick to answer our emails prior to the trip.  She made it easy to check in and out, and left us plenty of information about the city.  The location was very close to the Red Line (about ten minutes) which was very convenient."
3294775,43404724,2015-08-19,39141111,Sam,"This was a fine place to stay. We had a nice room with the essentials. Jessica's directions were great, and we really appreciated being able to drop our bags off early. We even got access to our room early, which was nice."
3294775,44437181,2015-08-26,16803622,Eugenia,"A very lovely place to stay!! I spent 3 days in Boston and I couldn't find a better accommodation. The house is not so far from the centre and well connected with the metro station. The neighbourhood is beautiful giving you the idea of the old residential Boston. The room is clean and cozy and Jessica was a great and perfect host, kind and helpful in a very need."
3294775,46189272,2015-09-08,39118605,Girish,Jessica was an excellent host and I had a nice time at her place.
3294775,47734020,2015-09-21,41747406,Roland,"Our host, Jessica was quite nice and welcoming."
What a disappointment! Although the house was located uphill in a quiet neighborhood with ample street parking space,the house and the rooms were old,cluttered and cramped.,,,
It was a long way from our expectations and we were happy to leave early in the morning as the comfort level was way too basic. The bedding and pillows need to be changed as well and the floor was sticky to the touch. Rooms would need a total revamping to be rented to outsiders.,,,,,
The subway station is about 15 minutes away downhill and takes you in a reasonable amount of time into the city. Although we will visit Boston soon enough,"we would not stay in this location nor recommend it to anyone.\"",,,,
3294775,48084847,2015-09-23,40694296,Kevin,Jessica was a terrific hostess. She made me feel welcomed. The neighborhood was quiet and the neighbors were friendly.
3294775,49376648,2015-10-03,34960680,Esther,"Jessica greeted us at the house, and was very flexible and accomidating.  She created a book of local information and places to go, which included maps of nearby eating places and where the subway station was located.  She took time to explain which line to take, and which one brings us back to the correct station. We had a rental car but didn't really need it, as we walked and took the subway. There was plenty of street parking and close to the house."

Je suis restée plus de deux semaines dans l'une des chambres disponibles et j'en ai été extrêmement contente : Confort et calme. Tout ce dont j'avais besoin pour travailler mes cours d'anglais une fois de retour le soir.,,,,,
A noter que Jessica met toujours à disposition de ses guests des petites choses a grignoter,des livres,des articles de toilette,...Tout pour se sentir comme a la maison.,,
J'en profite pour remercier de nouveau Jessica pour son accueil et ses conseils pour découvrir au mieux Boston,ville dont je suis littéralement tombée amoureuse.,,,,
"Thanks a lot Jessica for your kindness. I do hope see you again \"",,,,,
3294775,52092277,2015-10-26,19073677,Yong,"Jessica wrote a detailed guide for us of how to get to her place from train station. We find it very helpful. She is warm and friendly,  agreed us in person when we arrived, and provided us with useful information of her neighborhood and Boston in general. As advertised, her place is safe and quiet."
Her house includes a kitchen and refrigerator. Although we didn't use it for this trip,"we think it as a big plus.\"",,,,
3294775,52352857,2015-10-28,46251391,Judith,"My experience was amazing, place was pretty and neat. And price was very reasonable. This location has beautiful restaurants and a train station that takes you to different places. Overall very good experience."
3294775,60388109,2016-01-23,3002201,Julian,"Jessica has been an amazing host, she told me everything about the house I lived in (biiig house!), the neighbourhood and gave me some good piece of advice on what to do in Boston."
The room was super cosy,with an amazing bed,a fantastic view and enough room to feel well in.,,,
To get to the city: 8 min walk and then around 10 min of subway,but also some bus stations around the house.,,,,
The neighbourhood is pretty quiet and some people may not feel too well there at night,but nothing bad happened to me. And as you live in an original victorian house,you might hear some of your neighbors in the other rooms (there could be like 1 to 4 other guests at the house) and thus need to keep the volume down on the upper floors,so don't chose this airbnb if you want to have loud conversations im your room :-),,
Chose this airbnb if you like a convenient space with all the furnitures you need,"want to get to know amazing people like Jessica and Berry and are looking for a quiet place to relax after a day walking around Boston.\"",,,,
3294775,64870221,2016-03-08,41724148,Aria,"Jessica is really nice and gave good advice on exploring the city. She welcomed us warmly and invited us to have home-made popcorns. The room has a beautiful view of the sea and there is a cozy reading room on the first floor. Jessica has coffee, tea and oatmeal for guests to enjoy, and you can use the kitchen for convenience. The bathroom has nearly everything that you may need. It is 10-minute walk to the subway station, and there are shops and restaurants in the neighborhood."

The house was clean as promised and it was really pleasant staying in Savin Hill. It's a lovely place and affordable. New England charm at a great price
3294775,67519129,2016-03-29,58633823,Naima,"This was my first airbnb experience and I enjoyed it. I didn't get many opportunities to interact with Jessica but she seemed friendly and accommodating. The house is older and radiator-heated, so I'd dress warmly and utilize blankets (provided) in colder weather. I appreciated that she provided quality coffee! Decorations and furnishings were artistic and charming. The bed/pillows were very comfortable to me; I slept well. Wifi was fine. On-street parking was free and plentiful. The location was convenient to the Boston Convention Center (no bridges/tolls, 12 minutes away with no traffic) while giving a glimpse of neighborhood life."

3294775,73679869,2016-05-09,16060306,Sara,"This is my second visit to this site - the house and rooms are great, I like having full use of kitchen and storage areas for food (including in frig/freezer).

I would definitely return!"

I loved having a light, comfortable, private room to come back to each day.  The kitchen is user-friendly:  clean, well organized and well equipped for making simple things."

Also the neighborhood is very quiet, parking is easy and subway is very close to go directly to Boston center. We felt good here since the beginning. I fully recommend. Thanks again Jessica."
3294775,96090938,2016-08-21,33762182,Maryna,"Jessica - intelligent and poetic, welcoming and friendly, constantly willing to help. At her home, you feel like you got to relatives, who are familiar with from the very childhood. Jessica not only offers apartments, but she welcomes people from around the world under the roof of her home. The apartments are in an old house on the top of the hill, it really reminiscents of the houses from the Harry Potter books. At the same time, the house is located in 7-10 minutes from the subway station and near the center of Boston. No doubt from the moment I know where I will stay in Boston and where I advise to stay to my friends."
2930663,12521116,2014-05-04,703326,Bryan,"Great place close to bars and the bike rental is right outside his door. 2 miles to Fenway, about 10 minutes on the bike. Ari is easy to access at all times if you need him."

This place is VERY convenient if you're looking to be in the BU area. The 57 bus will bring you to the main part of campus in about 15 minutes. If you're coming in from Alewife,the 66 bus from near Harvard Square stops right near Ari's place as well.,,,,
Good WiFi,"Iron/Ironing Board so I could look presentable for a seminar- everything one could need. Thanks Ari! \"",,,,

L'endroit était près du transport en commun (10 min. à pied) ce qui rendait nos déplacements assez facile. Nous avions une voiture et nous avons trouvé du stationnement gratuit à 5 minutes à pied sans problème. Il a fait très chaud lors de notre passage à Boston et Ari s'est organisé pour ajouter des ventilateurs dans la chambre. Nous n'avons pas eu beaucoup de temps pour discuter avec lui, mais il a toujours été de bon conseil et sympathique avec nous. Le lit est très confortable, ce qui était le plus important pour nous !!!"

He made sure the sheets were clean and the room was as pictured.  The neighborhood is around the corner from eateries, a block away from a convenient bus and a short walk to bars.  I've visited Boston a few times before but always had an opportunity to stay with friends so it was refreshing to be close to places locals frequent."

We were very happy with the neighborhood. There was a coffee shop nearby as well as a variety of close restaurants.
There are two things I think would help. The bedroom doors have locks but there are no keys so rooms must be left unlocked when the occupants are gone. Also,"there was a very nice hot pot for heating water but I would have liked to have had a coffee pot. All in all we were happy with our experience.\"",,,,

2930663,80850322,2016-06-20,25844000,Fernando,"Comfortable place, as described. Nice neighborhood. Great host! Recommended!"
2930663,91513739,2016-08-05,39392286,Chie,"Ari 的房子,属于一栋,纯租赁的房子, 一楼是厨房,客厅,洗手间,二楼有三个房间一个洗手间,三楼也有三个方面。虽然每个房间都有锁,可是每天都会有不同的人出入。地下一楼是洗衣机和烘干机(非常的脏,有蜘蛛还有蟑螂,估计打扫卫生的阿姨从来不会清理)总体来说地理环境很好,公车,地铁,购物买菜都很方面。 注意的是,房子坐落在一条主路和学校的旁边,所以晚上和早上会比较吵。总的来说不错"
2930663,92610878,2016-08-09,46736591,Justine,It's really convenient. There are bus station on the street and plenty of restaurant. The house is clean and big. It's very comfortable. It's really a nice place to live. Thank you!
2930663,93001635,2016-08-11,28352029,Britt,"Very convenient location - room was quiet comfortable and big, just as described.  Ari responded to my messages within minutes!  Overall I had a great experience!"
2930663,93367652,2016-08-12,79954114,Xiyu,"Ari's place has everything you will need. As a new comer to Boston, I felt like home and spent wonderful two days in this cozy place where transportation is very convenient. It took just about 15-20 minutes to the downtown. Highly recommend."
2930663,94896183,2016-08-17,6199970,Nathan,Had a very lovely stay.  Ari is very responsive to resident inquiries.  He keeps the home clean and orderly.  :)
2930663,95004026,2016-08-18,88730192,Albert,I only used the room for a few brief hours at night but was perfectly adequate to crash for the night and use the shower.
2930663,95377622,2016-08-19,61606767,Aharon,i loved my stay at ari's house.  I recommend staying here!
3755609,19703755,2014-09-16,7854249,Michelle,I was so fortunate to meet such a vibrant and lovely woman. From the first contact Rosa offered assistance with locating transportation into and out of the city. When I was delayed arriving by Super Shuttle she asked her daughter to assist.
3755609,21166699,2014-10-12,16690240,Kristina,Rosa is such a gracious and lovely host from the moment I entered her home to when I left. She offered assistance in and around the city as it was my first time to Boston and was traveling solo. She made sure to make my stay comfortable and even offered me her umbrella when it was raining! The room is spacious and is exactly as pictured.
3755609,22635690,2014-11-10,1679551,Fabian,"I had the joy to meet Rosa during my first stay in Boston. She was an excellent, caring host who does not only offer a clean, nice and quiet place to stay, but who was also open for interesting discussions in the evening. Her open minded personality as an experienced traveler around the world, as a writer, Spanish teacher and former gallery owner made it easy for her to accommodate any guest and to know very well what information and support is needed. I definitely recommend her place for any stay in Boston! She and her cute little dog will make you feel welcome right from the first moment."
3755609,27939183,2015-03-15,27697132,Carrie,"Rosa and her dog, Mevil, were so gracious and generous.  Rosa made me feel at home within 5 minutes of stepping into her apartment.  She was also really helpful in suggesting transportation and she even let me borrow cold weather clothing because I came woefully unprepared for the harsh winter conditions they have had, and still have, to endure.  Mevil is the sweetest dog and is so excited to make new friends.  He will also be your morning alarm clock, if you let him.  Both of them have such energy and vivacity, and welcomed me with open arms to their home."
3755609,28800846,2015-03-30,3935132,Lizzie,Rosa was an amazing host! She is a very stylish and creative woman and her beautiful home reflected that: she has great taste and the room was a pleasure to stay in.  The whole apartment was spotlessly clean and the room was very comfortable.  Rosa was so friendly and helpful to me - I loved meeting her and hearing about her interesting life. She is a perfect hostess and her home was a perfect place to stay - I'll be eternally grateful to her for making me feel so welcome to Boston! I'd recommend anyone to stay here.
3755609,32430341,2015-05-17,27409942,Sophia,"Rosa is an amazing host. Her place is very arty, lots of useful info. Rosa is super friendly and knowledgeable. I would definitely stay with her again and recommend 100%. It was a great experience!!!"
3755609,33394358,2015-05-27,6200694,Martin,"Rosa is great she's always trying to help you, the room was perfect very clean everything i needed, i strongly suggest this place, the bus stop its just a few minutes walking, you have a lot of options if you want to buy something to eat or cook."
"Thank you Rosa for everything\"",,,,,
3755609,34386008,2015-06-07,34482525,Hanfei,"\"Rosa is such a lovely host, and of course her little dog is so cute and friendly. When I came to Rosa's place, she said\"\"all the food here is for sharing.\"\" That's amazing right? She will tell you how to take the transportation"
3755609,35488881,2015-06-19,7498274,Jillian,Rosa was very accessible & helpful as I was preparing to travel through the duration of my time at her place. She was welcoming & very friendly.
Prior to staying there I didn't realize she had a small dog but she did a good job of keeping him out of my room. I did wish the room was a bit more private,the door was not solid so sound traveled through easily.,,,,
Overall,"it was a great experience and I was happy to have a place to stay in close proximity to the city/train stations & a place to park my rental car. Rosa was a gracious host and I believe she really enjoys having Airbnb guests stay with her. \"",,,,
3755609,36328405,2015-06-27,19937009,Pamela,"Rosa was most hospitable. She went out of her way to be helpful, taking me on a little tour of Roslindale and driving me to the station with my luggage when I left. The room is just as it appears on the website."
3755609,41438269,2015-08-07,17564909,Andrew,I was made very welcome. It is a good area of Boston.
3755609,42620702,2015-08-14,40641264,Rita,It was okay
3755609,47737774,2015-09-21,41835447,Shannon,Ms. Rosa was a really good and helpful host. She is extremely knowledgeable about Boston and gives you anything you may need around the house. The bus is right around the corner from her house which was convenient. I strongly recommend her.
3755609,48759979,2015-09-28,43019898,Kathrin,This Air BnB is exactly what you see in the fotos. Rosa is a warm and welcoming host. The only downside is the distance from Downtown Boston and the bus connection is not what I'm used to. If you have a car it is perfect. A safe cute neighborhood outside the city centre.
3755609,50088815,2015-10-09,43027062,Ronald,"Rosa was a wonderful host. The place is clean, quiet and with beautiful neighbourhood. Sincerely I feel like home."
Rosa has been living in Boston long time and she help me to understand Boston life. I will never forget this week in Boston. I recommend her place for stay in Boston.,,,,,
"Rosa es maravillosa! Sinceramente me senti como en casa. Como Rosa lleva tantos tiempo en Boston es toda una autoridad sobre lo es vivir en Boston y siempre esta abierta a explicar las cosas. Tiene un perro muy jugueton todo un encanto. Siempre recordare esta semana en Boston y recomiendo totalmente a cualquiera que quiera conocer Boston.\"",,,,,
3755609,50716495,2015-10-13,21013893,Amela,"Rosa was very helpful with all advices about staying and moving around in Boston. She find a time to chat with me, and even offering beverage, after my long touristy day."
Room was exactly as on the photo.,,,,,
I enjoy my staying in Rosa,"s  house.\"",,,,
3755609,72966618,2016-05-05,63670714,Elmira,"I'm very glad that I chose Rosa's house to spend my month in Boston. I had everything I needed and even more that I could have expected. Rosa was very generous in terms of all the house appliances that I can ever need and use. The room looks exactly as you see it in the description photo - it's large, bright and unique - there are lots of pieces of art from different countries. The room has a table and a chair, which was very important to me as sometimes I needed to stay at the house and work on my own. The house is located near to different bus stations within 5-7 walk distance."
During my first days,Rosa offered me her help and drove me to the grocery store so I could make myself a breakfast or a dinner and explained me thoroughly how can I get to downtown and which bus stops can I use.,,,,
Rosa is a hard-working person and spends a lot of time working,but you'll definitely enjoy having a dinner conversation with her. She has traveled half of the world and knows Boston inside out,"so you can ask her about any events going on and she will recommend you something you should really visit.\"",,,
3755609,74492974,2016-05-15,45748277,Constanze,I enjoyed staying at the apartment very much and Rosa is a very nice and friendly host. Everything was like expected on the picures :)
Rosa I always willing to help out if you have any questions or if you just want to chat for a little bit!,,,,,
"Thanks again :) \"",,,,,
3755609,81471222,2016-06-23,77398362,Blair,Everything was wonderful!
3755609,83388615,2016-07-02,39344683,Kritaarth,"Rosa is a lovely and charming host who is always available and helpful. She is very sweet and ready to talk if you ever want to be social while also perfectly okay with giving you your space otherwise. She also goes the extra mile in helping you out- when I was new to the area and had yet to get a bus pass, she let me borrow her week-long bus pass so I could make an important trip. Rosa is, in short, a fantastic host who is very sweet, helpful and caring."
3755609,92025465,2016-08-07,2469492,Carlos,Staying with Rosa is a home away from home. She is a wonderful and caring host who always treats you like family. The pictures reflect the spacious room and she makes sure it is always clean. She always trests you with breakfast and gealthy fruits.
5455293,29536353,2015-04-08,29178094,Shyla,Fantastic apartment very conveniently located and incredibly well (URL HIDDEN) nice to stay in an apartment and cook a nice meal and get some washing done at the end of our trip. Thank you
5455293,32129212,2015-05-14,1812574,Beverly,"We had a lovely stay in Boston. The unit was well stocked with a full kitchen, linens, towels etc. The host was very responsive and quick to reply when we had some problems with the internet. Will definitely be checking out if this spot is available for future trips!"
5455293,33384095,2015-05-27,20114597,April,"Place was clean and great, nicer than I expected. We were very comfortable. Instructions to check in was clear we had no trouble getting into the apartment at all."
5455293,34529946,2015-06-09,26543085,Leslie,"The rental is in a beautiful area of Boston, quiet and easily walkable to public transportation. The unit is very nice and comfortable with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. We very much enjoyed staying there!"
5455293,35573088,2015-06-20,18685996,Bill,Great place in a great spot.  Very clean and well furnished for our family of six.  Entry instructions were easy to follow.
5455293,50003820,2015-10-08,23248137,Dan,We received a detailed check in procedure with directions that were very accurate. No problems. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed for the week. The rooms are quiet and well lit. The building is in good condition and elevators and garbage rooms are clean. There is a playground visible from our room with access that was easy enough; our 1 year old really enjoyed that. The access to the Pru and restaurants/grocery stores in the area is a short walk. Highly recommended. Very professional.
5455293,51759900,2015-10-24,31481759,Susanne,The property was incredibly spacious and clean. Check in and check out were very easy and the app provided all instructions needed. The app had a lot of great information. We even tried some of the recommended restaurants in the area which were great choices! I would definitely stay at a stay Alfred property in the future!
5455293,52780032,2015-11-01,19469045,Niklas,"Staying at Jordans place was perfect. The apartment is really beautiful, clean and has a great infrastructure. We enjoyed our weekend and would definitley come back!"
5455293,53114324,2015-11-05,36632831,Diego,Todo resultó como esperábamos.  El departamento muy bien equipado y la ubicación es excelente.
5455293,54877748,2015-11-25,45597305,Jen,We had a great stay. Everything was exactly as the pictures showed. Easy access and it was in perfect neighborhood. We will be going back.
5455293,59216663,2016-01-08,20449615,Luis,The apt is very nice and well equipped. Pics on the profile are very accurate. Back Bay is a wonderful area in Boston and the complex where the apt is located is also very nice.
Checking in was very easy and in general the experience was very satisfactory.,,,,,
"Would definitely stay again.\"",,,,,
5455293,63710996,2016-02-26,1812574,Beverly,"My colleague and I enjoyed a wonderful stay for a business trip. The apartment was spacious enough for us to have our own space, and was well equipped for our stay. Check in/out was exceptionally easy and the location is very convenient. Would definitely stay again for future trips to Boston."

5455293,72571918,2016-05-03,9667638,Donna,"Terrific location, and very spacious apartment for 5-6 people. It was a delight to have a washer/dryer in the unit, two separate bathrooms, and parking including. The parking was a little challenging, as there was often someone in our space, but all we had to do was call the telephone number provided and there was always someone to answer promptly and provide an alternate parking space. It was so nice to have also a furnished kitchen and plenty of linens, pillows, and blankets. Ideal home away from home for a longer stay."
5455293,82110199,2016-06-26,9805844,Patti,"This apartment was perfect for our family of four.  The one we booked is a little different from the photos but that didn't affect our stay. The arrivals and departures package was very well done with photos as well as instructions.  The location is amazing, we walked all over the place.  We also had a car for trips outside of Boston so have a parking spot was a necessity.  Parking in downtown Boston is next to impossible.  The apartment was clean and well organized. The building itself was quiet and well managed.  Even though building management isn't responsible for the unit they were friendly and offered directions if needed. The one small issue we had during our stay was resolved with a quick call to Stay Alfred."
5455293,95198318,2016-08-18,38551650,Cori,"This is a great location on back bay. Very well outfitted apartment, and comfortable. My business partner and I stayed here together and it was comfortable for two people and we saved half on what two rooms in nearby hotels would have cost."
11687031,69117743,2016-04-09,19106093,David,"\"This is like a hotel without room service :) Not saying this is good or bad, but if you're looking for the \"\"AirBnB feel\"\" where you feel like some friends are letting you stay at their apartment"
11687031,76337700,2016-05-26,20494844,Kiana,The place was wonderful. I felt right at home! I'll be staying again soon.
11687031,82031776,2016-06-26,1651780,Lea,Place was lovely! Very spacious. Loved having the whole foods right next to it. Only hiccup was I was not sent what room number I would be in. Concierge asked for that upon arrival. My name was on top of the list so he was able to see what room I was in. Other than that great place. Clean. Spacious. On the same floor as the pool. Pool and common areas were great! Loved flatbook and how responsive they were will definitely use again!
11687031,89226106,2016-07-27,5330433,Harvey,"Everything was fine, it's a good apartment pretty well equipped for a long stay."
5064995,27629223,2015-03-08,23437118,Yumi,Tom was an amazing host who went well out of his way to set us up last minute. We had our previous booking get cancelled a few days before our trip as well as several other hosts from Airbnb leave vague responses to inquiries so I wasn't able to commit to Tom's condo until the day before check-in. Tom responded very quickly and professionally and miraculously got everything ready for the next day. I am definitely looking forward to booking with Tom again.
"The condo itself was very charming. It's up a few flights of stairs so be aware if you're bringing a lot of luggage.\"",,,,,
5064995,33291796,2015-05-26,31766591,Saqib,"The appartment was the perfect location for the trip. Exactly the same as i saw in the pictures. Clean and without the owner present during the stay was an edge. We had plenty of options just 5 mins from the appartment to get everything we needed, groceries, drinks etc.. i would definitely recommend the place even though the appartment is on the top floor."
5064995,37057917,2015-07-04,33526965,Ann,"Tom was an excellent host who went out of his way to communicate and make the airbnb process run smoothly, especially for me, a newbie to this system. Tom and his site manager made our visit simple and pleasant.   The unit is located in a nice neighborhood with easy access to everything great about Boston.  We ditched our rental car as we got to town and took the subway or walked where we wanted to go.  The unit was clean and airy, and a refreshing change after a week in single hotel rooms with a family of 4. Be aware that this unit is on the 4th floor and the stairs are tiny and spiral, so hauling the luggage in and out was the only real challenge we had."
5064995,39298112,2015-07-22,13744310,Eline,"We enjoyed our stay in this cute appartment of Tom. The bedrooms have soft, clean beds, the kitchen is well supplied and big enough. Only the bathroom is very tiny. But for the four of us, the appartment was just fine. Beacon Hill is a lovely area to stay, it's an easy walk either way into whatever you want to see in Boston. A huge supermarket down the street and restaurants just around the corner."
5064995,44105930,2015-08-24,5456571,Melak,Tom got in touch with us immediately and explained the check in process clearly. The property was better than we were expecting (with a good sized kitchen) and the location was fantastic. We are a family of four (two teenaged daughters) and the two bedrooms provided plenty of space. We took a taxi from the airport ($30 with tip) and the Whole Foods at the end of the street saved us loads of time and money on food. The check in and check out were easy. I would stay at this property again.
5064995,44504728,2015-08-26,42298840,Tati,"The condo was a very nice place, clean and cool."
It's close to a lot of things,including the T,pharmacy,liquor store,starbucks,and walk distance to parks

5064995,53648009,2015-11-10,45660398,Danielle,"Great place to stay, great location. Quick responses and easy booking process. Parking was the only real issue but that comes with the ideal and upscale location."
5064995,55713640,2015-12-05,43153629,Ping-Hung,Great location and sweet place.
5064995,57641133,2015-12-28,39443236,Teresa,"Tom was very nice and sent us two different set of keys to two different addresses so that my daughter and I could arrive from different locations. The apartment was very comfortable, the location is perfect (near the T station and Whole Foods). It is small but had everything we needed, the only exception were enough chairs to sit the four of us in the kitchen, so we had to eat in the living room. The wifi either barely worked or not at all, and they were unable to fix it and the heating system is not possible to regulate it."
5064995,63616096,2016-02-25,51621550,Wumao,"it's an excellent experience living here! The apartment is very cosy and living facilities is perfect. The subway station is near the apartment and its traffic is covenient. Besides, housekeeper Jeff is warmhearted to help us solve all quesions at once. I love the apartment, it's a good choice where you live in Boston."
5064995,64106205,2016-02-29,14768883,Herman,The host canceled this reservation 67 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5064995,70844049,2016-04-21,36449681,Christine,"The condo was great and just as described. Communication with Tom (before the stay) and Jeff (during) was easy. The information they provided in advance of my stay was particularly useful, and greatly appreciated. The location is fantastic - very close to transport links, useful stores, and many of the sights of Boston."
5064995,98615314,2016-08-31,58061715,Wendy,"My son stayed at Tom's apartment this summer for his summer job in Boston, he had a very good experience during his 8-week stay at this apartment. The living facilities were great all-around: a spacious living room, clean beds, & a fairly capable kitchen. The location is truly excellent – you’re within walking distance of much of downtown Boston & T stations for both the red and blue lines, in addition to the beautiful Esplanade area which is perfect for an evening run or jog. The Whole Foods & CVS across the street also makes it very easy to grab groceries & supplies whenever you want. Tom and Jeff were very helpful and answered  questions very fast."

228883,3300180,2013-01-07,3610902,Nigel,"The building was in excellent condition and everything was great. The concierge had a key when I arrived and I just left the key in the apartment when I left. The location is right next to Fenway which includes a number of restaurants, bars, a not so bad walk to Back Bay, and a few blocks to either the Kenmore or Fenway T-station."
My only complaint would be I wanted to see if I could make arrangements for a later check-out time,and I was unable to reach anyone. I had two different phone numbers for different times of the day,"and called both and no one answered either; nor returned my messages. \"",,,
228883,3834717,2013-03-19,1002285,Brock,Host got back to me within 48 hours about booking. Received e-mail instructions a couple days before arrival. The apartment we stayed in was gorgeous and as expected. Had no problems getting into the room with the front desk as it was an apartment building. I would recommend booking through seamless again in this area or other areas they may manage.
228883,6148697,2013-08-01,5938511,Luciana,"The apartment is great. Good space, good location, good service and near to good transportation. From the pool has a great view from Fenway Park."

6976,5808,2009-07-19,23549,Gary,"A Wonderful, pleasant, and charming host.  The bed is very comfortable and the room is nice. Travel wise one is 15 minutes by the Needham Train or Orange Subway Line to Back Bay Station - the Center of Boston.  I highly recommend one staying with Phil."
6976,67912,2010-07-23,154097,Dominik,Firstly Phil is a great host! He's very helpful in every aspect of living and having good time in Boston.
Secondly Phil's rental is located in a great area surrounded by parks making it nice and quite and yet it close enough to city center which is easily accessible by walking,biking or taking a bus.,,,,
Rental room is very nice and has all that's needed to make it comfortable!,,,,,
"If I was to do it again i wouldn't be looking for any other place but simple book my stay again at Phil's!\"",,,,,
6976,277461,2011-05-23,232785,Aviva,"Phil was a great host and his home was very comfortable.  The room is well furnished and clean, with a comfortable bed, plenty of closet and drawer space, and a nice desk.  TV and sound system too. Phil was extremely hospitable about use of the kitchen and laundry, as well as helping out with rides.  The backyard is awesome - and in summer weather I imagine it would be a great place to relax.  The neighborhood is quiet, safe, and residential - but close to the commuter rail which takes you to downtown Boston in 15 minutes.  There are some really interesting shops in Roslindale Village - just a 7 minute walk from the house.   Supposedly it has the best farmer's market in Boston."
...and...,,,,,
if you enjoy Mexican folk art,Phil's home will be especially fun for you.,,,,
"I highly recommend staying there.\"",,,,,
6976,341306,2011-06-28,579421,Daniela,Phil is a very friendly host and I felt safe and comfortable in Roslindale. It's a very quiet and nice neighbourhood. You have easy access to the commuter train station at Roslindale Village (if you don't mind walking appr. 15 minutes) - but especially on weekends there is only limited service (on Sundays even no service at all). But you can also take the T orange line to Forest Hill and take a bus (there are several lines). If you like to explore Boston during daytime and have quiet evenings and like walking it's worth a stay.
6976,393798,2011-07-24,824245,Carlos,"Firstly, the room itself was very comfortable to stay in, and included a firm mattress, ample closet and drawer space, a large desk complete with stereo and TV, powerful air-conditioning, and wi-fi. Beyond the parameters of the room, Phil's home is very clean and comfortable to move around in - and filled with beautiful artisan pieces from Mexico! His stories are as colorful as the art pieces he displays. Beyond his knack for conversation, Phil is a supremely kind host, offering rides and opening his home in ways that made me feel like I was staying with a close relative, not with someone I had just met. Outside of the home, there are restaurants, small shops, and a gorgeous park nearby. Public transportation to downtown and around Boston is easy, as the commuter rail is a 15 minute walk and the orange T-line is a short bus ride away (which can be boarded a block from his home). I can easily recommend staying with Phil with no reservations."
6976,660258,2011-10-24,1246312,Kei,"The room was very comfortable, with clean and colorful bed, TV, Wi-Fi, desk and closet. And also, I could enjoy many Mexican arts in the house. (for free!)"
Phil is a great host. He kindly provided me with a bath towel,coffee and breads,a new teeth brush and any useful information on Boston,and also he took me to the station with his car.,,
The location is calm but the public transportation is limited. If you will come back at late time in weekend,you will have to take a taxi from Forest Hills station (It costs $8 or so) or walk 30 minutes.,,,,
Totally,"I was completely satisfied with staying this room.\"",,,,
6976,685634,2011-11-01,812255,Stephanie,"Phil was very accommodating to both my short notice and preference to stay in for the weekend.  I was able to come and go as I pleased and enjoyed the great art.  The room had a space heater, which was great for being able to make the space comfortable to what I prefer.  I was also appreciative of the location and not having to deal with parking nightmares or traffic."
6976,1382998,2012-05-30,1634171,Laura,"Phil was a great host.  He was accomodating and helpful.  The room was simple, clean and nice, and his collection of Mexican art added fun and whimsy to the atmosphere.  I had to rent a car while travelling, and parking in front of the house was always available and didn't require a permit.  I'd stay with Phil again!"
6976,1591064,2012-06-29,2643567,Prajakt,"Phil is a wonderful host. The house is located in a charming suburb, with easy access to restaurants and public transport. I enjoyed my stay, and will gladly stay again when I am in Boston."
6976,2034401,2012-08-19,3143289,Maciek,"My stay at Phil's was great. Phil is a great host, he is very friendly and willing to help if you need anything. I've got several rides to the supermarket and train station, and also helped me out to find the best routes to bike. He is a great cook too, I was once invited to try lobster and his banana bread is awesome !"
The house is clean and quiet and so is the neighborhood. Phil is pretty much all the time attending his online business at the studio,so you won't notice him very much.  The bathroom is shared but is very clean and you will get your own cabinet.,,,,
I would stay at Phil's again,"and I definitively recommend it. \"",,,,
6976,2523075,2012-10-06,1295674,Aor,"If you look for a place that the price is very reasonable with conveniently driving to the city, I'd recommend Phil's place. You can imagine how much to pay to stay in a city. Since we drove, it was pretty handy for us, Phil's place is located only 7-8 minutes away or 10+ minutes with traffic."
The place was clean and comfortable,especially Phil was friendly and helpful. We were welcome to share the kitchen. Some places were not.  Well,for me,to say hello and good bye is pretty important in my culture,therefore,"we expected host at least saying such things. Phil was way much over the expectation. Thanks Phil.\""
6976,2574957,2012-10-10,3421694,Lauri,"Phil is a great host who goes over and above to make your stay comfortable.  From rides to the subway station, to sharing his DVD collection, his kitchen and his home.  Great location, interesting conversations and nice cozy clean room."
6976,3467426,2013-02-03,4699326,Robert,"I was in Boston on a business trip that was scheduled with only a few days notice. Staying at Phil's place was perfect for my needs and a terrific introduction to the Airbnb experience. The room was clean with a comfortable firm mattress, work desk, and windows facing east for enjoying morning sunshine."
I was welcome to use the kitchen and did for breakfasts but found the local eatery around the corner was super convienient for dinners.,,,,,
"Phil had some terrific travel stories that he shared on my last evening in Boston. I would recommend staying here and would definitely stay again.\"",,,,,
6976,3899188,2013-03-25,4699326,Robert,"This was my second stay at Phil's place while working in the Jamaica Plain area. This stay was as comfortable, clean, and welcoming as my first visit. We had time to talk about some of the Mexican artwork he sells."
Phil's a host who is attentive to his guests and made my stay very easy to unwind after long hours working. If you like being in a large city and having a quiet spot to relax,"this is the place for you.\"",,,,
6976,6186719,2013-08-02,7764124,Settimio,"Phil was great, helpful and very kind during my staying in Boston. He gave to me all the necessary information to move around the city and helped me also finding another apartment while I was living there."
The place was big enough,"confortable and located near public transportaion. I would recommend this place to everyone !! I really enjoyed staying with him.\"",,,,
6976,7702734,2013-09-30,7785147,Chey,"I could not be happier with my first Airbnb experience. Having Phil as a host, to be fair, most likely had something to do with it. The room and environment was exactly as advertised with my space being clean, private and functional. I had full access to Phil's kitchen, bathroom and laundry amenities as needed. Phil himself was pleasantly conversant yet professionally distant to help maintain his and my work schedules. I was able to leave early in the morning and come back late per the duties of a medical student without incident.  I highly recommend Phil's Airbnb listing to anyone wishing to study or needing temporary housing in the Boston area. If I ever needed to return to Boston in similar circumstances, I would surely see if Phil was available. He is a great asset to the Airbnb community. Thanks for a wonderful experience!"
6976,7952430,2013-10-09,9034365,Mahavir,"Staying at Phil's was an excellent way to start off my airbnb journey. Given that I am a noob at airbnb there was a mild hesitation but I am glad I took a leap of faith and stayed at Phil's. Phil is an excellent host and a person. He was very helpful, accommodating and fun to talk with. I had a key to myself and he was fine with me walking in anytime. He gave me access to his washer/dryer in the basement which was very useful. He also suggested a bunch of good places to see around Boston."

6976,8095574,2013-10-15,1644716,Angel,"Phil is an excellent host, he went above and beyond by taking me to the train station my 1st morning there to make sure I could find it (it is however only a short walk from the house....very convenient for getting into downtown).  He was also a wealth of information about things I might like to do but would not have discovered on my own. The room is clean and comfortable.  I felt very safe both in his home and in the neighborhood.  Thanks Phil!!!"
6976,8273252,2013-10-22,8541589,Anthony,The reservation was canceled 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6976,12094709,2014-04-22,10932793,Bill,"Phil was quick to respond and to reach out before the trip to make sure my stay was a pleasant one. The location was great - quick to the bus stop (but not walkable to the T). Bus service is frequent, so it was fine for me."
Phil was super flexible about when I checked in and went out of his way to make me feel welcome. It's clear why he has repeat customers. Breakfast makings available and free reign in the kitchen. Good coffee (french press style) was available (although I ended up running out every morning before taking advantage of it.),,,,,
Their is a 7-11 less than a block away as well as a restaurant or two that I noticed. Parking was easy. Super quite and safe neighborhood (I caught the wrong bus one night and had to walk about a mile around midnight).,,,,,
"Thanks Phil for a great first AirBnB experience!\"",,,,,
6976,12966551,2014-05-15,4699326,Robert,Very quiet neighborhood and Phil opens up his apartment home to make your stay pleasant and stress free. If you stay here there is free street parking and the apartment is less than half a block from the bus stop. The room and the shared bathroom are clean.
"I've stayed here before and returning for a short stay felt very much like visiting family.\"",,,,,
6976,13120367,2014-05-19,8364428,Jennifer,"Phil was a wonderful host and was very accommodating. The guest room is cozy and the bed was very comfortable. Phil had coffee and bagels waiting for me in the morning and he even gave me a snack for the road. The neighborhood felt very safe and has a bar/restaurant, taco joint and convenience store within walking distance. Parking was no problem. I would recommend this listing and this host. Thanks Phil!"
6976,17602469,2014-08-14,12803661,Ramon,Phil was an extremely pleasant and kind host.  He was a very giving person and made the stay that much better.  We had a few chats here and there even though I was busy most of the time.  Location was fine for me.  Very quaint area but not far from it all also.  Very accommodating!
6976,17809584,2014-08-17,19675677,Vlad,Great place! Cozy room. Very safe area. Phil is very nice person! I will definitely stay here next time!
6976,18573887,2014-08-28,19195786,Troy,I couldn't have asked for a better host for my first few days in Boston. Phil gave me expert advice on how to get around town and even drove me a few places on weekends when the public transportation came less frequently. The neighborhood is full of character and things to do. I leave my highest endorsement.
6976,18641466,2014-08-29,14079909,Michael,"Phil was the absolute best!!  After responding within minutes of my last-second request, he waited up late for my arrival (12:30a) and greeted me with a bowl of delicious, homemade minestrone soup.   He was so kind and gracious throughout my stay.  He even drove me to the T station, so I didn't have to walk.  He was the absolute best and I would stay with him again in a second.  I would give six stars if I could."
6976,22181464,2014-11-01,10605904,Jose,"Phil is an amazing host. Always tried to make my stay more comfortable, and was very helpful. He has a very relaxed attitude, which I found to be very pleasant. The room was quite large, and had everything I could possibly need. The room had two windows with a view of his garden, and the decor was also nice. Phil let me use his kitchen, and it had everything I needed."
The house is in a very nice and safe neighborhood. Bus stops are very near (2 min walking).,,,,,
"I would definitely come back!\"",,,,,
6976,30330541,2015-04-20,7916597,Steve,"My wife & I stayed with Phil for 2 nights when we came over from the UK for the Boston Marathon.  Phil was a delightful host, with the facilities and ambiance of his place being informal and relaxed; exactly what we required. There was good contact with Phil from before our arrival; he was a really convivial host & more than happy for us to use his kitchen (& eat his banana bread!).  It’s a 10min bus ride from the end of Phil’s street to the Orange Line terminus, so you can be downtown in 30mins.  On Sunday, when the bus didn’t run, Phil generously offered & gave us a ride to the ‘T’.  Phil’s place is clean, private, quiet and just a wee bit quirky, with his pieces of Mexican folk art in which he trades peering at you from all directions!  Some are a little bizarre - but in a nice way!  There’s a sports bar, a Mexican restaurant and a Pizza/pasta takeout just round the corner and a 7-11 at the end of the street.  Overall, we enjoyed our brief stay tremendously; just a shame there wasn’t more time to continue the good conversations.  Thank you Phil – you and your place were just the kind of casual, hassle-free bolthole we needed for our short stay in Boston."
6976,32145906,2015-05-14,4699326,Robert,"I was at Phil's place for 2 weeks for a short work assignment. Staying here was convenient with ample street parking, full use of the kitchen, and a quiet room."

6976,34920326,2015-06-13,35418455,Brandon,"Phil was an excellent host. The room and apartment were well appointed and very comfortable. I very much enjoyed chatting with Phil about his travels and day to day life and his expertise about Boston (as a native) was invaluable to my housing search. This was my first Airbnb experience and Phil has set the bar very high. He was also kind and flexible when my plans changed. I would definitely recommend staying with Phil for those headed to Boston, particularly by car, as his street offers ample parking and quick access to local arteries."
6976,35388359,2015-06-18,12048482,David,"Phil was a great host, accommodating and friendly without being intrusive. He provides a beautiful apartment in a great neighborhood steps from the arboretum. Great trip."
6976,48403750,2015-09-26,35818731,Martin,"I stayed with Phil for three months over the summer of 2015. Phil provided me with a comfortable room in his pleasant, art-filled apartment. It was a very convenient location for Faulkner Hospital where I was working....a 20 minute walk. Also, the apartment is a handy place for Forest Hills T-station...a nice walk through the Arboretum. Phil is a great host and, in fact, an all-around good bloke."
"110% recommendation.\"",,,,,
6976,50785292,2015-10-14,25174316,Lydia,"I was in Boston for a convention and Phil made my stay there super comfortable and friendly. He was very accommodating and helpful - he was quite generous with his time in assisting me with my stay even though he runs his business from home. The room is cozy and clean, with plenty of desk area for when I needed to do some work. Also when he had the time, Phil even gave me a ride to where I needed to go (I didn't have a car and mostly took the bus/train) and he was very kind to offer me a few home-cooked meals though I mostly ate out at nearby restaurants. His house is beautifully decorated with lots of folk art and I enjoyed hearing his travel and life stories. He has great information and tips on the local sights and dining options as well as commute options."
6976,71536927,2016-04-26,2285894,James,"Phil was a delightful host. I found his 1920's era house very appealing.  And I enjoyed our conversations, and hearing about his travel adventures."

Moreover,heartfelt gratitude for Phil to invite me to  Phil's family parties. Because it made my dreams of knowing your American folks life style come true!,,,,
For more information,as a supplement to Phil's statement,there is a Chinese Restaurant (Hong Kong 888) round the corner!,,,

6976,91464023,2016-08-05,73213818,Chrislynn,"Phil's place is well appointed and in a very nice neighborhood. There is a convenience store and a few restaurants around the corner and Roslindale Village is about a fifteen minute walk away. Getting to/from downtown Boston can take a bit of time especially during the evening or Sunday's when buses run less frequently so make sure to leave plenty of time if you have appointments there. Overall the neighborhood is very charming and Phil is great host, he's a great source of information and very responsive to any questions you may have during your stay."

Nestled in the beautiful Beacon Hills it was wonderful to be able to walk around the neighborhood, with Boston Common being only minutes away. The apt itself was great - well suited for a party of 1 or 2, tons of great light, overlooking the area. Jack was very communicative and made sure I was settled both before and during my stay. Would certainly stay here again next time in Boston."

We walked to the Public Gardens, the Boston Commons, and followed the Freedom Trail from the apartment. There are tons of restaurants and shopping within walking distance,  as well the Science Museum and the Charles River. Jack was a gracious host and got back to our request quickly and was available to accommodate us even though we booked at short notice. His place is very comfortable with fantastic views of the city. We were even able to park for free on the street the entire weekend! Great value for a great location...thanks for a memorable stay."
13330146,92039618,2016-08-07,43305148,Natalie,Jack was an exceptional host. He accommodated our really early checkin and late checkout without a problem.

The neighborhood was super convenient - just moments from the train. We loved walking to all the great restaurants in JP and her 2 AC units were a lifesaver in this late summer heat. We would definitely come back.

The apartment was a cute attic apartment, quiet, very roomy, a good bed, and the AC worked well, it was pretty hot while we were there.

The entire home is beautiful along with the space. Bedroom is cozy and the bed was quite comfortable. The rest of the apartment is very nice as well with a clean and pretty bathroom. I didn't use the public transport around the area but Lori was so accommodating and offered a t pass! Parking was easy to find on the street. All in all a great option to stay.

7910223,56175609,2015-12-09,12103970,Adrienne,I was in Boston for work and had my housing (with a friend) situation fall-through last minute. Lori let me book late in the afternoon on the night I needed lodging (amazing and life-saving) and I stayed at her house for two nights while I worked out of my company's Boston/JP office. It was amazing! It was so nice to come back to some space to hang out and relax after a long work day and the bed was super comfy. Lori even left some breakfast snacks and coffee for me as well as a T-Pass. I'll stay with Lori again and would highly recommend it! Thanks!

Lori had left fresh fruit and chocolates to welcome us. The apartment is bright and comfortable, with a sizable bathroom and a very comfortable bed. Lori stocked the kitchen with more than plenty for breakfast, and coffee we could freshly grind. We only spent one night in Lori's home. The next time we are visiting our son in JP overnight, or even if we just need a place in Boston to stay, we will gladly stay here again! A comfortable, spotless, nicely furnished and decorated, warm and welcoming place to stay!"
7910223,59535188,2016-01-11,16475982,Kelly,Staying at Lori's was truly wonderful! As a former JP resident it was great going back to the old neighborhood.

7910223,60225844,2016-01-20,3210528,Cat,"I loved staying at Lori's! It's very homey and cozy. She was great at communicating and responding promptly. The house is a great location - near the T and also easy to park with a car without a permit. The space is so cute and well-laid out - you can tell that Lori's put a lot of love into it. Even though this is a shared entrance with the rest of the house - the attic apartment is separate and you'll have all the privacy you need. Also I came at a really cold time and was worried about being uncomfortable but I was so toasty and warm the whole time. Lori also was very generous with tea, coffee and other goodies. You'll have everything you need and more here :-)"
7910223,61103800,2016-01-31,6132519,Dan,"Lori was a great host.   The apartment was clean,  comfortable, and well outfitted with toiletries and snacks."
7910223,61737249,2016-02-07,8473310,Samuel,"Lori greeted Christin and I with a warm smile. The place was very cozy, clean and topped with snacks which just makes the place extra special. The Apple TV was a plus! And Remi, their kitty, was delightful. It was a wonderful home base for visiting jp:)"
7910223,62214863,2016-02-12,34515789,Steve,"My colleague and I stayed here for three nights on a work trip to Boston.  Lori has a great place. You get the whole third floor to yourself and it's very much like your own apt.  One private bedroom and then there's a nice pullout bed in the living room.  You have your own kitchen, and the fridge was stocked with nice options, especially for breakfast.  Apple TV/Netflix on the TV.  Quick 5 minute walk to the Stonybrook T stop.  I'd recommend Lori's place to any traveler who's coming to Boston for work or play, especially if you like the JP area!"
7910223,62556671,2016-02-15,1593293,Ryo,"My girlfriend and I stayed in Lori's charming Jamaica Plain apartment for 2 nights over Valentines Day weekend. Our stay was everything we expected, and more! Lori was helpful, friendly, and accommodating, being flexible with check-in and check-out times, being responsive to messages, and even stocking the fridge with breakfast supplies. The apartment itself was clean, cozy, and matched the description. I wouldn't hesitate to come back here again the next time we are in Boston!"
7910223,63589551,2016-02-24,59025177,Natasha,Lori was a great host she was very helpful and made us feel at home. Me and my husband would say shes the perfect host. Hopefully one day we can revisit for another stay
7910223,64152912,2016-02-29,59142152,Shannon,"Our stay at Charming Cottage was perfect! Comfortable, inviting and exactly what we needed.  Lori was friendly and helpful, navigating the city and finding local neighborhood staples like Ula Cafe's yummy coffee & Bella Luna for delicious pizza only a few blocks away.  We enjoyed the JP neighborhood and hope to be back soon!"
7910223,67147631,2016-03-27,55022246,Roberta,"This was the first time I stayed somewhere through the Airbnb. I was so pleased with my stay, a large beautiful home with the upstairs 3rd floor apt. which is like a studio, all to myself. The apt. was just as lovely in person as shown in the pictures, clean with all the amenities of home,  I could actually live there! I had absolutely everything I needed. You can tell that Lori truly enjoys what she does, fresh flowers and Easter candies on the table. A refrigerator filled for everyone's taste, from soy milk to half and half, fresh coffee beans with a french press, bagels, cream cheese, jellies, oatmeal, the freshest orange juice, honey and stocked with all needed kitchenware, etc. The bathroom was filled with all the essentials, there was extra blankets and plenty of closet space. Lori was very inviting, I was hesitant at first, not knowing the airbnb etiquette but I understood right off that she wanted my stay to be perfect. I spent my days out and about with my son whom I was visiting and it was wonderful to come back tired to such a comfortable place to stay. To top it off Lori's cat spent a lot of time with me so I didn't miss my cats as much. I would definitely recommend Lori's charming home and I will be back!"
7910223,68302400,2016-04-04,52796086,Jo,"This was our 1st Airbnb experience and it was fab, the apartment had everything we needed and was clean, cosy and comfy, a real home away from home. Super easy to get into downtown and to the Amtrak station. Lori had kept us well informed prior to our arrival and was delightful and seemed genuinely pleased to have us in her home. Both the main bed and the futon bed were really comfy, fab added bonus of Apple TV. Lori had provided every breakfast item we could want. Will definitely recommend to friends and would 100% stay again!"
7910223,68935629,2016-04-07,669596,Milan,Staying at Lori's place was great. Checking in was smooth and she had a small surprise ready for us. And her cat is so cute. I'd be happy to stay again when I visit Boston next time!
7910223,69170736,2016-04-09,65412426,Karina,Lori was a great host!!! Made us feel welcome and comfortable :) Neighborhood and home are lovely! Description was accurate and host provided many suggestions of great restaurants nearby.. Great place wish I could've stayed longer!
7910223,69265778,2016-04-10,6167254,Susan,We had a wonderful weekend stay in Lori's pretty attic apartment.
Lori's home is charming and cozy,and she is a very friendly and warm hostess.,,,,
The apartment was spacious,clean,and well appointed. Keep in mind a hallway separates the bedroom from the living room -- it's your own private hallway,but you'll want to bring a robe with you when walking from one room to the other (I was grateful I brought mine)!,,
Lori really keeps the kitchen area well stocked. All the items in the refrigerator were fresh. And there were lots of items! Organic fat free yogurt,milk,half and half,orange juice,Italian mineral water,fresh strawberries
Even though there is a lot to explore in Jamaica Plain,my companion and I wanted a quiet weekend in. And for a quiet weekend in,you really want a space where you feel comfortable and happy. This apartment had just that kind of feeling to it. It's sweet,and pretty,and homey. We only left it to have dinner at one of the restaurants nearby. It's crazy how close the Sam Adams brewery is!,
If you're looking for a nice place to stay while you explore Jamaica Plain,"I highly recommend this location. \"",,,,
7910223,69649200,2016-04-12,22905338,Christine,"This was my first Airbnb experience and everything worked out great. I was traveling to Boston with my son to visit Wentworth institute of technology which was very close to this location. Lori's house was just a short train ride to everywhere we needed to go. She was very gracious when she greeted us personally and gave some very good recommendations based on what we were interested in. I really loved her home which was very clean, comfortable, and exactly what we were looking for. There were towels, bath products, breakfast items, and a huge tea collection that I enjoyed before bed. After walking around campus for 5 hours it was so nice just to relax on our own watching Hulu on her Apple TV. We were so exhausted after the red eye from Seattle so ended up falling into the comfortable beds really early and slept like babies. I remember waking up thinking how I have to have these pillows. Lori does a great job stocking the space with everything you could need and made our stay a great experience. I so appreciate her letting me know the train would be faster since it was totally stress free and I didn't have to drop $50.00 one way again. Thank you for everything Lori!"
7910223,70665306,2016-04-19,10420878,Christine,This was a good apartment for us and Lori graciously accommodated our requests. Since she was going to the local market (which we never ran across while there) she bought us some special milk we needed.  Lori generously allowed us to stay there for a week during the marathon without raising the rate as some other hosts do.  We traveled all over using the T-line which had a stop 5 minutes from her place.
The one thing that I wasn't expecting is that the apartment is really two rooms with a 5-foot long hallway between them.  This means that if you need to use the bathroom at night,you need to go down the hallway.  But we just put on a sweatshirt or jacket as we left the bedroom.,,,,
Thank you for letting us stay at your place,Lori.,,,,

7910223,78093578,2016-06-05,24089826,Rachel,"My mom and I had a wonderful stay from Lori. Great location (residential street, but 5 minutes from the T, restaurants, cafes, etc). The apartment was immaculate and had everything you could need (britta filter in the fridge, lamp with an outlet for charging your phone while in bed). Lori picked up breakfast foods for me to have (she even asked if I had a preferred brand of yogurt), loaned me a travel mug to take on the T, and provided recommendations on restaurants and jogging routes."
7910223,78771241,2016-06-09,75404112,Leah,Lori was an excellent host and we felt welcomed from the first emails we received after booking. She is very relaxed and accomodating. The space was perfect for us- a couple looking to relax. With a little kitchenette and living space separate from the private bedroom. Very clean and well kept. The area is great for anyone not wanting to be in downtown boston. If you want to get to downtown it's a short walk and about 15- 20 minutes on the subway. Listen to Lori's suggestions for restaurants etc. We were very happy with the places she suggested!

7910223,81057630,2016-06-20,67317706,Hwa Young,우리가 숙소에 도착했을때 Lori는 우리를 직접 맞아주었고 숙소에서 지내는데 필요한 가이드(SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)을 꼼꼼히 알려주었다. 호스트가 게스트와 만나지 않는 경우도 많다고 들었는데 Lori의 경우 우리가 말하지 않아도 본인이 먼저 나서서 많은것을 알려주는 친절한 호스트였다. 덕분에 1주일 정도 묵었던 시간 동안 내 집처럼 편하게 지낼 수 있었다. 또한 숙소에 간단히 먹을 수 있는 음식이나 욕실용품은 모두 충분히 갖추어져 있어서 여러모로 절약하면서 지낼 수 있었다.
"게다가 숙소의 위치가 약간 보스턴 교외에 위치해 있어서 그런지 주위가 시끄럽지 않고 전반적으로 평화로운 분위기였다. 다음 번에도 보스턴에 갈 기회가 있다면 다시 머물고 싶은 집이다.\"",,,,,
7910223,82730606,2016-06-29,77109080,Amy,Lori is a great host. She had several items for us already in the fridge plus a fruit basket full of goodies. She had lots of pamphlets on Boston as well as eateries in Jamaica Plain. She was there whenever we needed help with anything. The brewery was a cool area with a few restaurants. We played trivia one night at Bella Luna and had great food as well. We traveled into Boston most of the time were there and it was very easy to get to. The space is a little cramped for a family of four but it was comfortable.
7910223,82929023,2016-06-30,15963192,Scott,Lori was amazing and so generous.  The space was great and its in a cool part of Boston.

There was plenty of space in the apartment to spread out and be comfortable, the bathroom was nice and large and the shower was great.  I enjoyed making delicious French press coffee each morning.  Honestly, the apartment was equipped with everything we needed for our stay.  Lori  went shopping halfway through our visit and got more breakfast foods for us.  Lori's book of restaurant suggestions  was very helpful to us.  We  would recommend staying at Lori's house to anyone!  My husband especially loved Remi the cat :-)"

7910223,88704329,2016-07-25,57534264,Kelly Jo,We loved staying in Lori's upstairs apartment. It's a turn off the century house with original floors and definitely adds to the history you feel in the area. Good walking location and near public transportation. Lori kept the kitchen perfectly stocked for snacks and breakfast goodies. We loved our stay.

7910223,96786576,2016-08-24,83974718,Ángel,"Ha sido un placer pasar unos días en casa de Lori, fundamentalmente por su carácter acogedor que hace que te sientas realmente bienvenido. En todo momento se preocupó por nosotros, adelantándose incluso a nuestras necesidades con una atención personalizada. Como ejemplo, decir que después de una noche calurosa (el apartamento está en una buhardilla y los días de calor se notan especialmente en esta parte de la casa), Lori nos compró dos ventiladores, ya que dijimos que no nos gustaba dormir con el aire acondicionado. Eso fue realmente un detalle. También destacar que todos los productos que nos ofreció para el desayuno eran de la mejor calidad (yogures, bollería, leche)... Todo de las mejores marcas."
También nos ofreció consejos para mejorar nuestra experiencia en la ciudad.,,,,,
Como punto de mejora,diría que la cama del dormitorio era un poco pequeña para dos personas (estamos acostumbrados a dormir en una cama de 150 x 200 cm y esta era más pequeña),y echamos en falta alguna cortina para el velux del tejado por donde entraba demasiada luz por la mañana.,,,
El barrio es de lo más auténtico que hay en Boston y Airbnb es la única manera de vivirlo,ya que no hay hoteles. El metro está realmente cerca de la casa de Lori (muy bien conectado con el centro),así como zona de supermercados y restaurantes muy aténticos... Jamaica Plain es un barrio que ofrece experiencias únicas mucho más allá que los típicos lugares turísticos de la ciudad.,,,

6908672,38169705,2015-07-13,36281278,Keith,"The two bedroom apartment was charming, very clean and has a wonderful location.  Our host was very accommodating in getting us the key since our flight arrived in the middle of the night.  We would definitely recommend it and would stay here again.  Guests will have to walk several sets of stairs to reach the apartment but we were happy for the exercise."
6908672,40120418,2015-07-28,11475157,Pete,"Brett was incredibly helpful about all neighborhood info, especially parking. The Beacon Hill neighborhood is quintessential Boston and the location is superb. You can walk to just about anything worth seeing. The apartment is very comfortable and charming. You will need to be able to walk up 5 stories but the trip is well worth it!"
6908672,40769783,2015-08-02,35992019,Rohan,"Listing description was completely accurate and the location and neighborhood were perfect. A 5 minute walk from Boston Common. Brett made us feel very much at home, and was extremely helpful in all regards. My family and I had a wonderful stay in Boston and loved coming home to Brett's place."
6908672,44441757,2015-08-26,24216339,Patrick Alexander,perfect location - perfect host. Brett was very communicative and could even help out with impossible things (finding a parking lot). Would definitely come back - had a wonderful stay in Boston and the apartment is wonderful

It's located in the heart of Beacon Hill, surrounded by shops, cafes, bars and restaurants, and within walking distance of Boston Common, the Freedom Trail, train line etc. The apartment itself is beautifully furnished and very comfortable.

13651290,87934033,2016-07-22,10335747,Ilya,"Overall, the apartment was great. The instructions which were left were perfect and very detailed. However, we expected that the place will be cleaned a bit more, it was strange that a lot of boxes were around."
It was very nice that we had a possibility to use kitchen equipment and had extra towels.,,,,,
Maybe it is worth to mention that the road to the house goes up so they are ready to pull heavy suitcases.,,,,,
The neighborhood is safe,however it might look slightly dangerous.,,,,
"The only inconvenience is that the closest grossers shop is located far away. \"",,,,,
13651290,93040021,2016-08-11,77563904,Megan,"Place was just as described. The futon mattress was on the hard side but for the price I paid it was still worth it. Never had contact during my stay but his in city contact was quick to answer my questions and I was lucky to get an early check in.  All in all, very nice tidy little studio close to all you need in Boston. I would definitely stay there again if I find my way back to Boston!"
13651290,95417339,2016-08-19,1391078,Matthew,Mahesh was very kind and is clearly a veteran with Airbnb travel. He has positive reviews as a traveller and I trusted that he knew how to prepare for a guest.
The apartment is perfect for 1-2 people and situated in a great section of Boston,close to the commuter train and subway. This made it very easy and affordable to get around on foot.,,,,
There is wifi and plenty of amenities to make your stay comfortable,including coin op laundry machines just outside the inner doorway.,,,,
While I didn't get a chance to meet Mahesh,we communicated via email and he was always very polite and courteous.,,,,
If and when I go back to Boston,"I do hope his place is available!\"",,,,
13651290,98480523,2016-08-31,85956841,Matthew,Location was great. Price was unparalleled. Once I found out how close the subway was I was in good shape.
1322461,5800866,2013-07-16,7333457,Elizabeth,"Staying at Julie's studio was an absolutely exceptional experience. Not only was I no further than 2 blocks from most of my favorite restaurants in Boston, Julie and Scott were the two  most accommodating hosts I could have ever asked for. They made sure every aspect of my stay was exceptional."
The studio is absolutely lovely,it is located in a gorgeous historical brownstone on the corner of Newbury Street and is fully equipped with anything one may need. Fresh towels,hotel style shampoos and body washes,maps of Boston,and an umbrella in case it rained were all laid out for me upon my arrival. I was even left with a list of the best restaurants to go to satisfy any particular craving. During my stay,"I was able to get a chance to meet both Julie and Scott; they are such lovely people with such positive energy. My stay was here was flawless and I would give it 6 stars if I could. I have found my new go-to spot when planning a stay in Boston!\""

1322461,6252216,2013-08-05,276367,Brody,"Julie's place was exactly as advertised - bathed in light, beautiful, and comfortable.  What's more, it is in the absolutely best location you could ask for in Boston, with windows overlooking Newbury St. and instant access to all of the shops, restaurants, and galleries of Back Bay.  It is also less than a block from Copley Square where you can catch the green line train and buses that head straight to Cambridge or SoWa."
The check in process was quick and easy - we were even allowed to check in early which was a great perk since we were checking out of a hotel in town that same day.,,,,,
"We hope this place is available next time we are in Boston!\"",,,,,
1322461,6356650,2013-08-09,4351206,Stéphanie & Marie-Christine,"My mother and I spent 4 days in Julie's apartment... It is clean, light and very welcoming ! We really felt at home and enjoyed our stay as much as possible ! Scott welcomed us at check-in and followed up on our stay. Both Julie and Scott have been amazing before, during and after our stay. Also, the apartment is in a nice and secure building and it is located  (in my opinion) in the best place in Boston ! It is safe, animated, there are shops and restaurants and everything can be done on foot ! We definitely will choose this apartment again next time we come to this beautiful city !"
1322461,6464461,2013-08-13,2532942,Steven,"Julie's apartment was perfect! Contact was easy and I was warmly welcomed and shown around the apartment. It is in a great location, close to a lot of things, including subway. The bed was super comfortable! Rarely used the AC because the ceiling fan does a great job of moving the air around. Despite it being right in the heart of several restaurants and businesses, the apartment is quiet at night. Highly recommended!"
1322461,6691727,2013-08-21,7065501,Melania,My boyfriend and I spent 3 days in Julie's apartment.

1322461,7187587,2013-09-09,2923891,Chris,"What a great location! And Julie was very flexible and accomodating, texting back and forth as our plans changed. We were able to walk everywhere: through the Commons and the Public Gardens, the entire length of Newbury St, to the theater district for a play and then back to the apartment. It all went by too quickly! And finally, a beautiful place to sit back and kick up our feet. It was great!"
1322461,7234508,2013-09-11,3106492,Veronika,"Julie is a lovely host. She went above and beyond welcoming us on a short notice. The apartment was beautiful and the location, incredible."
1322461,7386263,2013-09-17,800867,Jaimie,"Julie's apartment was more than perfect for my boyfriend and I's stay in Boston. It's located in a magnificent building right off Newbury and VERY close to the T. The apartment was clean, bright, and had the most amazing bed I've ever slept in. The street can be a bit noisy at night, but that comes with the great location. Easy trade off for us. Julie was very accommodating as we were stuck in traffic coming into town and arrived late. Entry into the building was quick and hassle free! Look forward to booking this stay again and for longer!"

I was so pleased with our first airbnb experience. I hope all of them are like this. If you stay"
1322461,7538890,2013-09-23,8782274,Julie,"My husband and I stayed at Julie's home to celebrate our anniversary in Boston.  This was our first experience with AirBnb and couldn't have been more satisfied with the service or our choice.  The location is ideal for sight-seeing and right in heart of Back Bay.  There are several restaurants and cafes in the area as well as shops and cultural institutions.  Julie's home is beautifully appointed, very clean, and quiet.  She was very responsive, easy to communicate with and made us feel very comfortable throughout our stay.  We would absolutely recommend her studio without hesitation and hope to return again for another stay!"
1322461,7573102,2013-09-24,4544451,Carolina,"The apartment is clean, cozy, and very well decorated. It is in the heart of the most elegant street in Boston.

1322461,8376951,2013-10-28,7966623,Angelo,"My wife and I had a great stay in Julie's apartment. It is a very charming studio. The location is perfect. I think Newbury street is the best place to stay and visit in Boston. The Copley Square station for the T is just outside so have easy access to the rest of Boston. The apartment itself is in a secure building. As it is in an older building, the kitchen and bathroom are small but perfectly functional. I will be very happy to stay there again on future visits."
1322461,8557392,2013-11-04,2030583,Bill,"Julie's communication skills are excellent, and the apartment is fantastic.  She provided detailed information for area and was always available via text or email.  Centrally located, fun area, and I believe Julie must be an interior decorator, as the interior is that nice.  :-)   Will be staying at her apartment again when I return to Boston.  Highly recommended."

It is almost impossible to find a better location!"
Julie is a fantastic host and is very responsive. She provided everything my wife and I needed during our stay at her apartment and we did not need to trouble her with any requests.,,,,,

While I was there, Julie checked in with me and made sure I had a blast while in Boston.  She treated me as if I was family. The place is literally right in the middle of EVERYTHING.  I was there for the marathon and it was right were things happened.  Just a couple short blocks to the Commons, Charles Rivers (great for running/biking), and excellent bars and restaurants.  Inside, her place is ABSOLUTLY fantastic. It was exceptionally clean and well decorated.  I will recommend her place to everyone and would love to stay at her place every time I go back."

Julie's place is delightful, cosy and chic. The bed was very comfortable and the apartment well ventilated which was appreciated as it was quite hot in Boston when we stayed.

I would love to stay there again in the future, and would confidently recommend it to others."
1322461,16536140,2014-07-28,18920189,Shannon,"We were in town for a quick overnight and thought to try Airbnb for the first time. Julie responded quickly to our request and was cordial and informative while we confirmed the details of our stay - responding to questions promptly and providing helpful hints about parking, the Newbury area and her apartment. And the place was wonderful. Extremely well kept, fashionably designed and comfortable.  I would highly recommend Julie's place to anyone visiting the area."

This beautiful space is so warm, gorgeous, whymsical and comfortably inviting. It is exactly as pictured in the posting, and the building is peaceful and very nice. Julie was a caring host and made my experience even more relaxed, easy breezy and taken care of. My arrival and check in process was smooth and flawless. Julie provides perfect instructions and directions for all you need to do, and she also is happy to give you information on anything you need while visiting, and special things to do and how to get there. For me, it was particulaly wonderful to stay in Julie's studio because she is such a lovely person and has the same soulful spirit and good energy and vibes that I do - this makes all the difference for anyone, in staying in a new space - it feels like your own home and very zen, neat, cozy, peaceful and special. All is clean, organized and you will love the layout of this studio. Right outside, all around you, you are surrounded by the charm and fabulousness of the Newbury Street/Back Bay neighborhood - endless incredible restaurants, specialty shops, clothing stores, art, cafes, street fair exhibits and anything you desire. The Green Line T stations are literally at every corner of the block the instant you leave the building! There is a 7-11 next door and a CVS around the corner. You honestly could not find a more convenient haven to stay in. Everything is at your fingertips, and it is a great feeling coming home at the end of a day to Julie's sanctuary she has created, just relaxing and looking out her amazing windows down at the city. Julie is a kind hearted, in touch individual, and I felt very grateful and touched to find/stay in her home, and experience Boston, finally, in a really amazing way. I'm extremely excited to go back soon and hopefully be able to stay here again. This is a gem! You will fully enjoy yourself and feel content here."

Julie responded very fast to all our questions beforehand, she was able to get us into the building with no wait at all, and she left very detailed and helpful instructions with regards to keys/building security etc. The apartment was perfect - it was decorated very nicely, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The room looks exactly as it does in the pictures online. Additionally, the location is amazing. It is right on newbury street - a perfect place to shop and eat, and it is one block from the Boston public library. This was our first airbnb experience, and I would give it an A+.

Located in the heart of back bay, this cozy getaway made us feel like home as soon as we walked in. The bed was comfy and the decor was very peaceful. Although we didn't get to meet Julie in person, she was able to remotely buzz us into her building and made the check in and check out process very simple! She had a nice guide with some great local choices to eat, and also made sure that we could contact her if any issues arose ( which they did not).

1322461,37427978,2015-07-06,14137777,John,"Places like Julie's are the reason I love AirBnB. Travel photos, hip decor, shelves of books . . . her apartment reflects her lifestyle and this kind of personal encounter is what traveling is all about."
She lives in the epicenter of the coolest spot in Boston. I loved that her building in Back Bay is a stone's throw from the esplanade on the Charles River,the Public Gardens / Boston Commons,and kiddie corner to chic Newbury St. Julie helped me navigate Boston parking,planned a smooth and easy check-in,and even had an oyster shucker in her kitchen in my hour of need. Besides the stellar location and hospitality,her apartment is charming
My girlfriend was an AirBnB sceptic before we stayed at Julie's. Now she wants to live in Boston someday,although she's never felt that way about any other city in her life. Thanks for sharing your space,"Julie!\"",,,

I would definitely return and in fact hope to over the next few years while my daughter is in college in the area.
1322461,52288350,2015-10-27,595220,Lisa,Julie was amazing. Easy to work with and super clear instructions. I was only there one night and you don't want to spend more time checking in than a hotel in that situation — and Julie was the perfect host for making it as straight forward as possible.

It's also so sweet just like a friend's home. I love the fulfilled bookshelves by the entrance and the wind-bell-like lamp by the window. Julie herself is a great host. She is so nice, helpful, and had everything prepared for us. I will definitely make her place my first choice when I visit Boston again and recommend it to all my friends.

His house is very creatively decorated, includes a parking space on a nice street and is about 10 mins walk to Forest Hills T station which is 20-30 mins in to Central Boston. We travelled with a baby so a home stay was perfect for a family with a grocery store a short drive away, spacious kitchen and easy to use washer and drier -  and we loved trying out the hot tub too!"
332225,2622719,2012-10-15,3756781,Pamela,"Ken's place is simply gorgeous: a clean, quiet, beautiful, spacious home.  (So clean, in fact, that although I have cat allergies, I didn't sneeze once during the stay.)  His kitties are sweet and friendly and low-maintenance.  The house is only a 10-minute walk from the Forest Hills T stop and the wonderful Dogwood Cafe.  And best of all, there's a huge and easy to use hot tub right in the backyard -- luxurious!  I couldn't believe how nice it all was."

It was conveniently located off of the Forest Hills T stop on the Orange Line which provided easy transportation into downtown Boston and the airport. It is about a 10-15 minute walk to the stop and nearby restaurants. Most of the activities on our trip were in Jamaica Plain so it was especially convenient for us. There is also ample parking for those with a vehicle.
The home was very clean and comfortable and in a nice neighborhood. Ken provided great communication and recommendations for places to eat. The two cats were a pleasant addition to the stay,but certainly could be left to their own devises if needed.,,,,

Though we didn't meet Ken in person, he proved a very caring host, and was easy to communicate with. We came as a whole family of five, but there was lots of extra room.

What a fantastic rental. Lovely home, tons of space, light and airy (which is not the case in a lot of Boston homes--note to fellow indoor-allergy folks, this place is great), pin-drop quiet neighborhood, great kitchen to cook in, and the hot tub is awesome. Ken was a superlative host--can't say enough nice things about his communication and their generosity, and we are so grateful that he worked us in at the last minute. One of the nicest parts of our stay was getting to hang with the resident cats. We recently lost both of our elderly cats, so were definitely in the market for some kitty company. Was hoping these two would be \"\"people\"\" cats and they definitely are. Thank you for sharing your beautiful place and adorable animals with us"

You have a magnificent house with enough room to keep all of us comfy and COZY. We were in Boston for an event a  UMass and that kept us busy most of the weekend, but we were so happy coming home to your place. It was perfect. The details are so nice that I wish I had a little place out there too. The cats were so cool too. They are so sweet and friendly and you never ever worry about them. They are so self sufficient, going in and out on their own. Thank you for allowing me and my family the opportunity to enjoy your house. We are just so sorry we didn't have enough time to see more of Boston. Your place was just as you advertised it."

It's located in a quiet, residential neighborhood in JP - a refreshing break from the bustle of the city with easy access to public transportation and central Jamaica Plain.  It was helpful to have a car while there, but the walk to the T would be very manageable.  The house itself has a welcoming vibe, full of light, and provided a very comfortable and clean stay.  There is plenty of room to relax and the hot tub is great for unwinding at the end of the day.  Ken is very accommodating, quick to respond, and resourceful!

The house was so clean and great with a lot of spaces (exactly as the photos show). None of us has any experience of caring a pet but the two cats essentially looked after themselves. All we needed to do was adding the waters for them in the morning. We could feel Ken's family's good taste of the life and had a wonderful stay. Highly recommended.

332225,44738028,2015-08-28,42482643,Samreen,We had a great experience during our stay.  The host was reliable and easy to get in touch with. He was very accommodating as he told us exactly how to find whatever we may need in the home.
332225,46157934,2015-09-08,490055,Anastasiya,"Ken did a great job in communicating to us, although we never got to meet him in person. The home was lovely and both of the cats were great to heave around as they are laid back and easy to care for. Our group was really looking forward to using the hot tub however it was not available to us at the time of our stay. Overall we had a great time, enjoyed the outdoor patio and home."
332225,50473196,2015-10-12,10077097,John,"Ken's house is beautifully kept and incredibly comfortable. It is sunny and airy, and a delightful place to stay. The neighborhood and location were perfect for us, and the cats were cool and easy. This is a stellar house that I cannot recommend highly enough. Thank you, Ken."
332225,92134848,2016-08-07,22570322,Kathy,Great house in a great neighborhood. The host was very responsive and helpful.

8082512,50554238,2015-10-12,6655897,Carlie,"This place was absolutely perfect for my week stay in Boston. The location was wonderful, space was clean and cozy and the directions for check-in and check-out made the process super easy. Would definitely stay here again!"
14767573,98911122,2016-09-02,57793075,Keroles,"The room was large and clean, with a comfortable bed and great view. Host was very kind and helpful. The area is also very convenient, being close to several restaurants and a CVS. Overall great experience."

In the heart of little Italy next to all great restaurants, main attractions, subway line etc. Kim was a great host! Great for single person or couple. Would definitely stay here again and live like a local and experience the charm of this area."
13298108,98539258,2016-08-31,89945835,Brie,"We loved staying at Kim's place. Perfect location, in the heart of North end, submerged in little Italy. The apartment is spacious, clean and contemporary."
13298108,99504079,2016-09-05,65524988,Molly,"I really loved staying at Kim's place! It was easy to pick up the key and move right in. The location was by far the best part in the heart of boston's little italy., so we were surround by great food and famous cannolis. We were also able to walk to the Charles, science museum and Quincy market. Would definitely stay again!"
4475740,22919871,2014-11-17,23041559,Sonia,"It was a good experience vacationing in Boston, Atanas was always very kind and good person. The place is very close to public transport and very quiet neighborhood."
6763785,36147939,2015-06-25,15284356,Nick,Maggie was extremely accommodating and a friendly and open host. She showed me around the neighborhood and helped me find a late dinner. The room was cozy and clean and the bed was very comfortable. Would absolutely stay with her again and would absolutely recommend her place to others. Great experience!
6763785,36340025,2015-06-27,31334404,Kaoru,マギーは、とても親切で、ボストンのことを良く知っています。
場所も大変便利で、Beacon hillを散歩するのはとても気持ちがいいです。,,,,,
お部屋は快適で、清潔ですし、ひとりには、十分な広さです。,,,,,
また行きたいな!,,,,,
"ありがとう!\"",,,,,
6763785,37694101,2015-07-09,30235394,Hikari,"Maggie was excellent host! The room was clean and cozy. I spent two hot nights there, but there had AC, so I could slept well. It was convenient to stay there, too... close to several subway stations and restaurants. Neighborhood was nice as well. I went there for sightseeing, and the apartment is in the middle of Black heritage trail, so it was easy to see around by foot. I love to stay at Maggie's place again :)"
(However,the room was on fourth floor and there was no elevator. I won't recommend to stay if you have problem with legs.),,,,
"Maggieは素晴らしいホストでした。日本に住んでた経験があって日本語も話せる方だったため、日本人の女子一人旅で安心して過ごせます。部屋がある地区も安全でした。近くには小さくてかわいい店が連なるショッピングストリートもあったため、ショッピング好きにもおすすめです。Maggieは旅行用のシャンプー、リンス、石鹸をくださったり、タオルを貸してくれたりして、本当に親切にしていただきました。私がまたボストンに行くとしたら、ここにまた泊まりたいと思います。\"",,,,,
6763785,38513796,2015-07-16,33709572,Lisa,"The room was as described, cozy, quiet and the bed was comfy. Maggie and Euny were both very accommodating and helpful (especially in helping to get my heavy suitcase up and down the narrow, steep staircase). Location was excellent with good train access and even with mild fitness, being essentially on the Freedom Trail, you can walk to all the tourist spots if you have the time. I felt safe wandering solo around the area, even at nite. I would stay there again! Thanks, ladies, for making my first airBNB experience a good one!"
6763785,39411293,2015-07-23,36383091,Jill,Margaret was a great host. Check-in/check-out was easy. The appartment is in a really good location with a T-stop nearby that goes straight to the airport. Was ideal for my short stop in Boston.
6763785,39584153,2015-07-24,14658565,Michelle,"Maggie could not have been more lovely: so friendly and helpful and made getting in and out and leaving my things very easy. When i went for a run, she even made sure to turn the A/C on so the room was super cool when I got back. It is a small place shared with her and another roommate, but for the price and location (so easy to get to everything; right next to a Whole Foods, the train and the River), you can't beat it."
6763785,39823044,2015-07-26,29182468,Lida,"The space was exactly as described: maybe a bit more cosy than I pictured, but that just reflects the fact that I have spent so little time in a city lately.  Maggie was very welcoming and fun while still giving me my space."
6763785,41394664,2015-08-07,2627334,Lani,The location of Maggie's apartment was perfect for my needs. I was out in Boston to assist my son with his recent move there. Maggie's place was only four blocks away. Her location would be perfect for exploring Boston as many of the must see sites are in walking distance and a train stop is near by for those sites that aren't .
The apartment is in a safe neighborhood with quaint cafes all around.,,,,,
The bed was comfortable and the wi fi worked well.,,,,,
Unfortunately,Maggie wasn't there during my stay but her roommate was. There was a little confusion when I arrived as to how I was to get the keys but that was quickly resolved.,,,,
I do think  the fact that the apartment is at the top of five flights of narrow steps should be included in the description. Fortunately,"I packed very light so I was able to manage getting my suitcase up the stairs.  \"",,,,
6763785,46773835,2015-09-13,27726975,Vanessa,"Maggie was not there, but she gave me all informations that I needed. Euny, her house matte received me well. She is very welcome and helpeful and I´m feel at home. The room is small, but very confortable. I recommend to stay here."
6763785,48791311,2015-09-28,7529215,Saadia,The host's flatmate (Euny) was available as Maggie was away. Euny was very hospitable and introduced me to the place and advised me on where I could get everything I needed.
6763785,50577350,2015-10-12,234535,Alex,"Great host! Welcoming and friendly, very accommodating to my needs - I felt right at home. Place is SMALL - not bad for me for a night, but I wouldn't recommend this for a couple - solo traveler only."
6763785,51753125,2015-10-24,44555766,Mirabelle,"I had a very pleasant, quiet and comfortable stay in this lovely neighborhood."

for parent of students in Harvard and NEU,,,,,
tiny flat of 2 women students - ideal for students or people like me.  There was enough room to put my computer,bits and pieces and a kitchen to make a cup of tea.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
6763785,62750584,2016-02-16,5689735,Darcy,Maggie and Euny were very communicative and accommodating.  I felt very at home. Their place is in the heart of Beacon Hill....wonderful location!
6763785,75376090,2016-05-21,24704590,Lydie,"Loved this sweet, tiny room with its just-right desk. Pack light to best  enjoy the brick streets and hills of Beacon Hill. It's very quiet and cozy at night. Thank you, Maggie and Euny."
6763785,79277912,2016-06-12,27014317,Vanne,"I stayed at Maggie's place on June 7-11. The room was cozy with everything one would need for a short stay. The bed was big enough for me, and was well-prepared with clean and warm sheets. There was a small study table beside the bed, and a small drawer and cabinet where I placed my things. The kitchen and bathroom in the unit was for sharing but I didn't mind. I especially liked that the unit had wooden floors, pretty old fixtures, which I think that added up to the cozy vibe."
Anyone who would stay need to be warned though that Maggie's place is at the loft,and the stairs going there was quite narrow. I would advise that one should bring just a small luggage and be sure it would be easy to lift.,,,,
As for the location,it would be an easy find,and an easy walk from the Boudin Stn. For healthy eaters,Whole Foods is just a 3 min. walk across the street.,,
Maggie was not around when I stayed there but Euny,her roommate,was there and was very accommodating. She even took some time to chat a bit but was also very respectful of my privacy. Both were also keen to answer some of my inquiries. Over-all it was a pleasant stay,"I highly recommend it!\"",,

We greatly appreciated Michael's hospitality, kindness, and generosity. We were so grateful to be able to check-in early to rest following our red-eye.  Michael graciously provided personalized breakfast foods, drinks, and snacks. His new, beautiful, thoughtfully designed home with high-end finishes is delightful and his spacious gourmet kitchen was a pleasure in which to prepare meals.  The amenities throughout his home, such as the sound system in each room, a large screen TV (with cable, and a variety of apps from which to choose), and zone air conditioning in each of the living spaces are on par with a 5 star hotel.  Michael's thoughtful care and attention to detail in preparation for our stay, and during our stay, created an ambience for a very relaxing and rejuvenating experience.  Thank you Michael for sharing your insights that helped us enjoy Boston and for your generous hospitality!"
1596470,91171541,2016-08-04,6493950,Eric,"Amazing space, smooth & nearly automated check-in, and great location. Michael is incredibly responsive and will ensure you have a great stay. This is AirBnB done right."
1596470,92601583,2016-08-09,5643383,Chris,"Michael was an amazing host and went above and beyond with what most hosts do!  He was so great to meet us at the house when we checked in, made sure everything was great, bought some breakfast snacks and drinks for us specifically, had an assortment of other food and drinks there for us, had the kitchen stocked and had the house ready to go the moment we got there!  It's a gorgeous 3 story place and everything was perfect there!  One of my favorite airbnb places I've stayed in ever!  Michael was so helpful with giving us recommendations about the city and checked in via text daily.  Also, when a minor issue occurred with the keypad he quickly got back to me and guided me through fixing the very minor problem.  All in all, my brother and I had an amazing time staying at Michael's place and I'd stay there again in a heartbeat!  It's a gorgeous place in a fantastic part of town!  This is exactly what an airbnb should be like and I recommend Michael's place to everyone visiting Boston!  Thanks again, Michael and I'll have to make my way back to Boston for another visit soon!"
1596470,93542523,2016-08-13,53219389,Julie,Exceptional location and spectacular home. I highly suggest you stay at this home. Michael is a fabulous host and his home is the best of the best!

The fact that there was food in the larder just showed how thoughtful michael has been in providing a fully hosted service - which makes a big difference after a long journey with small kids,,,,,
"Check in was simple and easy - with the electronic code being a fantastically simple solution \"",,,,,
1596470,95977320,2016-08-21,58989442,Chris,This was my first stay with this property and it exceeded our expectations from the beginning. Having used other rental sites in the past I have never worked with someone as attentive as Michael was. From our constant communication to his periodic check ins the feeling was more of a high end concierge than simply a rental transaction.
The first thing that strikes you about the location is parking. As someone who has lived in and visited the city parking can always be a challenge,but with a parking lot directly out the front door it felt as if you had a driveway.  From there the apartment looks and feels like a high end suite. The well appointed appliance and tasteful decorations make you ever more confident that staying at Michael's property was the right choice. We came with our small children and found ourselves going for early morning walks around the Commons and spending the evenings eating ice cream and walking down Newbury street.,,,,
"I can not wait to see what new updates Michael will be adding as we are already planning a return visit. \"",,,,,
1596470,98650527,2016-09-01,37719593,Tu,"喜欢Michael的房子,整洁、设施现代而且很新,入住离开的时候都很方便,附近有太多好吃的餐馆!到所有购物的地方也很近。床品和厨具都有五星级酒店的品质。说说Michael的服务:开门密码用了我的手机号码尾号便于记忆;去波士顿之前细心标出他喜欢的波士顿地标发给我;期间推荐我们需要的人给我们认识,非常热心和贴心。"
Michael's house is in good location and very new inside,clean and tidy,with soft towel and high quality bedding things.michael is very helpful and thoughtful,from plenty of food he prepared for us to the useful information and advice he gave us about Boston,we feel very warm and impressive .we will go back there for sure,"as long as we have the opportunity back to Boston.

The place is comfortable and very clean, it was perfect for our needs. We had a great stay at Jonathan's place, it was our first time in boston and he was very helpful all the time. The listing description was accurate and the pictures as well. If i plan to come back to boston i'll choose this place again."

8211468,48941050,2015-09-29,395528,Yosef,Jonathan was extremely helpful and communicative to us before our arrival. The apartment surpassed our expectations. We were proud to be able to call this place home for the weekend. We were incredibly fortunate to have stayed here because the neighborhood is in close proximity to everything that we wanted to visit. I highly recommend this listing!
8211468,50766499,2015-10-14,43533176,Diane,"We had a misunderstanding about the check in time, but Jonathan was very willing to help solve the issue.  He was currently out of town, and arrange for an early check in.   He was very helpful during a stressful time."
Part of our problem was thatHe did send a very complete emai describing procedures,l,but we were on a cruise,andidd not access to email.,,
The studio was as described.  It was compact,but comfortable.  We ate all our meals out,so did not try out the kitchen,but it seemed to be adequate,,
We liked the location.  We were in walking distance of Copley Square,the Old South Church etc.  It was near the back bay station which give access to all of Boston.  We are not young people,but we found the walking easy,and interesting.,,
There is a Starbucks about 2 blocks away,which we used in the morning.,,,,
All in all it is a small studio which was comfortable in a good location.  We would consider going back if we had an occasion to return to Boston.,,,,,
Taxi to Logan Air[port was $21.00 for  the two of us,Shuttle from the Seaport was $15.00 each,"so it was convenient\"",,,
8211468,53007114,2015-11-03,22823296,Karthik & Astha,"The space was centrally located and is very close to Copley square with all the shops. Jason made is real easy for us to check-in by sending us the instructions before hand. The room was exactly as described in the listing, it was cozy and real clean with all the amenities including clean towels, toiletries etc. He was readily available to talk to us over the phone when I had some questions. I would love to stay at his apartment next time I visit Boston."
8211468,71165102,2016-04-24,5523999,Jose,"Great neighborhood! Accurate listing. This is a small studio, but it comfortably slept two people. Jonathan was helpful and available. Checking in and out was easy!"

Jonathan nous avait laissé toutes les indications et a été très arrangeant sur les heures d'arrivée et de départ. De plus l'appartement est très bien situé dans la ville !"
8211468,85099489,2016-07-10,38276727,Chris,Jonathan was great. The apartment was very nice and he was very accommodating. It's a great value for staying in the heart of Boston.

1550047,8787426,2013-11-18,9416818,Melissa,"The apartment was perfect.  It was clean, comfortable, and well appointed.  Lots of steps, so maybe not the best location for someone that would be put off by that.  We didn't mind, and making our way to the third floor at the end of the day was fun for the kids in our party.  The kitchen is especially big, I was surprised.  The location, although not right in the middle of the bustle, was very convenient- easy to walk to shopping, groceries, and the T.  Great little spots to eat nearby too!  We'll definitely return."
1550047,9112354,2013-12-08,9068853,Barbara,Great place for a cool city ! Very close to the Hynes convention center by foot. Very comfortable place.

We were a group of six people - with three bedrooms and two baths, Will's place was perfect for us! The only drawbacks were that the light in one of the bedroom and the dining room did not work and the kitchen was missing dishtowels and some sharp knives but we would recommend staying there!"

1550047,10920487,2014-03-13,2014078,Allison & Kevin,"We stayed in Will's apartment for 5 days in early March.  6 adults and 1 baby fit comfortably and enjoyed hanging out in the clean and pleasantly appointed space.  We didn't do any cooking but the kitchen appeared well stocked in terms of pots/pans/dishes.  One member of our party has a severe nut allergy and while Will couldn't guarantee it would be safe, it was exceptionally clean and this put our nut-averse friend at ease.  Will was also kind enough to set us up with a Pack n Play for the baby on short notice - thanks!"
"The neighborhood was safe and conveniently located to the T and locals bars/restaurants.  We particularly enjoyed Render Coffee which was a short walk away.  The apartment was a nice retreat during our exploration of Boston and we would certainly consider staying there again if the opportunity presented itself.  \"",,,,,
1550047,11038563,2014-03-17,7013602,Sky,Staying at will's place was a great experience. The check-in and check-out process is extremely easy. The doors use a pass code lock so no keys were required. The apartment is clean and cozy. Highly recommend in general.
1550047,11088388,2014-03-20,8017999,Amelia,"Excellent apartment!  as described & pictured, convenient location & very well priced. Would definitely recommend."
1550047,11580038,2014-04-08,2784982,Nikki,"We really enjoyed our stay here. The apartment was close to the orange and green line, which made it very easy to get around the city. We had no problems with checking in and everything was very clean when we arrived. The kitchen seemed well stocked (although we never actually did any cooking). Beds were comfortable. The property manager was very helpful when I called with a quick question."
My family complained about the outside noise (traffic and sirens),but it didn't bother me. In my opinion,the only real downside to this apartment was the living room. It's pretty small and just has the one couch and two small chairs--not especially comfortable for a group of five after a long day of walking around. But all in all,"I would definitely recommend staying here!\"",,
1550047,11670347,2014-04-11,12635000,Jonathan,"The place was great! Just as advertised. Lot's of great restaurants within a short walking distance and only minutes away from the Longwood/Fenway area where we were working. It is in a really neat up-and-coming area. We were able to park on the street overnight, which was a bonus."
1550047,11787861,2014-04-15,9596252,Gregg,Great location and exactly how it was described. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay while in Boston.
1550047,11896685,2014-04-18,11729781,Aaron,The apartment was exactly as described and we loved our stay here. In a great part of town near to lots of bars and restaurants. Comfortably slept 6 (3 x double bed) and 2 bathrooms. Perfect for a group or family wanting to explore.
1550047,12686605,2014-05-08,12965089,Mathieu,Nice flat. Not far from a metro station to go downtown. The appartement was clean when we arrived. Nice old Boston style appartement (maybe some step on the stair are a little bit to old fashion ;) )
1550047,12879000,2014-05-13,9432691,Mark,"This is a very nice unit on the 3rd floor of a walkup. The apartment was clean and comfortable with a good amount of charm. The kitchen, which we hardly used was very nicely appointed. Should we have desired to cook, it would have been ideal."
The location of the unit was good. It is on the edge of the South End,just before the neighborhood get's a little rough.  We felt comfortable walking in one direction on Tremont (Right off of Northampton) at night and during the day.  Going left,left... not so much.,,,
"We had 6 people in our party. I assumed from the ad that the sofa was an actual \"\"sleeper.\"\"  In fact it is just a sofa.  I suppose it would be okay for a child",but was not really suited for an adult.  For our purposes,there was enough bed space,but for a 7th person,it would not be so comfortable.,
The host was very easy to communicate with and very accommodating.,,,,,
I would stay here again in the future,"for sure!\"",,,,
1550047,13244879,2014-05-23,11744793,Nick,Will was great and easy to deal with. Answered any questions that I had before.
The unit,like most people have mentioned is a 3 floor walk-up on very thin stairwell so don't bring too many big bags with you. The beds were comfortable and we had plenty of space for our stay. The Wi-Fi worked great and the individual A/C units were perfect for our rooms. The floors in the unit are all slanted which was more funny than annoying.,,,,
The biggest pain was parking. It would be nice if there was a parking pass included in the rental as you weren't allowed to be parked in front of the apartment during the day (city rule) without one. The closest parking lot was about two blocks away and just charged a flat rate. You might get lucky during the day on the other street but you can only be there for two hours. So if you aren't planning on going anywhere one day,plan on moving your car all the time. Better yet,don't have a car.,,,
"The neighborhood was nice enough but I wouldn't spend too much time walking south. Just keep going north and you'll be okay. Plenty of places to eat and drink in the area.\"",,,,,
1550047,16241383,2014-07-24,11871778,Lennard,"Beautifull house, with perfect location to make trips in Boston."
Although we had a car,we didn't use it once; all is within walking distance.,,,,
Items to improve:,,,,,
- only 6 beds; sleeping sofa is not available,,,,,
- douche upstairs mainly provides cold water,,,,,
Positives:,,,,,
- Boston in walking distance,,,,,
- Clean,,,,,
- Well equiped,,,,,
If you would like to stay in Boston I recommend this house,,,,,

Worth looking up shops and restaurants before you go. Well equipped apartment for a holiday. Light spacious rooms, comfortable beds. We would definitely return."
1550047,19405324,2014-09-12,15553501,Clint,This place was an excellent stay. Very well organized and a nice house. Very easy to walk to walk to the main intersection and get a taxi. We felt safe walking around during the day and got taxis to our front door at night. Thanks for a great stay
1550047,20684163,2014-10-04,13985111,Gail,We loved the place it was so close to everything we wanted to do. We love to walk so the Predential and Fenway is in walking distance. The place had plenty of Sleeping room for the 6 of us. Kitchen is very nice for all our cooking needs. We would use Wills place again if we would come back to Boston.
1550047,21751416,2014-10-23,21732452,Joerg,"The appartment was absolutely charming, cosy, furnished with care and taste, the beds were very comfortable. Everything was clean and nice. Helpful details were provided such as where to shop, where to eat, what to see. At night it was quiet, but someone who would like to sleep long should consider early morning traffic on the nearby avenue; bring earplugs - they helped us. There was a problem with hot water in the showers, seemed to come at random; we informed the owner and guess this will be fixed."
1550047,22133932,2014-10-31,12814834,Trina,Great location close to transport.  Please be aware that the stairs as mentioned in other reviews as quite steep.

1550047,23862413,2014-12-13,21861978,Gerard,Lovely home close to express rail with easy access to everything in boston. Loved our stay here in this beautiful home. Will was well organised throughout stay.
1550047,25854179,2015-01-27,25769327,Ava,"Will replied us pretty fast and gave us some introductions. The listing description was very accurate. The neighborhood is very convenient. We found most of things we need in walking distance. We love the historic streets views. We had a good time staying in Will's unit, even though we met the big snow storm in Boston."
1550047,26190632,2015-02-06,8593248,Devon,"\"Nice residential neighborhood, about a 10-15 minute walk from a few blocks of restaurants and bars. Pretty quiet street. The house itself was only so-so. Definitely not a \"\"lived in\"\" space"
1550047,27271942,2015-03-01,27062716,Monica,"This unit was what we expected from the description and pictures. The location was great for us as we were visiting Boston to attend a conference at the Boston Convention Center. I thought it was spacious and had enough room for 7 of us, which is harder to find in Boston. The kitchen was also nicely remodeled. However, the biggest issue we had was the water temperature for the showers. We had to take mostly cold showers as the hot water would only last for about 1-2 minutes. Unfortunately, the shower issue was enough to lower my overall experience of this place to 3 stars (I would probably give it 3.5 stars)."
1550047,27504042,2015-03-06,27327921,James,"The unit was easy to get to and only a few minutes walk to the Orange Line. We didn't spend a significant amount of time in the immediate neighborhood, but we enjoyed the space. it was quaint and more than served our needs. The beds and sheets were comfortable, the architectural details helped to set the space off, and the amenities were numerous and easy to use. I was almost always able to get in touch with either Will or the property management company when I needed to, and all parties involved where always courteous and helpful."
That being said,there were a few minor issues. These are all incredibly nitpicky and did not significantly detract from our stay and enjoyment of the property.,,,,
A few of the stairs,either in the unit or on the way up to it,are in need of replacement. We were actively trying to step as close to the riser as possible on these steps to take as much of the load off of the tread as possible.,,,
The cable jack for the TV is missing a face plate and is not secured to the wall; it is simply hanging out next to the tv stand. While this is mainly just a cosmetic issue,it is nonetheless rather interesting that it has not been properly installed.,,,,
The downstairs bathroom has the main light switch behind the hand towels,which we didn't realize until someone actually took one of the towels off the rack. It's just an odd/confusing placement,especially if you arrive after dark.,,,
Lastly,the wireless is shared between at least the top two units and the requisite equipment is located in unit 2. We had the wireless go out and require a reset once during our stay,and it caused a few minor hiccups when we were getting ready that morning. A quick call to the Short Term Rentals Boston office (the company that manages the property for Will) was able to remedy this; they contacted the tenets in unit two and had the system reset.,,,
"These were all minor issues and would not prevent me from staying here again or wholeheartedly recommending it to anybody that is considering the property. This is a nice unit with a fairly central location. If you're going to be spending a fair amount of time in the vicinity or traveling around the Boston area it's an excellent choice. It also serves as a far more reasonably priced option if you're going to be around the Cambridge area more but don't want to spend the extra money that would entail; the metro system will easily get you to the Harvard and MIT campuses within 15-20 minutes. \"",,,,,
1550047,28940568,2015-04-01,27787012,Debbie,"This was a great location!  The apartment was just as we expected and the neighborhood was great.  There is a book with good information on places to eat close by, grocery stores etc which was very helpful!"

1550047,31092274,2015-05-02,24867743,Sondra,"Our experience overall was extremely pleasant. The apartment was exactly as advertised, and having read some of the previous reviews, we had an idea of what to expect in terms of the apartment's shortfalls (creaky steps and water temperature issues). The check-in process was extremely smooth and we had no issues finding the spot or getting into the building. The wifi was a very welcome perk!"
The neighbourhood was fine. Late night excursions might not be a good idea for women traveling alone on foot,but during the day,none of us felt uncomfortable.,,,
The location of the apartment was wonderful,we were able to walk to the downtown and to Fenway in under 30 minutes,and we frequently used the T when our feet were tired.,,,
I did have a bit of difficulty getting in touch with Will. I had a couple of questions that were unanswered,but were quickly resolved with Airbnb's assistance.,,,,
Also,on our last night,the folks below us had a party. It was noisy,but it was a Friday night,and we were able to get to sleep eventually. Otherwise,the place was very quiet.
If I were traveling to Boston with a group again,I wouldn't hesitate to stay here in the future!,,,,

1550047,32449158,2015-05-18,25956465,Michael,The description was accurate. The place we stayed in was on the third floor in a decent neighborhood with public transportation nearby.
1550047,33068862,2015-05-25,27041039,Holly,"Very nice Boston apt. Exactly as described. No problems checking in or out. Will always replied via email promptly. Only downfall was the managing company he uses NEVER got back to me, I emailed & called probably 4 or 5 times, no response. Also, you have to take out trash when you leave. There are no facilities that we could find anywhere on the premises so we ended up having to walk a ways (with trash) to find an empty trash can. Other than that I would recommend staying here, this was my first time using airbnb and I will certainly use it again. Great for large families!"
1550047,37969456,2015-07-12,32617719,Francis,"We arrived at around 3PM to leave our bags before going to the game. There was no one to meet us. We waited until after 4 thinking that someone might show up, but no one."
We went to the game and came back to the apartment and went to bed. The next morning I showered to find there was no hot water and we had to do the best we could.,,,,,
The apartment was like it looked on the site and was clean and neat. However there could have been a few amenities such as soap and shampoo.,,,,,
Also,the $125 cleaning fee is a joke for one night in the place.,,,,

1550047,69637638,2016-04-12,26827452,Ian,"A group of us went to work a tattoo convention in the area, the apartment was great for our purposes. The apartment is furnished really nicely and it feels sophisticated and raw at the same time. The area of town is pretty good, there was good eats and bars right near there. Sound traveled a little too much, the first two nights the downstairs renters were quite loud and you could here everything, the last night we were up at 1 AM talking and working on drawings and the renters below were banging on the ceiling because we were too loud... So I'd say if you are sensitive to noise or you are really loud, this might not be the best spot for you."

The place is very convenient, about a 10-15 min walk in a very safe neighborhood to the Forest Hills orange line station and about 30 mins away from the city center where most of the sights are. Jamaica Plains is a nice quiet neighborhood that is surrounded by amazing parks. Matt and Julia are extraordinary hosts and are very flexible with regards to the amount of interaction you want. But it would be a shame if you don't get to know them as the walls of their house tell a wonderful story. They are very generous about local secrets and places to go. They leave tiny notes around the house to help you navigate around it even when they are not around. I even got to play fetch with the neighbors dog in their backyard. Small things like these make the airbnb experience memorable. After a crazy night in Boston their place is an oasis where you can relax and truly feel that you are on a vacation."

The photos capture the beautiful space well and I would definitely want to stay here again if visiting the lovely South End.

7714627,49449037,2015-10-04,40978009,Liz,"We truly enjoyed our stay in this treetop nest. A lovely view of the city over the tops of waving leaves was truly a sight to behold - morning to night. We woke from a comfy night's rest to a wealth of great eateries - we chose the Buttery and felt truly transported. The location is right in the midst of all that is hip and happening in Boston's South End. With so much to do in walking distance, you really have the best of Boston at your doorstep."
7714627,49988184,2015-10-08,30850865,Carlos,"Liri was a perfect host. No matter she was travelling meanwhile we stayed in Boston, she was permanently in contact with us through sms and mails. The apartment is a vary cozy one, in a fantastic neighborhood, very close to public transportation (T is 3 blocks away, as well as buses) , and you've got plenty of bars and coffee shops nearby if you want to grab something to eat. Also Whole Foods market is only 3 block away from the apartment."

7714627,50189687,2015-10-10,5320230,Beth,"Liri's flat is perfectly situated and perfectly appointed in a lovely, very modern yet comfortable style.  Staying there, you're within 15 minutes walking distance of pretty much everything you'll want to see, and there is a wonderful selection of bars, restaurants, cafes and shops literally steps from her front door.  Liri was also an attentive host, responsive to all communiques and kind enough to leave some snacks for us to enjoy while there.  We would definitely recommend Liri's flat for anyone who wants a convenient and peaceful home base from which to explore Boston!"
7714627,50843907,2015-10-15,42111819,Emma,Liri's Tremont Street pad is a home from home! Slap bang in the middle of all the best restaurants and shops that the beautiful south end has to offer. The apartment has everything you would want or need topped off with a fantastic city view. Excellent'

7714627,55364576,2015-12-01,44018332,Andrea,Liri. Thank you so much. Your apartment  was amazing. Loved the kitchen. I was able to cook my dreams away. It was extremely warning. I felt at home. Everything was beautiful and cozy.
7714627,56499903,2015-12-14,28292059,Sean,Liri's listing was beautiful and ready for my arrival.  I had no trouble getting into it and all her instructions were very clear.  The space was very clean and the bed was super comfortable.   A stress free place to stay for my time in Boston.
7714627,57256355,2015-12-23,22424438,Ewa,We have spent a few days in Liri's apartment and really loved the place. It has a very nice vibe about it.
Liri was kind enough to leave some wonderful granola and almond milk (to which I am now officially converted) for a quick breakfast. There is also a nespresso machine which we loved.,,,,,
The apartment is located about a 15 min walk from downtown and is surrounded by plenty of restaurants and shops.,,,,,
The apartment is as in the pictures and with some wonderful views of the city. We would definitely stay there again!,,,,,
Thank you,"Liri!\"",,,,
7714627,57726691,2015-12-28,742560,Brian,Liri's place of gorgeous and In the heart of the south end. Near everything and on one of the most charming streets. She was super to communicate with (she was traveling) and the place was stocked with convenient amenities.
7714627,58268176,2016-01-02,41210994,Dayl,Liri's condo was beautiful and located in one of the most vibrant parts of Boston.  Checking in was simple and the  condo spacious and immaculate.  I will try to say here again on my next trip to Boston.
7714627,59546487,2016-01-11,17596653,Sophie,"Lovely place, very reasonable for such a central location. Stairs are quiet intense and steep so if you have a ton a luggage you are going to struggle. Breakfast food provided on arrival, very clean, wonderful sofa with so many comfy cushions. Liri responds very attentively. Would highly recommend."
7714627,61225603,2016-02-01,52367326,Jeff,Amazing apartment in the heart of the South End!
We are very familiar with the city as we use to live in Back Bay and now live in California.  We knew we wanted to stay in the South End because it is more residential but still walking distance to so many great restaurants and shops. (We went to Cafe Nero every morning for coffee and scones,and would highly recommend Mistral brunch on Sunday),,,,
The apartment was very clean and was well portrayed in the pictures on AirBNB.  Another great feature is that it is a penthouse apartment which means there are not any neighbors above you walking around.,,,,,
We rented a car while we were in town to drive to Vermont for a day and out to the suburbs a few times and we never had a problem finding a meter spot on Tremont and noticed there were plenty of parking garages and lots nearby.,,,,,
We decided to stay in an apartment versus a hotel because it was a much better deal,you do not get the full city living experience in a hotel,and you have a lot more space! (We were traveling with our 6 month old),,,
"Liri was very responsive and helpful during our stay and we would highly recommend this apartment to anyone! \"",,,,,
7714627,62638426,2016-02-15,16095084,Carina,"I had a wonderful stay at Liri's apartment. The check in process was clear and simple, and the apartment was super clean and well equipped with everything you might need. The location of the apartment really can't be beat, there are so many awesome restaurants within walking distance, and it's a short uber ride to everything else."
7714627,65315577,2016-03-13,23981855,Zoe,"Although we did not meet our host - the welcome, information and attention to detail were 100%"
The apartment is in a great location with fabulous restaurants nearby . It is also close enough to walk into the centre,parks and go for a lovely run along the Charles river .,,,,
The apartment was clean,light and airy,"with all the home comforts you need when travelling . Thanks - we will definately stay again if we return to Boston. \"",,,
7714627,67538496,2016-03-30,2924625,Debra,"Lori's place was great!  We had never stayed in the South End before and feel like we have discovered a new part of Boston.  The apartment was exactly as pictured and described; clean, spacious and full of light.  There is a great coffee place just around the corner and we ate all of our dinners in neighborhood restaurants.  The proximity to all of Boston is a short walk; we walked to Charles Street, Chinatown, BU, Brookline and Cambridge.  Liri was always quick to respond to questions and made check-in very easy.  I will absolutely stay at her place again."
7714627,68406588,2016-04-04,25407209,Shira,"This is a beautiful home in a great neighborhood with a stunning view. Everything about the apartment was perfect, and everything I could have needed was provided. I hope to stay again!"
7714627,69420945,2016-04-11,54123460,Kevin,Liri was a wonderful host. At the start of our stay she contacted us to make sure everything was fine. Liri was always available for questions during our stay. The accommodations (clean and bright) and the great location were exactly as described. My wife and I had a wonderful time and very pleased with all the arrangements.  We would differently return to Liri's South End loft.

7714627,70699383,2016-04-19,8529655,Stacy,"As a first timer with Airbnb wasn't exactly sure what to expect, but if future experiences are half the pleasure that Liri's South End Penthouse provided than we cannot wait for our next vacation.  First off Liri was great, she maintained open communication up to the booking.  I was a little nervous so I emailed here a number of times and she always responded very promptly.  She provided great directions for accessing the apartment and information about the local area, which was really helpful.  As for the apartment what a gem.  Beautiful, spacious, and relaxing.  No way a hotel could have provided this level of comfort.  We were able to make breakfast, drink coffee, and lounge around.  It's equipped with everything you could want if you had intentions on cooking, but with all the nice restaurants we chose to eat out.  With that, the apartment is situated in the beautiful South End neighborhood.  This was our first time in Boston and the areas is something out of a movie.  Tons of shops and restaurants all within mere steps from the front door.  The Orange Line Back Bay station is conveniently located only a few blocks away.  Only drawback of the apartment is it's fifth floor location requiring a lot of steps.  After the marathon these were a little challenging, but full disclosure we new this going into it so no complaining here.  If we come back to Boston we will look no further than Liri's place for accommodations and I would highly recommend to anyone."
7714627,71230906,2016-04-24,30939048,François,"Liri's place was absolutely spotless and in a great neighborhood. she was helpful, her instructions were clear and i cant wait to go back for future trips"
7714627,73692124,2016-05-09,10705137,Michael,"Location, location, location!  Liri's apartment is in a fabulous location central to so many things to do in Boston.  The neighborhood itself has an energetic vibe without being noisy at night.  We love to walk; 20 minutes to downtown, 10 minutes to Copley Plaza, 15 minutes to the fun shopping on Newberry St, 25 minutes to the Charles River, 30 minutes to the Museum of Fine Arts, and 60 minutes to Harvard.  Lots of great restaurants in the neighborhood, we particularly liked the downstairs restaurant in the Buttery on Shawmut and Mela for Indian food on Tremont.  The apartment itself has lots of natural light and an open floor plan plus it's a really nice size for two.  Lots of closet space in the bedroom.  Beautiful night time view of downtown Boston.  Everything one needs is no more then two to three blocks away---morning coffee, market, sports club with short term privileges, myriad of restaurants.  We also enjoyed the neighborhood art show on Sunday mornings.  While we did not use the kitchen for cooking it is nicely equipped for those who plan on cooking.  The weather was cool during our stay but there are two window air conditioners, one in the main room and one in the bedroom for hot days.  We highly recommend Liri's apartment for those looking to stay in a fun neighborhood yet close to so many Boston attractions or work centers.  WiFi was excellent.  Check in was easy and Liri stayed in close contact to insure our stay was going well."
7714627,75612939,2016-05-22,35034129,Tina & Scott,"I had a very comfortable stay at Liri's 5th floor apartment - it is a bright and sunny apartment in a great south end location.  The apartment is perfect for a solo traveler or couple, and while I did not do any cooking during my stay, everything needed to do so was at hand.  The bed was comfortable and towels were new and everything was tidy.  I was in town a few nights for business and know the area well, and this would be a fun spot for out of town visitors to use as a base for exploring!"

1) The pad: Exactly like Liri advertised - and more. The apartment was bright,airy,spacious,aesthetic with an extremely well equipped kitchen (Nespresso!,Vitamix!) and thoughtful touches throughout (shampoo,novels
2) The location: Not knowing Boston very well before I didn't know how lucky I was to stay in the trendy,hip and understated South End. Many of Boston's favorite restaurants were in walking distance (B&G,Elephant Walk,Myers and Chang etc.),not one but two Flour bakeries within walking distance,Blackbird donuts
3) The people: Maybe it was the weather,but I was impressed with how friendly all the neighbors were - on the street,in the stores. You name it. Quarters for the laundry? No problem!,,,
4) Liri: A consummate host. Even though she was away at the time,she kept in constant communication and I was always prepared to find everything exactly as she had stated. And the welcome granola was the icing on the cake. Thanks Liri.,,,,

The location is perfect to explore the great city. The neighbourhood is very quant and inviting. There are some great restaurants a short walk away.

The apartment was clean and comfortable,and was in a good location for walking or taking the bus. At  night,walking was a little challenging due to uneven sidewalks and poor lighting.

Apartment was perfect for the two of us. Nice view of city lights @ night. Spotless with all the amenities promised. Would definitely recommend & stay there again.

7714627,89320393,2016-07-28,10776623,Jamison,"Liri's apartment is exactly as advertised. It's located in a fun, safe neighborhood near many things to do/eat/drink and less than a 10 minute walk to the train, which is only a couple stops from many of the popular tourist destinations. The place looks just like the photos - more than enough room for two people, comfy bed, all the amenities we needed, and while it was 90+ degrees outside, the window A/C units kept it plenty cool. Had great meals at B&G Oysters at the end of the block, and at Myers + Chang a couple blocks away. We'd definitely stay here again."

11739985,73970715,2016-05-12,27799053,Josh,The rooms are lovely! Jon and Margrit are very accommodating and hospitable. They let us use their kitchen and there are plenty of condiments and utensils to choose from. They gave us a fantastic tour to their century-old house and gorgeous backyard garden.
11739985,74183115,2016-05-13,25133202,Ian,"Very friendly hosts. Nice apartment (top floor suite). We were in town for a graduation ceremony and this place was extremely convenient being just 5 minutes walk from the Orange line subway. Jon and Margrit even provided fresh bagels, cereal and coffee / tea before we headed off in the morning."
11739985,74486114,2016-05-15,36486655,Emily,"Jon and Margrit were lovely. Unfortunately , I set this reservation up for my folks and they were unable to stay. However, Jon was very kind when I came I pick up the keys and drop them off. They had the rooms made up very nicely. They even offered bagels coffee and tea in the morning. Lovely garden in the back. Though this reservation didn't work out due to unforeseen circumstances on my end, I will recommend their home for years to come. They have a sweet dog too! The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because we never ended up staying so I can't fully rate my experience."
11739985,74751878,2016-05-16,61654454,Wanda,"We only had a quick overnight in this third floor suite of rooms but we would love to go back again when we had more time to explore the area.  We did get to enjoy a quick walk around the neighborhood. I wish I had brought a book to leave in the little lending library around the corner!  The train is very close and we were in downtown Boston in a matter of minutes.  It was also an easy drive to get to the airport the next day.  Our hosts provided bagels with home made jam for us, and the all important coffee, before we left for the day.  We felt very welcomed by Margrit and Jon and their house is absolutely amazing."

The top floor, where guests stay, was clean and bright, and had everything we needed. We stayed with our 1 year old daughter who happened to be sick at the time and crying a lot, but they did not mind and were very understanding."

Grande maison victorienne qui se trouve dans un quartier résidentiel très agréable et très proche du métro; on est à quelques stations du centre ville. .,,,,,
Notre logement était au 2ème étage,ce qui n'était pas clair d'après le descriptif. Les deux chambres étaient confortables et la salle de bains bien aménagée. Notre logement était bien séparé du reste de la maison.,,,,

11739985,79927502,2016-06-15,60379418,Ken,"Jon and Margrit are very nice hosts who made my family's stay in Boston a very pleasant stay. There is everything I expected and my family all said that it was a nice stay, although only for one night. They have some board games for my 4-year-old sister to play with. Margrit is a university computer science professor, and I just graduated from UCLA with a BS in computer science and engineering, so I had a lot to talk with her about and she gave me good advice on future affairs. Anyways, the hosts were nice and helpful, I would recommend them if anyone wants to visit Boston."

Street parking was easy, easy, easy if you are looking for this on your trip. Their nephew, Erik, helped us as they were out of town and he was very kind- he even came out to the car to help carry up our luggage which was much appreciated. I would definitely recommend this airbnb!"

Jon and Margrit made sure we had everything we needed, including a complimentary bagel and fresh fruit breakfast with our morning coffee. The Master Suite was extremely comfortable and provided lots of space for us to spread out. We especially loved the newly renovated bathroom with a huge shower. They also gave us good directions on how to get around the neighborhood. Our experience was very positive and we will definitely return!"

The house is lovely and Jon can tell you the fascinating history of it, and is a fun, engaging storyteller, too! The third floor is spacious, very well-kept, and comfortable, including two large bedrooms with plenty of room to sleep 5, a beautiful newly redone bathroom, mini-fridge, coffeemaker, books, games, etc. We asked if we could cook dinner in their kitchen and they happily obliged (kitchen is a cook's dream). Terrific location for exploring Jamaica Plain and other areas of Boston. We happened to be there for Porch Fest, which was amazing, with multiple musical acts all within easy walking distance. Overall, outstanding. We would definitely stay there again!"

Ils sont très accueillants, disponibles et aiment discuter . Ils nous ont offert le petit-déjeuner et prêté leur cuisine pour le diner. Le jacuzzi dans le jardin était très agréable après une journée de marche dans Boston ! En bref, le meilleur endroit où nous avons été accueillis pendant nos 15 jours aux USA."

Flexible hours checking in and out made our planning very easy. Small details like bottles of fresh water, umbrellas for the rain also showed a lot of consideration. If we travel to Boston again, we will definitely stay here !"
7377034,42099340,2015-08-10,40861926,Eline,"Adam was a great host! Upon arrival Adam was home to greet us and provide us with information, maps and bottles of water. During our stay, Adam gave us daily advice about what to do in the city. The room was spacious and the bed was very nice. The location of the apartment is close to city center, so you can either walk or take the bus (which stops practically in front of the apartment). We would definitely like to stay at Adam's again when we're in Boston!"
7377034,42217521,2015-08-11,40484440,Daniel,"Adam and his family were fantastic. Very helpful with parking, and very understandable and flexible for my need of a vague check in time"
7377034,42606862,2015-08-14,39873361,Robert,"This was our first time using airbnb, so we really didn't know what to expect. We decided to give it a try only because Boston has the most expensive hotels I have ever found anywhere on this planet, and I have travelled all over the world. Seriously, what's up with that?"
In any event,for 1/3 the price of any nearby hotel,this worked for us. Adam was gracious and very flexible and accommodating. He allowed us in early and let us check out late so,,,
we didn't have to deal with our luggage in the hours before our ferry to the Cape left.,,,,,
Adam also allowed us our privacy,but was available when we needed an iron and ironing board.,,,,
This is hardly a five star hotel experience,"but it met our needs for an affordable price. \"",,,,
7377034,42983997,2015-08-16,506204,Thomas,Adam was very welcoming and helpful. The room is very nice in a quiet neighborhood.
7377034,45354991,2015-09-01,7864668,Jan,"Hitting Boston just before the big Moving Day, finding accommodations was not easy. Adam, however, managed to accommodate us on very short notice (4pm on the same night). Not only this, but he was even super friendly extending our stay for one night (a period in which he was planning not to host) so that we got past the days of exorbitant hotel rates just before September 1st!"
The apartment is centrally located,and with Adam's instructions,easy to find. We had no qualms whatsoever with the neighborhood,all seemed well. The room is private and spacious and despite what first impressions may tell you,that sleeping couch provides for a very good night's sleep. Finally,having a private bathroom was quite the treat for an AirBnB.
Thanks Adam,"for a wonderful stay!\"",,,,

Additionally, they provided great recommendations for food and drink in the local area and made themselves readily available if we had any questions.

As soon as I got there (which Krishna was able to accommodate an earlier check in) I accidentally tried to get into his house ( I didn't realize I was in the back aha) Krishna came to the door and was as polite and assisting as can be. Even though the place I stayed in was attached, it was nice having them next door ( since I was also staying alone) Now the place was a ridiculously cute little cottage. There were quite a few things provided which made my stay an easy one. The only negative thing I'd have to say is that the mattress I slept on was very hard :( however, everything else was great.

The location is ideal-- as an outsider,the charming and historic surroundings were a perfect way to experience the city. Lots of great restaurants and even a Whole Foods accessible on foot for groceries. However,we drove in,and it was so great to have the parking spot-- especially after it snowed! Krishna was very responsive before and throughout the visit,and was super amenable when we had to shift cars in tandem. I would absolutely stay here again!

8442940,62069529,2016-02-11,33867991,Bernie,Fabulous place in the heart of Charlestown with great hosts! A 5 minute walk to Warren Tavern... highly recommended local spot with good food and a lot of history.
8442940,63229440,2016-02-21,6735696,Sally,"We spent the weekend at Krishna and Meena's townhouse in a charming Charlestown neighborhood. Everything was great. Krishna gave us excellent suggestions about where to eat (we got in late) that we could easily walk to. He also emailed us a couple days ahead giving us hints and tips about how to get around, the neighborhood, the townhouse, etc. all which were very helpful. He is super-friendly and we enjoyed chatting with him before we left. The townhouse was spotless, bright and airy in a perfect location a for shopping and walking tours around Bunker Hill and beyond. There is a really nice patio for relaxing or eating outside. The kitchen is well-equipped. Next time we're in Boston, we would stay there in a heartbeat. Thanks Krishna!"
8442940,63932690,2016-02-28,57278186,Amy,"We were very pleased with our stay at Krishna's. The location was amazing! Only a few blocks from bunker hill in charming Charlestown. There was a lot to do nearby and the Whole Foods down the street was very convenient. With a T stop within walking distance, we didn't have to worry about transportation into the city. The apartment was very clean and towels were laid out for us when we go there! Krishna was very responsive by text even though they were out of town and very accommodating when I wanted to check in an hour early. I will definitely consider staying here again if I visit Boston in the future."

The stairs ARE really steep, but as long as you are reasonable mobile, you will be fine.  The location is fantastic... a very quiet, cute neighborhood, but you can walk to the grocery store and restaurants in just five minutes.  It's a very safe area--I even let my kids go get ice cream on their own one night.    We didn't spend much time hanging out in the house as we were too busy exploring Boston, but it was a great home base and we would definitely stay there again.  Thank you for sharing your lovely home with us!"

We stayed there for a week over eastern 2016 and could do everything of the tips Krishna had suggested. We went to waterworld the Public Ocean, to Quincy seaside and all by the 7 days MTBA train Ticket. The breakfast at the Grasshopper Café was super and I could do my dayly Workouts at the YMCA as suggested. Super."
8442940,68306399,2016-04-04,50826776,Tara,This was a very clean place with everything you really need. The convenience of having a free parking spot was perfect for our needs. We walked to and from the nearby T location late at night and felt perfectly safe. Noticed a lot of young families in the neighborhood; it was generally a quite area with a few good restaurants.
Krishna was very helpful and provided a detailed and well organized outline of all the information we would need for our stay. The stairs are quite steep,so it may not be the best for people with bad knees,"etc. Definitely recommend staying here otherwise!\"",,,
8442940,68963138,2016-04-08,11423784,Richard,"Krishna gave  helpful information before we arrived and responded to our questions in timely manner.

8442940,71413381,2016-04-25,42005179,Alexander,We had a great time in Krishnas wonderful and comfy apartment. Everything was exactly as described. Everything was very clean and apartment makes guests really feel comfortable. Unfortunately we werent't able to use the gorgeous courtyard since weather was little too cold.Excellent neighborhood. 10 Min walk to subway wherefrom all sights are easily accesible. Krishna was very responsive and a great help to us. We'd love to come back to the apartment whenever we are back in Boston.

Neighborhood was safe and nice, and close to the T station. The hosts provided recommendations for food and sightseeing, which we took advantage of and were quite pleased. We were greeted by the host and was warmly welcomed. They were very accommodating with the check-in times and very responsive to emails. This was a great first Airbnb experience for my mom and sister!"
8442940,74253419,2016-05-14,26609680,Joanne,Krishna is a very good host. He promptly answers my emailed query. Very very helpful. He allowed us to stay in his place until we had to leave for the airport at 9pm because our flight was at midnight. Also allowed us to park our rental car in his driveway. If you are not averse to climbing the short flight of steep stairs from the kitchen to the upstairs bedroom and living room then I highly recommend his place.
8442940,75622539,2016-05-22,59953852,Robert,We stayed for 5 days as we were in town for our son's PHD graduation. The house was very clean and up to date. Our hosts were very friendly and Mina greeted us several times as we came in and was very helpful with recommendations for food etc. in the area. Charlestown is wonderful. We highly recommend an evening walk after dark in the nearby gaslight district. You won't be disappointed. We would definitely stay here again.

8442940,79728614,2016-06-13,12554037,Joshua,"This may be the first AirBNB I would actually return to. So close to downtown and all the action but located in the quite and historically significant Charlestown. The light in the apartment upstairs rooms was so beautiful. Very steep stairs from the entry way with Kitchen, be careful I slipped in my socks on the lower wood steps. A perfect stay for a long weekend any longer and those steps would be to much for me. The hosts  were very accommodating and quick to reply with any and all inquiry. Very convent to walk just down the hill and find WholeFoods. Highly Recommended!"
8442940,81070253,2016-06-20,27619508,Minkey,"Krishna and Meena were wonderful hosts.  They are the definition of what great AirBnB host is.  Location was great and not hard to find at all. Boston area was pretty mild weathered up until my stay, so the A/C unit was not installed yet.  But once I let Krishna and Meena know, they were very quick to install the A/C and make it very comfortable.  The place itself is accurate to the pictures and cozy.  The stairs are steep and require caution, but nothing to be afraid of.  I was able to meet Meena the morning of my leave date and chatted with her for a while.  She was super nice and a pleasure to talk to!"
8442940,82392583,2016-06-27,26756557,Kevin,"We absolutely loved everything about this stay. Meena and Krishna were fabulous hosts - readily accessible and very accommodating. The location was perfect, as there was much to do & see within walking distance, and the easy access to Logan was very convenient. Having a great coffee shop (Zume's) and Whole Foods within a few blocks walk was a definite bonus. We'll be back!"
8442940,85706495,2016-07-12,3349402,Gabrielle,Krishna's place was very nice. Very cute and comfortable with a lovely patio space. Krishna and Meena were accommodating for an early arrival and were very prompt with communication.

8442940,87903135,2016-07-22,71338196,Kathy,"\""
I very much enjoyed my 4-night stay at this Charlestown location.   Loved it!  Krishna was very helpful from the time I booked until I checked out.  Very responsive!  I bombarded him with questions which he answered quickly and graciously.  The unit was in a pleasant residential neighborhood,near Bunker Hill and the Freedom Trail.  I needed to leave my luggage there on check-out day until I could move to another location to meet friends at a larger location for a conference and he was very accommodating in letting me do that,be a tourist,then come back later in the day to pick the items up.  The little patio was so nice to sit in and relax after a full day of touring Boston's sites.,,
The listing was accurate...I did not read the fine print (my fault!) and didn't notice there would be no TV in the unit,but I was happy to catch up with Netflix,and Krishna also sent me links to live streaming of certain shows I had planned to watch.,,,
The unit is about an 8 minute walk to the nearest T station so it was easy to get around town.  (Part of School Street is rather steep from the T but I found that one street over was not so steep so it was easy to walk up that hill without too much exertion after a full day of exploring the city.) I would highly recommend this listing for 1-2 people for a simple,"comfy place.  The only caveat is that the stairs are very steep and deep and I was glad there was a very sturdy railing.  Not terribly easy to run up and down the stairs and it wouldn't be good for people with physical challenges.   And I expect that is due to the nature of the older historical buildings.   If I were to return to Boston and needed a place to stay I would go back here!\"",,,,
8442940,90648581,2016-08-01,30982522,Jack,"We had a wonderful experience in Charlestown at this airbnb blocks from the Bunker Hill monument . It is located close to the northend of Boston. In fact, a pleasant, easy walk down the hill from the Bunker monument, and then across the Charles River, puts you in the midst of the italian restaurant district. By the way, the Boston skyline is visible all the way. The location was perfect for us, as it was off the busy grid of Boston, yet we could experience it with a short walk or grabbing the T into town and beyond. As for the accommodations, the bed was very comfortable: might be a new mattress. The kitchen is fully-equipped and we prepared several meals during our 5 day stay: even ate outside on the patio. Krishna and Meena were very helpful to us in the planning stages before arrival: they are very responsive when contacting via email. If traveling through Boston, you should consider this airbnb."

Great location, all the necessary amenities and easy access into the city (they are walking distance from the orange and green lines but we preferred to take the ferry from Charlestown into downtown Boston which takes about 10 min)."
Krishna was accommodating and quick to communicate (while still leaving us alone for the duration of the stay,which was nice). He let us have a late check out to accommodate our later flight out of Boston.,,,,
Would highly recommend staying here for anyone who wants to be in a quieter,"nicer area while still having easy access to all the sites.\"",,,,

4359160,22630171,2014-11-10,23338599,Chad,"This studio apartment served its purpose.  It was clean, had a kitchen and was in an excellent location just a few blocks from the T Red Line.  I love the neighborhood with the cobble sidewalks and steep streets.  The apartment could use some new blinds and perhaps some curtains to make it feel more welcoming and private.  Overall, it's a good place to crash for a couple of nights."
4359160,22986151,2014-11-19,16421349,Tim,"Sean's place is wonderfully located and convenient.  While I didn't use the kitchen, it would be great to have it for a longer stay.  The bed was comfortable and the shower very nice.  Sean was flexible with my late check-in (as my train was quite late) and I appreciated that a great deal."
4359160,23105918,2014-11-23,12033179,Jill,"Place was perfect location near Whole foods, restaurants, MEEI and Masd General and near major T stops so no car was needed, and had everything we needed. Sean was an excellent host and went above and beyond to accommodate us. Forgot my daughters favorite toy but Sean saved the day by telling us he found it and mailing it back same day."

4359160,23305978,2014-11-28,23778510,Benjamin,"This was a perfect space for my needs. A small apartment in beacon hill, it's only one room, plus a small closet and bathroom. The neighborhood is right in the middle of downtown, but the apartment doesn't get too much traffic at night, and the streets have a nice lived-in buzz about them in the morning. I can't speak to much more than that - I was only there for one night, and really only to sleep."
4359160,23388758,2014-11-30,5298663,Mathieu,"We enjoyed our stay at Sean's flat. It is very well located, right in the lovely neighborhood of beacon hill, close to the main tourist attractions and the subway red line which brings you directly to Harvard campus. However we ask Sean for an early check in, he kindly handled it for us, but apparently it had not enough time to clean the flat. Otherwise, I definitely recommend this place for your stay in Boston, and thank you Sean for your helpful tips !!"
4359160,23531849,2014-12-03,5610953,Anthony,Very accomodating.  Made himself available to help check in.  Space was clean and tidy.  Great little studio affording privacy and a homelike experience.  The neighborhood is the best in the city with historic gas lamps and winding colonial streets.  Truly a charming and unique place.
4359160,23561579,2014-12-04,24285769,Katie,Sean helped me check in on my schedule.  The neighborhood was very quaint--the place is conveniently located between two different T stops.

Sean은 airbnb를 통해서 즉각적으로 응답해주었고, 영하 20도의 날씨에는 heating system이 그렇게 따뜻하게 느껴지진 않았지만 영상의 온도에서는 매우 완벽하게 작동했습니다. Sean은 직접 침대 시트와 베게 커버를 씌워줄 정도로 자상하고 좋은 host입니다~ 덕분에 좋은 여행 할 수 있었네요. Thanks!"

It was about a 5 minute or less walk from the Charles/MGH red line and was very convenient to various locations we had to go to during our trip. The place was not hard to find and our host was only moments away if we needed anything from him. He was quick to reply to all our questions and placed us at ease. Had a great experience.

4359160,26354146,2015-02-10,13822531,Yazhou,Sean was extremely patient and helpful when my parents stayed over at his studio over the weekend. The studio is located in the heart of Boston- Beacon Hill (only 5 mins away from John Kerry's mansion!!! I wish I could live in Beacon Hill while I was in college but could never afford it). It's super convenient to get to either Cambridge or Back Bay. There's a whole foods about 5 mins away from the studio as well.

The place is a little bit smaller than some of the pictures make it seem, although it's to be expected and was still comfortable enough. Sean was great at trying to be as accommodating as possible, and the room comes situated with plenty of the usual amenities -- shampoo, bedding sheets, etc. My only critique of the place was that some of the other tenants in the apartment building were loud and making a lot of noise in the late hours of the night. That place is also somewhat older too so between the loud tenants and the creaks and groans of the building things can get pretty noisy."
4359160,26675516,2015-02-17,6371767,Luca,Sean è stato sempre molto rapido nella comunicazione e molto disponibile per l'orario di arrivo e di partenza: ci ha dato anche la possibilità di  lasciare i bagagli fino al pomeriggio del giorno di partenza.
L'alloggio è piccolo ma in posizione centrale e quindi molto comodo per spostarsi a piedi. Unici svantaggi: i rumori dei vicini,"manutenzione e pulizia necessaria.\"",,,,

Sean was helpful and easy to get in touch with cause he lives right around the corner.,,,,,

En arrivant à l'aéroport de Logan, nous n'avions plus d'incertitude et c'était bien pour nous, mais il était temps."
"L’appartement est de confort basique. Pour le couchage il s’agit d' un lit double et d'un matelas à poser par terre pour une troisième personne. Ce qui est différent de 2 lits comme indiqué dans l'annonce.\"",,,,,

4359160,29631232,2015-04-10,25471592,Rebecca,"Great little efficiency apartment for short term stays. Clean, comfortable, great location. Sean was a wonderful host - very available and flexible. I wouldn't stay here for a longer visit (not a huge amount of room to spread out), but it's perfect for just 1-3 nights, especially if you want a kitchen to use."
4359160,29795023,2015-04-12,30734776,Sharon,"Sean was a very flexible host, not bothered by a late arrival. The room location was great for our short stay,  being so close to public transportation and to a grocery store. The neighborhood is charming and felt safe. Checkout was a breeze. Thank you, Sean!"
4359160,29879013,2015-04-13,7745119,Irene,Sean was prompt to answer questions about arrival logistics. The location allowed my daughter and I to enjoy the city and visit MIT on foot. We were comfortable with the accommodations and would certainly stay here again.
4359160,30107746,2015-04-17,30978102,Keri,"Nice, clean and cozy place. Sean greeted me and we chatted briefly while I grabbed the keys. Convenient location and felt very safe. Plus all the comforts of home - right down to a hair dryer! I would stay again whenever it's available!"
4359160,30492045,2015-04-23,25937819,Ryan,"My wife, 13 month-old daughter and I stayed at Sean's studio apartment in Beacon Hill for one night.  It was a nice experience.  He was very accommodating and helped us leave our luggage with him during the day until friends picked us up.  The place had a bathtub in the bathroom, a queen size bed, a little kitchen area with a freezer/fridge, so everything you could ask for.  A very pleasant stay.  The price was very fair and would recommend this to a friend."
4359160,30598839,2015-04-25,12913771,Kacey,"This is a small and centrally located studio on lovely Beacon Hill, close to several T stops and with plenty of great restaurants nearby. We could walk anywhere. The bed is very comfortable, and the place was quiet while we were there. It's a bit small for more than one or two adults, although there's a twin folding mattress for a third person."
Sean was very accommodating,"and he made a point of checking in on how we were faring. \"",,,,
4359160,30919721,2015-04-29,25041241,Donald,Slight difficulty in gaining early access despite assurance at booking that bags could be left early. Great location but disappointed that bed linen not available at 5pm.

4359160,30976448,2015-04-30,27187356,Mackenzie,Just stayed one night but this is a cute tiny apartment! The apartment was very clean and homy. Very close to everything downtown and has some nice breakfast places and stores in walking distance. Sean was very flexible with arrival and departure times. The door happened to break by the hinge while we were there but we were still able to open and close the door so Sean gave us our privacy and fixed it later.

4359160,31431855,2015-05-05,547938,Raul,We stayed for 2 nights in Sean's appartement.
We use to travel with Airbnb and to rent apparetements and for us it has been one of the worst experiences. The good point is that the appartement is well located but the bad points are that:,,,,,
Same if its affordable,you pay for a small place ( photos shows well the size of the appartement so no complaint about it),,,,
Its much older and dirtier as it looks in the photos and has nothing on it to make it more confortable ( no coffee maker,cutlery,dishes...),,,

4359160,32308585,2015-05-17,12033179,Jill,We have stayed with Sean 5 or 6 times now.  Location is great (a couple blocks to red line station and a few blocks from mass general and meei hospitals). Sean is very nice. Place is clean.
4359160,32778184,2015-05-21,5179003,Jarrod,"Pretty good all things considered. The location really was stellar and the unit had the basics as needed. The building and apartment is really quite run-down (talk about getting what you pay for!) and the WiFi was super slow but if I had to do it again, I’d much rather pay the $123 over a $600 hotel!!"
Sean was very nice and helpful too.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
4359160,32955004,2015-05-24,25077518,Faith,"It took Sean about 20 minutes to meet up with us, which made us a bit nervous, since we called and got his voice mail several times. The neighborhood was excellent--a great location for walking everywhere. The room was okay, the bed comfortable and the space fairly clean. I would not have used the kitchen, however. The windows really needed to be washed, including the window sills, which were very grimy, and the blinds needed to be replaced--the slats were broken. The bathroom was quite old and the shower head had plastic wrapped around it. It felt like the tub was about to fall through the floor--it was very tilted and creaky. The only soap and shampoo in the room were items left behind by previous guests--rather gross to use someone else's soap, so we went and bought our own. The towels were quite threadbare and a washcloth would have been much appreciated. The door needed to be planed--you had to pull to shut it with all your might. The hallway was absolutely filthy; I don't think the carpet had been cleaned in 50 years, and the steps were extremely narrow and steep--hard to manage with heavy suitcases. We did like how quiet the neighborhood was at night, and the fact that you could open the windows. I don't know how hot it would be in summer, though."
4359160,33080265,2015-05-25,28120986,Hernan,"Sean was very helpful, gave us all the help we needed. The studio was not the same as the pictures (it had wood walls) but it was ok for one night. Great location."
4359160,33227708,2015-05-26,2172264,Caitlin,"Not the best AirBnB experience I've had, but not terrible. The location is good, but the photos listed seem to be old; the place doesn't actually look like that."
Sean is a very nice and friendly guy,"but not very organized. Trying to check in and out was a hassle we ended up waiting around outside for 30min until a neighbor finally turned up so we could drop of the keys. He's also not very responsive to emails which was a big issue for us since we were visiting from abroad and didn't have a phone. \"",,,,
4359160,33491212,2015-05-29,25240136,John & Patricia,"Sorry Sean, great location and good if you just want a bed for the night but don't expect anything else. To walk in and make our own bed and find the kitchen sink blocked was not very inviting. Yes, you did try to fix the kitchen sink but after 2 days of not using the sink we felt it was time to move so requested a refund for our 3rd night. Your only suggestion was for us to check out the Air BnB website and change our check out date, well that wouldn't work so we phoned you again and let you know whilst on the website we noticed the apartment we were put in by you was different to what we had paid for after proving this to you via photos we took, you came over and we were moved upstairs. The apartment upstairs was ok for our last night but mate you could improve by adding a few basics such as tea towel, water glass, pepper & salt shakers and check out the Air BnB site on safety suggestions for your listings."
4359160,33763611,2015-06-01,8263614,Shaila,"Sean was a fantastic host. Very accommodating to my needs (as flights were delayed coming in), super easy to coordinate with and just made the whole process very seamless. the location was fantastic, loved that its on a quiet street but so close to so many things downtown."
4359160,34113996,2015-06-05,23601095,Mirza,Did not have a chance to personally meet Sean. We arranged everyting per email and all worked out very well.
The place has a great location what was one of the reasons we booked it. In general,"the studio could use some serious renovation but more importantly a serious cleaning. \"",,,,
4359160,34530607,2015-06-09,30550225,Zoe,The neighborhood was perfect!  Exactly where we wanted to be and Sean was very accommodating.  I couldn't have asked for a better experience.

La localisation est parfaite.,,,,,
Concernant Sean nous sommes plutôt déçu. Quand nous sommes arrivés il était bien là,comme prévu. Par contre arrivé à l'appartement ses recommandations étaient plutôt floues.,,,,
Nous nous sommes rendu compte que le ménage n'avait pas été fait (touffe de cheveux dans la salle de bain,reste de nourriture dans le frigo) et qu'en plus nous n'avions pas de dessous de draps.,,,,
Il avait soit disant oublié notre arrivée alors que nous avions communiqué par mail les jours précédents. Le lendemain il devait passer pour déposer les draps et quand nous sommes rentrés le soir il n'y avait rien..,,,,,
Nous avons donc dormi nos deux nuits sur le matelas avec une housse de couette certainement pas lavée.,,,,,
L'appartement est sympas,il n'est seulement pas entretenu comme l'immeuble ce qui est dommage.,,,,
Pour notre départ Sean a été d'accord de garder nos bagages chez lui ce qui était important pour nous vu que nous prenions un bus uniquement le soir.,,,,,

4359160,35632958,2015-06-21,3188708,Christopher,"This is the second time I rented from Sean. Both times were in the same great neighborbood, Beacon Hill. One of my favorite places to be. Sean was always accommodating."
4359160,35773954,2015-06-22,10396402,Sam,Sean's place was great! You cannot beat the location for the price. Right in the Beautiful Beacon hill neighborhood you can walk to all of downtown Boston quickly. It was a perfect spot for two people for a short but sweet stay in Boston.
4359160,35914959,2015-06-23,89440,JoAnne,"Unfortunately Sean was not very good about communicating. My boyfriend and I were in town for a wedding and had been put up at a nice hotel in Copley Square, but we wanted to stay one more night and couldn't afford the hotel. I booked Sean's place a couple months in advance. I emailed Sean a couple times to see how early we could check in. He didn't email me back right away which was making me nervous. He did eventually email me back but never let me know when check in was."
I emailed him closer to arrival and the same thing happened. No immediate response and no answer of when we could check in.,,,,,
The day we were leaving the hotel I emailed Sean to say check out was around noon and we would be to his place around 12:30. After we were checked out of our hotel with our luggage in a cab and on our way,Sean emailed that a 3 pm check in would be better,but he would be there at 12:30 to check us in. If he had told me any time earlier that 3 was the check in time,we could have left our bags at the hotel.,,
When we got to his address,I called to let him know we were there. It was about 5 minutes before he came down and we were just standing in the rain. When he did come down,he didn't say hello or introduce himself. He just took us around the corner to a different address where the unit actually was.,,,
We walked up the stairs to the room,which still had the bedsheets from the last guests. Sean seemed scattered and started to pull the old sheets off the bed. He placed new sheets,folded,on the bed but didn't actually put them on.  I asked if there were towels in the bathroom.  He said he'd have to bring some.   I asked where the subway was. His directions were a little scattered so I figured I would just look it up on my phone.   When Sean was leaving to get towels,he noticed the lock on the door and the wood surrounding the lock was broken and the door couldn't close. He said he would have to run to the hardware store and asked how long we were planning on staying in the room.   We were planning on going right out. But obviously couldn't leave our stuff in an unlocked apartment. So I said we could wait an hour. The entire time I could see my boyfriend was unhappy. I was trying to stay positive but it was getting worse by the minute. After Sean left,my boyfriend booked a hotel and called a cab. I texted Sean to let him know we were leaving and where I left the keys. He never contacted me back. I politely followed up later regarding a refund. He refused

Sean was extremely responsive (and trust me, the booking was super last minute) and transparent throughout the entire trip.  I loved that fact that there were no surprises and every description Sean gave of the place was extremely accurate.  The studio was perfect for my guests and I - It was in the perfect location to explore the city (and any of its neighbors) as well as have a night out and not have to worry about spending a crazy amounts in Uber prices.  I'd definitely recommend Sean's apartment to anyone looking to enjoy everything Boston has to offer."
4359160,37441576,2015-07-07,26098680,Eric,"This is a great space in a perfect location. It is a short walk from multiple T lines, Boston Commons, or the Charles River. The space looks exactly as pictured on the site. We didn't meet Sean in person, but he was very friendly and helpful whenever We called. Check in and check out went smoothly. It could use a little vacuuming/dusting, but the space was clean enough for us. Although you should be out seeing Boston if you are staying here, the WiFi was fast enough to stream some Hulu."

4359160,38325324,2015-07-14,8492550,Robert,The interaction with Sean was great: he made us feel welcomed and showed us the studio.  We were just crashing there for the night to catch an early flight and it was perfect for that.
Location was also a huge plus.  In the middle of Beacon Hill,super easy access to restaurants,Esplanade,and shops.,,
"The apartment is definitely a \"\"college\"\"-style apartment.  It is not intended for you to sit and relax and hangout in the house.  It is intended to sleep and go out and explore Boston!  If you are looking for a 4 or 5 star hotel room",this is not an equivalent option.,,,,

Wir waren 2 1/2 Wochen in der USA unterwegs und haben jede Nacht in einer anderen Unterkunft geschlafen. Aber diese Unterkunft war die Schlechteste.

Sean a été un hôte accueillant et serviable ; il était ponctuel au rendez-vous donné et a toujours répondu rapidement à nos messages.,,,,,
Nous avons toutefois été déçus par le studio lui-même qui est vraiment très petit ; nous étions 3 et c'était vraiment juste. La propreté est loin d'être irréprochable et le coin cuisine est très rudimentaire (difficile de se préparer de vrais repas avec les ustensiles fournis).,,,,,

The apartment was all we needed for the night, but there were a few things that made me happy I was not staying in the place longer. A few items that could be easily fixed with some TLC...The shower/tub was really dirty... A little disinfectant scrubbing bubbles could easily do the trick. Also I was not too keen on sitting on a toilet in front of a window with broken/missing blinds and no curtain to make up for it, I felt very exposed. There was another window in the house that had missing blinds, it did have a curtain to make up for the missing blinds, but we couldn't close the curtain because it would block the air from the in wall AC unit."

4359160,43602366,2015-08-21,27391746,John,"The unit was not clean, in particular the bathroom and kitchen were grimy. Windows were dirty and blinds broken and needed replacing. The kitchen drawers and cupboard were full of repair materials and paint cans, so cutlery and utensils took up most of what little bench space there was. There was a paint tray and brushes on display next to the kitchen cupboard. The second lock on the door was broken and the other was flimsy, so the apartment felt quite insecure. The common entry area and stairs were putrid. Had we had more time, energy and money we would have walked out five minutes after arriving. Instead we spent as little time there as possible. We did not meet the host as he changed the arrangements."

L'accoglienza di Sean è stata cortese e puntuale anche se l'appartamento è senza grosse pretese. E' un appartamento \"\"da studenti\"\" in cui c'è tutto il necessario ma non è molto curato. Da segnalare che l'appartamento è al primo piano ma senza ascensore e le scale per accedervi sono abbastanza ripide. \""
4359160,44513748,2015-08-27,2774418,Laura,"Beautiful neighbourhood, really close to the subway and local shops/restaurants. The accommodation was a bit too small for 3 of us staying for 5 nights but would've been perfect if we had stayed for less. It could be cleaned a bit better, but for the price we paid and for using it just as a base for sleeping it was sufficient. Sean was easy to contact via email (never tried phone as it would cost a lot in charges)."
4359160,45052296,2015-08-31,26551177,John,"This place was a disgrace . You could literally see through the hole in the front door where someone had attacked the deadbolt, which didn't work. There were food scaps in both oven and microwave. When approached, Sean said he did not clean them because no one used them. There were deposits of some human fluids across the sheets, which Sean said he had cleaned. He needs to understand if the stain is still there, it is not clean."
4359160,45363232,2015-09-02,7778291,Athida,"The location is just perfect. Indeed, the studio was located near the blue line (Bowdoin) so it was really easy to reach the studio from the airport and near the red line that deserves the train station."
Besides,the studio was located near shops (whole foods...),bar and coffee.,,,
Sean was very nice,helpful and accommodating with our arrivee and check-out (7 A.M).,,,,
"Thanks again Sean!\"",,,,,
4359160,45548233,2015-09-04,17751673,Arron,"Great location in the heart of Boston. The studio is a little more dated now than the pictures show and quite dirty (mainly the floors) in all honesty. That said, Sean was a nice and accommodating guy, and easy to contact during our stay. Would recommend for a short stay!"
4359160,45920297,2015-09-07,16514397,Donna,I'll get the good points out of the way first as it won't take long: great location and a reasonably comfortable mattress.
Now for some of the many,many bad points. Sean (at least I assume it was Sean - he didn't introduce himself properly) didn't have a key. The previous guests had left his only key in the apartment. To give you some idea of the security of the place,"Sean was able to walk up the fire escape and force open a window to get the keys. He then disappeared to the hardware store to get some new keys cut. On Sean's return he finally let us in and \"\"cleaned\"\" the apartment whilst we waited. Cleaning constituted changing the towels and bedding and",after some prompting that he probably ought to clean the bathroom,he ran the shower for a bit and tried to look busy with a cloth on the floor tiles. This wasn't sufficient to remove the previous guests' pubes from the shower and toilet seat but unfortunately I didn't realise that until he had left.,
The rest of the apartment is equally squalid. I can just about ignore the shabbiness at this price point but the dirt is inexcusable. The bed genuinely smells of cheese,presumably because there is no mattress protector and the duvet has never been washed. I'm trying not to think about it too much as I lay here drafting this review. The window blinds have chunks missing from them so wave to the folks over the road whilst sat on the loo.,,,,
No tea towels,sharp knives or washing up liquid and only half a loo roll. A crockery drying rack magically appeared half way through our stay... at least I assume it was magic because I didn't receive notification from Sean that he needed to enter.,,,,
"I've stayed in many Airbnb places of varying quality. This is by far the worst. Avoid at all costs.\"",,,,,
4359160,46247741,2015-09-08,13567739,James,"This property has a lot of potential. As a single guy, it was fine. It would be ok for a couple, but be aware a 3rd person would get a compact fold-out bed. The apartment is a bit dated but the price reflects the condition.   Still, I found the toilet & sink to be clean, and the sheet, blanket, and towels all looked washed.  The shower had some weathered grout & caulk but the tub was clean enough with plenty of hot water. There is a full refrigerator, small electric stove, and microwave but no TV. So plan on steaming on the included Internet. You can pack in your own food and drinks. The unit has a hot water kettle but you'll need to bring in tea bags, coffee & filters, and any other staples you might desire. I didn't notice pots or pans but I saw some mugs & glasses. All in all, it reminded me of a college dorm room which happens to be in a great neighborhood. I will consider this in the future but will arrive with a few more provisions. While I ran into a couple of snafus, Sean worked it all out. He's a busy guy so contact him ahead of time and stay in contact if anything doesn't work out."
4359160,46383969,2015-09-10,37799466,Meiling,"The transportation of Sean's house is absolutely convenient, and we three girls had great time stay at his house. The location has changed and Sean tried to give me instruction to get the keys to the new location but I failed to find it due to my broken cellphone. But Sean still showed up and gave us the keys, it's really kind of him."
The house is quite old and historic,walking up the hill to reach the house,,,,

Sean gave me precise direction of the way,"very helpful.Thank you very much!\"",,,,
4359160,47633950,2015-09-21,28748367,Melissa,"I can deal with the fact that large parts of the blinds were missing from the bathroom window, that there was a hole in the front door near the deadbolt, that there was a fold out futon on the floor for the third person, a plastic baggie tied around the shower head, and an empty TP roll in the bathroom windowsill. What I cannot deal with is filth. This place was disgusting. The pictures shown aren't accurate. There is no nice area rug, coordinating sheets, bathroom rug or nice towels as shown. The futon mattress provided was covered in leaves, clumps of hair and dirt. No fitted sheet was provided for it either, so basically we had to drape a sheet that hung onto the dirty floor over it. There was no top sheet on the bed, which means we had to use the comforter if we wanted warmth. The shower curtain liner had disgusting mold all over it and the shower didn't drain, which means that you were standing in ankle deep water while showering. Additionally, three and only three towels were provided. No hand towels, wash cloths or spares…I’m one to give credit where credit is due though, and I will say that this was a really nice location in a cool neighborhood. The convenience of the lock bock to get the keys and drop them off was also really nice and seamless."
4359160,48371890,2015-09-26,27314365,Michael,"This was our first use of airbnb, but we had heard good things from friends. Boston hotels are very expensive. The selection of this location was by luck, just looking at a map and trying to determine where we might be close to the sites. We found Sean very responsive. You do need to message thru the airbnb site and not text messaging until you check in it seems."
We contacted Sean a few days before left California,we were expecting to stay on Irving street,but  Sean he said the address was actually a street over,we started to wonder if we had made a mistake,were we getting the same room as shown in the photos. But his reputation seemed solid,so we just trusted the airbnb program and Sean. It all worked out just fine. Everything Sean stated was accurate and when we had a problem with the drain in the shower
This turned out to be a perfect location for us. Our Daughter is in graduate school in Connecticut and Sean had no problem with her staying with us a night,he even had a foldout mattress for her. It is very close to the subway stations; blue line coming in from the airport and the red line going to Cambridge (Harvard) and downtown Boston. Starbucks,restaurants,sandwich shops,CVS,Rite Aid are minutes away on foot. Boston Commons is about a 15 minute walk away along Charles Street with the original Cheers bar and Freedom Trail close by. From Boston Commons you take the green line out to Fenway park for a Red Sox game. No parking though
As an aside,we hade never been to Boston before. We found the people very polite and courteous. When we had our map out,people would stop and ask us if we needed help.,,,
Drivers are maniacs though as are pedestrians walking against traffic. Not a policeman to be found. Subways are terrific,they go everywhere and are safe.,,,,
We would definitely stay here again.,,,,,

4359160,49417364,2015-10-04,26978907,Janine,"We picked up the key after directions from Sean by email.  We never met Sean.   The good things about this room were the location, the price, the comfortable queen bed, and the hot water shower.  The negative things about this room were the creepy dirty stairs up to the room, the dirty windows and broken blinds, no light in the bathroom, the mattress on the floor was the second bed (which was okay) but we had to chase up bedding.  A stained duvet was in the cupboard.  We were sent down into a creepy basement laundry for sheets.  No tea towel was provided.  The picture is actually how it is but you can't see much in the picture.   The accommodation was bearable for two nights and as I said it was in a great location."

4359160,49757497,2015-10-06,5056421,Maryanne,Boston apartment
Apartment in a great location and only 5 min walk from station. Sean communicated well via email. The entrance to this apartment is quite shabby but we understand that it's a common area and Sean doesn't have a great deal of control over this although if it were my Airbnb I would make an effort to clean it a little. Its on the 2nd floor and there is no lift so may be difficult for some with large luggage. Although the studio is comfy enough it could do with some TLC. The blind in the bathroom is all broken and doesn't afford you full protection from outside which I found uncomfortable. The dead bolt on the door is completely missing,just a hole in the door and we felt the small door knob snib was not enough for us to feel secure leaving valuables behind. The bed was comfy and room spacious enough for two people. The towels were clean but they were very tatty with bleach marks and frayed edges. There was no tea towel to dry dishes and more importantly no hot water in the kitchen which makes me wonder about the cleanliness of crockery. There is a hot tap but no water comes out when you turn it. The kitchen draws were full of junk and it had minimal utensils.,,,,
"Other airbnb's we have stayed at have supplied some tea bags or coffee which this did not have so remember to bring your own. The neighbours were very noisy when using the common area and walls and ceilings paper thin. Remember to bring ear plugs. The studio needs a good clean. Dusty under the bed and there is mould around the bath. Also there was hair clogged in the bath drain. We were due to spend another three nights here upon our return to Boston but decided to cancel. This accommodation may suit backpackers but unfortunately did not suit us. We have travelled extensively over the years and sampled many types of accommodation so don't feel we are being fussy. \"",,,,,
4359160,50160868,2015-10-10,33249994,Yumiko,Airbnbを知ったのは今回の旅を計画しているときでした。ホテル代がびっくりするほど高いボストンで どうにか立地が良く安価に泊まれるところはないものだろうか。。 と インターネットであれこれ検索していた時にこのサイトを見つけました。写真がとても素敵なサイトだな が 私の第一印象。そしてだんだんと Aiebnbを利用してみたくなってきました。初めての利用で、しかも異国... LET'S TRY!!
ホストとメールを交わしたりしている間に、ボストンにいる友達に会いに行くような気持になってきました。いつもの旅準備とチョット違うワクワク感でした。果たして部屋にたどり着けるだろうかーという不安を抱えながらボストンビーコンヒルへ。自転車に乗って現れたホストを見たときは 「やったー」という感じでした。,,,,,
部屋は高価なホテルに比べると 不足なところが多いです。でもボストンに住む友達のアパートに泊めてもらってる という感覚があり、普通の旅行者以上にボストンにちかづけている感じを味わえたような気がします。ありがとう Sean!,,,,,

Sean kam innerhalb von 5 Minuten mit einem Ersatzschlüssel und hat uns alles gezeigt. Natürlich ist das keine Luxusunterkunft und alles etwas verwohnt, aber die Lage mitten in Beacon Hill ist super und man kann alle relevanten Punkte in Boston zu Fuß erreichen. Dafür ist das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis absolut stimmig."

This neighborhood is VERY expensive to stay in. This apartment reflects this. While the room is no 4 star hotel by any stretch it is clean and serviceable. No problems with the bathroom or anything else. It's small and spartan but given the location it is a decent value. Location,location,"location...\"",,,
4359160,51530744,2015-10-21,40572089,Farhat,Our experience in obtaining the keys and finding the apartment were difficult. We had to call Sean to get more clarification and help us out.
The building is very old. The staircase leading to tell apartment is dirty and smells.,,,,,
The apartment is small just right for people who do not want to spend time on the room and don't bother about other necessities.,,,,,
I would say ideal for single boys or girls/ Students/ sole travellers. Not recommended for couples.,,,,,
"Good things about the place is the location which is not very far from the station.\"",,,,,
4359160,52475407,2015-10-30,32250825,Lisa,Even before we got there we were confused by Sean telling us that the place we are staying at is not at the advertised address.
The studio was filthy and  dusty!,,,,,
The very steep stairs are hard to contend with if you have any heavy luggage and the whole entrance area is dirty.,,,,,
We came in when we said we will,but the place was not ready. About 20 minutes later Sean appeared with creased,dusty linen that he left us to put on the beds,making us feel he was doing us a favour.,,
The hot water in the kitchen doesn't work,the drawers and small closet are full of Sean's junk,so even the little storage space there is is thaken!,,,
Most of the small amount of cutlery is plastic and dirty.,,,,,
The door doesn't lock properly,because where a bolt should be there is a hole in thw door.,,,,
The kitchenette is so tiny that don't ever plan to cook there,even if you could scrape by with the utensils that are supplied.,,,,
The bed creaks and the neighbours can be easily heard through the thin walls.,,,,,
There are no cleaning tools,so we had to stay in the dirt.,,,,
"The only saving grace of it is the great location.\"",,,,,

4359160,53674364,2015-11-11,25892846,Adam,"I had an excellent experience with this listing. Sean gave extremely clear and effective instructions, including how to get to the place from the airport, the exact modes of transportation to take, how to collect the key and all of the pertinent information that would allow you to have a wonderful and comfortable stay in his space."
As far as the actual space,the bed was comfortable,the bathroom was stocked,the internet was super fast and I slept very well as there was minimal noise from the street and neighbors (I'm a light sleeper,so that says a lot). It's not the most modern looking place,"but it will absolutely serve you well and is located in a very ideal area. He gets my sincere and genuine recommendation.\""

I wouldn't stay here again and I definitely wouldn't try to have 3 people stay,as I planned to when I booked the place. The listing states that there are two beds but that is just not true. There is a folded up mattress pad on the floor next to the actual bed,for which there is no bedding provided (there isn't even a top sheet for the actual bed and I bet money that comforter isn't getting washed between every visitor). To list this as a two-bed apartment is lying. My friend had to stay with another friend.,,,
Also - there is no deadbolt on the door. The apartment door is the thickness of a closet door and there is just a hole where there once was a deadbolt,but it only locks like an interior door would; if someone outside had a key,they could let themselves in at any time (when you are out and your belongings are there,when you are asleep,etc - who knows?). It's really not a safe situation.,
I'm not complaining about the fact that the place was grungy,even though it was,"both inside and out. Sometimes that is the case with AirBnb. The problem is that the place is not secure and that the listing is dishonest about the number of beds and the \"\"essentials\"\" it claims to provide.\"",,,

4359160,59820487,2016-01-16,30888882,Delphine,"L'appartement est bien situé dans Boston pour visiter et découvrir la ville à pied. Malheureusement, nous avons été très déçus de l'accueil : Sean nous avait donné rendez-vous à l'appartement pour le check in à notre arrivée de l'aéroport mais il n'est jamais venu ! Nous l'avons attendu un long moment dans la rue (en plein mois de janvier !!!)... il a fallu que j'insiste plus que lourdement pour que sa compagne (?) daigne venir nous ouvrir et nous donner les clés (alors que manifestement, elle était à 2 minutes à pied de l'endroit où nous attendions)."
L'appartement est bien situé et bien chauffé mais assez ancien,pas vraiment propre et mal équipé. Le problème de la fenêtre de la salle de bains mentionné dans les précédents commentaires n'a toujours pas été réglé...,,,,
Bref,notre séjour a été agréable parce que la ville de Boston est magnifique mais certainement pas grâce à l'accueil de Sean ! C'est dommage. Je pense que s'il était venu,avait envoyé quelqu'un,ou nous avait au moins prévenu qu'il ne viendrait finalement pas au RDV comme il s'y était personnellement engagé,"nous n'aurions pas eu à attendre une demi heure dans la rue et dans le froid ... et le souvenir de ce séjour aurait été bien meilleur !\"",
4359160,60212955,2016-01-20,47149704,Jenny,"This place was perfect for what we were looking for. We were primarily looking for a place to sleep and shower, as we were out most of the day the days we were there. The location is fantastic, especially for the price. We were able to walk almost anywhere we wanted to go within 20-30 minutes and the neighborhood is adorable, felt very safe, and was very quiet when we were there. Sean communicated about how to enter the apartment with great detail and that part of the experience went very smoothly. I would only recommend for people staying here to make sure you bring your own toiletries - towels are provided but it seemed like toiletries that were there may have been left by previous visitors. Very minor, just good to know! Thanks for a great stay - would definitely return!"

4359160,78405544,2016-06-06,26272530,Berkley,"The location is good and the keys were easy to find. However, we did not stay in this apartment as we did not feel safe when we arrived. The front door was broken and did not have a functioning deadbolt (the door was also chipped away as if broken into). Even with the knob locked it could easily be pushed open. There were no towels, dirty dishes, and overall did not seem clean.  This apartment actually looks much less appealing than in the pictures. I contacted this host upon our arrival and received no response.  When we left and requested a refund, this host told me that he doesn't always wash the sheets/towels and refused to listen to any of my complaints about the other things, blaming me for them instead. Thank goodness Airbnb has great customer service because this is the worst listing I have ever booked."
I'm sure this host will reply with a nasty response,but I think that people should be aware that this listing is grossly misrepresented. Look back through this host's reviews from the past year - this problem has been going on for almost that long and he still hasn't bothered to fix the door.,,,,

Muchas de las atracciones de Boston pueden hacerse a pie desde allí. Si bien en otra disposición de  muebles, las fotos describen perfectamente el alojamiento. A Sean no lo conocimos, pero nos dio instrucciones por mail de dónde retirar y dejar las llaves, algo muy cómodo al llegar y nos dejó permanecer por una hora más sin ningún problema (ya que nuestro vuelo salía por la tarde). Lo único negativo para observar es que la entrada al edificio era incómoda y estaba muy sucia. El primer día tuvimos un problema con el WiFi, pero avisamos a Sean y lo solucionó con celeridad."
4359160,79091871,2016-06-11,45948354,Sirui,A really nice host! Great place!
4359160,79936468,2016-06-15,39302907,Kevin,Sean sent instructions in advance that were easy to follow to access the apartment. And it was exactly what I was looking for! Great location too.
4359160,80291473,2016-06-17,59904291,Jackie,Sean made us feel like family.  The neighborhood was exactly as he described.

4359160,83960365,2016-07-04,28978977,Tammi,"We enjoyed our stay in Boston very much. Lots to see and lots to do. `Apartment is situated in Beacon Hill which is a short walk from most of the things you would want to see and do in Boston. Apartment itself is much as you see in the pictures. Its small, but then we knew that when we booked. It would benefit from a bit of spring clean but if you are looking for a base as we were then it was perfect. We did notice that one of the locks on the door was damaged but that said whist in Boston we never once felt unsafe and because its in apartment block, it felt safer still. Would use again."

4359160,87331166,2016-07-19,4211720,Olivia,"Great location, within walking distance to restaurants, stores, pharmacy, Mass Hospital, the metro, etc. Apartment is small, has just the basic items for anyone who is in Boston for one or two nights: a comfortable bed, clean sheets, a clean towel, good lighting, AC, wi-fi. You can get good coffee and food just about a block or two from the building."
4359160,89526172,2016-07-28,55540848,Antonella,"L'appartamento è  ubicato in zona tranquilla, in posizione comoda per i mezzi pubblici e anche per arrivare a piedi nella zona centrale. Purtroppo è molto piccolo e va bene a malapena per una coppia pochissimo per tre persone anche se ci siamo aggiustati, l'interno era pulito ma va curato molto di più. L'edificio rispetto ad altri nella zona è fatiscente, con scale veramente strettissime. Non fa una buona impressione appena entrati. Avendo trovato facilmente le chiavi come da indicazioni, con Sean non ci siamo sentiti ma è stato comunque disponibile."
4359160,90661851,2016-08-01,59481763,Stacey,"The room was MUCH smaller than anticipated. From the photos it looks like the table was in the middle of the all ready tiny kitchen, which is inaccurate from the actual layout when we stayed."
Its a small studio,not for more than 3 people,SNUG.,,,
The sheets,blankets and towels smelled musty. Every night we stayed I kept telling myself to call Sean for new sheets,but we were up and busy by 8am,so I never got around to it. But the smells were very bad. The shower was very dirty,it appeared like someone took a shower and forgot their used toiletries scattered in the restroom and left the tub dirty.,
We wished we knew the apartment was up a narrow stairway on the 2nd floor on a different block than advertised. It wasn't a big deal,but we did have a stroller we had to keep lugging up a smelly,narrow stairway. If any of us had any handicaps,those stairways and doors would have been an issue. Also,didn't feel secure with a faulty one lock door. I wish the deadbolt worked.,
I only received one e-mail regarding check in. No response when I kept Sean posted about our flights. Never tried to contact him after that.,,,,,
The location is GREAT. But the apartment itself is VERY outdated,dingy,smells a bit,and small.,,
I wouldn't stay at this apartment again. If you can find something in the same area,that would be best. The location was very awesome! That's all this apartment has going for it.,,,,

4359160,90982021,2016-08-03,60812664,Stephanie,It is in a great neighborhood. Very close to everything. We enjoy walking to the park and the restaurants. The apt is a small studio perfect for two.
4359160,91751257,2016-08-06,56580354,Jeff,What a great location!  A couple of blocks from Boston Commons and all the historic locations in town.  Place was exactly as advertised.  A bit on the small side but a fantastic home base for walking all over Boston.  Definitely recommend!!

One of the best things for me is how quiet it was even in the daytime. Coded door locks so no need for keys, my belongings were always safe and Andre and his wife are really good host.

1128894,12799133,2014-05-11,14512512,Andy,"Steve was a very accommodating host. Between him and his friend Kahlio, they can help navigate the city for you. Kahlio helped me get my car out of the city impound lot. He searched for my car while I was at work. Steve has friends in realty and renting that can help you find a place to live. Accommodations are very clean. This isn't the Four Seasons, but you are getting ripped off by some host in the city. Public transportation is 3 blocks away which connects you with the whole metropolitan area. Red line, which runs very frequently gets you into Cambridge in 25 min and Harvard in 30. This is an excellent choice for long term or short term temporary housing."

Almost all a tourist's needs will be satisfied immediately when Steve was asked to. After we put down our luggage, Steve's friend, Klio(I'm not sure the spelling is correct or not, sorry), led us to see the environment around the house and meet some good neighbors. And the location is good to us because the house is close to the Fields Corner Station."
We would have bought some food from supermarket nearby and cooked it,but soon we realized that's not necessary. As an Asian you could always find a great restranut on the street. We visited the same Vietnam restaurant four times.,,,,
The bed is large,"but too soft for us. That's totally not a problem because we were still in good spirits and had good days in Boston. \"",,,,

I declined and ended up getting a tow truck ride to the house where Steve was waiting to help quickly unpack my loaded down car so the driver could tow it to a local mechanic.  Steve keeps the house very tidy and is always available to address any issues.   During my three month stay I met travelers from every continent.  There are six bedrooms, so I was always meeting new and interesting people.   It's truly been a phenomenal experience.  Would definitely return."

We did not know if we were staying with a family or with other travelers but we later discovered that multiple guests stay each night and its a traveler home, not a personal residence. The room was as pictured - convenient for the two of us!  We loved the guestbooks and all of the travel info all around the home to assist guests in discovering all things Boston. Very pleasurable stay."

The host was nice. He offered a discounted room due to the picture being different than the booking. We met him on our way out and he was nice and offered some recommendations for breakfast. While not too close to the heart of the city, it is fine to stay for a stop over."

1128894,91148525,2016-08-04,45101131,Brigitte,"The house is very old. The neiborhood was ok; we didn't always feel safe, the stores were pretty far by walk, it wasn't very easy to park and it takes a 10-15 minutes walk to get to the subway.  We though the house was far from downtown, even if the access was easy. It was around half an hour to get downtown. Sometimes, we just took the car to get downtown because it was faster."
About the house; the room was very big and clean. We had to share a bathroom with other renters,so sometimes,it took us more time to prepare. The kitchen is very small and not easy to cook in it. The freezer wasn't working proprely,so our icepacks wasn't cold enough for our coolers. Steve apologize about the situation. He is a very nice host,wanted us to have a nice stay.,
In resumé,I wouldn't personnaly go back there,but it can be a nice stay.,,,

That said, his communication was great, the place was easy to get into, and a good deal.  It's nothing fancy, but very clean and has everything one would need for a night or two.  Parking was a little tricky, but I'm sure part of that had to do with the fact that we arrived late.  Last but not least, just be aware that while in good proximity to the city, this is not a great part of town.  Overall, perfect if you need a quick place to stay and don't want to break the bank."
1128894,92049697,2016-08-07,46076032,Adam,"Steve's house was very clean and cozy. Whole accommodating process went smoothly despite the later check-in. Unfortunatelly, we haven't met Steve in person which was mainly our fault since we had been  travelling all the time. The neighborhood is probably not the safest one in the city but we didn't experience any serious problem. The connection to dowtown is very convenient. In general, we enjoyed our stay."
1128894,92748233,2016-08-09,70819663,Marc-André,"Steve was an excellent host! He was available and present but he was also respectful of the visitors privacy. Room was clean and had every essential services, plus a TV."
1128894,93269424,2016-08-12,61598245,Kelsi,Absolutely loved this air bnb! Steve is a wonderful host and the room/house were great. They are clearly careful to consider needs and accommodations. My only regret is that we didn't get a chance to write in the guestbook and share how much we loved staying there. Thank you Steve for a great stay!
1128894,96360303,2016-08-22,189178,Gloria,"Steve was an amazing host. He was readily available by phone or email, visited the house daily to check if everything was okay or if we needed anything."
The location is convenient,close to the T Redline,about a 10 minute walk to restaurants (including McDonalds and Thai) and shopping in an interesting,multicultural neighbourhood.,,
The house description was as advertised. The bed and pillows were comfortable,and room window air conditioners helped us through the hot muggy summer weather. The washrooms were up to date and had full size enclosed showers. We had full use of the fully equipped kitchen. There was an area to relax and socialize.,,,,
We interacted with most of the other guests,and it felt like home.,,,,

7225376,38074866,2015-07-12,36715398,Rachael,"We had such a great time in Boston this weekend thanks to the convenience and comfort of staying at this listing. It is a pretty large room in a quiet suite very close to the orange line. It was clean, comfortable, easy to find, and Feng was extremely accommodating to our schedule. He also quickly answered any questions that came up during our stay. Would definitely stay here again!"
7225376,38929706,2015-07-19,9231447,Luisa,Our arrival was smooth thanks to hosts flexibility for checkin although it wasn't him but other guest at the house who let us in.
Inside the house bathrooms,kitchen and room where not clean at all.  Amenities like towels where not provided.,,,,
Location is good,walking distance everywhere. It also has convenient Dunkin Donuts,"market and train stop near the house. \"",,,
7225376,39449567,2015-07-23,17825125,Verena,"The appartment is in a very nice neighbourhood close to the T (Subway) wich is really convenient. Feng was really helpful and flexible, super wifi, AC and kitchen can be used. I would definitely stay another time there."
7225376,40149090,2015-07-28,4059280,Davyd H,"Feng's place was very convenient and very spacious. Nice, quiet neighborhood.  2 minute walk to the T and 10 minute ride to major attractions."
11371205,74469765,2016-05-15,69983886,Bill,"This being my first time using Airbnb, I had a lot of question - Paige was extremely responsive and welcoming during the whole process."
Her instructions were clear and concise,which allowed us to enjoy our stay worry free.,,,,
"The location can't be beat and the place was immaculate. There was more than enough room for our group of 5.  \"",,,,,
11371205,76279090,2016-05-26,71500688,Khemchandra,This was my first time using Airbnb. Paige answered all our questions quickly and gave us all the information we needed. She really helped make the experience using the service a pleasant one. The rooms were just as she described and were very comfortable. There are many restaurants and shops within walking distance of the listing.
11371205,77639991,2016-06-02,31627650,Gaël,Tout était parfait ! Paige a été super à tous les niveaux.
11371205,77798872,2016-06-03,20374990,Michael,"Great Stay, Perfect Description, wonderful apartment, the right spot to explore Boston.. That's prefect Airbnb.. Thank you Paige!"
11371205,78794038,2016-06-09,38610526,Chryssi,"Paige was a very responsive host and her place was convenient for our group. We did not use the kitchen facilities, but the kitchen looked relatively well stocked. I wish I had known that it was two very close together but separate units ahead of time (and only one had a bathroom), but everything worked out in the end. The location was near everything we needed it to be, and the sleeping accommodations and bathroom facilities were clean and comfortable."
11371205,79599197,2016-06-13,70965745,Francie,"Paige made it very easy to get into the unit and although we didn't originally have all of the bedding we needed, Paige was very accommodating and brought by additional bedding almost immediately. She was also quick to answer questions and even allowed a late check-out so we didn't have to lug our bags across town for brunch."
11371205,80933413,2016-06-20,32051244,Park,Great apartments and just as described. The location couldn't be beat.
11371205,82778150,2016-06-29,80448451,Deane,Paige was VERY responsive to our last minute booking.  The location is incredible and we loved being able to walk around to shops & having the coffee shop downstairs.
11371205,83239030,2016-07-02,71682273,Christy,The house and location were perfect.  The accommodations were clean the view was great and we couldn't have had a better time.
11371205,84279510,2016-07-06,76978400,Nicola,The location of the apartment was perfect and it was easy to explore all Boston has to offer from there. The apartment was ideal for our group of 5 people to be comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it!
11371205,84589625,2016-07-08,10109086,Katherine,"I stayed with my family at Paige's place on Newbury St during the first week of July.  First of all, to be able to find a place during 4th of July week in Boston for one night was incredible, and the fact that it could hold our whole group (5 people, but in fact more could sleep very comfortably) for a good price was truly fantastic."
The arrival and departure are made super-easy with the lockbox,and Paige's instructions and communications were always clear and prompt (she was great!).  We used one of the air mattresses and it was very comfortable,and we didn't have any problems with noise from the street (although it was the middle of the week).  The coffee shop,Wired Puppy,below the apartment opens early (6:30am) and has really good coffee.,
All of Boston is within easy walking distance of the apartment and its location on Newbury St is fantastic!  So many shops,cafes and restaurants close by.  We walked to Fenway Park and it was a lovely short mile (so this is a great place if you are going to a game).  We didn't really have need for the kitchen,but we appreciated that there was a full one available.  The bathroom worked well and beds were very comfortable.,,,
The set-up with the two entrances but only one bathroom is slightly strange at first but we had no problems with it,and in fact it allowed for lots of privacy.  There is only one other apartment on that (top) floor and so it's not as though you are passing a lot of other residents as you go in and out of the two rooms - in fact,we didn't see anyone else during our stay.,,,
"We had a wonderful night here and the only bad part was that we couldn't stay longer!\"",,,,,
11371205,85586872,2016-07-12,54019989,Celia,"Great location, but remember it is a busy and noisy street. Slightly a strange set up with two apartments combined to form the one place so you need to move between the two parts via an open hallway but it was easy enough to do. Apartment was very spacious and host was very responsive to queries."
11371205,87635535,2016-07-21,77319986,Kirsten,"Great location in Boston!  Love the neighborhood.  The layout is very odd - with two separate entrances and the hallway is shared by another renter.  There were times when we thought our family was in hallway, but it was the neighbors.  My 75 year old parents counted all 35 of stairs up to the units.  It is also a very noisy street, with both rooms having lots of loud street activity.  Paige was extremely responsive and clear with communications."
11371205,91357895,2016-08-05,37139795,Annie,"Paige was quick to respond, the location was great.  The setup is a bit unconventional with access to the rooms via a public hallway, however, the spaces were large and accommodated our family of 5 nicely."
11371205,92653642,2016-08-09,9611394,Amanda,Location Location Location! Newbury Street is amazing! This listing is steps away from so many things to do. You can either walk everywhere you need to go or even a quick cab ride away. The coffee shop down stairs is the BEST (Wired Puppy)! Beds are super comfy too! We enjoyed this place!
11371205,93236687,2016-08-12,65983302,Mary,"Great location, easy to find, funky layout of the apartment, great AC, clean."
11371205,94776720,2016-08-17,3883562,Daliah,"This property is super clean and in a great part of town. As mentioned in Paige's description and in other reviews, the layout is unique and somewhat odd. The property is in an office building, and there are two doors to what seem like vacant offices, that you access from the main hallway. One contains a bathroom, the other does not, so in order to use the bathroom if sleeping in the suite without it, you have to exit the suite, walk into the common hallway, and enter the other suite with key. It works for a night or two given the location and how clean the space is (Paige is a great host) but it's important to be aware of the setup as it is a bit unusual. No complaints otherwise, would stay again."
11371205,96137973,2016-08-21,23420286,Michael,"Cannot beat the location. Lovely apartment and within distance to a lot of great bars, restaurants and landmarks."
11371205,96425555,2016-08-22,38958478,Pearse,"Had a wonderful stay on Newbury street for the end of our American holiday, the apartment was great clean, spacious and inviting! The dual apartment system was a little odd but was totally manageable! Paige was very responsive during our stay and had no issues"
12233830,70018232,2016-04-15,2134782,Shlomi,"Couldn't have been happier. The apartment was well renovated, very clean and convenient to great spots. The kitchen was stocked with all the basics and a huge grocery store was around the corner so we were able to easily cook at the house. Estee also provided some great local recommendations. Wine, snacks, coffee and games were great extras. Uber ride to downtown was $8. Would most definitely stay here again."
12233830,70649304,2016-04-19,37567875,Jessica,"The apartment is very nice- as described and very convenient. The real superstar of the listing though is the host; Estee was  phenomenal. She was very responsive and even let us know when she might not be able to be reached for a short duration of time. She provided great recommendations and tips for getting around. We had a MINOR issue, which she went out of her way to resolve very quickly."
Both bedrooms are a good size,and one has a lovely vanity. Everything is brand new - bathroom and kitchen. Estee had the kitchen stocked with staples (salt,pepper,olive oil,ketchup) and treats too! There are so many details throughout the place where she goes above and beyond. Parking on the street was easy. We hardly needed to move the car though because there was so much within walking distance. The description of a 10 minute walk to the T is accurate.,
100% would stay here again. Thank you for a wonderful stay,"Estee!\"",,,,
12233830,70882891,2016-04-21,68058568,Khileigh,"This is a brand new gorgeous place, very clean, bright and welcoming. Estee especially knows how to make guests comfortable, there were many thoughtful touches and she recommended a delicious Indian restaurant.    There is a supermarket within 5 minutes walking distance and we used Uber to get around - downtown Boston took less than 15 minutes. Best place I have stayed in so far. Thank you Estee!"
12233830,71725720,2016-04-28,43639502,Rajesh,Estee and Josh are great hosts. Very welcoming. Made us feel like we were staying with long time friends. Apartment very centrally located. Off street parking surprisingly easy (for Boston). Loads of restaurants within walking distance
12233830,74530572,2016-05-15,58310922,Stephenie,"Estee was super sweet and so very accommodating! The apartment was nicely renovated and the kitchen had all our basic needs + treats as well! My family and I stayed here because of a college graduation and because street parking in front of her place was easy and everything was within walking distance, it made our stay a lot easier! Would definitely stay here again!"
12233830,75258718,2016-05-20,17621596,Ellie,"House was great, and Estee was very responsive! Even left us delicious treats and a bottle of wine. :) Only tricky thing was loading/unloading equipment on the one way street. Nice apartment."
12233830,75880263,2016-05-23,5377271,Sean,"Estee was fantastic! She was quick to respond to any questions and was very kind and thoughtful. There were plenty of nice amenities in the apartment to make us feel welcomed. She truly put in a lot of effort to make our stay as great as possible. The apartment itself is quite comfortable and is furnished stylishly. The apartment is conveniently located near many awesome restaurants. I would highly recommend this apartment for anyone looking for a place to stay in Boston. Having Estee as a host definitely made our stay in her apartment seamless, she paid attention to every detail. Thanks again!"
12233830,78381063,2016-06-06,67742093,Avian,"This place was great for our weekend getaway in Boston! We did have a little delay checking in, but that was due to the previous tenants checking out late and therefore delaying the cleaning lady. Other than that hiccup it was the perfect location for us. Everything we needed in the house was provided, I even appreciated the bottle of wine and chocolates. Hope to be able to come back and visit again!"
12233830,78915413,2016-06-10,33771162,Dana,"\"Estee had a lovely bottle of wine and chocolates waiting for us. However, the best way I can describe this apt is tiny.  The bathroom is tiny, the living area is tiny.  It was incredibly hot that day and the two small window units (only in one bedroom and the one in the kitchen that didn't work well at all) did absolutely nothing to cool off the apt. despite the apt's very small size.  It was about 90 degrees inside the apt, so our first night was miserable. We contacted her and she did bring an additional unit for one of the bedrooms however the kitchen/sitting area was still very hot our entire stay.  This apt is not suitable for a family, it may have worked had it only been my husband and I but then it still would have been cramped.  There is a tiny area that is the sitting area which one can only assume is suppose to be the living room but our family four couldn't all sit together and relax, watch TV after a day of sight seeing and the bedrooms were too hot.  The bathroom and kitchen have recently been renovated and were nice.  The washer and dryer and are in the basement that is a dirt floor and has trash and building materials everywhere.  It was like meandering through a salvage yard to get to the washer and dryer which wasn't private but shared with another apt. (though I had specifically asked about a private washer and dryer).  It is about 15 blocks from the train station which should be the best mode of transportation since on street parking can be a problem, once we found a spot we didn't move our car until we were ready to leave. It would have been nice to have a charlie card (a reusable card that you can add money to ride the train available even it didn't have a balance) because finding a charlie card turned out to be quite an ordeal so we left ours hopefully she passes it on the next person.  Overall, though Estee personally was very nice this apt didn't live up to its advertisement of \"\"spacious\"\" we were 2 adults and 2 teenagers there is no way 6 people could have stayed there.  It was quite a disappointment.\""
12233830,80731179,2016-06-19,68716785,Nadia,"Friends and I had a wonderful extended weekend in Boston! Estee was a fantastic host, providing a clean, newly renovated, and spacious apartment with thoughtful touches and was very flexible with our arrival. Estee was always quick to respond and ridiculously helpful both before and during our stay. The apartment is a ten minute walk (or a 2 minute Lyft ride) to the T and was surprisingly quiet at night during our stay. An uber ride from the apartment to Newbury Street took 10-15 minutes. I would definitely recommend Estee as a host to others looking to stay in this area!"
12233830,81302722,2016-06-22,13102015,David,"Estee is a great hostess and extremely supportive and responsive.  We really enjoyed our visit and would definitely return and recommend her place to others.  The apartment is very well furnished and well located, close to many parts of town. Estee is also perhaps the most responsive AirBnB host we have had. When we had small a problem or question, I texted her and she responded almost immediately.  And she was always very nice and positive.  Her welcome bottle of wine and chocolate we also very nice, and we could use whatever was in the kitchen, which was quite a bit if you come with nothing!  I highly recommend her and would go back to her place. Thanks, Estee!"
12233830,81448263,2016-06-23,46626188,Marsha,"Estee was the epitome of a great hostess and we loved her place. She was in touch with us multiple times before our last minute stay, which she accommodated upon request, and she checked-in often. The house was spotless. Estee left us wine, chocolates, a kitchen that had everything I could have asked for, including many more snacks, k-cups and teas than four of us could consume, and a bathroom with just as much. Special thanks for the playing cards, popcorn and Netflix. She checked in about the unit temperature a few times even though I kept telling her everything was great. We were able to stock up at the grocery store around the corner, walk to the T in about 10 minutes and also rent a Hubway bicycle right next to the apartment which was great! The area is bustling, as I expected and wanted for staying in the city, but the house was quiet and a private oasis on the inside. I really appreciated all the unexpected special touches. I have family I often visit in the Boston area and Estee's place will be my go-to from now on."
12233830,82011482,2016-06-26,77780620,Jennifer,"Estee was an awesome hostess, always asking what she can do or get for me.  The apartment was very nice and very clean."
12233830,82728304,2016-06-29,779770,Chelsea A,"Estee was an absolutely wonderful host - probably the best Airbnb hosts I've ever had the pleasure of interacting with. She really thought of everything, and even went above and beyond. She called her cable provider to add HBO so that I wouldn't miss Game of Thrones, 10 minutes before the show started! Estee is a stunning person, and anyone should be happy to stay with her!"
12233830,83037531,2016-06-30,8765481,Grace,"My stay at Estee's place was great. She was very responsive and made sure that we had everything we needed. She also added little touches like a bottle of wine and some chocolates to welcome us to her place! The apartment itself was very comfortable and very well-maintained. Estee made sure to reach out to us several times to make sure that we were comfortable and responded very quickly anytime we communicated! All in all, a great stay at a great place!"
12233830,83802450,2016-07-04,47978289,Carly,"Estee was an incredible host and went above and beyond to give us information about the city, make herself available and had the sweetest little touches that made us feel so welcomed! The place had two big room and one smaller one that was perfect just for sleeping. The kitchen area was nice. The location was great as it was like 10-15 minutes from everything! We loved it and would definitely stay here again!"
12233830,83841143,2016-07-04,14547730,Maya,"Estee's place was perfect for us. We live in Boston but my family came to visit and we ended up hanging out at Estee's place instead of mine! The house was really clean and cool and Estee was in touch daily to make sure we were happy with everything. She left wine and the kitchen had way more than we expected. We parked the car right outside the house and walked about 10 minutes to the T whenever we wanted to go downtown. The house is right next to a bus stop as well and a bike rental rack (Hubway). We went to a few of the places Estee recommended and they were all awesome- Fugakyu and Barcelona in particular. All in all Estee was a thorough, caring and sweet hostess and we look forward to booking her place again."
12233830,84458172,2016-07-07,36373069,Colleen,"Estee met us at her place upon our arrival to make sure all was OK. We requested an earlier arrival than usual and was kind enough to accommodate. The place was immaculate, kitchen stocked not only with standard kitchenware, but also snacks and necessities like coffee, creamer,  and even eggs and oatmeal. Even a bottle of wine with a welcome note."
We were worried because we forgot a hair drier. Oops! there was one there!,,,,,
Estee was unbelievably responsive to questions both before and during our brief stay. We both had tickets to the Sox game on the same evening and we met and chatted a while.,,,,,
The place is just two blocks from a large Stop and Shop,which we found convenient and availed ourselves to. The S&S is right next to the new New Balance world headquarters which has a state of the art flagship store attached,for those that are into that.,,,
"Attention to detail in the property was apparent. Personal attention to our needs vastly exceeded expectations and was really appreciated.\"",,,,,
12233830,84920605,2016-07-09,1343341,Lucas,"Estee made me feel at home even before I arrived to her exquisite apartment! She checked in with me daily to make sure I was ok, responded to my inquires within minutes, and was available to answer any questions. She is definitely the epitome of a great host!"
The apartment is wonderful. Everything is new and in great condition. I can't complain about anything,"it was a true delight!\"",,,,

The apartment can easily fit six guests,and was stocked to the brim with everything we needed,kitchen and toiletry wise. Location was fantastic as well,"a ten minute walk to great restaurants and bars in a lively area. Upon returning to Boston I wouldn't hesitate to book Estee's apartment again.\"",,

She left everything we could possibly need/want during our stay and was always quick to answer if we had any questions. There were five of us, but it still felt like we had plenty of space. The two main bedrooms are very spacious, and the third bedroom is perfect for one person to stay in. We drove downtown several times, and it seemed like a fairly easy drive-only took about 15 minutes. I would absolutely stay at Estee's place again and hope my future airbnb experiences can be as great as this one was!"

She was always available for questions and provided an immense amount of information about the neighborhood. The place itself was clean and spacious with everything you need, but the location near so many restaurants and a small park really made it great for us!"

Really easy to deal with Jonathan,who manages the listing,during check-in and out. Nice guy,laid back.,,

8734707,57095668,2015-12-21,10087477,Michael,Jonathan is a great host and his suite is so pretty and nice. I stayed there for 4 days and had a great experience. Things are clean and artsy. Completely private. The low ceiling is not an issue at all. The place looks exactly like it is in the photos. It's closed to buses and orange line which can take you to anywhere in Boston. Highly recommend the place.
8734707,59232819,2016-01-08,46244001,Sohan,"Jonathan and Celia were awesome! Jonathan personally checked me in on the first night and was easy to get a hold of. The room was kept in excellent condition and was very clean. The room/bathroom were well-stocked with essentials, which made the stay comfortable and hotel-like. Would definitely stay in the room again if I ever need a place in Boston!"
8734707,59851602,2016-01-16,52889243,Bradley,"Celia and Jonathan made me feel at home.  Both were accommodating and eager to help or lend advice as it was my first time visiting Boston.  The neighborhood seems to be on an upswing with local houses being refurbished.  Just a short walk to the T stop made getting around very easy.  I felt safe in the neighborhood walking around alone at night.  The room was clean and as described.  A few times I thought to myself, it would be nice if I remembered to bring ... and it was right there already stocked.  Thank you Jonathan."
8734707,60395503,2016-01-23,25198153,Danielle And Sam,"Jonathan and Celia were great. Jonathan welcomed me and showed me how to use the keys. I initially had some trouble turning the heat on and he was extremely responsive, and both he and Celia checked in on me to make sure I was comfortable. Celia was very friendly and great to chat with. The room is adorable and looks just like the pictures. Everything was spotless. There isn't much in the immediate vicinity, but there are some cute restaurants about a 10 minute walk away."

8734707,63372433,2016-02-22,52320673,Guillaume,This room is just awesome. The private bathroom is really cool and the fridge in the room compensate the fact that guests do not have access to the kitchen.
Moreover Johnathan and Celia are just perfect hosts and very easy going for everything: check in,check out...,,,,

8734707,67447934,2016-03-29,45745461,Erin,We had such a wonderful experience in Celia's home. Jonathan was extremely welcoming and helpful and immediately made us feel so comfortable.
The home is beautiful,new,and very clean. It easily felt like home and was in such a great location. It was maybe a 5 minute walk from Roxbury Crossing on the Orange line,which we took all over the city.,,

8734707,68690489,2016-04-06,5541212,Michele,"I had a really great stay with Jonathan and Celia. I was greeted very promptly by Jonathan, who was extremely friendly and welcoming. He also checked in with me throughout my stay to make sure all was well and to offer some really useful maps, tips on the neighbourhood and places to visit in Boston. I also had several really nice chats with Celia, who is as lovely and friendly as Jonathan. She was very warm and welcoming and also made sure that everything was ok during my stay. Even Celia's neighbour is lovely, so I can't say enough about the wonderful people you will meet if you choose to stay here. And, just as important, the room - with a sleeping alcove, sitting area and private bathroom - are also really nice. Everything was just as it looks in the photos, very clean and nicely decorated. The bed is very comfortable, there's a good wifi signal and a nice hot shower with good pressure! The room also has a mini-fridge, coffee maker (with tea and coffee!), iron, hair-dryer etc - all that you would expect to find in a hotel, but there is a more personal touch here (and much better price!!). It's a very short walk to the nearest T-station and only a 20 minute walk to really wonderful museums and gardens. All in all, I would highly recommend staying with Jonathan and Celia - lovely, personable service, a nice room, good location and great value for money."

Célia et sa famille qui m'ont acceuilli ont été charmants. La chambre est un petit cocon bien confortable, un réel plaisir durant mon séjour. Jonathan est resté en contact avec moi pour savoir si tout se passait bien. Je tiens à remercier tout le monde d'autant d'attention. La ville de Boston vous acceuille à bras ouvert, c'est un exemple à suivre pour nous européens!!"
8734707,70158323,2016-04-16,20122748,Hillary,"I had a wonderful stay! Celia and Jonathan were both very welcoming. The space is private, comfortable, and has everything you need. It is very clean and neat, and the decor is nicely curated. The windows let in fabulous light during the day and there are plenty of lights at night, so you'll not be left reading in the dark. The home is also conveniently located to public transport and an easy walk to the Longwood medical area. I'm already looking forward to my next stay!"
8734707,70561144,2016-04-18,8541362,Sam,"This is one of the best Air BnBs I've stayed in. Very clean, very private, Celia was a fantastic host. I was in town to run the marathon so I had to make the 25-minute trip into the city a bunch of times--very easy and no train transfers."
The room was actually a little more spacious than expected,and has separate sitting and sleeping areas. Also,the great,new bathroom is attached!,,

8734707,70937408,2016-04-22,46142136,Nicola,"This place was great! Communication was excellent and pro active from Jonathon, expectations also made clear. Jonathon came to meet us personally and was very friendly and keen to share tips to exploring the city. Location is up a hill but near a subway which goes regularly and also near the bike sharing hubway station. We met celia once briefly - also very friendly. Actual room was fantastic - would stay here again."
8734707,72870531,2016-05-05,39822723,Emma,We couldn't have had a better stay at Celia's house. The location is great - an easy walk to the nearest underground line and only three stops into town - and the suite itself is lovely. We particularly loved the book collection which was great for browsing. Jonathan was an excellent host - so friendly and gave us some brilliant recommendations for the neighbourhood and for Boston in general. We would absolutely stay again next time we visit.
8734707,73691671,2016-05-09,34014403,Guilherme,"My parents had a lovely stay at Jonathan's place. He met us when we arrived and showed us the building and the room. Location is good, at walking distance from a subway station (Orange Line). Everything was clean and organized, felt almost like a hotel room. The place was even better than what I expected from the pictures. It is a very private space, with it's own bathroom and a nice small living room. I though that I could even live there myself!"

It was super clean and the sunlight in the morning was perfect to wake up to. Amenities such as towels, iron, etc were provided which was an added bonus. I never expect these when using an Air BnB. Jonathan was fast to communicate with and even let us stay a couple hours longer after checkout. It was super easy to access the transit system which made getting around easy. It was also a delight to speak with Celia who provided us with recommendations and was just lovely to talk to in general. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it highly if you are considering staying here."
8734707,76463616,2016-05-27,39198615,Ga Young,"Our stay at Jonathan's place was fabulous. He was quick to give answers back to us via text messages, was welcoming us on time, and helped us find out good places to eat, drink, and explore. He also didn't forget to check out with our first night experience and asked if we needed something additional. Another great thing was the place itself. This was such a cozy, pretty, and lovely place to stay. We were happy to stay there for two nights with affordable price when hotels in Boston got so expensive due to several universities' commencement season. I'd like to highly recommend other people to stay at Jonathan's place!"
8734707,78003258,2016-06-05,71497104,S.,"The suite was very private with a bedroom, a reading room, and a half-bath. It was very clean, functional and nice! The host, Jonathan and Celia, were very warm and welcoming, making sure my stay was good. The location was also perfect for me. Being right off from Boston's South West Corridor (bike and walk path), I was able to walk easily to downtown (about 1.5 miles, 30 min). You can rent a Hubway bike and ride down the corridor (then the trip will be far shorter!) or tak(URL HIDDEN)min walk to the station). The neighborhood is very charming with buildings with characters and friendly residents. It is very walkable, so I explore the area on my foot a lot. When I visit Boston again, this definitely will be the first choice for me to stay!"
8734707,84605543,2016-07-08,65950260,Ewald,We had an amazing stay at this lovely house. It was a perfect place to explore Boston and a welcome oasis in this city.

It is exactly as described and shown in the pictures, and I can only underline what all the other reviews already mentioned. The uppermost level of Celia’s beautiful apartment is yours, it’s spacious, lovely furnished, very clean, providing all you need. Celia and Jonathan are extremely friendly and helpful, that adds to the home like feeling I enjoyed during my stay. Additionally the location is perfectly connected to the center, the neighborhood itself is calm and in some areas a little rough. I can highly recommend this place for a stay in Boston!"
8734707,87612016,2016-07-21,71555824,Minh,Jonathan and Celia were fantastic hosts. They gave me detailed answers to my questions and careful instructions about where to go and what to do in Boston.

8734707,93355278,2016-08-12,60498743,Debbie,"The suite was very clean, private and cozy!  We enjoyed staying here during our brief stay in Boston.  Carrying luggage up and down three flights of stairs can be a fitness challenge, but we didn't mind.  Jonathan was great to work with and very responsive!"
8734707,94374162,2016-08-15,44394331,Minh,"Jonathan and Celia were great hosts! They were very accommodating. We had arrived earlier than check in time and were able to leave our luggage there until check in time.  Jonathan was very communicative and flexible. Celia was very welcoming with a vibrant personality. Her home was beautiful in the streets of Roxbury.  It was super hot in Boston at the time and they had warned us about the room being hotter than usual. There was an AC unit when we arrived and it helped cool down the room. If the room wasn't bearable,  she had proposed that we could stay in the living room if we needed to. The room had a slanted low ceiling.  It was clean and cozy.  The room was very private including the bathroom within the space that had natural sunlight.  It's a little bit away from central downtown Boston, but if you are ok with taking an Uber then this place is for you!"

L'appartamento è molto accogliente soprattutto nella zona giorno. La camera con il bsgno al 1 piano è completa e il letto comodissimo. La seconda camera in taverna forse  troppo vuota ed essenziale ma tutto sommato un buon appartamento. I punti forti: la posizione vicina quanto basta al centro ( con in taxi di arriva in 10 minuti) e al mare a nemmeno un km. Insomma x noi è stata una ottima esperienza.
14107067,98608193,2016-08-31,62530592,Grant,"Chris had a fresh basket of fruit in the kitchen, maps for Boston, a variety of toiletries in the bathroom, and the place was perfectly clean upon arrival.

3129309,13901467,2014-06-07,5030084,Regina,Jose was a good host. He was readily accessible and responsive by phone and text. We appreciated his willingness to make accommodations for our early arrival and our post-check-out sightseeing plans.
The place was in a great location - right off the freedom trail and close to two T stops. It was a well-appointed,comfortable and cozy place to stay for my husband and me. It was a great value for the price.  Since this was a new listing and we were the first stay in this unit,we did encounter trouble with securing a wifi connection in the bedroom; using TV (it wasn't yet fully connected); and the shower curtain getting caught on the track. These were all minor things that didn't diminish our experience and will likely be resolved for the next guests.,,,

Any additional needs I had during my stay (more towels, bedding, ect) were brought over super quick.  He's very communicative and helpful in getting you settled.  All instructions for arrival were very clear and detailed."
The apartment is awesome.  It's super spacious and stocked with all the essentials for cooking and cleaning - which totally makes you feel at home for a long stay.  All the appliances and furniture are modern and in fantastic condition,but the apartment maintains the old school North End feel.  It's on the top floor of a 4 floor walk up.  It's super quiet,especially with no one above,so if you don't mind the stairs,it's perfect.  Tons of natural light,as well.  The sleeping alcove is super cozy.  There's no door
The location cannot be beat,off a quiet street  in the North End.  The area has tons of awesome restaurants,markets and is super quaint.   Go check out Pomodoro (hidden gem) for amazing Italian,or Mike's Pastry/Modern Pastry for awesome dessert.  About a 6-7 minute walk to the Haymarket T stop.  And a great walk.   About a 20ish minute walk to the Downtown Crossings area/Boston Commons,should you opt out of the T.,
I had a great stay and would highly recommend staying at this listing,"or any other listings through Jose!\"",,,,
3129309,16417006,2014-07-27,12268655,Yvonne,"The listing description was very accurate.  The location was fantastic, just steps away from the Old North Church and in the heart of Little Italy and a short walk to Quincy market.  There was also a farmers market nearby on a Friday we were there.  Jose was so available and helpful.  He was able to get me a parking pass to a local residents-only garage one block away which helped SO much.  Parking around there is very difficult because the streets are so narrow and it is mostly limited to residents.  Jose was really pleasant in all of our communications, too. The apartment was airy and light and very comfortable.  We didn't do major cooking but used the stove top which was great and the kitchen was stocked with enough utensils, etc.  Shower was great, loved the shower head.  Queen bed was very comfy and couch futon was perfectly fine.  It was a treat to stay there and I will recommend it to friends."

3129309,20278915,2014-09-27,4264726,Danielle,We had a great time staying here. Jose was very accommodating with our arrival/departure times and easy to reach. He even stopped by when we requested a blanket. He's a great person to rent from and the location is great. The only thing that would have been nice to know earlier is the flights of stairs to the apartment.
3129309,20599580,2014-10-02,17794890,David,"The location was awesome!   We could walk almost anywhere, convenient to great restaurants, easy to grab public transportation.

3129309,21123165,2014-10-12,6874466,Audrey,"Very well located apartment. The apartment has been recently renovated and is well equipped and comfortable. Our hosts have been reliable, available and helpful throughout the booking process and prior to our arrival. 2 con's maybe during our stay: 1) the neighbors from surrounding buildings have been very noisy up until 5 am on both week-ends we stayed there (parties, karaoke). 2) the cleaning was decent but not on par with a neat freak standards. But overall it was a good experience and I would recommend it."
3129309,21204191,2014-10-13,17426579,Chelsea,Jose's apartment was great! Exactly how it's described. My boyfriend and I wish we could have spent more than one night there. Jose was extremely helpful throughout the booking process through our check-in. We will definitely stay at his place again!
3129309,21459615,2014-10-18,14572565,Jennifer,"The apartment was well located in little Italy, right next to the north church as described. We were very happy with the size and feel of the place, ample space and they have clearly done some work to make it more modern with a waterfall shower , floorboards and nice appliances. Unfortunately it was on the fifth floor - but that isn't their fault! It helped us walk of the delicious cannolis from the 24/7 bakery at the end of the road! Communication was very good, checkin and out was seamless. A great place to stay in Boston that we would reccomend!"

José was easy to get hold of and quick at responding. The only downside was that the apartment was a bit chilly (we were there a very cold October weekend) and we never managed to turn on the heating."
3129309,21759608,2014-10-23,22205002,Lisa,My husband and I had only one night in Boston so Jose and Jason's airbnb was perfect.

You couldn't ask for a better location, close to everything - we literally walked everywhere and never had to take a cab! We spoke mainly to Jose, and he was extremely accommodating for our check in arrangements, and his communication was quick and descriptive. The apartment itself is clean, modern, and very spacious. There are tons of windows for great natural lighting, and even a view of the Old North Church from the bedroom. Overall, our experience was fantastic, and we would stay here again in a heartbeat! Highly recommended."

We walked to the TD Garden for a show and were so happy to have such a short walk back. Next morning we had coffee downstairs in a corner cafe and felt like we lived there. Host was very responsive and it could not be an easier stay.

The apartment was perfect, with a small bathroom, open living room/kitchen, and a cute little bedroom. There even seems to be a terrace...but it was rather cold, so we didn't venture up the ladder. Overall a great find and I'd recommend it to anyone wanting to walk around the North End."
3129309,22987855,2014-11-19,11827043,Gabriela,Great stay - extremely close to North Church.  First time using Airbnb and would use it again.  Jose was very accommodating trying to allow us to drop of our bags earlier than check in.

Getting there, I was a little nervous, but remembered Jose's clear directions and headed down the alley. Got the keys, and headed up the 5 flights of stairs, and into a really clean apartment. It is located within walking distance of most things we wanted to do and is an easy way to great restaurants, the T, and is RIGHT ON the Freedom Trail. It was a lot of fun and the perfect place to stay. I even decided to extend my stay and contacted Jose. He got back to me right away and helped me extend the reservation. It was a great stay!"
3129309,23877622,2014-12-13,24410112,Kyle,Apartment was exactly as described.  Has a very welcoming feel to it with the natural wood burning fireplace.

Everything was as described about the flat (note, it is not handicap accessible - 5th floor by stairs).   My only complaint was that it was not thoroughly cleaned after the previous tenants left; however, there was a swiffer there and we cleaned it on our own.  Location is fantastic! We never drove anywhere, and could easily walk to everything.  The Italian area is superb!"

There were three of us and the couch/bed was not terribly comfortable.  But the apartment is well suited to a couple. The apartment is well equippred but no frills in terms of decorations and that type of thing.
3129309,34958207,2015-06-14,20517622,Robin,The location is perfect but it is a 4th floor walk up with only a/c in the sleeping (URL HIDDEN) needs a little elbow grease to give it a nice clean shine. Bed needs a new comforter and some new pillows. It served its purpose but if the weather was any hotter it would be a little unbearable to hangout it the apartment.

There were tons of great restaurants, coffee shops, bars all just steps away. The apartment was about a half mile from the Aquarium stop on the T blue line and you really could get anywhere either on foot or via the T very easily. The apartment was very cute, clean, and had all the necessities. The only drawback was that it was hot out and the air conditioning unit in the bedroom kicked on and off throughout the night which didn't bother me but was a bit hard from my friend to sleep through. Overall it was a fantastic experience, I would definitely come back!"

3129309,43658935,2015-08-21,25636375,Elise,"I really having nothing but raving reviews about Jason's Boston apartment. The location is fantastic, nestled in the winding streets of the North End, awesome restaurants and bars just a minutes walk away, totally accessible to major tourists spots but still has a local neighborhood vibe. The apartment itself was immaculate, tastefully decorated, and had everything we needed. We didn't do any cooking but you absolutely could there, the kitchen is super nice. Jason and I never even met up actually but he made it extremely easy for us to receive/drop off the keys. Honestly I loved it so much, stay here, I know I would stay here again and probably will if I come through Boston."
3129309,43760011,2015-08-22,11736534,Kindree,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! This lovely apartment had everything we needed (including A/C!) and the location was perfect. Jose was very helpful and responded promptly to all our questions. We would totally stay here again, and we'll tell our friends to do the same!"
3129309,44147493,2015-08-24,38151309,Elle,"We loved the apartment! It was spacious, well decorated and clean. The location was awesome!! We would definitely stay here again. Jose was a very nice host and was easy to contact."
3129309,44658630,2015-08-28,38190389,Christina,"Jason is a great host, he responded promptly to all our queries."
The apartment is just as described,it is very clean and well equipped.The location is perfect,very close to lots of great restaurants,in addition we particularly enjoyed Caffè Vittoria for coffee and the best ice cream and Mikey's Pastry for the best cakes. It's on the freedom trail,"so easy to walk into the centre of Boston and it's an easy walk to the harbour area for more great seafood restaurants. We would definitely recommend Jason's apartment to friends.\"",
3129309,44841997,2015-08-29,4051691,Matthew,"Great place! Clean, location is amazing, very communicative host. Would stay again."
3129309,45023263,2015-08-30,42422854,Laura,Very conveniently located and host was easily contactable and responsive. Apartment was decently cleaned and very comfortable. Instructions about how to get key were slightly confusing but the host helped sort out the problem quite quickly.
3129309,45369129,2015-09-02,32350955,Susan,Lovely flat in great location in North end. Despite being in a busy part of town - nice and quiet. Flat was beautifully clean and had all the amenities we needed. Didn't actually meet Jason but he was very prompt at responding to my enquiries online. Process for getting keys to house was very simple
"Only thing to be aware of as other people have mentioned is 4 flights of stairs up to flat. Not a problem in my case but worth knowing if joint issues etc. \"",,,,,
3129309,46588015,2015-09-12,37045628,Vicente,"La descripción del anuncio es correcta. El anfitrión responde rápido y es bastante eficiente. El apartamento es amplio y está situado en muy buena zona, tanto turística como de ocio. El barrio es tranquilo y muy seguro a cualquier hora del día y de la noche. Lo único está en una zona muy húmeda y el aire acondicionado a parte de hacer un ruido insoportable no sirve para toda la casa y te da directamente mientras duermes."
Entre eso y que la cama está encajada entre cuatro pareces las se hace difícil descansar las noches calurosas,"y nosotros tuvimos 3...\"",,,,
3129309,46863225,2015-09-14,30711499,Maria,"Great and spacious place!  The surrounding neighbourhood is absolutely adorable, very Europe-like.  Tons of restaurant and bars nearby, and it was walking distance to the core and subway."
"Jose was very quick with his responses and gave tons of notice and detail before our arrival.  We'd definitely stay here agin.  Thanks again Jose!\"",,,,,
3129309,47090255,2015-09-15,3373251,Brittany,"The description was accurate and it was in a good location. The floors were filthy, when we arrived and I had to sweep first thing. The TV was also not hooked and laying down on the table. Otherwise, the place was great."
3129309,47955640,2015-09-22,24518347,Jeff,"After long hours of travel we were unable to get into our apt, we called Jason and he did not recognize who we were. After a few hiccups we finally got in."
The location IS AWESOME! And made our not so great unit acceptable. The apt is on the fifth floor and is totally bear bones. Don't expect any frills like soap or coffee filters. The towels looked like worn out car wash towels,thimgs like stained comforters made the cleanliness of the unit suspect.  It is my opinion that Jason has too many units and is,"behind on keeping up with them. I would try a different spot next time.\"",,,
3129309,48872605,2015-09-29,13006434,Nancy,"A great Boston Freedom Trail experience.  Great location for taking in the history, great food in the neighborhood, close to the T.  Clean apartment with a very comfortable bed."
3129309,49122603,2015-10-01,15785161,Dayana,Jose is super professional and flexible.
The flat is exactly like the picture.,,,,,
"Next  time we are in Boston we will stay in the apartment. Super nice area plenty of restaurants and cafes.\"",,,,,
3129309,49586235,2015-10-05,31742027,Kelly,"The Charming Freedom Trail had a great location and puts you in walking distance to everywhere in the North End! There was nothing frilly about the apartment but had all of the necessities, which is all you need when you're out and about exploring the whole time!"
"Jose was extremely helpful & always responded to my calls/questions. We left an item in the room and he has taken an extra step to try to recover it. \"",,,,,
3129309,49974470,2015-10-08,37425559,Christine,"Jose sent great information ahead of time, with clear directions about where to find the apartment, keys, etc, along with. Dry clear house rules. This was our first Airbnb experience and it exceeded our expectations."
3129309,50132390,2015-10-09,24158140,Kostyantyn,"I loved my stay. Lovely place, great location, cosy, and clean. Definitely recommend!"
3129309,50934214,2015-10-16,10685513,Digby And Avren,"A wonderful space. Loved it. Plenty of room. The bed wasn't particularly comfy but that's the only minor flaw I can think of. Obviously because it's an old densely populated neighborhood your windows look right into other people's windows but there were easy to use roller blinds for all the windows (except one - couldn't quite figure out why).  The sound insulation seems to be really good - I couldn't hear the people below at all - and when I walked past their door on the way in and out they were definitely in there chatting away and watching TV but none of that sound transmitted upwards to the apartment, and there's no one above you.  The refrigerator is full-sized, the kitchen has all I'd need and was plenty big enough to cook meals. The neighborhood is just amazing. Very few cars, everyone walking, tiny windy streets, lots of small shops, lots of people chatting in Italian and smoking. Loved it loved it loved it. I'll stay in this place again if I'm ever back in Boston."
3129309,51435425,2015-10-20,40723193,Anne,We enjoyed our stay in Boston. Everything worked out fine. Great location. Great food in Boston and people are very friendly. We'll be back.
3129309,51558822,2015-10-21,15651234,Brian,"Very nice space, comfortable, and great instructions on how to get there, in a awesome part of town"
3129309,51761494,2015-10-24,45167712,Jacob,"\"Staying at this place was an absolute dream come true! We got in a little late, so it was a pretty dark and we couldn't exactly find the place. Called Jose and within the first 3 rings he picked up and gave clear directions. The apartment is absolutely amazing. My girlfriend and I had been staying in hotels for the week prior and so when we walked into Jose's place it felt like we walked into our own home. The place was very clean, cozy, and had everything we needed. We spent most of our time exploring the \"\"north end\"\" and eating as much Italian food as possible"
3129309,52308689,2015-10-28,34607085,Abigail,We had a lovely stay in Jose's apartment in the North End. The apartment was just what we needed- clean with all conveniences and a comfy bed and relaxing shower.
The apartment is in a great location surrounded by numerous restaurants and cafés (we'd recommend Theo's just down Salem Street for breakfast) and almost opposite the Old North Church and the start of the Freedom Trail. We were able to walk almost everywhere within 30 minutes,though the nearest T stop was no more than 10 minutes away as well. It was around 15 minutes by car from the airport and an über cost $20.,,,,
Jose was very easy to get hold of before our trip,"and sent very well timed messages about check in. We had no problems during our trip that we needed to bring to his attention.\"",,,,
3129309,52416915,2015-10-29,29538171,Elizabeth,"This was the perfect apartment for discovering Boston. My husband and I only had 20 hours in the city and we couldn't have asked for a better location. We were only minutes away from delicious food, great bars and shopping. The historical landmarks are a huge bonus - it was such a cool experience. The apartment was very clean and exactly as listed - would definitely stay here again."
3129309,52820137,2015-11-02,34195881,Doug,"It's a clean, comfortable apartment in the best neighborhood in Boston. Just minutes away from transit and some really great restaurants. Always love staying here. Jose was very communicative as far as helping us find and get into the building and responded almost immediately to my questions. The best place to stay in Boston."
3129309,53252752,2015-11-07,44436664,Shannon,"Jose was very professional and provided us with all the necessary information for our stay. The apartment was really nice and was very clean. I definitely recommend staying at this place, especially given the location, which is surrounding by tons amazing restaurants (especially Italian food) and is within walking distance to many attractions."
3129309,53744065,2015-11-12,41999868,Tara,Jose was terrific at making sure we had the required information to access the apartment and he was always available via telephone during our stay if we needed him.
The apartment was in the North End neighbourhood of Boston,which is a lively Little Italy and fantastic location to explore the city from.,,,,
The apartment was neat and clean and served our purposes well for our 5 day stay.  It was great to have a fridge and cooking facilities available as there were a few evenings that we were so tired we just wanted to cook dinner and relax on the couch!,,,,,
We particularly loved the water pressure in the shower,the bed was comfortable,"it was a great place to stay for 2 people.\"",,,
3129309,53937632,2015-11-14,51989,Angela,"The neighbourhood was great, really central to everything."
The apartment was big as seen in the photos.,,,,,
There was a really large bath with shower.,,,,,
The only thing I think other people should be aware of is if you have mobility issues or medical condition this may not be for you as there are 7 flights of stairs no lift.,,,,,
Perhaps one of Jose's other properties next door might be better for you.,,,,,

3129309,54095181,2015-11-16,38612960,Casey,Can't beat this location! Right in the heart of the North End but tucked into a private little side street. It was bigger than expected and very tidy.
3129309,54424917,2015-11-19,49261159,Georgie,Great host and apartment! So much space and great location! Very quick responses and accommodated my needs - felt at home. Thank you!
3129309,54843432,2015-11-25,8997855,Karin,"The North End was absolutely delightful! Plenty of delicious Italian and seafood  (Neptune Oyster!) restaurants within walking distance and a 24-hour bakery a block away satisfied our sweet tooth after hours. The apartment was so quaint and lovely - the bedroom was cozy and all appliances worked well. It was a short walk to Haymarket where you could catch a train to anywhere in Boston! We didn't even realize how close the apartment was to the airport and grabbed a Lyft instead on the way out (only $12 or so!). Jose was very attentive and accommodating, and we had no issues with our stay. Would definitely stay at this airbnb again!"
3129309,55572291,2015-12-02,10116416,Bill,What a terrific place! The location was perfect to discover everything that the North End has to offer. We walked miles and miles and loved every minute of it.
Jose gave great instructions on getting into the apartment,and it was just as pictured,"with everything we needed for our Boston stay\"",,,
3129309,55706690,2015-12-04,41446136,Dj,This is a true north end experience but upgraded. The apt. Is sleek and larger than expected. Also very clean. Jose is an excellent host and extremely attentive. I have no complaints fort my stay:)
3129309,55898089,2015-12-07,44523868,Trent,Perfect Airbnb for explorers. Park your luggage and start adventuring.
The location alone is incredible. You can literally see The Old North Church from your pillow. My wife and I walked everywhere we wanted to go. Wether it was history or shopping,you can do it all from this place.,,,,
After your long day of history,shopping,eating,you can grab groceries from the 7/11 or grab excellent pastries from Mike's Pastries and chill.,,
I enjoyed the sleek,"modern style and unique parts of this awesome apartment. Strongly recommend this to anyone looking to stay right in the middle of all of our nation's history.\"",,,,
3129309,58734231,2016-01-03,52682803,Jeff,Jose crushed it. He was very friendly and responded quickly to questions/concerns. Great spot and very clean. You can walk anywhere in the north end within ten minutes. Highly recommend staying here!

3129309,68668528,2016-04-06,29392367,Tanja,"The flat is absolute wonderful, clean, neat and tidy. Situated perfectly in the north end close to North station and Haymarket station. Only 8 minutes walk from the TD Garden, which is great if you are to attend sports events. Perfect with the bakery which is open 24/7. Good choice if you have business in TD Garden, want to be in the Italian area or simply being close to the shopping area downtown without being in the middle of it. Jose was very helpful and always answered if we had a question and helped us to store the luggage after check out."
3129309,68793010,2016-04-06,48570212,Gene,"Place was perfect! would be a 5 star experience due to a slight miscommunication problem, but it was nonetheless an amazing experience. The location was in the heart of everything, from a 10 minute walk to quincy market, to literally walking outside to see the old north church. Great experience."
3129309,69099969,2016-04-09,24009917,Kevin,Jose's place was great for a quick trip to Boston. I took the water taxi to a wharf near the North End. A quick 5-minute walk led me to Hull St. Court. The apartment itself is comfortable and spacious. My favorite was the shower. They have a rain shower head. The location is great. Especially if you love Italian food. I suggest Trattoria di Monica. The location is great especially if you love history like I do. It's right on the freedom trail and there are some great historical sights to see and a few great pubs along the way for a quick break.
3129309,69301349,2016-04-10,63153917,Brent,Great place in the historic North End of Boston.  Clean and convenient.
3129309,69553574,2016-04-11,31242729,Logan,"Jose gave accurate directions to the house and how to get in. The place is the perfect size for folks like us coming to stay for 2-3 days to get in the sights. We really only slept and showered there. The spot is ideal for exploring the North End, Little Italy, and the Freedom Trail. Walking distance to tons of food and there is a coffee shop right on the same block. Only bad thing about the whole place is the 5 stories of stairs."
3129309,69762609,2016-04-13,35224791,Oscar,Great find in Boston! check in with the lock box was very easy and the place was very clean and bigger than expected. I will definetively use it again next time that I am in Boston if available.

3129309,73264995,2016-05-07,18816241,Bijal,This apartment is beautifully located in the North End (close to Hanover Street and Bova's - yum!). Jose was a great host that made the stay very welcoming by providing the necessities listed within the post. He sent easy to follow instructions a few days before check-in and was very quick to answer any questions I had.
3129309,73740641,2016-05-09,62570844,Sally,The apt was very clean and you can't find a better location to explore the North End/ Freedom Trail. Jose gave clear directions to get in and was very flexible allowing us a late checkout. We had trouble connecting to the Internet and he responded within minutes telling us how to correct the issue. 10/10 would stay here again.
3129309,73937239,2016-05-11,47214846,Hannah,This was a great little apartment just on the freedom trail. We found it to be a great base whilst exploring Boston.
The bed was comfy and the bathroom was lovely.,,,,,

3129309,74078940,2016-05-13,69548416,Dylan,"Very nice location, and very spacious. Would definitely stay again."
3129309,74316459,2016-05-14,40889672,Sheryl,"The unit was as described. Jose was very response before I arrived and when there which helped a lot. While I did have some questions as a few things were missing, he was very responsive to discuss and clearly does a lot to ensure his guests have a great stay."
"Great location! \"",,,,,
3129309,74602236,2016-05-16,8866807,Kevin,"The listing is entirely accurate. The location is very central and convenient, a short walk (20 mins) from the South End station."
The Jose's responses were prompt and the organisation was very smooth (key pickup etc.). The host is very flexible and accommodating to your specific needs (extra sheets,towels,slightly earlier/later check-in/out time etc.). He provided lots of information leaflets of the area which saved us a trip to the tourist information office.,,,
The neighbourhood is warm and has a very local vibe with a bakery and a good place to have a hearty brekkie just around the corner. The Haymarket and the Boston Public market are both 5mins away.,,,,,
"I'd definitely stay at this apartment again for my future visits.\"",,,,,
3129309,75150553,2016-05-19,53448584,Elaine,The apartment was great - even more spacious than the photos - and the location in North End was indeed ' under the steeple of Old North Church'. Jose/Jason were immediately 'on it' for any questions. I ate my way through my stay at some of the fabulous restaurants nearby. I'm going back in October!
3129309,76329105,2016-05-26,54104467,Chris,"Jose was a fantastic host, the directions to get to the apartment and how to get in where both meticulous and simple. The hull st court apartment is the absolutely perfect place to stay in Boston. It is so centrally located that getting around the city is a breeze. The apartment was beautiful and spacious. Not only is this best location in all of Boston to stay, but you are fundamentally missing a great experience by not staying here. Great space, friendly and helpful host, don't waste time, opportunity, or money staying anywhere else. We are soo grateful for Jose and the opportunity to stay at his space."
3129309,77971325,2016-06-04,63958163,Nick,"Jose is a brilliant host, very accommodating. The apartment is in a lovely part of Boston. The reviews speak for themselves."
3129309,78815749,2016-06-09,1666760,Jennifer,"I love the location of this apartment - right smack in the middle of North End, easy walk to most of the historical sites and Haymarket T Station. I was with my 11-year-old daughter, and I never once feel unsafe walking around the neighborhood. We were standing on Hull Street this morning at 5:30am waiting for our Lyft ride to the airport, and it was peaceful and quiet."
For an apartment that's so close to the Old North Church,where it's swamped with tourists constantly,the apartment itself is surprisingly quiet. Yes,the apartment is up 5 flights of stairs,but after all the Italian food,it's a good exercise. We arranged for an early check in
I highly recommend the little corner cafe facing the church - the latte is great,and breakfast sandwiches are awesome. But mostly,they are just nice people. We took a red-eye flight,arrived at 8am,and sat at the cafe's window seats till 11am,and they never for a moment made us feel uncomfortable. Quite the opposite
"I will definitely return and stay in this apartment again!\"",,,,,
3129309,79424205,2016-06-12,1813548,Christophe,"The apartment is very pleasant: clean, comfortable and very quiet. The location is just perfect. Jose was very efficient in the communication and we found the apartment very easily. We recommend this place!"
3129309,81049720,2016-06-20,64840255,Kyle,"The Airbnb was located smack dab in the center of Boston's North-End and is a perfect place to spend a few days. The unit is at the top of the building and has plenty of windows, but being in the North-End you are surrounded by others. The place is spacious and clean, with a bedroom nook to separate from the rest of the unit."
On arriving we took the metro from the airport to downtown and walked about 20 minutes to reach the house,although we did get lost for a bit. Nearby is all the Italian/seafood restaurants that you could ever dream of. It's also close to the Bruins stadium if you're lucky enough to stay there while they are playing.,,,,
"Loved this place and would stay again if we're lucky enough to make it back to Boston!\"",,,,,
3129309,81225991,2016-06-21,29735250,Siera,"Amazing location! Quiet, clean and cozy place on the freedom trail. Well within walking distance to all the historic sights and any type of food you can imagine. Great experience for our first trip to Boston"
3129309,81705104,2016-06-24,31494978,Elizabeth,"The location of this property is outstanding, you could not get closer to the Freedom Trail & the Italian restaurants & delis nearby make it a great place to explore. The apartment presents itself much better than the photos, it is clutter free & doesn't feel like you're living in someone else's home. As mentioned in other reviews, the apartment is up 5 floors of stairs. The general cleanliness of the apartment was fairly good, although our main issue was that the floorboards felt sticky to walk on and a lot of the light bulbs do not work. Also the blinds are very thin, they primarily provide some privacy rather than blocking the light. The kitchen is nice & modern, & we were able to cook some nice Italian meals after buying our ingredients from local stores."
3129309,82880152,2016-06-30,40732893,Justine,"Jose's place was PERFECT for our Boston vacation! It was in a great location (right in front of Paul Revere's house and the Old North Church), and walking distance from almost all sites! The kitchen was big and great for cooking and the bedroom and living room were both very cozy. Highly recommend this to anyone coming through Boston!!"
3129309,83216319,2016-07-01,46886960,Jack,"Jose was inviting, accommodating, and friendly. He was not intrusive in the slightest, giving us clear instructions to access the apartment. The room was well stocked with towels and it had a great view. Would definitely recommend!"
3129309,84277467,2016-07-06,73717342,Donna,Access was well communicated.  We were visiting family in the neighborhood so did not need much help from our hosts. The North End is very convenient to wonderful food and historic sites. Thanks Jason!
3129309,85371356,2016-07-11,76961916,Jane,Location was fantastic!  Apt is nice!  Enough room for 2 to 3 people for a few days.
3129309,87199952,2016-07-19,49033891,Denzil,"Great area, friendly neighborhood with lots of history, great food, and a fun atmosphere. We loved the little apartment. The only bummer was the air conditioning. The listing states it has AC, however, this is misleading. There is a small AC in the bedroom which is cold and helped us to sleep. But the rest of the apartment was so hot, it was actually cooler outside, we could not use the kitchen or sit in any other room besides the bedroom which is tiny. We would go back at a cooler part of the year."
3129309,87372619,2016-07-19,4218500,Rachel,"Great clear communication!  I was a little confused by all the boxes and keys, but mostly because of being flustered from all the Boston traffic and walking with bags in the rain.  Location was great and we would definitely stay here again."
3129309,88427869,2016-07-24,25648386,Christy,The location was ideal...right in the heart of the North End. Jose responded to all of my messages in a timely manner. Check in and out was very easy!
3129309,89009418,2016-07-26,33609360,David,The check in process was VERY easy and Jose provided the perfect amount of detail. The apartment was great and right in the best part of town!
3129309,90618126,2016-08-01,77630738,Laura,"This apartment is amazing! It is right in the freedom trail and steps away from the doors of Old North Church. The apartment has a spacious bathroom, lots of storage for clothing and personal items, and a kitchen with full modern amenities e.g. dishwasher."
We found this apartment to be within easy reach of both subway stations and water taxis. It's also right in the bustling heart of North End and so is surrounded by incredibly good Italian restaurants serving authentic Italian food e.g. Beneventos and Rabia's seafood and oysters.,,,,,
José himself is easily contactableand,friendly and was flexible when we enquired about late check-out. Top quality guy.,,,,
We look forward to staying at José's charming freedom trail apartment on future visits to Boston. Thanks for a great time,"José!\"",,,,
3129309,91883051,2016-08-07,49445989,Jaroslav,Nice apartment. The best possible location.
3129309,93685760,2016-08-13,40637286,Kirsten,Our host made us feel welcome and was very good at showing us what the place would look like.  It helped a lot to know that it was across from an historic landmark so I could plan our other excursions from home.  His place is spacious and clean and in an awesome location.  We feel so fortunate to be able to stay there.
3129309,94368878,2016-08-15,1140642,Julie,Perfect location! Great neighborhood with great food and close to everything.
3129309,95017589,2016-08-18,63869669,Lawrence,"Although we didn't meet our host, we were happy with the accommodations.  It was in a convenient location for us and close to the DownEaster train station from Portland."

3129309,98122725,2016-08-29,180369,Rebecca,"Perfect location! My stay was extremely short but I loved staying in North End. The neighborhood is super walkable and the apartment is so close to everything, especially Italian food."
The apartment was as described and the hosts made it easy to be self sufficient with instructions for everything. It's simple and cute,has the basic essentials you'd need,and in general was a super comfortable place for a couple to stay. It's a bit pricey after both the cleaning fee and Airbnb fee are added,but I'd recommend it either way.,,
"Thanks Jose!\"",,,,,
8302844,48323672,2015-09-25,43684345,Verite,Jj was awesome and attentive - easy to work with. The apartment was cozy and nice and in a central area - easy to get everywhere. I had a good stay.
8302844,48927487,2015-09-29,43785662,Melissa,"Jj was very helpful, providing detailed instructions on how to reach the apartment and also accommodating our request to flex the arrival time a little.  The apartment was spotless and while small, was plenty big for our needs and very comfortable."
We relied on walking or riding the T during our weekend trip and found the location of the apartment to be really convenient!  It was only a couple blocks from the Blue line and a moderate walk to the Red and Green lines. There were a couple drug stores and a grocery nearby,plus plenty of restaurants and bars if you don't plan to eat in.  There's a lot going on but it was never noisy inside the apartment.  We felt safe walking around day or night.,,,,
Criticisms? Only a couple things that might pose a problem. The shower is quite small--not a problem for us,but could be for some.  Also the stairs at the entrance might be a bit of a problem to negotiate when first in the door for someone who is unsteady.,,,,
"We had a great time and would definitely stay here again!\"",,,,,
8302844,49149213,2015-10-01,43827207,Kristen,"This was the perfect place to stay for a couple of nights in downtown Boston! It is a cute, little studio that has all the basic amenities. J.J. was a very gracious host and he even let us check out later so we could store our luggage until our afternoon flight. I definitely recommend J.J.'s studio!"
8302844,50008991,2015-10-08,28609558,Donna,"our stay in the studio was good. we were not in the place very much. J did everythibgbhe xoukd to.make our stat work out. a few rhibgs were a bit of an inconvience . no television and internet, had to buy sime basic supplies that normally are avaialble with all airb&b  's and the licatiin and appearance were slighty misrepresented. i do not think it the studio is equipmet ans spacious enough for more than one ir two at the most.  J as a host was very accomodating  for sure and i think it will only get better."
8302844,50658352,2015-10-13,2970699,Ashley Lauren,The apartment was in a great location. It was clean. The bed was comfortable. Shower had great water pressure. JJ let us check out some time later than planned and was very accommodating. Overall happy with the experience.
8302844,50876259,2015-10-15,45477348,Kori,"My husband and I had an excellent stay in Jj's place.  The apartment was exactly as the pictures showed.  The location was absolutely perfect.  The city is so walkable and staying in the Beacon Hill neighborhood put us close to everything.  We were also less than a 5 minute walk from the train to the airport, so that was a huge bonus.  Jj responded to messages very quickly, which we appreciated.  If you want a small place to rest your head while you visit Boston, this is a great choice!"
8302844,51036901,2015-10-17,5718812,Forbes,Our visit wasn't incredibly smooth with some hiccups around both WiFi and the apartment getting cleaned before our arrival.

8302844,52494408,2015-10-30,44029259,Rosanna,"The listing was accurate. The apartment is located in a lovely neighborhood. The entrance is in a back alleyway with a short door to get into a very cozy little studio apartment, which was the perfect size for a couple. Clean and comfortable. The decor made it very welcoming, and not difficult to get in."

8302844,53481587,2015-11-09,45319075,Kristina,"Our stay at the apartment was pleasant. It's conveniently located within walking distance of many attractions and within the same block as a train station. The inside is cozy and the kitchen has a full, clean refrigerator that's perfect for storing water or left overs.The bed is probably more comfortable than my own bed at home. Jj was quick to respond to inquiries and was a great host."
8302844,53887011,2015-11-14,11367578,Natalia,"Si bien nos perdimos para llegar al apartamento, el lugar por dentro era mucho mejor que en las fotos! Grande, limpio, confortable, comodo, con provisiones. Lo recomiendo!!"

Perfect location. The home itself was super cozy and and so comfortable, had all the essentials that we needed. Would definitely consider coming back here again the next time I'm in Boston!"
8302844,60286439,2016-01-21,14473779,Kelvin,I had a great time staying at JJ's spot. The unit has everything I needed and the location was ideal to do a walking tour around Beacon Hill and the North End.

8302844,60602033,2016-01-25,26488658,Michelle,"The studio was exactly how it was described, so cozy and the perfect size for 2 people. JJ was very quick to respond and our communication was flawless. Great location! Would definitely recommend to anyone that is experiencing Boston for the first time, loved it!"
8302844,61435098,2016-02-04,17620307,Karina,"Truly a quaint place in Beacon Hill. Comfortable walking distance from MGH, Boston Common, and Suffolk University. The studio type place is great for a couple's weekend.  The wifi was excellent as was the tv and comfort of the bed."
The limitations and recommendations for improvement include:,,,,,
1- improving in cleanliness as the floor was dirty enough that you couldn't walk around without shoes,,,,,
2- would recommend bringing your own basic toiletries as there was no hand soap in the bathroom.  (We were too busy to contact jj but he is quick to respond to other matters so maybe he would have made arrangements to provide you with it.),,,,,
3- storage space is limited so a prolonged stay would be challenging,,,,,
Overall,"this a very functional stay.\"",,,,
8302844,61566191,2016-02-06,11308763,Ann,"Jj was a very responsive and accommodating host, returns calls & email quickly. The little apt was in a quiet location, very conveniently located, walking distance to many of central Boston's neighborhoods."
8302844,61792130,2016-02-08,31747591,David,"So this was my first experience using Airbnb and we could not have been any happier. This apartment is in an AMAZING location. So easy for me to walk around town. Being my first time, I leaned on J a little bit and he was responsive and incredibly helpful. The apartment was really clean and even though we only spent a weekend in Boston, it felt like we had a home in town. Honestly, I don't seen any reason to look for another place and will certainly be looking to rent this home next time I am in town. It was just a really easy and wonderful experience!"
8302844,62120548,2016-02-11,46636717,Anne,"The apartment is in compliance with photos and a great location in downtown Boston . It is an ideal starting point to visit. Despite maid incident arriving , Jj has responded very quickly and ensure that everything goes well . The stay was very enjoyable."
8302844,62809412,2016-02-17,18101261,Mark,The studio was centrally located which was great and allowed us to explore all Boston had to offer. Beacon Hill had many different types of restaurants and shops all within walking distance.
As for the apartment itself,while tiny it severed its purpose. The door was a bit scary since there's not a complete seal,but the base heaters were able to keep the studio warm and comfortable enough. The kitchen has the essential supplies needed,and there is a Whole Foods a few blocks away so it was easy to keep a few groceries in the fridge during our stay. Plus great water pressure.,,
Jj provided us with enough toiletry items (TP,shower gel,contact solution,first-aid kit,etc...) which was convenient. The bathroom is a bit small,and if there is more then one person timing would need to be coordinated.
Overall it was a very nice stay in Boston,"and close to everything you could ever want to see.\"",,,,
8302844,63343427,2016-02-22,53220263,Kirby,"Absolutely loved this apartment for a weekend stay! It's in a great location, and a short walk to downtown and the T which made it easy to get around. The bed was super comfortable and the apartment had all the essentials. It did seem like there was a lot of street noise which wasn't an issue for us but if you're sensitive to a lot of noise this might not be the place for you. Would definitely stay here again if I'm back in Boston"

He actually loved it so much that he didn't leave it to explore much during the day and worked from the apartment. He is going back this weekend and asked if he can stay at this place again. Thank you, JJ, for being so accommodating and making this process so smooth for us!"

It was all that it was described to be plus some.  Very quaint and cozy and comfortable. Wish I had spent more time exploring the city however I was here only for business.  I would definitely return and stay here again. The accommodations were lovely. And you cannot beat the location in Boston. Thank you so much Jj!"

We also enjoyed the history behind the location.  We were close to one T stop and others were a short walking distance.  We could not access the wifi, we did not have the code.  This location is better suited for 2 poeple, it was quite tight for 4."

It has a great location: it is very close to the Downtown Crossing (the shopping area), the Faneuil Hall Marketplace on the one side and Boston Common Park, Beacon Hill and Back Bay (Prudential) on the other side. It was just perfect walking distance to everywhere. The room itself was very clean and warm (while outside was -6°C). We found all necessary things. Jj was a very good host. He replied very fast and was very helpful. Also the place is very nice itself with different decorations. I would definitely stop there again."

We were able to walk to all of our destinations and appreciated the variety of restaurants and nightlife nearby.

The apartment is as shown in the photographs, very beautiful and cozy! We stayed there three days, and we cooked almost every night, but the kitchen utensils are not too complete for that, we wish we had more of those. Late at night and early in the morning, we listened the neighbors walking upstars and moving furniture. There is no good sound isolation. We woke up early so we didnt care, but if you want to sleep it may be uncomfortable. The bathroom is ok, the only thing is that the shower is too small!! All the apartment was clean and tidy!"

8302844,75346528,2016-05-20,1960,Kassie,"Space accurately described. Close to restaurants, bars, the Boston Commons Parking Garage, and the train. The people living above are rather noisy (walking, dropping things, dragging furniture) from the hours of 4pm to 11pm, which may interrupt any naps, fyi."
8302844,75941213,2016-05-23,8287665,Sarah,"There was a scheduling mix up with our hosts cleaning service and when we arrived the place had not yet been cleaned; however, JJ responded to our call quickly and was apologetic and courteous. He quickly arranged a back up service to come over while we were out. Great central location- easy walk to the T or any of the main sights. Only draw back was that as a basement apartment, and a young child in the apartment above, the footsteps were extremely loud early each morning (7 am onward). We enjoyed our stay- Thanks JJ for sharing your place!"

What I loved most was the fact that it is in a historic building, in a great part of Boston, with many amenities within walking distance. Whole Foods is a block away, and there are many options right outside your door for a quick meal. There is an air mattress if there are more than 2 people and the studio is spacious enough to accommodate 4. Checking in and out is a breeze as JJ gave us very specific instructions. I highly recommend JJ's studio for your visit to Boston."
Only one issue - the shower is small so if you are a big person,"this is not the place for you.\"",,,,

8302844,79012856,2016-06-10,19072522,Patricia,"the neibourhood is perfect!!!!!. as it is very close to Bowdoin T STATION and Park T station, walking distance from everywhere we wanted to go, quincy market, downtown, chinatown, newsbury street and every thing. the appartment IT IS NOT on Temple street rear... it is on Coolidge st, facing a quite silent and lonely and big parking lot. (:/)  it was ok...though. coming and going was easy. JJ was really quick responsive when internet and CAble TV suddenly stopped but he was very helpful trying to solve it. that was very good. ... Other issues: By the house roules and the descriptions of previews guests I supposed the appartment was inmaculated and the cleaning was really fond... BUT IT WASN´T. we found previous litter in the trash bins... kitchen and bathroom... the brown chocolate cuchions didn´t smell as if they were clean. There were uncovered sheets, and blanquets and who knows what else under the bed, that I tried not to  sweep the floor in its direction in case  I made them dirty with the dust and gravel that was already inside when we got into the apparment. I went to the closet looking for the broom and shovel and I found them... the broom plenty of dirt and lint and entangled long hairs and stuff, and the shovel broken... very discusting. It is a pitty such an amazing location dealing with all these ackward details that are not ok at all. I think everything I mentioned can be  solved easily in a very simple and cheap and loving form so the place becomes the perfect spot to spent your vacations in Boston."
8302844,79698453,2016-06-13,30662893,Lauren,JJ was easy to get in touch with and even gave us recommendations for parking our car for the weekend.

This eclectic space was basically a studio apartment, but was very cozy, and was well suited for my stay. The apartment is well located to public transportation and other services within the downtown area., which made exploring the city very easy. I would absolutely consider staying here again on my next trip to Boston."
8302844,80382909,2016-06-17,15974711,Tim,"We loved the servants quarters in Boston.  The location could not have been better.  We walked everywhere we wanted to go.  If we go back to Boston, we will check with JJ before we go."

The studio looks exactly as in the pictures and has a cozy feel to it. It was clean and we found the neighbors friendly and helpful. The area itself is quite relaxt and just off of a busy street, however it can be a bit loud in the evening, but we slept well. The keys to the studio were at the location JJ told us and were easily accessible. The week before we left JJ verified whether all was clear, which it was."
8302844,81354643,2016-06-22,68963305,Scott,"The home was in a very good location in Boston, very convenient as far as walking to everywhere is concerned."
We found the home to be a little small in a few ways,the shower was very tight for room and there was barely any space to hang clothes up. It was also very dark in there as there is no natural light coming through.,,,,
One other small issue was the people upstairs were constantly banging and making noise,at one point I actually thought the Boston Celtics were playing upstairs.,,,,
Overall not a bad stay but a lot of room for improvement.  5/10 for me,,,,,

8302844,83186922,2016-07-01,20287770,Lisa,"Fantastic neighborhood and easy access to lots of Boston sites.  The place is a studio apartment (so small), but was perfect for my purposes.  Internet worked well as did everything else.  Will definitely stay here again next time I'm in town."
8302844,83669528,2016-07-03,65668950,Lauren,"Our host was incredibly responsive and replied to any questions we had within minutes, if not less. This is a perfect place to stay in Boston, as it's in a great neighborhood, and minutes away from all the touristy and fun spots in downtown Boston.  It was a great base for us for the weekend, and I would highly recommend it."
8302844,84139803,2016-07-05,12195790,Georgina,"This is a great place to stay in Boston! Wonderful apartment and excellent location. JJ was a great host and I would absolutely recommend staying here if you are visiting Boston. Super close walking distance to most things and also close to the T. Thanks for having us, JJ!"
8302844,84748013,2016-07-08,2006891,Alexis,This place is amazing. Super cozy and welcoming. Great location! Jj was very quick to respond to my inquiry and gave great detailed instructions.
8302844,85718234,2016-07-12,28724801,Michele,"Although we didn't meet JJ, we felt he was very quick to respond. Checking in and out was a breeze. The location is convenient and walkable to everything we wanted to see.  Studio was small but certainly comfortable for the 2 of us."
We didn't see any info regarding wifi (nor did we ask) so we didn't use it. The bathroom sink drain looked pretty dirty,no hand soap or wash cloths. It's a basement so there is not much natural light which was fine but even the lights in the space still made it feel very dark. We also found no place to hang our stuff or stash our clothes. A lot of the drawers had clothes in them already.,,,,
All in all,"we liked the place. Would recommend it if a few changeable things were addressed. \"",,,,
8302844,86250785,2016-07-15,58645460,Gayle,"The location was great, easy to get most places, and could walk to most places. T was very close when we needed it. Kitchen seemed really cluttered compared to the picture. Couldn't find a hand towel or soap in the bathroom. And the closet wasn't really usable with the snowboard in it."
8302844,86757221,2016-07-17,46857314,Craig,"The studio apt is in a great location, bars and places to eat abound, late night pizza just a few blocks away, they are open till 3am.  Starbucks and Dunkin literally nest door."

8302844,88142006,2016-07-23,51672762,Justin,"The space was very cozy and worked perfectly for our visit. It is walking distance or a short uber ride from everything. Clean, quiet and private. Jj truly made us feel like we lived there. We did not need anything other than what was provided but if we did i am sure he would have helped as much as possible."
8302844,90138189,2016-07-31,74454800,Richard,"The place was just what was promised.  Perfect location, close to all including public transportation making getting around a breeze.  Suggest to all that read the description.  Is small, but cozy is not overused here."
8302844,90645904,2016-08-01,30672786,Austin,"The place was in a great location and we were able to easily walk to it from our train at North Station as well as walk to Boston Common and most everything else!  For just the two of us, the space felt plenty large, but we honestly didn't spend much time there, we were out in Boston seeing the sights!  The host was incredibly easy to work with and let us drop off our bags before check in and helped us with anything that we needed."
8302844,93427214,2016-08-12,41485764,Barbara,Die Unterkunft wäre eigentlich attraktiv.
"Sie liegt mitten im Zentum von Boston im hinteren Untergeschoss eines Stadthauses. Die Austattung und Instandhaltung lassen zu wünschen übrig!\"",,,,,

Everything you need is within walking distance.  From the beautiful sites to having a pharmacy right around the corner.  Just perfect.  The apartment is quaint and exactly what you need for a weekend away. It's clean, warm and welcoming, and in a pretty awesome \"\"servants quarters.\"\"  We would absolutely stay here again.  Thank you"
8302844,96667144,2016-08-23,52285332,Adrian,"We were in Boston for three days and Jj's appartment was a great choice. It was clean, tidy and well located. Jj is a nice host."
8302844,97284909,2016-08-26,31870157,Sarah,"Just spent 3 days at JJ's place and it was fab! Right in the heart of the city, easily accessible from the airport and super clean!"
8302844,98417718,2016-08-30,65281857,Mary,Communication was awesome and appreciated. Bathroom was smaller than thought but everything was in working order just small.

1810397,14878850,2014-06-28,12635000,Jonathan,"This was, by far, our best Airbnb experience to date. The house is beautiful and immaculate. The neighborhood is charming and inviting. The house sits on a beautiful tree lined street with numerous great restaurants and bars at the end of the block. Stacey was a fantastic host. She was extremely attentive and was easily accessible. We hope to be able to stay here again on future trips and would highly recommend this beautiful home."
1810397,15106899,2014-07-02,5423665,Xavier,"\"I visited Boston with my sisters and a friend for a long weekend.  Our stay at the Koeppel's was just perfect!  The house is located in South End, Boston's best neighbourhood in my opinion and walking distance to anything you may want to visit.  The house itself is amazing: very spacious, clean/well maintained & extremely well equipped.  Communication with Stacy & Seth was very easy.  We really appreciated Seth meeting us at the house to give us a tour as we familiarized ourselves with the place.  We were also very grateful for the \"\"house"
1810397,15298631,2014-07-06,17365258,Mona,The reservation was canceled 38 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1810397,15334966,2014-07-07,16400421,Jennifer,"We stayed in Stacy and Seth's home during the Fourth of July weekend with a group of 6, and it was an amazing experience.  We've rented many homes but this one far surpasses any of our past rentals -- the house is immaculate with great amenities, located in a charming neighborhood.  There were plenty of great bars and restaurants within a short walking distance.  Even with a terrible rainstorm, we had a great time hanging out in the home -- there were plenty of TVs, spacious common areas, and video games (not to mention a beautiful patio that we were able to enjoy when the weather improved)."
Stacy was extremely responsive and checked in with us days before our arrival and during our trip.  She also left a welcome packet with detailed instructions for how to operate all the gadgets as well as recommendations for places to eat and things to do.  I highly recommend this rental,"I have nothing but positive things to say about our stay!\"",,,,
1810397,15599975,2014-07-12,12635000,Jonathan,This was our second time at Stacy's beautiful home and everything was perfect once again. This has quickly become our favorite place to stay when we visit Boston for work. We absolutely love the house and the neighborhood and can't get enough of the great local restaurants. We even walked to a Red Sox game! Though I'm sure that it would be easier to jump on the train a short walk away to get there... Can't wait to stay here again!
1810397,16102170,2014-07-22,16513446,Tim,Seth and Stacy were the perfect hosts.  We were in town for a birthday celebration and everything went perfectly.  The house was gorgeous and the South End gave us the best location for activities.  I highly recommend their home.
1810397,16367839,2014-07-26,12635000,Jonathan,"This was our third time at Stacy's place and it continues to be our favorite place to stay in Boston when we come up there for work. Everything was perfect, as always, even though she and her family were away in Spain! Check in was seamless and Stacy and her husband were very attentive all the way from Madrid when there was a small problem with one of their TV's! We will always want to stay there when we are in town but this treasure is starting to get tough to book with so many others discovering it. We continue to love the neighborhood and it's central location."
1810397,16836485,2014-08-03,7571933,Jean Marie,"Très beau et confortable appartement en RDC à quelques minutes du plein centre de Boston. (seul bémol le stationnement d'une voiture qui dans la rue est impossible, parking autour à 35 $ en moyenne par jour)."
L'appartement est très propre,"silencieux et les propriétaires très attentifs le laisse à disposition comme s'ils allaient recevoir des amis. Donc une très grosse confiance dont on a envie de se montrer digne en respectant les lieux. Je recommande chaudement.\"",,,,
1810397,17561535,2014-08-14,5378962,Christos,"Stacy was a wonderful host. From the initial inquiry to checking us in and throughout our stay, she was always available to answer our questions. She is extremely personable, welcoming, and accommodating. Her house was exactly as advertised, very comfortable, spacious, and well furnished. It easily accommodated our party of seven adults. Some of the high-end amenities (e.g., gourmet kitchen, comfortable and well-equipped family/media room, wireless sound system. etc.) made our stay even more enjoyable. The information packet provided, with tips for using the house amenities, as well as great suggestions for what the neighborhood had to offer was very useful and much appreciated. The neighborhood was terrific, quiet, within easy walking distance from downtown Boston, safe, and teaming with restaurants, coffee shops, boutique shops, and an organic grocery store. Parking could be an issue so this should be a consideration for those with a car. Overall, we had a wonderful stay and definitely recommend Stacy's home to other airbnb travelers."
1810397,18879227,2014-09-02,16996419,Natalie,"We were greeted by the hosts Mom, a lovely lady who showed us around the property and encouraged us to make ourselves at home.  The host had left a very useful guide with tips on good areas to visit, restaurants, bars, sightseeing etc.  A great welcome!"
1810397,19211862,2014-09-08,14611183,Liz,"Stacy made us feel very welcome and was a wonderful host. She went out of her way to accommodate us.  Her Place was as wonderful (or maybe even more spectacular) than described or as seen in the photos. Great location within walking distance to great restaurants, playgrounds, Copley/prudential, etc.   We stayed with our 2 young ones and had a wonderful time.  Very nice amenities. Gorgeous deck/porch. This will be our go to place to rent when in Boston again (if she'll have us....that is)!!!"
1810397,23367921,2014-11-30,21981584,Mindy,Stacy and her family were very flexible and accommodating.  The listing was as described and worked perfectly for our family.  There was plenty of space and the ping pong was a bit hit.  We loved the amenities and especially the location.
1810397,24604469,2014-12-31,24368676,Christopher,"Fantastic experience with gracious and accommodating hosts.  It's a beautiful Boston home in the heart of one of the best neighborhoods in the city.  Walk to everything. Unbelievably comfortable, and especially well suited for families. We have lived in and around Boston for our entire lives, and Stacy & Seth's home is a perfect base to experience all Boston has to offer. I would recommend this home to the most discerning visitors. You will not find better accommodations or better hosts."
1810397,30437348,2015-04-22,21189652,Kaitlyn,"Stacy was a perfect host! She had everything ready to go for when we arrived, which was a little earlier than usual as we were there for the Boston marathon and wanted to drop our stuff off so she was very accommodating. The pictures online describe exactly what you will see when you enter her beautiful home! The surrounding area is just beautiful and very close to anything you wish to get to in Boston. I will definitely be staying here again if I am ever in Boston for a holiday. She checked in occasionally to make sure everything was going well and let us take our time leaving after the marathon. Great stay, would highly recommend!"
1810397,35486001,2015-06-19,15324211,Lisa,"What a gem!  The Koeppel's made us feel right at home.  The neighborhood is wonderful, with great restaurants right in walking distance.  The home is elegant and spacious, very comfortable beds,  wonderful showers and little extras that make it worth every penny!  Such as a steam shower in the master bath, a nice backyard sitting area and a pool table.  We would definitely stay here again when in Boston!"
1810397,36361195,2015-06-28,9598836,Adam,Wonderful place. Wonderful hosts.
1810397,37941666,2015-07-12,9598836,Adam,"This is a beautiful home in the welcoming and high-end neighborhood of Boston's South End. We stayed for a total of 3 weeks and soaked in the experience of what it is like to live like a local: parks, cafes, and friendly neighbors. As hosts, Stacy and Seth were there to attend to our needs from nearby, without hovering. In other words, they were extremely helpful without being intrusive. I would absolutely recommend this home to families (my family of hour stayed there comfortably) or groups."
1810397,42843607,2015-08-16,31582449,David,"This is a very nice house in one of Boston's nicest neighborhoods. It is well supplied, and unusually well furnished. The owners are very involved and expect their home and neighborhood to be taken care of as they would."
1810397,49498003,2015-10-04,44018196,Jonathan,The place was very well described and it was a lovely neighborhood.
Stacy went out of her way to ensure that everything was smooth for our arrival including an early check in.,,,,,

1810397,50759210,2015-10-14,33943533,Betsy,"Stacy's home was wonderful.  It was perfect for my family of 5, with plenty of room to spare.  It is located in a great part of Boston, within walking distance of many excellent restaurants and sights.  Every morning, we walked right down the street for a delicious breakfast at The South End Buttery.  The home itself has everything one would need and more; we didn't do much cooking this time, but the kitchen was well-stocked had we chosen to do so.  We also loved just hanging out, watching t.v. and playing pool, in our downtime."
Stacy was a pleasure to deal with,as was her mom,who showed us around when we checked in.  The welcome information (provided ahead of time) was very informative and appreciated,as was the bottle of wine Stacy left for us.  Stacy also helped arrange a parking space for us,which was very helpful,as parking is a challenge in her neighborhood.  Stacy checked in via text once or twice during our stay to make sure all was well
1810397,51481348,2015-10-20,34168920,Jacqueline,Stacy was a wonderful host.  She made us feel incredibly welcome in her beautiful home. She even helped out when I needed to find medical care for my son. I would definitely recommend this home to anyone planning to visit the Boston area. The location is perfect and the house spectacular!
1810397,67942055,2016-04-01,61663606,Natalie,"Absolutely lovely and wonderfully located home!  We were greeted by Seth who showed us around and got us settled.  Everything worked well, the beds were so comfortable, and we even got to entertain and cook a meal in the kitchen!  Ending the night with a few rounds of pool was a blast.  Overall fabulous experience!"
1810397,70622809,2016-04-19,32473443,Wayne,"Stacy made us feel very welcome.  House was a pleasure to experience.  We had a family group of 6 which the house readily accommodated.  The house is very spacious.  The neighborhood is ideal for walking to restaurants and shopping, but the immediate area around the house still seems very private and separated from traffic."
1810397,80769170,2016-06-19,5005857,Dorian,Stacey's home was beautiful and the area was fantastic.  We could not hoped for a more central location.  The home is exquisitely remodeled and perfect for our business trip.  We strongly recommend this home to others.

13451383,93121611,2016-08-11,42644154,Candost,"The place is really clean and cozy, and room has a good light and enough space. The instructions he sent beforehand and the information he provided trough a document in the room made our stay considerably smooth. If I were to use a single adjective it would be 'professional'."
13451383,95343720,2016-08-19,84791055,Ben,"Hang's place was really easy to get into as a result of his very descriptive details as to how to get into his place. The room I slept in was very clean and spacious, and the bathroom was everything one needs. Would recommend staying at hang's! Also very close to a lot of bars in the area"

I thought it was nice that he had slippers for us when we first walked in. He showed us the place and helped us with our luggages. We wanted to get dinner right away and he and his girlfriend helped us find a restaurant nearby and even offered a ride to the restaurant. The listing description was accurate. The neighborhood was very nice and clean. It was close to a lot of businesses and the riverfront. \""

8351880,50514135,2015-10-12,44658893,Thomas,Jinchen is a very good host full of helpfulnessand hospitality. Staying in Marlboro Street is great – in the heart of where the best of Boston is happening.
"Only minuses are that the room is located in the basement without he option of opening a window – and that the apartment is not actually located on Marlboro Street but in the alley just behind he front houses.\"",,,,,

8351880,51055788,2015-10-17,45299451,Kevin,"Jinchin and Caroline were very helpful and welcoming to their home.  It was in the perfect location for Boston, I was able to walk all of the freedom trail, and walk to Fenway for a visit.  It's also right in the middle of a very fun neighborhood, I would recommend this location.  The room was very clean and perfectly comfortable for a one night stay.  It is in the coachhouse of the building.  As I returned after my evening out, Jinchin and Caroline placed some water in my room (with lemons!) - just a very nice and unexpected touch.  Getting up and down the spiral staircase was a bit tricky with my suitcase, but Jinchin was, again very helpful with moving my luggage around."

8351880,51788373,2015-10-24,9155767,Nasser,"I had a great experience at Jinchen's place . I fell absolutely in love with my room in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston, which is most famous for its rows of Victorian brownstone homes — considered one of the best preserved examples of 19th-century urban design in the United States — as well as numerous architecturally significant individual buildings, and cultural institutions. The apartment was always clean, Jinchen made sure to communicate the arrival and departure time professionally, allowing me to leave later than usual. He and his girlfriend provided me with all the privacy that I need and made me feel so conformable. Thank you so much for being a great host!"
8351880,52427089,2015-10-29,2931674,Sven,Jinchen/Frank was very kind and helpful. His place is very centrally located in the beautiful Back Bay neighbourhood. It's very quiet so we slept very well in a comfy bed.

It would have been good to know that the bathroom is up a spiral set of stairs from the bedrooms, but Caroline helped me with my luggage."

8351880,53979298,2015-11-15,9485882,Daniel,Jinchen and Caroline are very friendly and hospitable.  They lent me an umbrella and offered me fresh fruit.

I had a great experience living in their home and I guess had made friends with them. BTW, the back bay area is definitely one of the greatest in Boston, worth to try!"
8351880,57244402,2015-12-23,1471157,Yin,Jinchen is a phenomenal host.  He's done a great job at making the place comfortable and cozy. My experience was great.

The best thing about Jinchen's place (not to mention the hosts) however is the location since back bay is definitely the place to be in Boston."

"Thank you!\"",,,,,
8351880,61844627,2016-02-08,7263732,Barret,"This is an excellent part of town to stay. For what you are getting, it is well worth the price. Jinchen was very accommodating and warm.  He ensured that I was enjoying my stay. When I mentioned I was paying an obscene amount of money for parking, he went out of his way to help me find a much cheaper place to park for the duration of my trip. He was also very patient when I arrived later than anticipated from my road trip (about 1am). This area of town is walking distance to a lot of historic buildings, and great restaurants. I highly recommend staying here."
8351880,62440116,2016-02-14,26113431,Patrick,"Jinchen was wonderful. He and Caroline made me feel so welcome, and their place was super convenient to the Back Bay/Copley Square area. It was clean and cozy. Highly recommended."

His apartment is literally a few steps away from Newbury Street and Copley T Station, very convenient. I would definitely recommend this place and definitely stay here when I come back to Boston. Even though it was a short stay, but my friend and I had a wonderful experience."
8351880,63432671,2016-02-22,58780808,Michelle,Husband and wife hosts were very welcoming and eager to please.
Location in Back Bay Boston is perfect. Walk everyplace.,,,,,
Address is on Marlborough Street,one of the most prestigious streets in Back Bay Boston.,,,,
However the entrance to this unit is off a back alley ... and the unit itself was perhaps a garage at one time.,,,,,
Don't expect a gracious brownstone foyer & accommodations.,,,,,
I stayed two nights. Was perfect at this price point.,,,,,

I lived there for one night but have to say, I have a good experience and also a reasonable price for a tidy and cleaning room. Also, the location there is very convenient for me to hang out with my friends and go shopping. I would like to recommend it if you want to find a place to live when you travel or study in Boston."

They are so friendly and accomodating and it felt so nice to have people to talk to while I was away from home. We had a misunderstanding about my time of arrival but Jinchen did what he could and fit me in anyway!
Perfect location - you can't beat it. You are in the heart of Back Bay,steps from the main shopping district and close to food and convenience stores. Also a perfect location if you are up for walking you can walk to Cambridge along the Charles river. I think it's a perfect place to stay for a visit to Boston. Very safe too!,,,,

The apartment is entered via a  back alley and is what looks like must have been servants quarters to the main house which is a lovely brownstone around the block... You will not be in the brownstone. Although the location is great, ideal actually, the accommodations are not."

8351880,72102072,2016-05-01,21360545,Cyrena,The location of this listing is certainly ideal. Conveniently close to just about everything! Jinchen was a great host and very quick to respond - especially when I changed my check in time last minute! I had a very brief stay so we didn't have much interaction. My one qualm was that i'm not much of a candle person and there all kinds of heavily scented items in the place. But overall if you're looking for a convenient place to stay in Boston this apartment is in a great area!!
8351880,73070662,2016-05-06,48092734,Yumeng,"Hey Jinchen: Thank you for hosting me ! The location is super and your apartment is tidy and clean! I love it so much ! If I go to Boston , I will choose your apartment again !"

The neighborhood is beautiful and is close to interesting things. In the photo, the airbnb room is down the small staircase to the left. Everything was very clean and nice."

Due to a last minute cancellation, he offered to upgrade me for free to a studio apartment right at the river, and just a 5-minute walk from his place. It ended up being fantastic - clean, convenient, cozy, and had everything I needed. The check in and check out was smooth, Jinchen was very willing to accommodate my schedule and always super responsive. He recommended I use Hubway (the bike share system), which ended up being a great tip as I ended up going all over the city and not using the public transportation once. I would definitely book with Jinchen again."
8351880,78008532,2016-06-05,68833678,Adam,"Jinchen and Caroline were fantastic hosts. Welcoming and warm, helpful and respectful."
The location to the Back Bay and/or Fenway (longer walk,but walkable) was perfect. Especially for Hybes Convention Center.,,,,
The room was apart of an apartment creates from the back and below ground of a house.,,,,,
The bedroom had a queen bed,snugly fit in a room. Shared bathroom. The entrance is tucked in an alley,but again in a very nice neighborhood.,,,
Definitely consider if heading to Boston.,,,,,

8351880,79555323,2016-06-13,9290487,Fayth,"Jinchen and Caroline were very accommodating hosts!  If you are looking to be close to Newbury and Boylston, then this apartment is your best bet as it is only 2-3 blocks away to its many shops, restaurants, and bars. The Charles River is also a hop and a skip away! The apartment had everything we needed, and was quite cozy. There is a smaller refrigerator outside the bedroom stocked with beverages that Caroline had graciously offered, which was a nice addition! The only thing I would advise is that if you have bad knees or trouble climbing stairs - you may have a bit of difficulty getting downstairs to the bedroom as the spiral staircase is a bit tight. Overall, our stay at Jinchen and Caroline's apartment was quite lovely and you really cannot beat the location!"
8351880,81435958,2016-06-23,25678745,Stanley,Had a very good stay.  Thank you Jin for being a very good and accommodating host.  Loved the fully stocked fridge and very clean bathroom.  Location was very ideal.

The room is very small and there's a strong odor when you walk in, but that's somewhat expected for the price/location combo you get."

Could use just a couple more things in the kitchen if you are planning on cooking (which you don't need to with so many great restaurants within walking distance). The check-in process was smooth. The only downside for our stay was the street noise, but that's expected when you're staying in the centre of a big city. Would definitely recommend."
4118162,21854228,2014-10-25,1870229,Erik,The apartment was great! The host made it really easy to get into even though I was arriving at 1am. I would highly recommend staying here if you have the chance.
4118162,22547089,2014-11-09,22654040,James,"The apartment could not have been more perfect in its location, set up, and management.  I loved being so close to the financial district (for work), Downtown Crossing for daytime shopping, and public transpotation for everything else.  Adam was a wonderful host.  I had a problem accessing the wifi when I arrived, and he had it taken care of extremely quickly.  Very quick to respond to every email.  I really enjoyed my stay and hope to reserve the apartment again on my next visit."

The Compass staff was also very nice and accommodating when we arrived early and needed to stay later than check out time. If we are ever in Boston again we will definitely stay here again.

Adam did a great job communicating about how to get into the apartment and leave it at the end.  This was a huge relief since we arrive at mid-night and left in the early evening.  The apartment had all the necessities for cooking a simple meal, relaxing, laundry, etc.  It was a great experience and I would definitely contact Adam for a host on AirBNB again."
4118162,51810440,2015-10-24,46270240,David,"Our stay was great. The apartment was modern, spacious. The location was bang in the middle of the shopping district (however if you are a light sleeper you may find the noise at night a challenge)."

4118162,52521783,2015-10-30,45643585,Faisal,"As a first experience with Airbnb, I enjoyed it. The price was a good deal compared to the surrounding hotels. The apartment was good size for 2 people with nice living area and average sized kitchen. The location was excellent in downtown Boston but it was a bit noisy specially at night (If you have light sleep don't stay downtown). Adam (the host) was responding to my inquiries and question in an appropriate time even late in the evening and he was very helpful. I would stay with Adam again but in different location."
4118162,53909809,2015-11-14,6442632,Justin,"Loved staying here! Seriously great location, and the apartment was impeccably clean. From extra towels right down to thoughtful kitchen items, it has everything you'd need for an extended stay. Check-in was pretty easy, no hassle. Everything is communicated via e-mail ahead of time, and if you have any troubles, there's a super friendly consigner right next to the building entrance. I only visit Boston a few times a year, and I'd absolutely love to stay here again in the future."

The only small issue was that the smoke detector was low on battery so it chirped for a while but then went off. Adam offered to check it out, which was great."

We used it to go everywhere since the T is literally right outside the building.  From the airport, we took a bus to the T - no need for a cab!"
The condo was clean and felt homey.  We were a little worried about the bed situation (would it be comfortable,etc?) and it turned out just fine.  We slept like babies every night.  I'm sure getting in 20,"000 steps a day helped!\"",,,
4118162,74705545,2016-05-16,45824898,Drew,"The unit was perfect and in a great location.  The building entrance opens to a slightly sketchy street, but that's Boston..."
The only complaint is that the thermostat became locked shortly after we arrived.  No one seemed to be able to help and it remained on Cool but set to 90 degrees until we left.  Fortunately,the weather was nice and we just kept the windows open the whole time.,,,,

The pictures reflect the apartment very well, the neighborhood is quiet, and we felt safe walking at night from the T-station to her place."
As this was my first time in Boston,Liz shared many valuable tips and insights about Boston. I can recommend a stay with Liz without reservations.,,,,

Elizabeth's home reflects her delightful personality, neat, clean, singularly decorated with lovely artwork and meaningful antiques & treasures. Her style is as warm and open as she is. The bedroom was very cozy, roomy & comfortable (it was a very cold & wintery Boston weekend) and the bathroom extremely clean and well stocked. The shower was a good flow and the water nice and hot despite a 10 degree winter day outside. Elizabeth's delicious banana bread is truly homemade and the coffee perfectly brewed.

The convenience was equally matched by her warm and thoughtful hospitality - she had even gone the extra mile to discover and accommodate my special dietary needs. The accommodations were superb, and Liz's world-view, enlightened by her vast travels and great experiences, made wonderful evening conversation. I will not hesitate to add the \"\"McGrath Suite\"\" to my short list of future away-from-home destinations!\""
4262255,28749282,2015-03-29,29474502,Phoebe,"other BnB. Elizabeth proved to be an excellent host.  Firstly, she was very accommodating and pleasant when I arrived at her condo late due to the train.  Nonetheless, Elizabeth pleasantly welcomed me into her home.  Throughout my stay there, “Liz” was personable and very engaging; I really enjoyed our many conversations. I am especially grateful to “Liz” for allowing my family, who lives nearby her condo, to visit and talk. This of course ensured my feelings of comfort and confidence that I made the right BnB choice."
Liz’s personal talent is well represented in her décor.  True to a description of her condo,everything is pristine,comfortable and welcoming. Placement of her furnishings and pictures are so appropriate. Under any weather conditions; rainy,cloudy or sunny,it was a pleasure to arise early and enjoy the ambience.  The banana bread was the highlight of Elizabeth’s morning fare.,
The neighborhood felt friendly and peaceful. I would not hesitate to request a stay at Elizabeth’s again.  I would encourage anyone who is seeking a comfortable and friendly stay at an AirBnB to choose staying at Elizabeth’s condo in Jamaica Plain,Massachusetts.,,,,

She offered us food and drink, supplies like extra blankets, and great conversation. She really goes the extra mile to make sure that your time in Boston is everything that it could be. Thanks, Liz!"
4262255,30441917,2015-04-22,26509518,Ariel,"This was our first Airbnb stay and Liz made it a very positive experience.  Her condo had a very cheery feeling.  It was clean and the bed was very comfortable.  There was easy access to the T rail into downtown Boston.  We especially enjoyed the opportunity to have time to visit with this lovely lady, she is an Irish Jewel."
4262255,31301595,2015-05-04,16703091,Jeanne,The condo looked just like the picture.  It was very clean.  The neighborhood is diverse with lots of young families.  Walking distance to the T and downtown Jamaica Plain which has great shopping and restaurants.

As a first time visitor to Boston, I appreciated her tips on places to visit. I would definitely stay with Liz again! Thanks for a fantastic experience and it was a pleasure meeting and visiting with her."
4262255,32341917,2015-05-17,29958701,Stuart,"Elizabeth was a great host and the apartment was clean and spacious. Breakfast was always neatly laid out for us and there was plenty to choose from.  The location was about a 10 minute walk to the Orange line, and then another 10 minutes to get to downtown crossing, trains came frequently too so we didn't ever have to wait more than 5 minutes. So, the location turned out to be great.  It was also close to the Sam Adams Brewery which was a nice bonus, and definitely worth checking out."
4262255,33731220,2015-05-31,19127744,Annette,We had an absolutely wonderful stay. Elizabeth was easy to get ahold of and is really friendly and helpful. The space is clean and comfortable. Breakfast is a plus! We recommend staying in the sunny condo! :)

Great location--close to hiking trails in the woods, great restaurants on Centre Street in JP, and easy access to Boston; and unbeatable price!  We highly recommend Liz's B&B!  Thanks, Liz, for a great experience!"
4262255,35011095,2015-06-14,6621034,Levi,"I can't say enough about this host. She was accessible and welcoming, and did everything she could to make us feel welcome and comfortable. The space was gorgeous, the location is excellent, and she provides everything we could need and more. I especially appreciated how she was excellent company when we wanted it, very personal and interactive, but also gave us plenty of space, and did all of the little things to make our stay as comfortable as it could be. I could say more, but that would likely get tedious at some point. I would certainly stay here again, and I strongly recommend it for anyone looking for somewhere nice and affordable to stay in Boston."
4262255,36717548,2015-06-30,32707547,Jean-Claude,My wife and I really enjoyed our 3 night stay with Elizabeth. She is a wonderful and welcoming host and her condo is very quiet and beautifully decorated. We would not hesitate to stay with her again if we ever decide to go back to Boston.
Merci beaucoup Elizabeth pour votre gentillesse et peut-être à la prochaine!,,,,,

She went out of her way to make us breakfast on our schedule instead of hers and gave us delicious, nutritious choices of what we'd like to eat.  She made us feel like guests in her home and more like family."
4262255,38595573,2015-07-17,7027033,Joan,"Liz is a gracious host, and her place is lovely.  She made us feel welcome while being considerate of our privacy.  The breakfasts were great.  The location is quiet and close to the T.  We would be happy to stay with her again."

4262255,41818389,2015-08-09,37945711,Lola,"We enjoyed our 2 night stay with Liz. She greeted us with a warm welcome and helped us upstairs to her lovely condo.  The room we stayed in was perfect for 2 and was very comfortable.   Liz has a warm, open personality and we enjoyed sitting and chatting with her.  She  had a lot of info and brochures on things to do and was very helpful giving directions on the best way to get around Boston.  We were greeted the next morning with a wonderful breakfast."
Thank Liz for a wonderful experience.,,,,,

Elizabeth was a wonderful host, very responsive ahead of check-in, welcoming and friendly on arrival, and very pleasant to be around during my stay.  The apartment is lovely and the room was very comfortable, clean, in a quiet neighborhood convenient to the T... on its own I would highly recommend it to anyone, add to that Liz's generosity as a host (setting out breakfast in the morning, a glass of wine in the evening, cheerful conversation...) I really can't say enough."
4262255,42950266,2015-08-16,37891765,Katie,"My husband and I stayed with Liz for a short weekend getaway, and I cannot say how perfect our visit was! Liz was so accommodating - to the point where she even made me the tastiest gluten-free scones when she heard I had an allergy. She provided plenty of recommendations for where to go - both in Boston and JP - and is a kind, warm, and generous person. We actually found ourselves wishing that we could have spent more time with her, and will definitely be back for a longer visit. Liz lives in a nice neighborhood, her house is open and light, very comfortable, and is a 10-min walk to the T. She also lives in walking distance to a beautiful old cemetery, which I highly recommend walking to if you have the time. All in all, a perfect first experience with Airbnb!"
4262255,44004085,2015-08-23,40414031,Ilaria,"Me and my boyfriend went in Boston for three days and Elizabeth gave us all the precious details to discover this beautiful city more better than the best guide ! Every morning she made for us very delicious breakfast. The room is clean and very confortable and the house is near to the station, maximum 10 minutes by walk and 15 minutes to arrive at the centre of the city by train!"

Aside from the extreme convenience in location, Liz is a charming  and truly continental hostess, in every sense of the word. Her place has become a destination, not just a place to stay. Thanks, Liz! 'Til next time!"

4262255,49480066,2015-10-04,2863033,Christine,"Elizabeth was easy to communicate with by emails & phone, and made us feel very welcome in her third story condo. The light is really  lovely in her place, even though we happened to be in Boston for epic cloudy/rainy stretch. The room was private and comfy, the bathroom neat and clean, and her home is relaxing. Elizabeth was generous with her time in helping us sort out dining and shopping needs and offered us a very yummy breakfast both mornings. We happened to find much in common and really enjoyed our time with Elizabeth."
4262255,50277174,2015-10-11,1117297,Calista,"Liz is a fantastic host! She made us breakfast (thank you so much!) and is great company. We would definitely stay here again when in Boston. Neighborhood is lovely- lots of green space and close to the T, and the apartment is bright, spacious, and a great place to lay your head."

4262255,52839784,2015-11-02,43135686,Selma,Liz was a fantastic host! She went out of her way to welcome us into her home. We were comfortable and the condo was absolutely beautiful! She provided everything we needed and made herself available without being intrusive. The neighborhood is cute and the stop for the train was close which is very convenient for getting around Boston.
4262255,54868756,2015-11-25,2868501,Lyle,"Liz was the most amazing host! So friendly and comfortable to talk with, house was immaculately clean and bright. She gave us complete privacy when we wanted it, and we sat and talked with her for hours when we were able to. A perfect balance! House was lit all around with natural sunlight and had the quiet peacefulness that comes with staying in a sleepy little neighborhood, but we felt that the city was completely accessible once we got used to the walk to the train (about 10 minutes) and then the 15-20 min ride into town on the T. Well worth this short ride in order to stay in such a lovely, cozy place."
4262255,56240366,2015-12-11,16703091,Jeanne,"This was our second visit with Elizabeth, and just as the first she was very welcoming and a wonderful hostess.

She was available to answer our questions and she even woke up earlier to make us a breakfeast. The condo was spotless. There are many free parking spaces in the street, we were parked right in front of the house for 3 days. The property is located about 10 minutes walk from the train station, it is very easy to get to the station. In 30-40 minutes you can get anywhere in the city. I would definitely recommend people to go at Liz place, everything was perfect!"
4262255,68738232,2016-04-06,25469969,Thorsten,"Staying with Liz is like meeting old friends: Right from the beginning we were heartedly greeted and felt immediately welcome. The room was as described, the request for a second blanket fulfilled right away and the breakfast was tremendous (no need to have lunch!). In addition, Liz gave us great advice re public transport, dinner options etc.  Though the room is located outside downtown it is only a 10min walk to the T station and then a 15min ride with the T into the heart of the city. You cannot do anything wrong when staying with Liz!"
4262255,70696934,2016-04-19,2472608,Steve,Elizabeth was a perfect host.  She welcomed us into her home with a warm and inviting invitation for a cup of coffee or tea.  She prepared breakfast and was most accommodating.  I look forward to staying with her again next time I visit Boston.

Even though the weather did not cooperate for us during our weekend, it was such a comfort to come back to Liz's place- warm, clean, and inviting. The breakfast spread was delicious, healthy, and filling. Liz is very kind, friendly, and easy to talk to. She gave us very helpful tips and recommendations on which places to visit and restaurants to eat at. The neighborhood is safe, and the walk to the subway was a nice and easy 12-15 minute walk. From there, all the sites we wanted to see in Boston were very easily accessible. We would stay at Liz's again the next time we visit Boston!"
4262255,74895809,2016-05-17,4089797,Monise,"Liz is fantastic, her rental is fantastic, and we immediately felt at home. My daughter and I slept well, ate well, and maneuvered easily in her neighborhood. Many restaurant choices nearby. Parking directly in front of her condo or within very close proximity was easy whatever time we arrived. The neighborhood was quiet, so quiet we slept with the windows open a bit. The bed's mattress was nicely firm but not too much so. Sharing the bathroom posed no problems and it was very clean. Our trip to the Darmouth area (Vermont) was just under 2.5 hours during rush hour.  Ideal location with excellent hospitality, which I highly recommend."
4262255,75860061,2016-05-23,6458632,Jasmin,Liz was a fantastic host. She made us a delicious banana bread and left the table set for breakfast. This made our short visit in Boston very comfortable.

You can walk out the door and it feels like the whole city is right there. Literally around the corner from Hanover st and all of the North End. A perfect place to stay if you want to see the Boston."

The listing was exactly what I expected. It was located in a great part of Boston. There were many great Italian restaurants in the neighborhood, and a 7-11 1-2 blocks away, which was extremely convenient."
I was in town for work for 2-3 days after attending a wedding in Cape Cod over the weekend. This apartment was a great all-around option for me. The price was much cheaper than hotels in the area during that time. I would definitely stay here again if I travel to Boston moving forward. The bed was comfortable,the apartment was clean and tidy,the appliances were very nice and modern,the shower was awesome,"and having a washer/dryer available in the apartment was clutch.\"",
2898226,15499785,2014-07-10,4391452,Dan,Ben was an awesome host.  He had clear instructions regarding check-in and check-out.  His home was perfectly put together when I arrived.  Fantastic location!  I would definitely stay here again!!

2898226,16174110,2014-07-22,5655800,Matthew,"A lovely apartment in an excellent part of Boston. Right in the North End with any number of wonderful Italian restaurants, and a short walk to the rest of downtown. This was a very short notice booking and Ben responded promptly, answering all my questions in no time at all. Highly recommended."
2898226,16234997,2014-07-23,18117081,Tembre,"The Good:  The place is conveniently located in a nice area, close to all that the North End has to offer for someone who is on foot.  There is a Hubway station nearby for those who wish to explore the rest of the city by bike.  There was a nice amount of privacy in the building, we did not see another person during our 2 night stay there.  We felt very safe here."
The Bad:  The host's communication was very poor.  We asked for an early check-in time 2 days prior to our arrival to store our luggage,but Benjamin never responded to our request.  We showed up at the pre-determined noon check-in time and tried to buzz-in at the front door.  No one responded and we spent 30 minutes waiting outside until finally our host buzzed us in remotely.  We arrive in the unit and there were multiple boxes from Amazon cluttering the space.  The sheets from the previous guest were still on the bed and their used towels were still hanging up in the bathroom.  The waste baskets were close to full.  The toilet had rings and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months.   Clearly,the host had not had anyone clean-up between guests so we had to do this ourselves.  At 12:20pm the day before we departed we asked Benjamin if we could check out at 2 pm instead of 12 (check-in and check-out are both at noon,leaving no time to clean in between guests).  He then informed us that he had committed an 8 AM check-in time for his next guest and apologized for not informing us of this sooner.  We asked him if he expected us to be out of there by 8 and he did not respond.  We contacted AirBnB to notify them of our experience up to this point,and then messaged him to notify him that we had done so.   This resulted in an immediate response that we could now check-out at noon as we had initially planned for,"and that he believed we escalated things too quickly which he stated would be reflected in his review of us.  We told Benajmin that we would be out of the unit by 12 and that was the last message communicated by either party.   The next day  we checked out of the unit as we had found it and expect that no one came by to clean up after us.   Overall the location of the place was great for our needs and the unit overall was quite comfortable.  The lowered rating is due to the communication and attitude from the host and the lack of cleanliness. \""

Comme Benjamin nous l'avait indiqué, l'appartement se trouve dans l'état laissé par l'occupant précédent (pas de ménage). Dans notre cas, nous avons donc trouvé de la vaisselle non nettoyée, des draps non lavés et  des serviettes sur le sol. En dehors de cela, l'appartement correspond parfaitement à la description: il est très bien situé dans le centre de Boston et possède les commodités présentées dans le descriptif."

The appartment could have been a little cleaner (bathroom),but it was extremely comfortable  and modern.,,,,
The best part of this deal was Benjamin who was available and really fast to answer our questions. This made the trip a lot less stressful because I knew I could rely on him if anything came up.,,,,,

2898226,16754077,2014-08-01,3390758,Sarah,"We stayed in Benjamin's apartment for a night in July. It was a last minute booking and Benjamin was quick to respond and easy to contact. The apartment was great -exactly as described! It was clean, modern and very very comfortable. The location is amazing, close to the waterfront with lots of bars/restaurants. We even considered trying to extend our stay and cancel our other accommodation! I definitely recommend staying here."

His place is perfectly situated in the city. Everything is a short walk away,with the waterfront on one side,little Italy on the next main street over,and Quincy Market a few minutes away. His neighbourhood is nice enough,and the building a little bit dated,but you wouldn't know once you walk through his door.
All in all,"we had a great trip to Boston and much thanks to Benjamin and his flat! \"",,,,

Compact and homey, the apartment is very comfortable. Communication with Benjamin was very clear and quick, which is highly appreciated.

My host, Ben, was instantly responsive, provided all the details I needed about access and use of everything from the wifi to the universal remote, and was accessible during my stay to answer questions that popped up. Great, great host. The apartment is perfect for one or two guests, was spotless and everything was in perfect working order. The North End location was ideal for access to restaurants, shopping and night life. The photos are all recent and show the apartment exactly as I found it. So happy that I rented from Ben instead of getting a hotel room for my business trip. Will happily stay there again."

2898226,20433960,2014-09-29,20037359,Jenny,"This was a great place to stay for a weekend in Boston. It is near everything that is happenin, and is walking distance to the T that takes you to the airport, and the T that takes you anywhere else. The place was very neat and modern. It is comfortable for up to 4 people if you share the bed and futon. The price is definitely a steal compared to other listings for what you get and is a great location."
Because Ben may not be around in to check you in before the last tenant leaves,the cleanliness of the apartment will be dependent on the tenants before you. We got lucky and our tenants were clean,but they told us that they stayed after a bunch of guys who partied so they had to clean up a bit.,,,
"Overall I recommend the place! \"",,,,,
2898226,20521606,2014-09-30,5869263,Abigail,"The apartment was exactly as depicted on AirBnb, small and tidy, also close to restaurants and nightlife. Overall it was a very pleasant experience and we would book again."

We werent even sure if they were clean or not.  No hand soap in the bathroom, a box of toilet paper in the middle of the living room."

2898226,21789613,2014-10-24,21592650,Evelyn,"The apartment was just as depicted on the website. Loved the location, right on the water and close to absolutely everything. Steps from the Freedom Trail and wonderful Italian restaurants, it was very easy to get around from here. Ben was pretty prompt to respond to most questions/concerns via text message. Only things that I was not pleased with were the lack of towels available in the apartment (there was only one towel for two people), there were stains on the bed spread and the garbage in the bathroom was overflowing and there was no hand soap in the bathroom. Apartment was moderately clean. Would recommend staying here solely for the location."
2898226,22103732,2014-10-30,10937450,Lynn,A great location for our stay in Boston. Walking distance of everything you would need to see in Boston if you only have a few days to visit. On the doorstop of many Italian restaurants with its close proximity to the Italian quarter. Apartment as described. Would recommend to anyone planning a Boston visit.

The apartment is very nice, but the people before us did very little cleaning.  I think most people wouldn't mind paying a cleaning fee to assure it's tidy with clean linens on the bed.  Great apartment and value, and I would definitely book again if available on my next trip to Boston."
2898226,34253387,2015-06-06,515625,Ashley,I had a nice and tidy stay at Benjamin's apt. It was very convenient from booking to departing. The location is ideal if you are interested in exploring the North End and waterfront of Boston.

The place was neat and clean, and perfect for what we needed. The only problem was there were two entrances into the apartment complex and we tried entering from the wrong one. Once inside everything was great. Benjamin even suggested some great places for us to grab a bite to eat."
2898226,35027722,2015-06-14,8998112,Bj,"This is a nice apartment in a nice location. Benjamin was responsive and communicative before and during our stay. We had no problems with that. As has been stated in previous reviews, the unit and arrangements are just as he describes them. On that note, it is clearly stated in the description that occupants who leave on Wednesdays are requested to clean up after themselves and change the linen for the next guest. We arrived on a Thursday to let ourselves in, and there was definitely evidence of the previous occupants upon arrival. The apartment was lightly picked up. A couple empty water bottles were sitting on the kitchen counter. We THINK the bed sheets were changed. The bed was made anyway and there was a pile of used sheets and towels in the corner of the bedroom. However, there was only one clean bath towel that my wife and I had to share for the wash basin and showers during the two days we stayed there. The bathroom was not clean. The toilet and sink counter were quite soiled which we had to thoroughly clean ourselves before we were willing to use them. Note the bed is a full size bed which isn’t big enough for the two of us. We found the extra sheets in the living room to make up the sofa pull-out so we each had a bed to sleep on. The bedroom AC unit does an adequate job of cooling the bedroom but not the rest of the apartment. It is also quite noisy. So, on those hot Boston nights that could be a problem for anyone who doesn’t like the heat or noise when they’re sleeping. We enjoyed the large flat screen TV which was perfect for watching our team in the NBA Finals after we arrived on Thursday night. This can be a good place to stay if you’re willing to put up with the above, but my wife and I personally prefer the more personal touch of in-between-guest cleanings and restocking, even if it means paying a little more."
2898226,35162180,2015-06-15,9030945,Alex,"Location is great. Place had not been cleaned prior to our arrival. Bed not made. Amenities of place as advertised, easy to get around from apartment location."

Ben was friendly and responsive. Cleanless of the appartment depends on previous tenant, since Ben may not be around to check you in. We were not lucky and had to spent a couple of hours for cleaning&laundry. But Ben  offered a discount for the inconvenience. Overall I recommend the place!"
2898226,36970067,2015-07-03,34357054,Nicole,"The place was exactly as Benjamin has described. Clean too, especially for having someone stay their the night before us.  The location is PERFECT walking distance to everything! Didn't have the best communication with Benjamin when it came to our check in time as he was supposed to get back to me and just never did. I would also bring a spare blanket and such if you have someone sleeping on the couch as you don't have to take from the bed. But overall an good stay!"
2898226,37646174,2015-07-09,5720663,Rebecca,"Fantastic location!!!  Within walking distance to harbor, subway, bike rentals, awesome Italian district, Quincy Market...basically whatever you need!!!  The apartment was clean, exactly as expected and comfortable.  Benjamin was easy to reach and responded in a timely manner.  Would definitely rent again!!!"
2898226,37816397,2015-07-10,25922435,Sally,"This is a great little well-appointed apartment, in a super location in a fantastic neighborhood... wish I had been there longer than one night (!). The value is VERY good for the area.  Ben was very responsive and easy to communicate with  (text/email).  Although my stay was only one night, he was generous in allowing me to do a load of laundry, which I so appreciated."
Note --- Ben  may ask that you change the sheets on the bed and put in  washer/dryer for the next guest.... not a big deal,but if you are expecting hotel-clean and this to be done for you,this may not be your place.   When I arrived the towels I was to use were wet and in the dryer... again,not a big deal,tho a little inconvenient.. That,and taking the time to process the sheets thru washer/dryer before leaving and make the bed.  Just be sure you know you might be asked to do this so you are not disappointed.
Overall,"this was a sweet little place in a fantastic location for a great price!!   Ben was very nice and accommodating...  I recommend it! \"",,,,

Uber to the airport was about 10 minutes with no traffic.  Apartment was perfect for our two night stay.  Ben always responded promptly to phone calls or texts.  Would stay there again on our next trip to Boston.

The apartment is small, but cozy and comfortable."
The TV worked,but channels were limited. However,if you have a Netflix,or premium channel account (e.g.,HBOGO),access was available. It took a little while to figure out the remote
Although we would have appreciated a coffee maker in the apartment,there were numerous cafes and pastry shops nearby. Be sure to visit both Modern Pastry and Mike's Pastry for cannoli's and a wide variety of pastries; but get coffee from Cafe' Vittoria or My Cousin's Place.,,,,
Finally,for those for whom it matters,the bed is a full size bed,not a queen.,,

"I believe the dryer has some issues and needs to be cleaned.   It was full of water and dirt when we tried to use it.\"",,,,,
2898226,49971303,2015-10-08,34766551,Jenae,The location was great and exactly as pictured.  Enjoyed our stay!
2898226,50925615,2015-10-16,8094944,Anwen,"A very happy experience. The location is good,which is not far from subway. The host is kind,although we did not meet each other."
2898226,52316759,2015-10-28,41804143,Meghan,"The listing description was very detailed and accurate - the apartment looked just like the pictures! It was small, but plenty of space for my sister and I for the night and 2 days we spent there."
The location was ideal for what we were looking for - close to the North End,Quincy Market,Faneuil Hall ... so plenty of shopping,restaurants and beautiful spots to walk along the water. I use to visit that area of Boston a lot about 5-10 years ago,so it was great to see all the familiar spots!,
The apartment was well-kept,but there was some dust and a little dirt in corners. Also,the trash was full when we arrived and caused a bit of an odd smell in the bathroom. The only other thing I would mention is there wasn't a lot of silverware (looked like 2 place settings which was fine for the 2 of us,but could be an issue if you were looking for more).,,
Overall,"it was a really great experience - it was convenient and easy for us which was most important. We didn't have any issues at all. Thank you!\"",,,,
2898226,52479481,2015-10-30,32886668,Andrew,"Benjamin's apartment is excellent. His instructions were really clear and we arrived, stayed and left without any problems. The apartment is located in the North End area, very close to many fantastic Italian restaurants and cafes. It's also close to downtown Boston and all the attractions there. The apartment itself was clean, warm and had everything we needed. I would definitely recommend this apartment for your stay in Boston!"

"I did change sheets before leaving but there could be notes as to whatbis clean and what is not. Sheets were just tossed in ottoman. \"",,,,,
2898226,53223876,2015-11-06,24659447,Brianna,"I loved staying here. It was an excellent place to relax after a long day of walking around all of Boston. The living room was cozy and the bed was a memory foam mattress, so comfortable! The apartment is near everything it is close to north end, Fanuiel Hall, the waterfront and many great restaurants. Ben suggested we eat Paulis for lunch and it was a great recommendation. We arrived right after the cleaning lady left and the place was spotless. I have no complaints! I would defiently stay here again!"
2898226,53828490,2015-11-13,22725200,Camilla,Benjamin has been really kind and his apartment is really in a good position. I suggest his place !!
2898226,54336556,2015-11-18,47994677,Erica,"Loved it! The location is amazing and the place was tidy. Also he had iPhone and Apple Watch chargers which made my life a bit easier. Oh, and the blanket on the couch is SO soft. A+ blanket!"
2898226,54430968,2015-11-20,2227733,Pamela,This is my second time staying at Benjamin's place.  The location is the best and we love the North End!  The apartment was clean and bed is comfortable.  I would recommend to anyone staying here that they take their shoes off immediately as Ben has a downstairs neighbor who came up both times when we were there requesting this.  Both times it was literally 3 minutes from the time we entered the apartment and nobody had heals on.  This last time it was only 7:30pm.  We would stay again if Ben's apartment is available!
2898226,55309619,2015-11-29,5112588,Ahmad,"The best location in Boston, the apartment is close to almost everything, I loved the Italy town that is two steps from the apartment. The apartment is super clean and neat. I will always choose him for Boston"
2898226,55687241,2015-12-04,49815498,Ullrich,"We did not meet Benjamin in person, but he was extremely hospitable and helpful.  He made us really welcome in his home."

2898226,65187250,2016-03-11,30715662,Phil,"A great way to see downtown Boston!  Situated right on the harbor in the scenic North End of the city, the apartment is a short walk to some of the best Italian restaurants, groceries, and pastry shops in the city.  It's also right around the corner from the New England Aquarium, Quincy Market, and all of the other downtown Boston attractions.  Not to mention there's a Starbucks across the street for morning coffee."
Benjamin made getting into the apartment very easy and the place was comfortable,clean,modern,and very quiet. Benjamin was always available for any questions and his apartment made for a great vacation to Boston for my wife,myself,"and our two young children.  \""
2898226,65940618,2016-03-18,28908235,Warren,"There were positives and negatives to this place.  The positives: 1. Great location.  Not far from the airport.  A block away from the heart of Little Italy. A 20 minute walk to Boston Common and 15 minutes to TD Garden.  2. The host was very responsive to any complaints or questions.  3. The bed, couch and recliner were very comfortable and the wireless internet was FAST.  The Negatives: In my requirements I asked for a washer and dryer.  They were there, but neither worked.  Wasted 4 hours trying to do a wash.  Coin laundry was in basement but no change machine.  Had to wander the neighborhood looking for change.  I also stipulated Cable TV.  It had it, but the worst cable ever.  10 channels; the 3 networks, 2 pbs, 2 shopping channels and 3 indy stations that only played horrible reruns from the 60's 70's and 80's. Not a single sports or news channel.  The place was not dirty but certainly was not clean.  Kitchen sink and counter were a bit grungy.  My daughter slept on couch in living room.  Very comfortable, but at 7 in the morning the TV and kitchen light would all of a sudden come on.  Also there's no place to unpack.  Absolutley no closet or drawer space, so be prepared to live out of your bag."
2898226,66882249,2016-03-25,54663553,Christina,"Staying with Benjamin in Boston was our first time with Airbnb. The apartment was great, super well located, it was clean and comfortable and quiet. Since this seems to be important to a lot of people, the bed was very comfortable. If you have a third person sleeping on the couch, the little kitchen green house is a little annoying, even with the curtain. And the elevator is a bit frightening! Take the stairs - they're cool!  But all-in-all very recommendable! Thank you, Benjamin, for having us!"
2898226,67904324,2016-04-01,24668070,Jamie,"The location of this place was great. Right on the freedom trail and walkable to the T, and other great Boston destinations. The pictures made the space look very spacious, but it's pretty small open concept kitchen / living room and then the bathroom, and bedroom. The space was tidy, but definitely not clean. There were coffee grounds on the kitchen counter, old bananas left out, and dust bunnies in all rooms. The bathroom was the dirtiest - some kind of short hair all over the bath mats, soap scum on the counter, and toenails / fingernails on the floor. Also, there was only one set of towels, so that was difficult since there were 2 of us. It was not what I expected considering the cost. I would use this space again, if it was guaranteed it was professionally cleaned prior to my arrival."
2898226,68872779,2016-04-07,54943288,Hannelore,"The apartment is located in the north end of Boston, very close to the city center. It is a little smaller than it appears on the pictures, however it was fine for the three of us and it's equipped with a lot of nice technical features. The only unfavourable thing was that there was still laundry in the washing machine, a running dish washer and it overall gave the impression that someone just left the apartment. Besides this we enjoyed our stay in Boston and we had a great time in Benjamin's apartment."
2898226,69731761,2016-04-13,52355129,Cassandra,The host canceled this reservation 71 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

Even though I didn't notice the guide is in the confirmation email,he still kindly helped me to get into the house. The house is also very spacious. My parents and I had a great time in the house. It's also very convenient,we made breakfast by ourselves,we did the laundry,"and we had a nice sleep. Thanks!\"",
2898226,71754681,2016-04-28,6807269,Jeff,Bens apartment was a great base of operations for our explorations of Boston. Restaurants and coffee were abundant and easy to access. The subway was down the street through the Italian district and the Freedom Trail was just a few steps away. Great centralized location for your trip to see everything there is to do in the city. Perfect spot for a couple traveling together or a solo traveler.
As a host,Ben was responsive,flexible,"and always friendly and easy to work with. \"",,
2898226,72885049,2016-05-05,14541644,Charmaine,"Ben's apartment was a great base  for our city explorations. There were a lot of restaurants and coffee shop around. The Freedom Trail was right at the corner. Ben was responsive and flexible. The place was comfortable, clean, modern, and very quiet."
2898226,74058089,2016-05-12,54531458,Susan,10 out of 10 for location - the North End is historic and full of life with great bars and restaurants - although finding a breakfast spot was challenging.
This was our first experience with Airbnb,our advice is to read all info carefully and have a easy ready means of communicating with the host as Benjamin is an absentee host.,,,,
We initially had a huge problem accessing the apartment. This was a disappointing start,we did get things sussed with help from Benjamin.,,,,
"\"\"Techno Mancave\"\" would describe the space. It felt as if the last person had just left moments before our arrival as pizzas filled the fridge",dishes in the unclean sink,bench unwiped and rubbish in the bins. The bathroom was filthy and we were uncertain whether the bed had clean sheets.,,,
We also felt there was a lack of information and guest guidelines in the apartment.,,,,,
Expect a visit from lady downstairs to ask you to remove footwear upon entering the apartment,she appeared 5 minutes after our stressful initial entry.,,,,
In conclusion,"location superb but lots of room for improvement.\"",,,,
2898226,74871883,2016-05-17,67239413,Osmund,Overall a great experience staying at ben's apartment! Clean apartment with amenities such as netflix for some downtime! 5min walk from boston's little italy. 10min walk towards the city.

It was my first Airbnb,and overall went smothly.,,,,
One thing to take in consideration,this is not an apt that 100% for airbnb,he actually lives there sometimes,so there will be things that he owns such as shoes/clothes etc.,,
Theres an awesome kitchen,wifi and over everything is thought out.,,,,

2898226,76326499,2016-05-26,54019903,Graham,"Very comfortable apartment, great location for North End/Little Italy. 5 minute walk from the Aquarium T stop (2 stops from the airport). Everything is as described - was really nice to be able to have breakfast each morning in the apartment."
Access to the apartment using the Bluetooth app took a while to connect each time we returned but we did always eventually get in. The doorbell links directly to Benjamin,and he is very responsive to any problems. There is a lot of tech in the apartment - chargers everywhere which was useful! If there was someone sleeping on the couch,"the sound and light from the little garden in the kitchen could be distracting. \"",,,
2898226,80198392,2016-06-16,50004405,Hillary,Perfect location to see all Boston has to offer!
2898226,82959621,2016-06-30,20984563,Kumiko,Fantastic location and comfortable space with all the amenities of home. We loved being a quick walk to the hustle and bustle of the North End and being so close to the water. Thanks for a great visit to Boston!
2898226,84503738,2016-07-07,7165869,Silvia,Benjamin is a very nice and responsive host. His appartment is as described and everything was clean. We liked this area because it is quiet yet close to good restaurants and places of interest.
2898226,85346450,2016-07-11,27635706,Kyle,Great location! Right off of the freedom trail in Boston's historic North End Italian neighborhood. Very cozy and comfortable.
DEFINITELY make sure you get the August app and check it before you get there. Benjamin was very helpful,but as he was out,"he was not readily accessable.\"",,,
2898226,86121757,2016-07-15,71553642,Mallory,Absolutely great location in the Boston's North End. Apartment is small but works for two people. We were a disappointed in the cleanliness of the apartment when we arrived. We had to change the sheets and the floors were messy. The ac worked but only in the bedroom and is very loud if you're a light sleeper. The place worked for our stay but didn't meet expectations. The location saved the stay for sure.
2898226,87577925,2016-07-20,66762026,Steffen,Excellent location! Apartment is clean and looks exactly like on the pictures. We had some difficulties to find the best settings for the air condition but that's probably due to us.
All in all,"we would definitely come back!\"",,,,
2898226,90780490,2016-08-02,21742107,Esteban,"\"We had a really bad experience at Ben's place. Ben did not tell us that his shower was leaking to the neighbor's apartment below until we were living in his apartment. More importantly, this means that Ben knew about the leak, which had been a recurring issue for months, but still he rented the apartment. Obviously, as soon as we showered, his neighbor knocked on the door. We and Ben's neighbor had to deal with the plumbing issue with the corresponding delay to our daily visits. What is more, the fix of the shower leak could only be temporary given some imperfections in the shower tile, which will take much longer to get fixed. If you still decide to rent this apartment, expect an email from Ben encouraging you to keep your showers \"\"on the short side\"\" just as he did with us. Unfortunately"
2898226,91275593,2016-08-04,70674902,Jim,"The apartment is very nicely done up as per the photos with a lot of  gadgetry, such as ipad/phone chargers by the bed. Seems like a small thing, but made it easy for us coming from Europe and not having to break out the adapters right away. Arguably, the building itself is a bit tired looking in the common areas, but this is more than made up for by the apartment itself. The neighborhood is a bit on the noisy side if you need to have the windows open at night in the summer, but it's not a major issue. The key for this property is its fantastic location in the North End, minutes away from great Italian restaurants and bakeries as well as the waterfront. Overall, an excellent base for exploring Boston."
2898226,93771182,2016-08-13,1878028,Harriet,"Excellent location, right by Little Italy and ten min walk down to the harbour. Ben was very good at answering our questions. Apartment had everything we needed."

I was the first guest since a complete refurbishing of the apartment, so everything was pristine and new!  The sound system and TVs are state-of-the-art.  Susan kindly stocked the refrigerator with some basics, and the apartment is close to the south end where groceries are nearby.  Any guest should make use of the lovely rooftop at night, which has a magnificent skyline view of the city.  Overall, the best airbnb experience I've had, and I hope to stay again!!"
5088560,43441846,2015-08-19,812740,Tristan,What a FANTASTIC experience! I almost don't want to give away the secret that is Susan's gem of a home for fear that it won't be available the next time I'm in Boston : ).
Susan was an exceptional host,communicating with us immediately to make sure we had all the necessary info for a smooth arrival. She was also there to meet us as soon as we arrived with the keys and a quick tour.,,,,
The home is spectacular.,,,,,
All the appointments are top of the line and make for an inviting yet modern space. The bed in the master is extremely comfortable and was difficult to part with. The additional bedroom is fantastic as well. Slightly smaller but still very nice. Both bathrooms are beautiful with the larger of the two boasting a great,spacious shower.,,,,
The living room and kitchen are just as well thought out and Susan was kind enough to make sure we were stocked with all the required basics as well as a lovely bottle of wine! You could cook a gourmet meal there in a heartbeat.,,,,,
Not to be missed is the rooftop deck. It is absolutely breathtaking and was our favorite spot to end the day. The view of Boston in the evening will not disappoint.,,,,,
The South End location is wonderful and gave us easy access the outstanding restaurants and bars in the area. It is also next to several transportation options that can get you to any part Boston quickly.,,,,,
"Overall one of the best Airbnb experiences we have had. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a top notch home with wonderfully gracious and accommodating hosts!  \"",,,,,

The apartment is stylishly decorated and the lounge is great for relaxing in after a busy day out in Boston and the full kitchen has everything you would need for entertaining, although with so many great restaurants nearby we ate out all the time."
We were there for our son starting at Northeastern University and the location was great as only 5 minutes walking distance. Also couldn’t be more convenient to rest of Boston as walkable to Boylston & Newbury Street for shopping,had a T stop next door and a Wholefoods round the corner.,,,,
Check in and out was easy and Susan was always quick to respond. Would highly recommend and we have already rebooked to come back in October.,,,,,

The bedrooms are extremely quiet and comfortable so it was very easy to sleep soundly. The kitchen is very well appointed - had I wanted to cook, I would have had everything I needed. The roof deck is stunning and adds another glamorous detail to this otherwise already glamorous space.  Although the apartment looks lovely in the photos, it is even more beautiful in person. Renting this space ended up being less expensive than a moderate/nice hotel in Boston and our experience was ten times better. Susan met us upon arrival and was so caring and helpful to make sure we had everything we needed. She was very responsive before the trip as well, eager to help with any logistics. I will certainly return and stay when I am next in Boston!"
5088560,46921834,2015-09-14,41397312,Anna,Susan was the perfect host she emailed me all the information for the apartment and directions the day before. We were able to park around the block which was very easy. Two of our other guests flew in and it was a 25 dollar uber ride there. We got there early and susan was able to let us come early by one. She showed us the apartment how to use everything and had done nice snacks and wine for us. We opened s bottle and drank it up on the rooftop overlooking the city.  It was  a perfect start to 4 wonderful days spent with my sisters in a girls weekend.  Susan told about uber and we did it everywhere. We had the bus and down the block the train. But we just loved meeting all the uber drivers if we were too tired to walk. The apartment was central to everything.    The apartment was comfortable and clean. It was modern and new. We hanged out two night up on the rooftop  drinking wine talking and playing mah Jong.  It was spectacular.  We got some wonderful pictures too. Susan texted us everyday asking us if we needed anything and if we were comfortable.  We had s wonderful time and will be back there again. Thanks susan for your hospitality!!

Book here - you will not be disappointed! :) Susan was consistently and rapidly responsive to all of my communications, from first booking right through to leaving. She has been incredibly inviting. I arrived slightly later to her place than I'd expected, despite that her partner was still available to greet us and helped with bags. The apartment itself is truly stunning, modern fresh and clean, it looks exactly as it is on the pictures and is very secure with external and internal locking doors, and in a safe neighborhood too. The beds are very comfortable and the shower is a dream. Susan even provided some items ready in the fridge for our arrival - a VERY much appreciated touch!

The condo was a beautiful space to call home while we were visiting Boston.  The rooftop deck was spectacular, even during the cool fall evenings.  Susan had the refrigerator and cupboards stocked with basic items like water, milk, oj, eggs, cream, cinnamon rolls, english muffins, butter, etc... which was much appreciated since we had a late arrival.  The subway is about 100 yds away, which was so convenient to travel to anywhere  in Boston in a matter of minutes, without having to deal with traffic or parking.  Northeastern University is just around the corner, so plenty of restaurants, coffee shops and grocery close by.  We felt safe walking around at all hours of the day and evening."

Even though I live close to Boston I would definitely use it again for business or pleasure!  I highly recommend it to anyone for business or pleasure."

Staying in this home made our first holiday in Boston an amazing one that will be cherished forever. Susan is an exceptionally gracious host who provided more than we could ever ask for. Her attention to detail made our stay unforgettable...literally anything that we could possibly need was already there in the penthouse. She provided stellar recommendations for sightseeing, dining, shopping, and nightlife. Would rate my overall experience 6 stars if it were available. Can't wait to return and will without a doubt book this lovely penthouse again and again."
5088560,59859878,2016-01-16,26249761,Dahna,I had put up two coworkers from London at Susan's apartment and although I never got a chance to see it my coworkers would not stop raving about Susan's beautiful apartment. Susan was extremely thoughtful and made the check in process very easy for me (seeing as I was working with 3 other apartments as well it was much appreciated). They also requested to stay there every time they come into Boston! I'd say it was a success! Highly recommend it.
5088560,61918157,2016-02-09,54901444,Daud,"It was a fantastic place to stay in. The unit was well equipped and the main food supplies were available by the owner. Truly we needed nothing except our personal belongings. The location is marvelous close to two train stations and close to Prudential Center, Copley, and Newberry street. The owner were very cooperative and friendly. I will 100% recommend this unit for everyone I know."
5088560,62769778,2016-02-16,31946526,Yunan,"I spent a great Valentine's day in Susan' fantastic penthouse last weekend. And it was a great experience, for sure, Susan was such a considerate and adorable host. She had taken good care of us. Wish to meet Susan in person next time when Boston gets warmer:)"
5088560,63460452,2016-02-23,38873082,Tracy,"This penthouse was amazing! Susan and David were amazing host who greeted us at our arrival. Not only did they give us great recommendations but also stocked the kitchen with drinks and snacks! The penthouse was beautiful-just as the photos show, and the roof top patio was breathtaking! Looking forward to visiting during the summer!"
5088560,69532917,2016-04-11,52862413,Kelly,"Sue and Dave were incredibly thoughtful and gracious hosts.  Literally there was no detail they had not meticulously anticipated  to make our stay perfect.  From the gorgeously appointed accommodations, to breakfast foods stocked in the fridge, to restaurant recommendations, they have thought of everything.  On top of that the location is fantastic and we were happy to meet such nice people.  This is a very special place and Sue and Dave have done a wonderful job.  We will definitely be back!"
5088560,70685380,2016-04-19,34828245,Maia,"We booked this apartment for the weekend of the Boston Marathon, and our experience could not have been more perfect. The unit itself was gorgeous - the beds insanely comfortable, the kitchen great for cooking, and the roof deck amazing for basking in post-race beers (which Susan so-thoughtfully left at our door!). The location was crucial - easy train to the commons for the start, walk able to expo, close enough to hobble home after the finish. We also found plenty of great places to dine and get groceries nearby. It was the absolute perfect place to feel at home and like we could create a perfect environment for racing (comfy beds, home cooking) but still such a lovely environment that it felt like vacation!"
5088560,72158160,2016-05-01,40699152,Sidni,Staying at Sue's place was one of the best things of my Boston trip! Her and David met us at the door upon arrival and gave us a home orientation as well as the best options for eating out on the town. She was helpful from the moment of initial contact until the last moment when we left. It's impecable! Thanks a million!
5088560,73353068,2016-05-08,41293857,John,The best airbnb ever! This apartment is indeed stunning - beautifully remodeled with high-end finishes and tastefully furnished. Incredibly light filled and airy despite the constant rain and overcast conditions. The view from the rooftop desk was awesome (even with sideways rain and 40ish temps). Susan was a wonderful and attentive host - very concerned that we enjoyed our Boston visit in every way. Thanks.
5088560,74202862,2016-05-14,49500661,Ej,"411 was absolutely lovely. Sue and David greeted us, helped with our bags and gave us a personal tour. We booked last minute and the experience was wonderful. Would definitely stay there again!"
5088560,75645421,2016-05-22,68754055,Suzanne,"Absolutely the best place to stay in Boston!! Gorgeous penthouse condo within walking distance to Fenway, great shopping and restaurants...not to mention fabulous views from the rooftop patio. Susan and David truly thought of everything and made us feel at home the minute we arrived. We can't wait to book our next stay.!! :-)"
5088560,76649303,2016-05-28,30051379,Petter,This is a fantastic location and I highly recommend it. My colleague and I stayed for a week for business and it was really nice to have a calm place to relax and enjoy the sun on the roof deck. We went out to eat and made our own dinners at the flat. Some really nice restaurants around in the neighborhood.
Susan was very helpful from when we inquired about the place until we left. She made sure we were comfortable and gave us lots of recommendations for the stay.,,,,,
"I do hope to get back some time\"",,,,,
5088560,82677257,2016-06-28,58605950,Susan,"Susan and David were great hosts and on site. Welcomed us and made us feel at home. Provided information to surrounding area and checked in periodically  to make sure everything was comfortable and we were having a good vacation time. Penthouse was just like the pictures online. Roof deck was a great bonus and worth it.  Fantastic views. Unit was clean and well stocked. Located in an good area for walking around Boston. Close to good restaurants, shopping and transportation options.  Highly recommend."
5088560,87563154,2016-07-20,37732010,McGregor,"What an amazing place!! So much better than coming home to a hotel room. Susan and David are exceptional hosts and their place is comfortable, clean, spacious and well appointed. Susan is great about communicating with you prior to your arrival and during your stay to make sure everything is going well for you. Perfect for a a family with two small children. Sleeping accommodations are a little tight for 4 adults. The highlight had to be the rooftop deck. We had breakfast up there and were lucky enough to see the sunset while enjoying our favorite beverages. Boston is a beautiful city to see and because it's fairly condensed, it's easy to get around using the T and by walking. We walked MILES each day and were so happy to come back to this beautiful spot and relax after a long day. Susan and David, - THANK YOU, for helping us have a truly remarkable experience in Boston. If you're ever in Seattle - please give us a call. :)"
5088560,89675984,2016-07-29,57710817,Beate,"What a wonderful stay!! Everything was just great. Warm welcome, Sue and David even waited for us to welcome us. Stunning views From rooftop terrasse, perfect beds, incredible interior! Thank you again for being there!"
5088560,90765356,2016-08-02,67111880,Michael,"This was our first time using Airbnb and it far exceeded our expectations. Our hosts, Susan and David have done an incredible job furnishing their beautiful home and ensuring that guests have whatever they need to enjoy a perfect stay. Their home was immaculate and all the furnishings were modern and very comfortable. One of the highlights of our stay was the time we had on the private roof deck. There, we were able to enjoy some of the most spectacular views of the Boston skyline. That made our weekend and it is the best spot in Boston to enjoy an evening cocktail. I have seen many pictures of the interiors of other homes in the area and none compare to this one. We would definitely return!!"
5088560,92464594,2016-08-08,14649290,Ty,"Susan's place is remarkable!  Her and David were amazing host!  Hospitable, easy to get a hold of, and helpful with ideas of things to do and places to eat!  Their place was close to everything and so clean.  The pics don't do the place justice as it's even better than those if you can believe it!  If you're traveling to Boston for business or vacation their condo is the place to be!"
5088560,96251121,2016-08-22,21289686,Mike,"Susan and David are exactly what make Airbnb so amazing. From start to finish, they welcomed us into their beautiful space, and provided the perfect amount of help and communication throughout our stay. The location is fantastic, steps from the Back Bay T and tons of shops and restaurants. The space itself is very well appointed, and the roof deck is absolutely stunning. I would highly recommend this space!"
5088560,99638296,2016-09-05,91099705,Simone,"Susan's place was perfect, looked even better than her photos. Her furniture and appliances were high end, and very comfortable. My husband and I often travel to Boston, mostly to be with or help our daughters at Boston University or Northeastern University. This location was so close to my daughter's apartment (less than 5 minute walk), the hardware store, target, Fenway, many restaurants, and close to everything interesting in the South End of Boston."
Staying at an Airbnb felt like home,spacious and liberating.,,,,
"This was my first time using Airbnb and I would definitely do it again. It certainly helped that Susan's place was immaculate and exactly as was stated!\"",,,,,
13642397,85630977,2016-07-12,71564963,Dan,Colleens place was great.  It was exactly what we needed.  She offered tips on restaurants and was always there when we needed her.  The apartment was walking distance to everything we needed.  If you want a small quiet place on the north end this is the place.
13642397,86702442,2016-07-17,22590421,Anthony,"Colleen was incredibly easy to work with! Her place is in a perfect location for food, walking to sites, culture, and scenery. It was very clean and she even left soaps in the bathroom and suggestions for her favorite places."

13642397,88767724,2016-07-25,53228276,Adrienne,"We had a great experience staying at Colleen's place! We are a couple in our mid-twenties and the location and size was perfect for us. There was lots of stuff to do in the area and you can't beat staying in the North End. The place was very clean and cool in the mid-July weather. Colleen was awesome, very responsive and provided some great suggestions."
13642397,92080260,2016-08-07,84101351,Justin,"Colleen did a great job accommodating my girlfriend and me on our trip to Boston. The check-in was easy. The apartment was clean, and cozy. The location was fantastic, within walking distance to many popular historic sites of the North End. We parked our car in a parking garage in Charlestown, 25 min walking distance from the apartment. There were closer spots, but were more expensive. I would highly recommend this listing."
13813380,87496596,2016-07-20,1320332,John And Aurora,Dimitra was all you can ask for in a host and her place was fantastic. I would highly recommend!

9905304,61961493,2016-02-09,26096479,Asaf,Accurate listing and great Host. I and my family stayed in Hasan's apartment for a month. He was very helpful in providing complimentary tickets for the museums and tours. He also picked us up from the airport.  The apartment is a great location in heart of Downtown. Can walk anywhere and use public transportation. No need for a car. Five of us perfectly fit the apartment. The beds were very comfy and the rooms are very big and clean. We'd love to stay here again. Thanks Hasan.
13578911,94916272,2016-08-17,79288694,Stephanie,Great place to stay.
Very close to the beach and the subway.,,,,,
The host was always available to message and got back to me very quickly with help when I needed it.,,,,,
One thing was that there was no air conditioning in the apartment and it was very hot when I was there.,,,,,
"Overall I would recommend staying here. \"",,,,,
377474,1946635,2012-08-11,2172959,Shaun,Hermina is a nice host - affable and willing to impart information. The place is ok. There are a lot of rooms in the house but with two primary toilets so this tended to cause a delay in getting everyone out. We hit the peak of the heatwave and there was one portable aircon unit but the other room was left with a ceiling fan. Hence we only went back to the house in late at night when it was cooler. Area is close to a lot of Vietnamese restaurants - all pretty good. Near the JFK library as well.
377474,1999543,2012-08-16,2061000,Dominique,"Very nice experience. Hermina is a lovely  generous and trusty person. Her house is very well situated, only a few station from central Boston. Highly recommended!"
377474,2038687,2012-08-20,2520630,Davide,"Very nice place and host. The house is big, comfortable, clean, with a lot of space and four rooms, with 1,5 bathrooms. The host is very nice, and we are happy to have met her. She lives in the same house than the guests. The area is in Dorchester, that is not close to downtown Boston, but the subway is close to the house. The area is not very good, and there is nothing to do here, but it is safe (and the police station is close to the house)."
377474,4146575,2013-04-14,1984955,Steve,"Three of us stayed with Hermina for a whole week and we so loved being there! Her beautiful Victorian house is really spacious and well decorated with everything you need. Hermina could not be more friendly and welcoming, offering to help out in so many ways and lovely to meet."

377474,9052155,2013-12-03,9175301,Yung Ching,"My friends and I (total 10 people) lived in Hermina's Beautiful Victorian House during Thanksgiving. Although at first we had some confusions, Hermina and her helper, Donna always reply us in a short time. The location is good; it is easy to get to the Dunkin Donuts, McDonalds, and the red line station in only a few minutes. We bought one week pass for the subway and it's very convenient since we took subway every day to different areas in Boston. Personally, I think the best part of the house was the kitchen as it had almost everything we needed for cooking. For example, there was rice cooker that we could use to have rice for our dinner. Utensils were also enough for 10 people. Overall, we felt relaxed in the house; it gave us a feeling of home!"
377474,11172840,2014-03-24,9826368,Heather,"I stayed here while I was attending a convention with my family and friends. There were 8 of us total and we never felt like there wasn't enough room! Everyone loved the house and everything that was there. Our host recommended delicious places to eat that were in walking distance as well, which made our time here perfect."
377474,14155449,2014-06-13,9264911,Joe,"Overall, we had a very good experience at Hermina's house. We had a large group visiting Boston for a conference, and her house comfortably fit all of us. The house is very close to the red line, which made getting into Boston easy. The house was clean and comfortable, and I would stay there again without hesitation."
377474,14386689,2014-06-18,12507394,Roberta,"Timely communication, available to help if needed, provided a second person we could call on if we had any needs, and the house is very conveniently located for riding the subway."

377474,21698396,2014-10-22,16369374,Lisa,We as a large family renting this property were quite disappointed with our accommodation on our trip to Boston. We were under the impression that the house had 4 beds as advertised but in fact there were only 3 proper beds the rest of the beds turned out to be mattresses on the floor. The area is quite run down and we were advised by a nearby pub that we shouldn't be out alone after dark. Downtown boston is  around 20 mins on the train and the train station is a 5 min walk from the house. There is a supermarket & McDonald's nearby but not much else so we just used the house as a base but it was a pain getting back before dark every day.  On the whole I think the house was overpriced and we would not return to this house although it may be suited to a smaller  family/group.
377474,23161447,2014-11-24,22771342,Norman,Host was welcoming and accommodating for our large group. Checked up on us but did not disturb us.

Donna the caretaker/cleaner was there when they arrived and was SUPER nice! She really went out of her way, even helped us make coffee! The house was in a great location - near to the subway, there was a bar across the road (with fab food) and local stores and stuff nearby too."
377474,39276789,2015-07-22,30234008,Hien,"The house could really accommodate a lot of persons (we were a family of 10), and that made it so enjoyable !! We stayed there 4 nights. The neighbourhood is good, with lots of Vietnamese restaurants around, and supermarkets. Hermina, our host, was very nice to us, and discreet at the same time. I definitely recommend for large groups or families !!"

In terms of the neighborhood, Spanish seemed to be the first language. We did enjoy having a parking spot available on the back of the building."

8595650,72586612,2016-05-03,62489732,Aniuta,Wir haben eine wunderschöne Woche mit unserer kleinen Tochter (2) in Pauls Apartment verbracht.
Paul ist ein toller Gastgeber. Offen,freundlich und hilfsbereit. Er hatte jederzeit ein offenes Ohr für unsere Anliegen und seine Familie ist sehr nett.,,,,
Das Apartment liegt im Souterrain von Pauls Stadthaus in einer sehr schönen,ruhigen Wohngegend im South End von Boston inmitten der typischen Brownstone Häuser und umgeben von kleinen Parks,Geschäften und Restaurants. Direkt gegenüber dem Stadthaus liegt ein schöner Spielplatz,perfekt für unsere kleine Tochter. Die Innenstadt und alle Sehenswürdigkeiten Bostons liegen in Laufweite oder wenige T-Stationen entfernt.,,
Das Apartment ist äußerst geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Schicke,bequeme Möbel und stilvolle Dekoration sowie eine komplette Ausstattung. Vom kuscheligen Handtuch bis zum Shampoo im Badezimmer; von der Mikrowelle bis zum Löffel in der Küche - es fehlt an nichts.,,,,
Als unsere Tochter ein bisschen krank wurde,waren Netflix und Peppa Pig die perfekte Ablenkung ;),,,,
Wir konnten uns hier wirklich wie zuhause fühlen. Vielen Dank,Paul. Wir kommen gerne wieder.,,,,

8595650,78713610,2016-06-08,10531181,Tiffany,"My husband and I recently stayed at Paul's apartment with our 7 month old daughter for a short vacation in Boston. We have traveled a lot and stayed at many Airbnb locations and this was one of our favorites. The apartment was just as pictured, it is perfect for a couple or small family. The apartment is very clean, modern, and tastefully decorated. The bed was very comfy and the bathroom was better than a nice hotel. Paul was very friendly, welcoming and always available if we needed anything. The neighborhood is perfect as it is walking distance or short cab/uber ride to many of Boston's sites however it has a nice quiet neighborhood feel to it. There is a park across the street where there are always children playing and there are many great restaurants in the area, many of them family friendly. We used several of Paul's recommendations that he gives in his listing/guidebook for restaurants and coffee shops and they were all great.  We would definitely stay here again the next time we are in Boston."

The apartment is located near a lot of amazing restaurants like Barcelona Wine Bar and Coppa. Just walking down the street in the morning and getting breakfast at the Wholy Grain or the South End Buttery is just delightful. I would highly reccomend to anyone wanting to experience the south end boston architecture and city life. Paul was very responsive and an amazing host. Thank you Paul for making this trip wonderful for my parents.
8595650,81015672,2016-06-20,63379959,John,"Paul was great. The apartment was nicely decorated and most amenities were new. The neighborhood is great with lots of parks, restaurants and families with young children. I was attending a conference in Boston and staying at the apartment was a welcome change. The Convention Center was only 15 min. away by bicycle. I was able to buy groceries at a nearby Whole Foods and prepare some of my own meals. This was especially nice because I hate hotel breakfast offerings.  I even rode my rented bicycle home for lunch twice. I will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Boston."

This garden level unit was perfect for our family and exceeded our needs and expectations.  It was very clean and tastefully decorated. Paul and his family went out of their way to be accommodating.  My partner and I have a three year old little boy, so having the beautiful park across the street was also an added advantage.  This home is in a perfect location near great restaurants and public transportation.  We would love to come back and stay here again and can't say enough positive things about our experience."

It's not an apartment in which to linger (it's on a lower level, accessed through the owner's shared space, though in a private locked apartment), but because of the terrific location (including the immediate proximity of a beautiful park which is effectively the building's \"\"front yard\"\") it offers a fabulous \"\"South End\"\" experience that is highly recommended for someone who doesn't mind the type of access.  The apartment is cozy but well appointed and pleasantly laid out; the Internet was fast; the kitchen is modern and clean; and the owners cared about providing a comfortable experience.  Not cheap"

We had travel cards and maps ready for us as soon as we arrived. The neighbours downstairs stand in for Catlin in her absence and make guests feel very welcome.

The beds were super comfortable with beautiful linens in each bedroom.  We found the best little breakfast/lunch cafe, Canto 6, in the neighborhood and met a wonderful couple from the area who told us all about the history of the Jamaica Plains neighborhood.  Parking can be a bit challenging for large vehicles since street parking isn't allowed during the day, but Caitlin worked hard to find the space to park both our SUV and minivan.  The only thing our men missed was access to watching their weekend NFL games after a day of sightseeing, but the lack of a TV was offset by everyone hanging out together at the dining room table...even if each of us was on our own laptops connected to the (URL HIDDEN) was still extended together time! :)"
6465075,50638782,2015-10-13,42264425,Lothar,"Unfortunately this evaluation will not be very positive. A day prior to our arrival I had contacted Catlin to find out how we could get access to the house. In her general description she had written that there was a key lock next to a side door but there was no indication as to the code or where I could find it. We were traveling from Philadelphia to Boston that day so it was a long journey and throughout that journey I tried to contact Catlin by email, phone or voice mail, always without success. I was getting more and more worried as I had all my family with me and it was getting towards 8 pm when we arrived. We looked for a key lock at the side door but there was none. I called her again but without success. Finally we saw that there was light in the house so we rang the bell and her neighbours opened for us. They informed us that the key lock was no longer on the side door but next to the front door and that the code would likely be the last four digits of our cell phone. Thank God that worked so we managed to get into the house. There we found the next surprises. In general the house was fine but we had subscribed to a cleaning fee of over 250 $ for staying just two days (!) and were very surprised to find that many parts of the house were not clean. There was hair on the bed sheets and the sink was quite dirty etc. Needless to say that we did not expect this. Again we tried to clairfy this with our host without success and eventually decided to contact airbnb who helped us to resolve the situation. Apart from the total lack of communication the cleanliness issues the house was fine, as was the neighborhood. You are not exactly near the universities (at least not MIT or Harvard) with about 20 minutes by car, but you are nor too far either.  The house lacked some basics such as cereal bowls or tea spoons so if you feel you need them you better bring them with you. The neighbors downstairs are kind and friendly. Oh yes and don't be surprised if some of the light switches are in unusual locations :-). It will take a while until you have identified everything."
6465075,51882749,2015-10-25,9351294,Jeff,"Catlin's condo was perfect. It is as beautiful as the photos. There were six of us staying there and we were all comfortable. The location was perfect for us. The street is quiet, Jamaica Plain is full of great restaurants and shops, and we could walk to the subway and be in the heart of Boston in no time. If you are staying in the Boston area this place could be ideal. Catlin was a wonderful host. She made herself completely available both before and during our stay."

The beds were most comfortable, the house was clean and we didn't lack for anything.   It is everything we had hoped for and more.  The neighbors were nice, we felt safe, and the local eateries within walking distance were great.  Our favorite was Grass Fed.  Great hamburgers, shakes, and floats.  Easy walk to the train was perfect and on occasion when we used uber we never waited more than 5 minutes.   If in the future I were to ever have a need to be in Boston for any length of time, I would definitely stay at Catin's.  I highly recommend Catlin's  Condo."

We swooned over the bathroom and the kitchen, both of which were gleaming and well-stocked, and we spent hours on the back porch basking in the sun. The house is so well located, in a quiet, pretty neighborhood right down the street from the Forest Hills stop on the orange line, across the way from the Arboretum, and just a few blocks from a co-op market and a coffee shop. In addition, Catlin was so helpful and responsive with instructions and couldn't have made it easier for us to enjoy our stay. Our family loved using Catlin's home as a home base for our stay in Boston and would love to stay there again!"

The apartment is just as pictured with everything being brand new and renovated. John was incredibly communicative and even nice enough to accommodate our requests for early check-in and late check-out.

And for our additional food needs, there is a Whole Foods grocery store less than 10 minutes away by foot."

We were arriving early into Boston and he got the cleaners to finish up a bit earlier to get us going on an early day out.  The house is among the best we have stayed in all AirBNB stays.  The house was so well stocked with all necessities and more (Juices, bagels etc.!).  This is far more than any host would do.  The place is located very close to the T and highly accessible to any place in Boston.  Will highly recommend John's house to anyone.   It is big enough for a large group, but we were only 3 of us and had the whole house.  The photos of the house are exact.  Great decor.  Enjoyed our stay throughout!"

John's home was spotlessly clean and very inviting.  The beds were extremely comfortable and all the appliances easy to use.  Since there are three levels, it made it super easy for all of us to have some privacy and space.  The view out the third floor balcony is charming.  One morning my grandson and I watched people walk their dogs, drink coffee, and get on with their day.  So, big thumbs up from all of us on this AirBnB property."
11866651,78108129,2016-06-05,66750228,Mario,Our group of 6 give it 12 thumbs up!
11866651,78968569,2016-06-10,19436326,Chris,Pros and cons to our experience.
On the pro side,the house is beautiful and location is great.,,,,
On the con side,one of the beds was broken and unusable,and the host did not notify us before arriving.,,,
When we called about it upon arrival,the host told us to blow up an air mattress if we wanted privacy in a room. We didn't want to ask one of our guests to sleep on an air mattress on the floor so he had to sleep in a common area rather than a private room.,,,,
These things happen,but it's unacceptable when you're booking for almost a week and the host does not offer the courtesy of a warning when a bed is not usable.,,,,
"The host did followup later and ask how he could make the stay more enjoyable but without a fix for the broken bed it wasn't what we were expecting. \"",,,,,
11866651,79486713,2016-06-13,56971,Niki,"The home is beautiful, in a perfect location and the owner was extremely responsive. We felt secure and comfortable in the home. There were many nice touches such as bathroom amenities and food items when we arrived, we appreciated the extra detail. One note for those traveling is that this is really a 2 bedroom with an additional 3 large and comfortable dens. There is a basement that could be considered a 3rd bedroom, but there was no bed. We had plenty of space - even more than expected - so it worked out fine for our group. Also very much enjoyed the rooftop patio."
11866651,80826215,2016-06-19,57685430,Gloriana,"El apartamento tiene una excelente ubicación, conveniente para caminar a restaurantes, tiendas, teatros etc. Además es precioso, todo está literalmente nuevo. Sus anfitriones se preocuparon por todos los detalles desde comida hasta cargadores de celular! La puerta tiene un sistema de candado automático que no requiere que los huéspedes tenga que  cuidar llaves, es genial"
11866651,81451816,2016-06-23,70611818,Pat S.,"We felt at home the whole time we stayed here. It was our first Airbnb experience and we loved it. Our host was very professional, honest, and trustworthy. He was prompted in respond to our questions, he kept his promises, and at the same time very helpful and kind."
The place is one minute walk from Tuft Medical Center T-Line,it is right behind a small park. The neighborhood is safe,clean,and quiet. We took the Silver Line from the airport and that was very convenient too.,,
Upon arrival,our host provided juices,bottled drinking water,plenty of yummy bagels,and other things such as coffee and tea to make our stay pleasant. The house is very clean,equipped with WIFI and our host was thoughtfully provided a charging station for us (for all kinds of popular devices). The kitchen is fully equipped. We only used the toaster and coffeemaker
The house is spotless clean. Six of us have our own beds with clean pillows,sheets,and blanket. Our host provided sufficient toiletries which is very nice for us who traveled from far away.,,,
We love this place and we would recommend it to our friends and family upon their next visit to Boston.,,,,,
And here are some comments from our group:,,,,,
Nuni: Loving it! So clean,convenient location,and cozy.,,,
Tete: Such a neat little place,love the view from the balcony.,,,,
Numpon: Wow,what a location!,,,,
Jom:  went running every morning at Boston Common!,,,,,
Beau: slept so well.,,,,,
Folks,do not hesitate,you will love this place as much as we do.,,,
Pat & friends,,,,,

11866651,81801490,2016-06-25,23770475,Ellen,Thank you for a great stay!! It was the perfect location and the home was beautiful. John was a great host and we would love to stay there again if we are ever back in Boston. What a great Airbnb experience!!
11866651,82688333,2016-06-28,17416297,Carlos,"John was incredibly helpful, and his place was magnificent. If you want a great Boston experience, this is where you should stay!"
11866651,83312605,2016-07-02,70716954,Jeanne,"This was our first experience with Air BNB and John made it extremely easy. His home is as pictured and was a perfect solution for our family of six. Ease of access and available parking sweetened the deal!   Elderly may have an issue with the spiral stairs but that was no issue for us. Bagels, juice and bottle of wine made for a for a nice welcome. We walked or took the T everywhere and enjoyed Blue Man Group at the Charles Playhouse which was only steps from the door. All in all we could not have asked for more"
"Thank you John!\"",,,,,
11866651,84917610,2016-07-09,59662741,Katherine,There were bagels and wine available upon arrival. The house was clean and bright. Instructions were well written and easily accessible.
The location was amazing,and the house was spacious. John was very flexible,"and an amazing host.\"",,,
11866651,86881158,2016-07-17,67501320,Michael,I very much enjoyed my stay here.  Check in was smooth and the home was clean and spacious.  John was super accommodating in providing everything needed for a pleasant stay with plenty of sleeping arrangements for extra quests. The location is in a safe area and provides quick  access to a multitude of attractions/events.  I highly recommend to anyone looking to spend some time in the city.
11866651,87424832,2016-07-20,26469985,Harriet,Amazing house in a great location and a great host
11866651,87772991,2016-07-21,16943938,Kjell,"We truly enjoyed staying 2 nights in John's more than beautiful 4 floored townhouse. Spacious, fresh, modern and very centrally located within the reach of most things in Boston."
Excellent and short access to the garage where we could park the car. The code for access to the apartment gave us the freedom to come and go as we wanted,not depending on each other's for access.,,,,
Even without physically meeting up with John he was one of the best hosts,always available if required.,,,,
"Thank you for having us.\"",,,,,
11866651,88318281,2016-07-24,4598848,Max,"Perfect multi-level apartment in the heart of downtown. Everything is very clean and brand new. I've been to Boston many times and used Airbnb, and this apt is the best by far. It's worth every penny, I highly recommend."
11866651,89139122,2016-07-27,79916525,Maria,"We truly enjoyed our first trip to Boston and John's home certainly played a part in making it such a great experience.  The location is so great - close to many restaurants and just a short walk to Boston Common.  He has done a wonderful renovation.  Everything is nice, new and clean.  The home was perfect for our large family and was a much more pleasant experience than our usual option of paying for 2 hotel rooms for each night.  We found a nice grocery market on the other side of the Common in Beacon Hill.  Thanks to John for being a great host."
11866651,89232945,2016-07-27,51272592,Andrew,Great place and great host.  Loved the location and house!
11866651,91723326,2016-08-06,15984710,David,"John was an excellent host and the accommodation was immaculately clean and very well appointed. The location is perfect and we were able to walk to many of the places we wanted to visit. There was a slight hitch with one of the appliances but John fixed it the morning after we made him aware of it. The house is spacious, comfortable and has a lovely welcoming feel. It is perfect for anybody wanting to make the most of central Boston. Many thanks for letting us stay. We'd be delighted to return!"
11866651,92957129,2016-08-10,39336647,David,This house was amazing! Great location with less than a ten minute walk to Boston common. Never went more than 5 minutes for an Uber. Lots of room for lounging around and relaxing when not out on the go. I will most certainly look to stay at this house on a return trip to Boston.
11866651,93463610,2016-08-12,3611043,Sharon,"John was a treasure of information, flexibility and responsiveness.  This home was exactly as described and totally wonderful to stay in.  I absolutely loved the old world charm that was evident, despite the modern updates after the renovation.  In fact, the original brick was still visible on some of the walls, and one could imagine what the space was like in the 18th century.  We stayed during an especially hot period in August, yet, the rooms were comfortable due to the individual air conditioning units in each area of this three story + basement house.  The kitchen was nicely set up as a central meeting/eating area for our group and beyond that, there were little seating areas, and a patio that allowed separate relaxation.  Additionally, we appreciated that this gem of a place was so fantastically hidden in a location so near the heart of downtown Boston.  I hope I have the opportunity to return again for another stay!"
11866651,94354639,2016-08-15,78196815,Christopher,Amazing place and great location! You can't beat the area it's in and the space accommodated all of our needs. John was a great host and if you are looking to go to Boston with a group of people stop looking anywhere else and just book this.
11866651,94821605,2016-08-17,4024028,Kate,"John's place is quite literally a hidden gem in Boston: The entrance is tucked away in a small, quiet courtyard, but it's right in the middle of the action. Great location for restaurants, nightlife, culture, historical sites, parks - it's ideal for virtually everything. The apartment itself is great - spotlessly clean, lots of room (not a given in Boston's old buildings), and private outdoor space - and John is an excellent host. He responded within minutes, had details covered (hair dryers, baby gates for the stairs), and even had bagels, wine and chocolate waiting for us on arrival. We recently moved down South from Boston, and no question we'll book here again next time we're in town."
11866651,95492410,2016-08-20,10768901,Nick,John was a very courteous host. We used the space for a video shoot and he made sure we had everything we needed. He was polite and accommodating with a quick response.
"I only wish we stayed many nights!\"",,,,,
11866651,96046376,2016-08-21,37043538,Teddy,"John's place was perfect for our weekend trip to Boston! It was very spacious, there was plenty of room for our group. The design/decor was exceptional and it was extremely clean. We were very comfortable staying here, we enjoyed spending time on the deck! The location was great as well, every area of the city that we went to was never more than a short cab ride."
John exceeded our expectations as a host. He was very helpful,informative,"and kept in contact with us as needed. It was a pleasure staying at his place!\"",,,
11866651,97381306,2016-08-27,6076583,Jordan,This is a great place in a fantastic location with nearby parking.  The house is fully renovated and super clean. John provided basic toiletries and even some breakfast foods and a bottle of wine.
Five stair AirBnb experience and would definitely stay here again.,,,,,
Note while there are tons of beds and pull out couches to sleep on,there are really only two private bedrooms,plus a cellar room.  This would be a better setup for a family or very close friends.,,,
"John was super responsive and got back almost instantly with answers to my questions.\"",,,,,
11866651,98350960,2016-08-30,81719284,Margaret,The house was lovely and clean. It was exactly how it was described on the website. We were greeted with bagels and orange juice which we thoroughly enjoyed. The neighborhood was nice and conveniently located near lots of neat stuff.
11866651,99669863,2016-09-05,918697,Eliza,John's place was a great house in a very good location of Boston. The whole house was clean with plenty of supplies. Orange T was a few minutes away. Mike and Patty's is 3 minutes walking distance with some delicious sandwiches.
3881993,19949886,2014-09-21,16671351,Arthur,"Beautiful little place in an easy-to-reach location. The hostess was kind of enough to let us use her kitchen. There was enough space for everyone and some nice decorations. It's a good place to spend a weekend in Jamaica Plain, if you're looking for that."
3881993,48334710,2015-09-25,10892248,Sarah,The apartment was very similar to its description especially regarding the parking which was very good and easy.  Josefa was very attentive and communicated often though we did not meet in person. She was away and sent over a friend to clean and leave us the keys.
The refrigerator and bathtub were rather dirty and I cleaned it before my husband's parents came as we were sharing the apartment with them. Josefa also asked us to say we were friends of her daughter who lives there. Thankfully we did not have to say this as we did not see any neighbors.,,,,,
The kids got a little cold at night and we found one comforter and a sleeping bag.,,,,,
Overall,"the house was fine and it served our purpose.  I would suggest having a cleaning service come to prep the apartment for guests and provide blankets.  I was very happy with the people in the neighborhood and the parking was great.  We were parked out front the whole 4 days and did not have any time limits on that.\"",,,,

3881993,71458122,2016-04-25,40525537,Teresita,The place was fantastic. Really well decorated and very cozy. The back porch was a great place to relax. Josefa was a very accessible host and was quick to reply to our questions about check-in/check-out and WiFi. A few little bars and places to eat nearby but it's also really easy to get into Boston from here. Would definitely stay here again.
3881993,76503795,2016-05-27,9059872,Eric,"Great place for a group to stay in a good neighborhood. It is located several blocks away from a train stop, which was convenient. The apartment appeared as advertised."
3881993,76836388,2016-05-29,10545317,Xuhui,We enjoyed staying at Josefa's apartment. The 3 bedrooms are spacious and neat. It's ideal for 6 people to stay together. The location is convenient as well.
3881993,78814337,2016-06-09,68244149,Sarah,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3881993,87897297,2016-07-22,72172980,Natasha,We really enjoyed our stay at Josefa's.  The apartment was beautiful and very comfortable.  Josefa checked in on us regularly to make sure that we had everything that we needed.  Street parking was convenient and we could not have asked for anything more.
2764624,12583871,2014-05-05,6689395,Ping,The  location is a quick walk to the subway station and a quick train ride to downtown Boston. You can have cafe fee. But I think there should be more furniture in the room. At least a desk and a bigger sofa. In the bath room there should be a shampoo.
2764624,13105377,2014-05-19,13011591,Tj,A great spot to visit the city from. A different room than advertised but certainly every bit as good. Actually this airbnb has a lot of extras and I would be happy to stay here again. Thanks

2764624,13985999,2014-06-09,12880172,Danielle,"My friend and I arrived in Boston, extremely early on Saturday morning, and Steve had no problem checking us in at this time (It was his assistant who checked us in, but everything had been sorted). As we were on the way to the apartment, we got a text from Steve with the address we were staying at. This was different to what was listed on airbnb, however it was no problem as the apartment we stayed in was only a 2 minute walk from the original. The room was nice, spacious, and clean, and it is very close to the T, which can take you nearly anywhere around Boston. It also has a small kitchen area in the apartment, which would be helpful if you planned on doing your own cooking. Whilst I never met Steve, he was very helpful over email and texts, and promptly responded to any questions I had. We had a great time staying here. Thanks"

The room was in the house across the street, and not the same room in the picture but it doesn't matter to me. I think it worked out even better because I had complete privacy. The room was clean, free coffee and tea in the kitchen. Will stay here again. :)"

The location is very good -you get from there with the t- line (Metro) easily and fast to other parts of Boston. The room was clean, bathrooms also. There is a nice porche in front of the house for resting in the evening. We didn't use the kitchen. Steve had the best advices (food, shopping so forth) and was all in all a very good host.

The neighborhood was fine. It's a bit older and certainly not the ritziest. It's certainly not unsafe or anything with plenty to eat/drink near by and easy access to the train, which took no more than 20 minutes to get downtown. All in all, totally solid stay. Would definitely stay again."

The bed was comfortable. The area was very interesting for us. It was easy to get to downtown by public, it took us 30 Minutes."
Unfortunately the appartement was not clean enough according to our personal standards. When we arrived there was only one bed even though we were four people. The good thing was that an air matress was set up right away. It was comfortable but lost air over night.,,,,,

2764624,31608070,2015-05-07,31818922,Solene,"Super séjour chez Steve. La localisation est idéal, un seul métro de 20 minutes et Steve est très accueillant et disponible."
2764624,32209890,2015-05-15,31992846,Alex,"Steve is the best host one can hope for. He accommodated all our needs, even though he was out of town for the first two days of our stay. Extremely helpful and caring. The room was also very clean and well taken care of, and I felt very comfortable using the bathroom / kitchen / living room. Also, proximity to T station made it very easy to commute. Would come back every time!"
2764624,32610080,2015-05-19,32785621,Hongling,"Steve is really nice and helpful. We had a problem of renting a car, he's really willing to help and tried his best to give us a solution. The location was great, it was really close to the train station, only takes 10 to 20 minutes to get to wherever you wang. Everything was really nice, it was a nice trip staying in Steve's house:)"
2764624,32873976,2015-05-22,25032981,Arvis,"We booked the room only a couple of hours before arriving, but everything was ready and in place. The description was very accurate. The neighborhood is quite and away from downtown, but there is an easy access to the city with train."
2764624,32919880,2015-05-23,32690444,Lizzie,First time with airbnb and it was incredible.
I planned an overnight trip as a surprise for my friend's birthday and just needed a place for us to crash while running all over Boston. It served that purpose wonderfully; easy parking,close to the T,clean bathrooms,and a comfy,lovely bedroom. After our first day,we baked some brownies (love the kitchen too) and got ready to wake up and get out early for another day. However
If you want to take a trip to Boston for any length of time,this is your place! Despite my parents wincing when I said we'd be staying in Dorchester,the neighborhood was lovely. I felt perfectly safe walking to the T and around town (seriously,don't bother driving anywhere). The bathrooms were clean and there was really no problem sharing with the students. Beds,again,"super comfy. The blow up mattress was like a cloud. I loved absolutely everything about this trip and cannot think of one negative thing that happened.\""
2764624,33289158,2015-05-26,32014254,Tammy,So glad to have booked the starlight room. Very convenient to get to with the T. I didn't get a chance to meet Steve but the other tenants were very friendly. I met Theo during the end of my stay and he showed us Ronan park and a shortcut to the T.
2764624,33838566,2015-06-01,20416115,Wang,"Steve is really a wonderful host ,nice ,easygoing and always ready to help . I and my husband had a good rest here and a awesome trip in Boston. The location of the house is quite great only 5 mitues walking to the train station. It's absolutely highly recommended place to stay"
2764624,33968103,2015-06-02,17131095,Craig,Steve was very welcoming and friendly.
2764624,34073568,2015-06-04,31851900,Yingqiao,"The whole block is peaceful.Steve's house is beautiful,and it was very near the subway. The bedroom is as it appeared in the pictures and it is clean and neat . The bathroom is also clean ."
Steve is really a nice host,and always ready to help . When I saw his beautiful big eyes,I like him.,,,
"We had a good stay at Steve's!\"",,,,,

2764624,36294278,2015-06-27,19738280,Liza,I loved staying here! The room was beautiful and the house had nice indoor and outdoor space to use. The kitchen and laundry facilities are nice and coffee and tea are provided. Steve is really cool and so is Khalil! I loved my time there and will definitely come back!
2764624,36840582,2015-07-01,28944582,Malinda,Steve was very accommodating when we needed an air mattress in addition to the large bed in the room. The upstairs shower/restroom is small but nice. I would recommend staying here.
2764624,37205494,2015-07-05,35641336,Patrick,Steve was very flexible with our late arrival and made sure we could get in.  Salif (a longer term tenant) was great.  I needed to return the rental car and he volunteered to go with me and make sure I could find my way back on the T (subway). The T is only 5-7 minutes from the house.
The neighbor hood was very nice and even had a Chinese restaurant open late. (We were on Pacific time),,,,,
Steve was a great host. He was always helpful and offered to let us use a blanket to go on a picnic. The water heater went out and he had it replaced in less than a day.,,,,,
The room was not the one in the picture,but was plenty large.  We had a king size bed,a king size air mattress,a dresser,a table,and still had a bit of room to walk at the foot of the beds.
There were plug strips in the room so we had plenty of placed to plug in our gadgets.,,,,,
There is a washer and dryer with detergent and dryer sheets for the guests and that helped a lot.,,,,,
The kitchen is kind of small (is that an East Coast thing?),and it and the laundry room kind of had the feel that they were in the middle of being remodeled.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
2764624,37858081,2015-07-11,25188564,Florian,"Steve was an awesome host, who did everything he could to make our stay as pleasant as possible. Khalio (is that the correct spelling?), who took care of the apartment, was also very nice and helpful and a great guy to communicate. He even offered us some of his homecooked food. The apartment is conveniently located nearby the red line, which makes it really easy to travel around Boston (the 7-day pass is also rather cheap)."
In the house itself there are quite a few other Airbnb guests,but it doesn't feel too crowded (as long as both showers are working).,,,,
The neighbourhood is definitely not the finest in Boston,but we always felt save and secure there.,,,,
Eventhough we booked the star light room,this room was already taken,so we got another room,that did not look like the one on the picture. But that room wasn't bad either.,,
We were even happy that we got that room,because it seems that not all rooms were equipped with air conditioning (but I'm not totally sure about that).,,,,
All in all I would totally recommend spending your stay Steve's house and I would come back here again,"when I come back to Boston.\"",,,,
2764624,38150340,2015-07-13,35328804,Jeffery,"Steve was very welcoming.  We arrived in Boston quite late and although Steve was not there, another person was there to welcome us and take us to our room.  The neighborhood was fine.  Quiet.  The best feature was the proximity to the T train.  We were able to get to the Common in a very short amount of time."
My only comment is that the upstairs shower was out of order and we had to drag our things down to the downstairs shower.  That being said,"we never had to wait for the shower and were always able to get on our way in short order.\"",,,,
2764624,40440659,2015-07-31,28168641,David,"Très bon accueil, Steve est une personne attentionnée. La chambre est bien placée (métro à proximité)."
Le seul petit hic,la chambre est un peu petite pour 4.,,,,
Par contre,nous avons fait des rencontres super sympas dans cette maison.,,,,
En bref,On s'est régalé à Boston.,,,,

2764624,40913338,2015-08-03,33317831,Dave,"\"My daughter and I made our yearly trek up to Boston to work at a comic convention, but this year rather than stay out of town and take the train in, we used Airbnb.  Our host Steve kept touch with me the entire week, and was waiting for us when we arrived at his home.  We were staying in a lovely two-story victorian in Dorchester, an area that was undergoing some love gentrification.  The room was spotless with a huge king sleigh bed, we had access to a kitchen, laundry and bathroom facilities that were also sparkling clean.   Steve also has a lovely sitting area and he had the refrigerator stocked with water and snacks for us.  We were less than 2 blocks from the Field's Corner \"\"T\"\" station which was able to get us down to the World Trade Center at the Seaport in less than 1/2 hour.  We were also directed to a very nice Thai restaurant in the neighborhood on Saturday night after the show and all in all we had a fantastic time staying with Steve.  I highly recommend staying with him and we will use his room again next summer.  \""

La maison était agréable et calme, nous avons pu utiliser lave linge et sèche linge après avoir passe l'après midi sous la pluie! Steve est adorable, s'est inquiété de nos conditions de séjour et a mis beaucoup de documentation a notre disposition. Un bon séjour :)"
2764624,41748792,2015-08-09,30699895,Hilrieke,"Steve is een aardige man die ons welkom heette, het huis heeft laten zien en onze jongens een eigen kamer heeft gegeven. Dat was echt super. De buurt was prima en het huis en de kamer op zich ook. Maar het was er helaas niet schoon en ook bleek Steve niet in dit huis zelf te wonen."
2764624,42140497,2015-08-11,19278644,Kate,"Steve was friendly and helpful, apartment not too far from subway with easy access to downtown Boston. Room is in shared house, ok if you're young and looking for something basic, not ideal for families (our case)."
2764624,42636371,2015-08-14,41155575,Guillaume,"Had an great time there. Steve was very welcoming and caring. Room real close from subway, 5 min walk. Rooms and washrooms clean, trouble-free check in."

There were minor maintenance issues with the house but our bedroom was very nice and clean. There is a quick connection to the boson downtown area, however Dorchester might not be the best area to spend a lot of time during the night. If you are looking for a good alternative to hostels I'd recommend going here!"
2764624,45326857,2015-09-01,28945047,Qiuyun,"The house is in a crowding community, about 20 minutes by car or by subway to downtown Boston. A long-term tenant gave us a very nice welcome and guidance whereas we did not meet Steve during our 3-night stay there. We  felt uncomfortable since our room was stuffy and not well tidied, with very basic supplies. It is recommended to young travellers with moderate expectation to the accommodation."
2764624,45956518,2015-09-07,38286575,Yu,"Steve is a warm,patient and friendly man.I lovehis house very much because neighbours are really helpful.recommend this house to you if you plan to have a trip in Boston"

Steve (and his wife Mary) are extremely communicative and available when you need to reach them. There are two students that currently reside at the home and I've only ran into one of them once. The room was lovely and exactly what we needed for our first stay (4 nights) in Boston. We rented a car and though the streets were narrow and somewhat confusing, parking was never an issue. Walking distance to the T Line which was perfect for one of our nights out to the North End. Pretty bummed I wasn't able to grab some Vietnamese while in the neighborhood, but I know Steve will be my go to next time I'm in town! Fantastic guy. I cannot recommend him and this place enough."

We met Steve the second day we arrived,and can feel he's really a warm person. We can use the laundry kitchen bathroom. It's quiet good to wash all of the clothes. And the area is very safe,"even we came home very late. We had a great time staying here. Thank you Steve. \"",,,

There's actually a small closet that is kept empty for guests, which we appreciated as we were visiting the area for a fancy event and it was nice to be able to hang up our suits/dresses instead of draping them over a chair or the bedframe."

If you have luggage be prepared to walk about ten minutes from the T in a bit of a sketchy neighborhood.  By this I guess I simply mean a working class urban residential neighborhood with some lingering cannabis smells in the  air.,,,,,

They gave a list of awesome places to eat around the area (I tried one out - it was fantastic), shared passes for the Science museum, guided me to the bus stop near their house, and even met me very early in the morning so I could check in before heading out for the day. Marilyn is a phenomenal cook - her meals make you feel right at home! They even invited me to go square dancing with them which was, of course, an absolute blast! I'll definitely be looking them up next time in Boston! There is no AirBnB host I'd recommend more highly than Marilyn + Allen!"

When I read reviews about Phyllis's other room, I was happy and so booked the room for two weeks. All the good comments about her and her house was 100% right. She is such a nice host and also her house is really a beautiful, clean and comfortable house. She made me so welcome and I felt like I was in my own house. I sometimes had a chat with her, so we talked about many things. She offers a nice breakfast, specially I loved her cheese omelet that she made during the weekends. She was nice enough to teach me how to make it. :) She is very friendly and helpful and I really liked her. Also, I had so many heavy bags and she helped with everything going out of her way. The neighborhood  is really decent and nice. It is very easy to get to Downtown Boston as well. I will definitely stay at Phyllis's house if I come back to Boston.

Phillis is perfect hoster,"great \"",,,,
7692933,66439878,2016-03-22,58109775,David,"Phyllis is a wonderful host. Her hospitable charm was very evident in her accommodating approach to making her guests feel as comfortable as if it was their own home. Realizing that getting around in Boston can be difficult for visitors, she helped me find my way around town, by either driving or using public transportation. The house is accurately depicted in the photos, and the neighborhood was safe. If I have the opportunity to visit Boston again, I hope the room is available."
7692933,66957012,2016-03-25,27458127,Shiyuan,"This was a great experience staying in Boston for 4 days. The room was cozy and clean. It's a little bit small but sweet and perfect for one. The bathroom was clean and spacious. You will find everything well provided for guests in it. You may have to share the bathroom with other two rooms. Breakfast was also provided. Phyllis was very nice and helpful. She replied quickly. I had joyful conversation with her. Also, she can make great homemade cookies!"
7692933,67525092,2016-03-29,3506492,Florian,"The perfect place! Phyllis runs a very nice airbnb. Clean, comfortable and cosy. Breakfast is included and there are always self-made cookies on the table. Phyllis is very nice and welcoming. Her house is conveniently located next to a bus stop from which you can get to Central. An Uber to Harvard Sq is about 7$. I would always stay again."
7692933,68347744,2016-04-04,57095100,Sharen,"Phyllis is a great host, and she sets a high standard.  This was my first Airbnb stay.  I was pleasantly surprised. Her home is warm, and is well decorated.   A sufficient breakfast including tea, coffee, toast is on offer.  Her home made cookies make her a standout.   The bed was extremely comfortable.  The location is ideal for easy access to the city and Harvard square.  The bus is close by for to access Central Sq, for trains, alternatively,  Uber is less than $10 to Harvard Square.  Phyllis will provide you with bus timetables if required.  This stay,  I am sure not your average airbnb, it is well above average.  Book it and see for yourself."

7692933,69965253,2016-04-15,1229524,Ector,"Very comfortable accommodation and Phyllis is wonderful host (and fantastic cookie artist).  I was in Boston for convention at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center (not to be confused with Hynes).   For anyone that's a fan of Mass Transit (just realized that's a pun), my favorite route is Bus 64 to Central Square, then transition of underground metro red line toward Braintree(Ashmont) getting off at South Station then using Siver Line bus to World Trade Center.  That leaves you with a one block walk to the convention center.  I like Boston more on every trip and Phyllis's  place is perfect location for easy access to conventions but quiet safe neighborhood  for the evenings (I'm a big fan of quiet)."
7692933,70232804,2016-04-17,52268351,Malcolm,Phyllis was an excellent host and it was a pleasure staying with her. She went out of her way to make my stay in Boston very convenient and was able to pick me up from the airport even. I couldn't give a higher recommendation than to stay with Phyllis.

My flights were all messed up my luggage didn't make it, and Phyllis offered to be at the house to receive my luggage when it arrived.  I was greeted with fresh cookies and a tour.  There was snacks and coffee readily available and cereal and fruit in the morning.  It was a nice neighborhood and the bed was very comfy."

7692933,71424138,2016-04-25,62531774,Frank,"When arrived Brighton,  my first impression was What a nice quiet neighborhood and very peaceful. I felt very safe the moment I arrived. I was greeted by the hosts husband who introduced himself to me and welcomed me to their home. The home, a vintage 18th century home was filled with a warm genuine nostalgic feel of giant portraits ams paintings and beautifully furnished. I was instantly amazed with just entering the living room alone which you will find the yummy cookies for the guests. My room was perfect since I was by myself and has a view of the quiet neighborhood.  Gentle breeze would enter the room to keep yourself nice and cool when you need it or you can shut it completely and stay warm at night. Bathroom was very spacious and way better than most hotels. Every morning when I awaken to birds chirping felt very rewarding like a peaceful sanctuary. I loved the variety of flavored coffees and breakfast items. Phyllis is very down to earth and made me felt like I was visiting a relative for the weekend. Uber services were amazing and if you liked, the MBTA bus and train service was walking distance. I definately would return again of I ever stayed in Boston......a city rich in history and yummy clam chowder and amazing people. From a score of 1 to 10, she deserves a 21. She is an amazing host and you will not be disappointed.  Free WiFi which is very strong if you need it.  Thank you Phyllis for an amazing experience.  Your home is very beautiful."

So organized and gives you the proper instructions about your stay and about Boston city, she even provides you with a magazine for all the activities that's going on in the city. Overall, communication and hospitality is 5/5!"
The house is decorated nicely and you have an artistic things to look at on every corner,"so I didn't actually need to visit \"\"The Boston Fine Arts Museum\"\" and that's my personal opinion! My room too was very comfortable clean",and has everything you need! Overall,house setup,organizations,and cleanliness is 5/5!
Location was good too,there is a bus right around the corner that takes you to a main station for all trains and buses! And it's also close to Cambridge which is a fun and a busy area! Overall,location is 5/5!,,,
Now,Phyllis also makes a unique cookies that taste really good and look amazing,I will never forget about that since I'm a cookies fan!,,,
To sum up,this is a great place that offers a great value,I would definitely consider staying there again and I would recommend the place to everyone visiting Boston!,,,
Thank you so much Phyllis!,,,,,

The famous cookies were well worth the fame while the most impressive was, of course, Phyllis's hospitality. I had no problem in getting around the areas with her concise guide and help. While Brighton may not be very near the centres of attraction, the nearby bus services to Boston and Cambridge were convenient enough.

I felt welcomes and invited. I had an extended stay while attending Lesley University in Cambridge. It was a quick 15 minute drive to the University and Harvard Square. Breakfast and coffee was always available. She puts her clientele first and is readily available for quiet conversation while maintaining space if that is what you need. Very enjoyable experience. I would visit with Phyllis any time in the future.

The place was very clean and suitable for a couple. The checkin/check out was also very smooth and flexible. They have a 24 hour hotline which was very convenient. This particular apartment was a bit noisy as it was right next to the stairs and you could hear people coming and going. There also isn't a lot of natural light. The landlord came in to the place a couple of times while we were there, and it would have been a bit better if they had given us a heads up. All and all though I would certainly go back to this apartment and it was very reasonably priced especially considering it was graduation week."

The description is accurate: It can be noisy. We were awoken by other residents coming and going,yelling at 6am (down the street),jackhammers after midnight (nearby construction of some sort). Do yourself a favor and pack earplugs.,,,

Estabamos muy cansados y con tres maletas cada uno y fue una situación muy desagradable y nadie nos ayudó.!! El estudio  està en barrio muy pintoresco, una buenisima zona llena de restaurantes y tiendas. El estudio es como se describe es pequeño pero COZY y està limpio. La cama es muy cómoda y el estudio tiene una pequeña cocina y baño pequeño.  Al ser una primera planta y las escaleras de madera, toda la noche se oyen muchos ruidos de la gente subir y bajar y esto impide dormir ya que la cama esta a un metro al lado de la cama. En la foto de la pared de la cama hay una puerta que si se abre hay un sótano sucio que no se sabe donde va y teníamos dudas de que alguien entrase.."

Fantastic cafe across the street with a good sandwich menu and very of entertaining local characters."
Per the email we received,I called ahead of our arrival and was given a code to room 'D',"but it turned out that the keys were actually a few doors down in the mailbox of the property management company instead and we never needed the code.

1426754,46308774,2015-09-09,7802953,Tim,"Great little apartment right in the center of the North End. Easy to find and access was simple.  The apartment was clean and the bed was comfortable.  The pictures and description are accurate, it is a cozy studio for 2 people at most.  There isn't a lot of room to lounge around in the unit, but the apartment is the perfect home base for exploring Boston."
1426754,47040108,2015-09-15,29949849,Nicola,We were made to feel very welcome upon arrival with the room set to a nice temperature. Information regarding the apartment was very clear and easy to follow.the neibourhood itself was ideal for getting around as it's near the subway line. There are lots of restaurants right on your door step and also near some points of interest on the freedom trail.fabulous location with lots to see and do.

Nice and clean studio for a short stop in Boston.,,,,,
Getting the keys was in the end easy; you need to call in advance for a code. Storage for luggage before arrival and after check out around the corner of the studio.,,,,,
You deal with an agency; which made us a bit nervous because we didn't get a reply to our questions via air bnb after confirmation of the booking. Also; when you have an issue during your stay,"you deal with the agency. \"",,,,
1426754,48282125,2015-09-25,39630044,Micah,"The directions were precise and easy. The North End is such a perfect spot if you're visiting Boston. Close to amazing restaurants, shopping, sightseeing. The unit was a perfect size for our two-night stay and convenient to everything. Clean, comfortable and affordable, this unit was a great home away from home, and the staff was prompt and friendly."

1426754,48708864,2015-09-28,6440866,Kim,"Great little apt with everything!  There is everything you would need in this little apt. Picking up keys and communication went very smooth.   If you are a big person, I would think of maybe another apt but only because of the bed.  I loved the bed and everything about it but if you are a big person, you might not.  To get out of it, you have to scoot down to the bottom.  No windows to look out of, they are too high but that didn't bother me. Plenty of lights in the apt.  Mini kitchen fully stocked, nice TV on the wall, A/C window unit ran 24/7 but I don't think it was cooling the apt, I think the fan was just running.  Noise in the apt was not a problem, we didn't hear any of our neighbors or outside noise.  Perfect location, close to Train, short walk to South Station, Financial District, City Hall Plaza and the ocean. I will stay here again, I loved it."
1426754,49068029,2015-09-30,4630359,Krystian,"The apartment was perfect for our trip.  It was located right in the heart of the North End surrounded by great restaurants and cafes, and a few minute walk to Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market.  The apartment was actually nicer than the pictures and description let on.  Gail, the superintendent was easily accessible via phone and we were even able to check in two hours earlier which was hugely helpful since our flight got into Logan at 630am."
1426754,49212305,2015-10-02,4078298,Luisa,Excelente! We had a little problem to get the key the first day but the apartment is really good. It has everything you need and it was really clean. Also it is very well located. I recommend it!!

1426754,68301384,2016-04-04,1810437,Rochelle,"We had a wonderful stay at this lovely studio located in North End. We were in town for the World Figure Skating Championships held at the TD Garden and this studio was in short (15-20 minute) walking distance to the venue.  It was also a short walking distance (10-15 minute walk) to the Haymarket T-station. The check-in and check-out process was seamless.  The studio is located on the 2nd floor, and was the first door after climbing 1 flight of stairs.  In general the floor/building/neighborhood was relatively quiet.  My friend and I enjoyed our stay a lot and would consider this location in the future if I were to visit Boston again in the future!"
1426754,69499692,2016-04-11,36582299,Tina,This was an adorable little place in the perfect neighborhood!  It was a quick walk to the train and many restaurants to choose from.  I would definitely stay again!

1426754,75065810,2016-05-18,65892806,Rachael,We had a great experience. This was our first time using an Airbnb and we will definitely do it again. Dror had a lot of personal details like shampoo in the shower and a lot of info on surrounding restaurants.
1426754,75948395,2016-05-23,31824027,Véronique,Good place for a short stay at a great location. We spent 3 nights and slept well! The Northend is so beautiful and a great area full of lovely restaurants. A short walk from the city center and all attractions. I recommended this place!  Thank Dror for the pasta and Nutella !  Vraiment bien situé tout se fait à pieds! Nous recommandons l'endroit ! Trop de choix de bons restaurants ! Véro et François!
1426754,76580722,2016-05-28,63794147,Jaime,We felt very welcomed with a little gift basket. The surrounding neighborhood was filled with restaurants and shops all within a very short walking distance.
1426754,77180235,2016-05-30,69432544,Jane,"Location was the best!!! Right at the end of Little Italy, one block away from famous Mike's Pastrys where we stopped by for cannolis and croissants every morning. Tons of restaurants nearby, 10 min walk to the Haymarket T, 10 min walk to Quincy Market - could have spent the entire weekend we were there just in that neighborhood. The space is small - don't expect much, but if you aren't planning to stay in the room, it's great. Self-storage was convenient as well."
1426754,77702964,2016-06-03,713324,Ciprian,I'm happy that I have found Dror's place for my stay in Boston.

He was very thoughtful with providing instructions and necessities for the place.  The location in North End Boston is superb as it was walkable to restaurants, Freedom Trail, and other historic sights.  I especially loved the treats provided for us."
1426754,79036362,2016-06-10,70931662,Jean,Perfect locale and setup for someone working in the Gov't Center/downtown area -- 15-minute walk from North End charm to bustling business district. Dror was very responsive and pleasant.
1426754,79281721,2016-06-12,8556386,Jaime,This studio was adorable! From the moment we walked in we were shocked by how much you could do with such a small space. Dror really takes the time to include the smallest details to make a guest feel welcome. The check-in process was easy and he was communicative the whole time. The location was perfect for exploring the North End and the harbor and I can't wait to come back and stay here again!
1426754,79400269,2016-06-12,36345668,Leslie,"So amazing! The apartment is perfect, clean,  in a great location! Street parking is difficult but there is a lot just 3 min away - $20 per day - so convenient! Would definitely stay again."

Excellent value!
1426754,82186978,2016-06-26,44084042,Kat,"Super cute neighborhood in the North End of Boston, smack in the middle of Little Italy.  The studio was sweet and cozy, in a really neat, quirky older building, and my boyfriend and I immediately felt at home.  Noise from the stairwell was barely noticeable (it's mentioned on the listing but it wasn't an issue for us!).  I LOVED that it was walking distance from so many great restaurants, shops, and downtown!  We'll definitely be back, thank you so much for a wonderful experience in Boston!"
1426754,84146847,2016-07-05,5837162,Caren,"Dror's place was great! It's in prime North End location, however, a little bit away from the loads of tourists on Hanover Street. The apartment was pet friendly, which is always a plus. Dror was very accommodating and let us check in a little earlier than the normal check in time so we could drop the pup and make it to the Sox game on time. The apartment is small, but very charming, and just what we needed for a weekend away. I would definitely recommend! We had a great time!!! :o)"
1426754,86538999,2016-07-16,64032752,Doris,"This is a no-frills studio in a great location. The long stairway up to the second floor is very steep in spite of a small platform - might be an issue for some people. Bring a good makeup mirror if this is important to you - the bathroom lighting is bad and it is not an easy place to put on makeup. What makes this place worthwhile is it's location, otherwise it is just utilitarian. The noise from the hall was negligible but the upstairs apartment could be noisy at times."
1426754,97347014,2016-08-27,80301595,Marc-Andre,"This place was perfect. Great neighborhood, great price, great little apartment. Includes everything you need for one person or a couple. Nothing was complicated during the booking process or the stay."
"There was a very comprehensive guide to everything from the apartment itself to the neighborhood and restaurants. There was even a basket of food waiting for us on the table in case we had nothing to eat when we got there. The AC was already on and the apartment was very cool despite it being a very hot day. Very thoughtful.\"",,,,,

The property is close to Northeastern University. The area is transitional and the condo is right on the fringe which was fine but best to cab at night.
13652639,91124267,2016-08-03,83824193,Cinzia,"Everything was great, perfectly organized, clean and beautiful. The only problem is parking, even the suggested one is not so good, however, I would suggest this wonderful apartment to everyone!"

619142,1927956,2012-08-08,3097588,Marcus,"We were the first to stay in the freshly renovated first floor of Joe's building, and everything was very well restored. Our first thought upon entering this one bedroom unit was that it was much more spacious and pleasant than anything we could ever have gotten at a hotel. Besides that, the neighbourhood is peaceful, quiet, and well situated for a walk to the T subway or the ferry into downtown."
The full kitchen was nice to have for reheating leftovers or for making breakfast from the food that Joe provides. Those who want to cook more elaborate meals can find a grocery store just down the street.,,,,,
As mentioned by others,Joe is a wonderful host and his knowledge of the local history add a real,genuine flavour and culture to the entire experience. You may be considering multiple places for your Boston stay,but those places won't have Joe. If we're ever in the Boston area again,"we'll have to return back to Joe's in Charlestown.\"",

We were arriving at a very late hour and Joe went out of his way to stock the fridge with a few additional requested provisions (fruit, cheese, lox to go with the bagels)."
Any request,for directions,for a little more heat,was graciously received. The accommodations are well described,the apartment is roomy and the bed is extremely comfortable with high quality linens.  The location near Bunker Hill is easy to navigate to Harvard Square,North Station

We'll be back and would like to stay with Joe again.  Thanks for everything!"

A wonderful location in Boston/Charlestown, and close (walking distance) to many other great areas of the city.  The flat was very comfortable and spacious.  Joe was very accommodating:  we arrived (in the rain) on bicycles at the end of a 10-day cycle tour and Joe had a place for us to put our bikes inside and dry out our gear.  He also had plenty of food available for us during our stay (muffins, fruit, eggs, milk).  We would stay here again for sure."

Joe was an excellent host, he had a lot of very helpful recommendations for us and his apartment in Charlestown is a wonderful starting point if you want to explore the city.

When we arrived he gave us tips for a walk - the freedom trail which starts close to his home shows you the best of Boston - and a lovely place for lunch. He als bought some bagels, fruits and eggs for us which is a first in my airbnb experience but an absolutely lovely gesture."

It's a great area, perfect for starting the 'Freedom Trail' as the Beacon Hill monument is only a couple of minutes walk away.  There 'T' stop is about 10 minutes walk away, but there's a huge Whole Foods supermarket on the way - very handy for food shopping. You hardly need the 'T' though as it only take about 15 minutes to walk across the bridge to North End (great restaurants)."
The apartment is lovely - really nice and spacious with a proper kitchen.  Joe had stocked the fridge with juice,milk,"bagels etc. and was the perfect host - really helpful and friendly and went above and beyond to make our stay really great.

You can walk into downtown Boston to see all the sights or take the \"\"T\"\" which is just about a 5-10 minute walk. The apartment has lots of space and a full kitchen and the neighborhood is quiet and residential. You feel like a local. Joe does everything to make you feel at home from providing food to eat to giving recommendations on places to visit. I'd highly recommend staying with him and hope I have the chance the next time I'm back in Boston.\""

619142,8646965,2013-11-10,9755914,Paul,A lovely place to stay in beautiful and historic Charlestown. Joe was a great host and a great help; full of good tips of how to get around and where to see. He was even kind enough to drive us to the train station in the morning when we left for NYC.
The apartment was lovely; warm and clean and we felt very comfortable staying there. It was only blocks from the Bunker Hill monument and an easy walk into the rest of Boston via the Freedom Trail or you can get the via the ferry straight to the Aquarium. Highly recommended and would not hesitate to stay there again.,,,,,

619142,10961050,2014-03-15,3630233,Mike & Anna,"We spent a week in Boston looking for apartments for our move back. The place and location are great. The bathroom is a wee bit small (stand up shower), but the pros certainly outweigh any small things like that. Joe was very accommodating and even had some breakfast items for us in the fridge (milk, eggs, OJ)."
619142,11531995,2014-04-07,367976,Clive,Joe is the ideal host. His apartment is in the historic Bunker Hill part of Boston and is the ideal spot to from which to explore Boston on foot. We stayed in flat 1 which has large and very comfortable living and bedrooms.  The kitchen and bathroom work well.  We arrived late in the afternoon to find that Joe had generously stocked the fridge with the essentials. We had a great stay and would recommend Joe as a host to anyone visiting Boston
619142,11829750,2014-04-16,12024850,Xueni,Excellent stay. Full amenities provided. Place is kept in good condition and clean.

Breakfast is waiting in the kitchen,as is fruit and a bottle a of wine. When Joe saw that I was cold,pretty stupid of a swede not to dress according to the weather but anyway,he lent me a nice sweater for the day.,,
"Nothing to complain about really. Would look to see if it's available again our next time in Boston for sure.\"",,,,,
619142,12143297,2014-04-24,3449754,Steve,"This is a fantastic apt in a picture postcard area of Boston. I stayed here when I came to run the marathon and Joe couldn't have been any more accommodating... Bagels, juice, fruit and more were all left out for me for breakfast. He even gave me a lift to the train station a couple of days after the race when my legs were too stiff to walk properly. Top man."
619142,12536319,2014-05-05,12634691,Marjaana,Staying at Joe's place in beautiful Charlestown was the highlight of our US tour. Joe was an excellent host and his apartment our home away from home. The only complaint is that our stay was all too short. If we ever have the opportunity to return to Boston we will absolutely stay at this place.
619142,12693560,2014-05-08,13744595,Ellie,"Joe was really welcoming and provided lots of useful info, including use of Boston guidebooks, one of which we managed to lose (but replaced with a new one) so others can enjoy. The neighbourhood is really nice and it was good being a little away from the centre of Boston and you are right at the start of the Freedom Trail. We chose to do lots of walking but you could have easily got the T. The apartment has everything you need, including a powerful shower and a whistling kettle!"
619142,13064232,2014-05-19,11766237,Brian,"Joe was great, hospitable and accommodating.  He loves his city and always offered suggestions and recommendations.  The house is great, quiet neighborhood and easy walking to almost everything.  Thank you Joe."
619142,13209060,2014-05-22,12803641,Trista,"We had a great experience staying here for a few days after a family wedding. The location in Charlestown was fantastic - a quiet residential street close to everything we wanted to see. We were able to walk everything very easily. The apartment had everything we needed and was comfortable. The TV, wi-fi, coffee maker, hot water, etc. all worked fine. We could hear people walking and talking upstairs during the day, but not to the point where it bothered us. I think that is to be expected anywhere in the city. It's different than a hotel, but not bad. Joe was an excellent host and was very accommodating. We would definitely stay here again."
619142,13354668,2014-05-26,14058413,Jake,The listing was absolutely perfect and exactly what the pictures and description say. It's in a great location; short walk to the T and the harbor ferry. Joe was a great host and very friendly and accommodating. My girlfriend forgot a rain jacket and Joe offered to lend her his. He even gave us a ride to the airport! He is very familiar with the area and can offer recommendations for places to eat and things to do. I wouldn't have changed anything. My girlfriend (now fiancé) and I had an amazing trip. Thank you Joe!
619142,13561391,2014-05-31,7201483,William,"Joe is a generous, outgoing, and thoughtful person who seeks to do all he can for his tenants. A most likeable person, he went out of his way not only to pick us up at the airport but also to drive through heavy Friday afternoon traffic to take us back there (I don't think he can do this each and every time, and nothing in our arrangement with him obliged him to do so). His flat in Charlestown is comfortable, not fancy, but has everything you need (save for a working oven, which Joe is seeking to fix). All facilities work, the bed is comfortable, the neighborhood charming, the walk over to the Bunker Hill Monument a must, and Boston itself worth many hours of investigation."
619142,13781508,2014-06-04,7028056,Alison,"The apartment is in a great location. It is at one end of the freedom trail, is about a few blocks from a Wholefoods and Metro station, and is an historic area."

The apartment is clean and comfortable and about 10 mins walk to the subway station. The kitchen is well stocked with juice, milk and bagels - everything you need for a simple breakfast. Joe even surprised us with a gift card at a neighbourhood cafe. All in all, my friend and I had a great stay in Boston."
619142,16581148,2014-07-29,5604787,Magali,Great apartment in Charleston area ! 20 minutes by walking from Boston's downtown.

619142,17196133,2014-08-09,12107295,Doreen,"Joe's apartment was just as we expected. The only surprise was that the bedroom was between the living and kitchen, but it was not a problem."
It was a lovely area,and very quiet.,,,,
Its an old house,filled with period furniture,and very few mod cons,but we liked it that way. The lovely big sleigh bed,which he told us he rescued from being thrown out,was extremely comfortable.
Joe loves to talk,and we enjoyed listening to his stories. We wanted to a visit a cemetery,and he gave us a lift there,and also took us to the airport on the day we left.,,
We got talking about family,(my hobby is genealogy) and I ended up volunteering to research his family tree.,,,,
All in all,Joe was was a very good host,and we would recommend him to other couples looking for accommodation in Boston.,,,

619142,19865157,2014-09-20,13166119,Michael,"Joe runs a classic AirBnB. He is warm, considerate, friendly and unobtrusive. He stayed up till after 2am to admit us after our plane was delayed. He gave us information when asked and dropped us off at the train station at the end of our stay. His ground floor apartment is nicely fitted out with everything you might need including breakfast stuffs. Very clean. Good bed. All in all a great AirBnB and a great host."

Easy to get hold of at all times and quick to respond. Apartment was great. 8 mins from the \"\"T\"\" (underground). Location was very pretty- if we had stayed in the city we wouldn't have seen it! I'd recommended staying outside of city- fraction of the price and all of the charm! Close to start of freedom trail! Joe left us with items in the fridge too- most welcome! Wish we could have stayed longer! Comfy bed and spacious living room! Recommend to all! \""

Charlestown provided us with both and Joe set us up with everything we needed, including a laugh or two!   He got us a bottle of wine as a welcome along with bagels, fruit, juice, milk and an assortment of other things we could use for cooking.  We made breakfast in our awesome little kitchen every morning and loved every second of it.  We walked to the North End, to the long wharf and traveled anywhere else by taking the T, which was a short walk from Joe's place.  Joe was there when we needed him, but he wasn't intrusive at all.  His apartment was the perfect place for us to celebrate our 1st anniversary.  We would definitely stay there again.  Thanks, Joe!   We enjoyed staying with you!"
619142,20809540,2014-10-06,269526,Lynda,Joe was a great host. Very welcoming and knowledgable about the local area and history. He went out of his way to make sure our stay was very enjoyable.

The place was roomy,very clean,fully equiped  and really nice. The pictures provided represented truely the appartment.,,,
The area is quiet and charming,Charlesltown being a historic neighbourhood - it has preserved much of the hisotric cachet. It is an short walk to nearby historic sites: USS Constitution and Bunker Hill which are part of the freedom trail. The orange T line is easily accessible (10 min walk).,,,,
Overall,"we had a great stay in Boston and we will contact Joe for our next visit. We highly recommend the place.\"",,,,
619142,22292236,2014-11-03,9059472,Steve,"Joe is a great guy, interesting and helpful.  His rental is just 2 stars.  It's adequate and conveniently located in Charlestown, but it has shortcomings.  It was cold. The drawers in the bedroom and kitchen were full of odd stuff, like a cold chisel. The kitchen was minimally stocked with cooking implements - Joe mentioned he doesn't encourage much cooking in there - so don't plan on more than scrambling some eggs and making coffee. TV is rabbit ears not cable or Directv.   Bathroom is very small.  Overall it was just ok, but we're not likely to return."
619142,26145424,2015-02-04,16580343,George,"Joe is a great host! He gave me a warm welcome when I arrived and showed me round the town. I was in Boston for the worst snowfalls on record and Joe made sure I was warm and even lent me some winter gear. The location is perfect for exploring Charlestown, with easy access to the rest of Boston. Highly recommended!"
619142,31229771,2015-05-03,18132155,Elizabeth,"Joe's house was comfortable and very clean.  it is convenient to many places in Charlestown and to transportation to other parts of Boston.  Joe was a wonderful host.  He left supplies for a few good breakfasts.  When my flight got in late and my husband was joining me the next day, he walked with me to my daughter's house.  He checked in with us each day to make sure things were going well.  We would definitely stay at Joe's house again."
619142,32177654,2015-05-15,30809872,Emily,"Joe was very accommodating to our early check in and had the house ready upon our arrival. He was present and somewhat informative about the area. Joe has graciously stocked the fridge with eggs and milk and had also purchased bagels and bananas for us. The house is located in a charming neighborhood, easily accessible by subway and within walking distance of the Navy Yard, Cambridge and the North End. However, the experience only gets one star. The unit was dirty. The blankets and quilt were stained. The microwave had not been cleaned prior to our arrival and had food splattered about. We were not informed that the heat had been turned off and thus were unpleasantly surprised when the temperature dropped to 60 degrees during the night, with no way for us to control the temperature in the unit."

619142,45260422,2015-09-01,36980815,Josh,"Joe was a friendly and very welcoming host who is very knowledgeable about the local Charlestown and Boston areas. He spent time with us when we first arrived explaining the apartment and the local area which was really helpful. Joe had also kindly stocked the kitchen up with bagels, bananas and juice which was a very nice gesture. The apartment is located just a few streets away from the Bunker Hill Monument (the last stop on the Freedom Trail) and there is a Whole Foods Store conveniently located very nearby. If you are looking to stay in a quieter end of town in a beatuiful apartment then this is the place for you."

619142,48678652,2015-09-28,14780593,Benjamin,"We had a great time at Joe's place. Proper historic Boston, nice and quiet and really comfortable. A short walk across the bridge and you're into the Italian delis and bakeries of the North End. Joe's communication was great and he was really helpful and laid back - attentive too. Tom Brady is still a cheat, mind."
619142,50619014,2015-10-13,1801122,Agnes,We stayed at Joe's home for four days.  The location was convenient to public transportation and within easy walking distance to historical sights.

Everything was in working order, including secure, free WIFI access. He also gave us a tip and a map to use in exploring the neighborhood, esp.  the Bunker Hill Monument.  My husband and I visited Bunker Hill Monument during our free time.  The neighborhood was a typical Bostonian section with beautiful, clean buildings.   Walking around the blocks was very enjoyable.   My husband and I enjoyed our stay."

Communicates very well and get's back to you with a response very quickly.,,,,,

619142,78583523,2016-06-07,41193252,Alison,"We had a great time in Boston and would definitely recommend to anyone who asked. Joe was there to meet us when we arrived and gave us loads of ideas of where to go and how to get there. Charlestown is a lovely place and would definitely stay in this area rather than main Boston... It's so easy to walk to, or get the ferry to, or T it as well! The accommodation was lovely as well! Every thing we had expected and more! Thanks so much Joe.... If we are ever coming back to Boston we will definitely look the apartment up again... And recommend it to friends and family!"
619142,79407003,2016-06-12,4753254,Nicolas,"The only thing better than the place and the location, was Joe. He was the kindest host, he waited for us with some groceries done, and he walked with us towards downtown showing the landmarks and useful places around. Charlestown is perfect, 15 minutes walking distances away from downtown and noise, in a quiet and beautiful zone, I strongly recommend this place to stay. The apartment was very comfortable, everything worked right, fully equipped kitchen, really clean, lot of space and light, our stay in Boston was better with this choice. We had a supermarket two blocks away."
In our last day there,Joe told us there was going to be a parade just down our street,"we joined him and it was awesome. Charlestown is the place to be.\"",,,
619142,81263273,2016-06-21,55031450,Laurie,"Joe welcomed us and showed us around the apartment.  He had fresh fruit, bagels, a bottle of wine, and coffee for us (which we did not expect).  He talked to us about the area, made suggestions for our getting around.  He even walked us part way to a pub he suggested.  When our flight didn't leave until late afternoon, Joe worked with us to accommodate our luggage.  Our first visit to Boston was terrific and staying at Joe's place in Charlestown was a big part of why we had such a great time."

The apartment was great, the room was small but just what we were looking for, and the bed was super comfortable.  Patrick was the best part - very sweet (picked me up at the train station and walked me to the place), very communicative, and a great, fun guy too!  I was pretty familiar with the location, but Patrick was very informative and helpful and more than willing to point me in the direction of any good bar or restaurant he could think of.  Great value, great stay."

It is located in the Seaport area which is a great trendy newly revived area of this great city.  From start to finish, Patrick was a great communicator.   The apartment building was a newly renovated old building, so while the outside was historical, the inside was new with elevator, climate control, modern appliances and large new bathroom.   From the airport, there is a free Silver Line bus which took us to South Station which was a short walk to the flat.  We were awed the minute we stepped into the place.  The beds and pillows were unbelievably comfortable that we all slept very soundly - it felt good after our long plane journeys to Boston.  There were lots of thick towels for our use and we loved the high end bath amenities.   For washing clothes, there was modern washer and dryer, along with detergent provided by host.  In the living room, there is a comfortable leather couch and in dining area, there was table with 4 comfortable chairs.   For food, there is a wide variety of great choices within walking distance.  Wifi was fast and reliable.  Boston was very hot during our stay but the reliable AC kept us cool.   Our biggest regret was that we only stayed one day.  Thank you, Patrick!"

6908525,38197387,2015-07-13,17272414,Angela,"I rented this studio for one week in July. It is in a perfect location, but as it faces directly onto Newbury Street (which I was initially very pleased about as the view is nice) you hear everything from the street, even with the windows closed, making it difficult to get to sleep. The apartment was very clean with plenty of storage. The kitchen supplies were limited but when I mentioned this to Alicia she quickly supplied more. Access to the apartment was easy with the pin code provided. Internet access was was not great. Frequently it was very slow or I would have no access at all. I mentioned this to Alicia and she told me that more access points would be installed but this could only happen after I left. This was a big problem as I had a lot of work to do. Considering the size of the studio and how long it would take to clean it I think that the final cleaning charge was much too high. With some modifications and if you don't mind the noise this could be a great place to stay during your visit to Boston."
6908525,45261649,2015-09-01,19788628,J. Harrison,Alicia was very pleasant to work with and accommodating if ever there was an issue. She was willing to be available for any thing I may have needed. I enjoyed staying in this unit it was perfect for a three week stay and the location can't be beat!

If you don't mind 3 flights of stairs you are in the middle of the best Boston shopping street: Newbury. It simply has everything you need, even a Deli downstairs.

6908525,93362383,2016-08-12,61695285,Jessica,In Boston for a new job and decided to Airbnb it for a while while looking for a place to stay. I stayed in several different Airbnbs in Boston. Here are my takeaways from the Maverick #12 unit:
Pros:,,,,,
* Incredible location. Tons of shops/restaurants,easy walking distance to the Charles River & Copley T stop. CVS is on the corner for all your conveniences,like if you need a roll of t.p. (more on that later). OOne of the reviewers complained about the noise. I was here on a Friday and Saturday night and sure you hear a little street noise,but nothing was obnoxious and I slept just fine. If you're worried about noise,you might consider staying somewhere that is not one of the busiest areas of Boston.,
* The unit was very clean and un-lived in. The other 2 Airbnbs I stayed in were clearly someone's primary residence. This felt a bit more like a hotel experience,though it was missing a few kind of essential items (more on that later).,,,,
* It is totally remodeled. Having looked at several apts in the area to live in,this is rare. Most places in Back Bay are old and dusty.,,,,
* The shower was great,excellent water pressure and consistent temp,except one morning where the hot water was randomly broken and I was stuck with a cold shower. I alerted the owner and it was fixed same day (more on that later).,,,
* The kitchen has basic items. One nonstick pan,two small cutting boards,one sharp knife,some utensils,and bowls/plates/glasses/coffee mugs.,
* It does have DirecTV,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
* Every Airbnb I've been in offered basics like soap in the bathroom,dish soap,and extra toilet paper. None of this here - expect to buy your own. Which kinda sucks if you get in late at night and everything is closed (the Walgreens a few blocks away is 24 hrs).,,,
* The bed is a flat rectangular rock with smaller rectangular rocks for pillows. Furthermore,everything is covered in waterproof plastic that is very crinkly. Also,"if you are 5'5\"\"",expect your feet to touch the bottom. If you are taller,expect to hang off the bed. I think it's a full sized bed.,
* Having interacted with a number of hosts now,I wouldn't call Alicia super responsive. Even though she got the hot water situation fixed the same day,I had to message her a couple of times to find out if she even got my message (or voicemails).,,,
Only other thing is that the unit is on the 4th floor so be prepared to climb some stairs. Didn't bother me at all but might bother some.,,,,,
If you're looking for something with a great location,"this is your place. Just be aware of some of the considerations I've outlined. \"",,,,
6908525,96353691,2016-08-22,82397624,Arrua,This studio is exactly as depicted online. Access was easy and convenient... My unit was on the 4th floor... Which was a little annoying because I'm five months pregnant and had to lug my laptop and books up and down every day. If I wasn't pregnant I wouldn't have minded. Otherwise the location on newbury is perfect! It's in the heart of the back bay....The view was gorgeous!  Alicia was responsive and easy to reach. Even though I didn't need to contact her during my stay. I highly recommend it and will probably stay here again next time I'm in town.
14603878,97541584,2016-08-27,40987363,Mohsen,Medi is an attentive guy with a positive attitude. I enjoyed getting to know him and staying at his offered dwelling. He has been super helpful with accommodating me through my stay. We had good conversations and company altogether.

It is in a very convenient location, with easy access to downtown Boston. It's clean, neat, and perfect for two. Very simple check-in/check-out process.

197727,1463358,2012-06-11,1026914,Dennis,I stayed with Jill for a few days when I was in Boston to take care of some personal business. She was very helpful and knowledgable and always available to assist me with any information that could help me. The house is in a great jamaica Plains neighborhood which is also very safe. There was ample parking on the quiet street in front. The house was clean and beautifully furnished with antiques. It was a joy to stay with Jill. I highly recommend her.
197727,1545736,2012-06-23,2681763,James,"Sweet spot, great neighborhood, laid back host. I am a low-needs traveler and this was perfect: clean, comfortable, friendly. The 2 nice dogs and a nice cat were a pleasant addition for this animal lover."
197727,2159080,2012-09-01,2729203,Dani,"Meeting and staying with Jill has been an absolute blessing.  Beautiful home, neighborhood, dogs and room.  Very helpful in introducing me to the city of Boston.  Couldn't be more thankful for Jill!!"
197727,2461427,2012-10-01,2175279,Muriel Et Jean Claude,"Notre séjour d'un mois chez Jill Hallisey s'est passé sans fausse note. Jill est simple, directe, positive, chaleureuse. Elle a son travail, ses engagements humanitaires, elle est très indépendante, mais elle reste à l'écoute et elle n'a jamais laissé passer une occasion de nous rendre service ou de nous renseigner tout en respectant notre autonomie. Nous étions à Boston afin de prendre des repères pour un roman;  après les heures de marche dans la ville, c'était un plaisir de retrouver cette maison tranquille, de prendre un verre sur la terrasse, de respirer sur la pelouse, de passer les nuits dans un calme campagnard. Le centre de Jamaïca Plain, à deux cent mètres,  est vivant et animé, il regorge de petits restaurants typiques et de commerces, on y trouve un fabuleux café-épicerie-restaurant bio, des fringues originales...  Le bus pour Boston passe à cent mètres, mais dix minutes de marche vous amènent au métro. Si vous aimez l'espace et la nature, un lac vous attend au bout de la rue, et le Franklin Arboretum, à cinq minutes de là, est extraordinaire. Autre point : le chat et les deux chiens sont bien vivants, les chiens sont drôles, toujours contents de vous voir, et assez obéissants. La maison et ses meubles sont patinés par le temps, mais les équipements fonctionnent vraiment correctement et l'ensemble est propre. en conclusion, nous recommandons chaudement ce bnb."

197727,2596955,2012-10-13,3324436,Jennifer,"I was in Boston for business for 2 weeks and was looking for a place to stay that wouldn't break the (company's) bank and would also provide a more interesting experience than a hotel. I am so pleased to have found such a great place! Jill was a wonderful host - interesting, kind, generous, and not intrusive in the least. The 2 dogs and cat were so friendly and I loved coming home to them. Jill was usually already gone in the morning when I got up, but we saw each other a few of the evenings. She is an extremely interesting person to talk to and knows a lot about Boston and the area. I immediately felt right at home in my room and in the rest of the place as well. It's a bit of a walk to the T, but I always felt safe and it's a lovely neighborhood to walk through. There are plenty of places to pick up groceries or grab a bite to eat nearby. I was sad to leave, and would definitely go back the next time I'm in town!"
197727,2702808,2012-10-24,2771802,Katheryn,"This is such a wonderful find and incredibly comfortable, highly recommended to any future guest.  The location is superb, close to the city, but also near the Emerald Necklace's Jamaica Pond.  Jill was so flexible as there was a miscommunication regarding who was staying there: my husband and I live nearby and our our family was in town and needed a room as our place is too small.  Instead of a couple coming, a couple and an 11 month old baby was hoping to stay there!  Jill was amazingly gracious, picked us up so we didn't have to carry all the luggage, and even offered a light breakfast in the morning as the schedule was a bit overbooked.  On top of Jill's kindness, we absolutely couldn't believe how well behaved the dogs were (they were so great with the baby!) and the cat really wasn't around.   Thank you so much, Jill!  You really went over and above...we so appreciate your hospitality and thought while our family was in town staying in your room!"
197727,2776006,2012-11-01,3282219,Sandra,"My stay with Jill was a great experience. Her home is near to downtown (only a short walh to bus or T), but on the other hand in a friendly and quiet neighborhood. The ideal starting point for a great holiday!"
The room and Jill provides all you need for a comfortable stay.,,,,,
Jill is a very interesting person who provides a lot of information about the Boston and the life there. It was a pleasure to stay with her!,,,,,
And also with the pets who are absolutely lovely.,,,,,

197727,6753106,2013-08-24,6719434,Julia,"I stayed with Jill for 8 weeks this summer (2013), while I was joining a summer school. Jill was indeed a perfect flatmate/host, giving my stay a homy feel as of the first day."
Jill is very welcoming and helpful,but not the least bit intrusive. You have everything you need around,and the flat is clean and in a convenient and nice area (pond just behind the house,bus stop nearby). My husband also stayed for 2 weeks,and he could go sailing with Jill some days,which he absolutely loved. Jill is a very interesting women

197727,9514731,2014-01-01,6872289,Sarah,"Jill was a wonderful host! She is an amazing person, who has a passion for running and sailing, people in Haiti, her friends and her pets. Buddy and Angel are so lovely and well behaved. The room was tidy, clean and very comfortable. Jill gave me a lot of private sphere, but always helped me out whenever I needed her. Furthremore, I have come to love Jamaica Plain! It is such a nice neighborhood for both young and experienced people. As a woman you do not have to worry walking by your own at night. Cute houses everywhere and the pond right around the corner, bars and restaurants very close to where Jill lives. Jill was very helpful whenever I planned a trip in the area of Boston, but even with my trip to New York! She was a great host. I strongly recommend staying with her. Thank you, Jill, for making me feel at home!"

The house is adorable, in an awesome location, clean, and very welcoming.

Buddy and Angel are very sweet and well-behaved.  Highly, highly recommend!  Thanks Jill! :-)"

Jill is very careful to give you privacy, but she is very eager to help. Jill always invited me along if I was interested to have dinner or try a new gym, and Jill took me out sailing for the first time ever. Jill is the best!"
4460532,22562120,2014-11-09,23230202,Anna,I had a good experience at Jonathan's place. He's done a lot of work on the place to renew it and make it clean. He has a good eye for interior design and remodeling.
The other people staying there were great,too.,,,,
Jonathan was a nice guy,always had a smile on his face,and was easy to talk to and get advice from on where to get food and whatnot. He was also patient with my last-minute planning.,,,
This was my first time staying at an airbnb. Since I was having to plan things last minute,I probably would be more careful next time to look at cancellation and alteration policies.,,,,
But the way Jonathan runs everything is professional and totally understandable. If looking for a place to stay in Boston,"I would definitely recommend this place.\"",,,,
4460532,22938933,2014-11-17,268783,Will,"This was a perfect, comfortable and well-thought out room for a short or longer stay. It's an ~$8 Uber or cab from the centre of things. I was arriving quite late (10.30pm), but Jonathan was still able to accommodate."
The bathroom is right next to the room,so it's almost an en-suite. The room had lots of towels,and extra blankets in case the (great) heating isn't enough.,,,
This was a surprise business trip for me,and being able to book this from the tarmac was incredible. Jonathan was warm,receptive and understanding and went out of his way to make things work out (even when I couldn't respond to his messages for a few hours).,,,
No complaints. This is a good visit,"for business or pleasure.\"",,,,

4460532,25068644,2015-01-05,25411948,Bob,"When we first arrived to the area in the late evening, we were concerned about the neighborhood because it looked sketchy and run-down. We later learned that it is an area in the midst of transition; Jonathan's brownstone is a good example of recent improvements made in some of the older houses. Parking can be a challenge, but we did find a spot right beside the place. Jonathan's place is really clean, comfortable and clutter-free and we enjoyed our stay. We actually only met him in person at the end of our stay, but he had communicated with us via text, was well organized and had everything ready for us, even though we made the reservation just two days before we came. He is close to the Museum of Fine Arts (though it would be a long walk -- we drove). There is also a very friendly Baptist church behind his house that we attended on Sunday."

The neighborhood is fairly quite which also means walking about 15min to get a bite to eat. I would have liked more than one towel for all my bathing needs. The bed was a bit more firm/stiff than I am use to.
4460532,41555998,2015-08-07,40511189,Lingling,Nice host. Will recommend to my friends.

He has a very good system to get the key and gave me all the information I needed via email. The description of  his place is accurate. The area where he lives feels pretty safe. There is decent parking in the street and I was able to leave my car filled with stuff and there was no problem.  There are other 2 rooms that he rents. All share a bathroom that is spacious and clean. The only minus is that I had to climb 3 sets of stairs, one outside and two inside to get to my room. Good exercise if you are not helping your son move that weekend like a was. There is a window air conditioner that is a bit loud. I did not use the kitchen. Only the refrigerator. Overall I give his place a very high rating."

The place was extremely neat and clean, great system with the keys in order for us to check in and out, fresh water in our room, a separate area in the bathroom and kitchen for guests needs, and he even messaged us frequently to see how our trip was going. Only met him once but he was a very outgoing, friendly, intelligent guy who was happy to help us with our plans. The location of the house is great as its a quick walk to the T stop and Boston is very easy to get around with the subway. The only thing we found was we preferred to take an Uber home at night which was no problem as its a short and inexpensive trip from downtown. Would definitely love to stay at Jonathan's place again next time we're in Boston!"

He told us he renovated the house himself and that effort definately pays off as the house is bright and spacious. The neighbourhood is OK, and connections to the subway is easy (although you have to walk up one street and some stairs, so not recommended with suitcases). Very suitable for a pleasant stay in Boston:)"

Metro is 5-7 minutes walk. Jonathan was very welcoming, a true global citizen and we had a great chat. He really thought about all the things to make our stay comfortable and was very accommodating. There was even a guide customized by him and chocolate, all as a welcome gift! We had a very enjoyable time and would definitely come back in the future :)"

Although Jonathan wasn't around when I arrived, he left very clear and easy instructions for obtaining the keys and finding my way to my room. Parking is readily available usually right out front. His house is beautiful, everything is very clean, neat, and modern. The room was prepared in advance with towels, a pitcher of water and a glass, and some guides to the area among other miscellaneous convenience items.

He made sure that I was having great time in Boston. The location of the apartment is very convenient, just 5 mins away from the subway station and bus station.

Jonathan contacted us to see if everything went well and turned on a light at entrance of the apartment building just for us.  We felt so welcomed.  On top of that, Jonathan welcomed us as if we were close friends, not being intrusive at all but being very considerate for our needs."

We arrived later than expected, and he was kind enough to leave a light on for us. We had no trouble following his very clear instructions, and everything was exactly as described and as seen in photos. The house is beautifully renovated and very well maintained. It was as clean as a hotel room would be, but more nicely decorated and with much more character! The neighbourhood is quiet, and conveniently located at only about a 5 minute walk from the T. An Uber into the city (Fenway) cost us an average of $7."

Thank you for the wonderful place to stay!
4460532,80973062,2016-06-20,1821721,Marissa,"My stay at Jonathan's brownstone was wonderful. He was very communicative and accommodating and even let me check in an hour early as soon as my flight arrived since there wasn't a guest the previous night. After 14 hours of travelling and a red-eye flight, this made my day and gave me more time to freshen up and explore Boston. He also had water and chocolate waiting in the room. These are the little extra details that make an excellent host. The pictures are true to the apartment. It was very clean and comfortable. I never got to meet Johnathan, but I enjoyed meeting some of the other Airbnb guests, all of whom were very friendly, considerate and who came from all corners of the world. I also enjoyed the neighborhood and city tips Johnathan provided. The apartment is located a short 5 minute walk away from Roxbury T Station, which I used to go everywhere during the day. I also used Uber to get around later at night which was never more than a 10 minute ride away from wherever I was and cost $10-$20 depending on Uber's surge pricing. The apartment is also a pleasant walk away from the Museum of Fine Arts. The neighborhood itself has lots of character, beautiful architecture, and green spaces, so it felt like a refuge at the end of the day. Thanks for sharing your home Jonathan!"

There were a TV with xfinite, good wifi, clean towers, an iron, a hairdryer, a rack for handing wet clothes......., in fact, all the things I needed in the room. The fringe, the stove, cutleries and tablewares were all good. I could cook my meal very conveniently."
"Jonathan was super nice and helpful. We had drinks and watched Copa America final together. He even brought me out with his family to watch the firework on July 4. Jonathan was perfect. I am hoping to come back and stay in his house soon.\"",,,,,

The home itself is very modern and newly renovated. The neighborhood isn't the greatest, but I never felt unsafe, even at night. The train station is a short walk away with a 15 minute ride to downtown. Highly recommended at a very reasonable price."

Not only he is super helpful and friendly, he is also a perfectionist about keeping his apartment clean and neat. Rooms, bathroom and all the other areas are as clean as a 5 star hotel. The cozy apartment is very beautifully decorated. I can definitely say the photos of the apartment are 100% accurate. Instructions about checking in and out were super clear and convenient. He also helped us with great suggestions about the local spots. Next time when we come to Boston his apartment will be our first preference."
4460532,87995092,2016-07-22,21155599,Bumsoo,It was really wonderful place to stay in Boston. Host also very friend and kind. Jonathan sent me some massages everyday to check my staying.

Its close location next to the orange line made it super easy to use Boston Transit. We ended up parking right outside and leaving our car there for the remainder of our stay with zero problems."
4460532,89230159,2016-07-27,83408813,Mai,"Overall, my friend and I loved our stay with Jonathan. He was a very gracious host. From the get-go, Jonathan sent me very detailed and precise instructions of the apartment. It demonstrated not only his attentive nature, but also an individual who strives for quality. The bedroom itself was beautiful and we were greeted with chocolate and water upon our arrival! What a nice a touch! Jonathan even let us leave our bags prior to our check-in time so we didn't have to haul them around the city. We also met his adorable mother who showed us where the T station was. All in all, a wonderful stay with an amazing host! We will definitely stay here again if we find ourselves back in the city."
4460532,90211943,2016-07-31,67577813,Marc,"This was our first airbnb experience so not much to compare with. However, if all hosts are like Jonathan I will use airbnb as main channel to book my stays. Very good and attentive host, has a lot of tips to do prepared for you and house is very clean. We would recommend it to anyone staying in Boston! 5 star."
4460532,98102923,2016-08-29,92053805,Eduardo,"The place is great, a very good sized bedroom with a shared bathroom right next to the bedroom and a shared kitchen downstairs. Jonathan is a fantastic host, I did not get to meet him but we stayed in touch via text and he really makes you feel welcome. There was a chocolate and maps with recommended sites/restaurants, clean sheets and towels at the room. I met some of the other people living/staying at the place and they were ll very nice.

One small hiccup was that at first we did not realize there was an elevator and had to climb-up five looooong flights of stairs up to the apartment. We later found the small vintage elevator, which made things a lot better. It would help if the elevator was better marked and if it was mentioned in the welcome message."

We were in apartment 4 Front and there was a lot of space for the 5 of us.  The only drawback was that the front bedroom facing the street was very loud with street traffic at all hours of the night.  Overall, a wonderful place and I would definitely stay again."

When I arrived, she took my luggage up to the apartment on the second floor while I parked my car.  She made me some tea, showed me where the coffee was for the morning and what was available for breakfast in the refrigerator.  We ended up chatting for almost a hour in the kitchen, which I very much enjoyed.  A lovely person."
The room was exactly what the picture shows.  The Bed was comfortable.  The room was nice and sunny with nice plants; a table/desk; a closet with hangers (I had brought my own but didn't need to); and an ceiling fan with dimmable lights and a remote control so you could turn the lights off without getting out of bed.,,,,,
The apartment was decorated in an eclectic way - lots of pretty things Susan found at garage sales - reminded me of my youth and added to the charm.  It fit in perfectly with the town of JP.,,,,,

The room in the apartment feels larger than pictured and there was a comfortable fan for the hot summer evenings. The location of the house was very convenient when using the metro station and is approximately a 5 min walk away. All in all, I had a great few days in Boston."

We especially enjoyed having the breakfast she provided on her beautiful and peaceful balcony, and generally loved spending time relaxing in the apartment.  Jamaica Plains is a very pretty residential area with a great park, and close to the subway.  We'd definitely stay here again - thank you Susan (and Shuki)!"
11912139,92572504,2016-08-09,84896748,Klaus,I had a really nice stay at Susan's place. The neighborhood is awesome with lots of restaurants and little bars and it's not too far from downtown. I can strongly recommend staying there while visiting Boston.
11912139,97010934,2016-08-25,41758545,Jen,"I had a wonderful stay at Susan's. Susan was on an overseas trip at the time, which was a shame as I feel like we would have hit it off really well. She was a great communicator - she even messaged me one morning, all the way from her holiday in the UK, to tell me that the Museum of Fine Arts (which is a must-see) had free entry that evening - so thoughtful!"
In her absence,Susan's current housemates made me feel very welcome - absolutely charming people! They made me feel very much at home. And Shuki the cat is a real cutie.,,,,
Susan lives in a lovely neighbourhood. 5 minutes walk from a wonderful Whole Foods store,and 5 minutes walk in the other direction to the train station,with frequent trains. You can buy a 7-day unlimited travel pass from the machine at the local train station.,,,
Susan's home is full of interesting bits and bobs - you almost don't need to go to the wonderful galleries that Boston has on offer,as there's something new and interesting round every corner at Susan's!,,,,
Loved my room - it was light and bright,with tonnes of storage,and I really appreciated having a desk. It was hot in Boston and the window fan made the room very pleasant. Be aware that the bed is very very firm - if you like a firm bed then you should be fine,but someone used to a soft bed might struggle.,,
Susan provided lots of local guidebooks,some of which are more up-to-date than others. I was thrilled to see she had a fairly recent version of the DK Eyewitness Boston Guide (I love those DK guidebooks),and I made extensive use of one of the other books,Walking Tours of Boston.,,
The photo of the deck doesn't do it justice - it's fairly large,and a lovely place to spend some time,with charming views of treetops and rooftops (really cute rooftops!),,,

My most lasting impression is that I felt like I was at an extended stay hotel - professional, comfortable, lots of amenities, etc. The room was very comfortable, it's a beautiful place to stay, and everything is quite comfortable. You get the whole kitchen to use if you want to have breakfast or make coffee/tea, etc. Victoria is very dedicated to making the stay comfortable - for example she left an umbrella by the front door for me since it was raining and she noticed I didn't have one.

The room was quite confortable and everything went well.  The only thing that we missed somewhat was the possibility of discussing with you about some advice or tips regarding Boston surroundings. Of course,there is so much to do in Boston that we left early in the morning and came back late at night,so understandably,our schedule did not match exactly with yours. It would just have been nice to have the chance to chat a little bit more with you when we all happened to be home. Hopefully,we'll have that chance next time we're in town :-) Thank you so much Victoria ! We will highly recommend your place to our friends and close circles..,

1179399,32064240,2015-05-13,1908510,Padmanabhan,Very friendly host and very helpful. Accurate description of property. Very clean. Two minute walk from the T trains ( metro). Overall good value for money.
1179399,32479796,2015-05-18,27475027,Nitin,"Victoria mad us feel very welcome, even though we ended up calling her quite late.  The room was exactly as advertised, and to our complete satisfaction."
1179399,32822319,2015-05-22,28232149,Jiun-Ren,"Victoria's house is very close to the Shawmut station and it is easy to get to the airport. You just need to take the red line and transfer to silver line at South Station. The room is spacious and the memory foam bed is very comfortable. Victoria is very responsive and has given detailed information about our stay. You share the kitchen and bathroom with the guests staying in the other room, and many utensils as well as tea and coffee are provided."
1179399,32975661,2015-05-24,21213541,Zdenek + Nadja,"\"Bydleli jsme u Victorie 3 dny. Vše bylo a proběhlo tak jak je popsáno v nabídce. Victoria je milá dáma, která má ráda čistotu a pořádek - takže bydlení u ní bylo velmi příjemné. Obývali jsme pokoj R1 - je větší než rovněž nabízený R2. Oba pokoje mají společnou kuchyňku a koupelnu. Victorie bydlí o patro výš, takže jsme se po celou dobu vlastně nepotkali - kromě příjezdu. Dům stojí u menšího parku, okolí je velmi pěkné a klidné. 3 minuty chůze je stanice bostonské rychlodráhy. Cesta do centra trvá cca 15 minut. Okolí \"\"metra\"\" a domu Victorie je bezpečné i pro noční návraty z centra. Strávili jsme v Bostonu krásné chvíle i díky bydlení u Victorie. Doporučujeme.\""
1179399,33258757,2015-05-26,25476283,Matt,My girlfriend and I had a great time.  The house was clean and parking was ample.  It felt like a hotel as we had privacy and peace and quiet.   I would stay with Victoria again.
1179399,33612993,2015-05-30,28953246,Maxim,"Victoria I should a great hoster . Me and my wife has been contacted by her a couple days before our arrival. She explained how to get home,  and was very hostile to us.  We had a very positive experience. If I will come back to the Boston,  I would ask her again to settle us."
1179399,34633949,2015-06-10,31155930,Jason,"Victoria's place was very clean, spacious and is located in a very warm residential area. Loved the gas lights and how close the place was to the subway (5 minute walk). I was able to stay parked in front of her place for the week without any issues. Overall I would recommend this place- Victoria gives you privacy while still making you feel at home. The only criticism I have is that the house is located near areas that I would not feel 100% comfortable walking through on my own late at night-but I had encountered no problems during my stay...two thumbs up!"
1179399,34819117,2015-06-12,5985445,Paul,"With a super comfy bed and a quiet ground floor room in a gorgeous neighbourhood within easy reach of Boston's centre, I was totally satisfied with my two nights spent in Boston. Victoria is an attentive, friendly host quick to respond but never intrusive. Great experience!"
1179399,35207766,2015-06-16,30173811,媛,"房间很干净,卧室和厕所都很大,房子对着一个小花园,环境很好,很安静!房间离地铁非常近!victoria很热情,考虑很周到,冰箱上写了一个小纸条,指明了附近的地铁和超市的位置!下次还会在来的!"
1179399,35436016,2015-06-18,10945953,Martin,"Victoria is a very friendly host. We apprecited to stay at her house. It was very nice and easy for uns. The location is very good for excursions in Boston, because the T-Train Station is very close. The guestrooms are very spacious, clean and tidy. We like the victorian style houses in the gaslight street very much."
1179399,37312867,2015-07-06,20536407,Melissa,"This was a great house, so close to the train lines and only one train away from the city. We really enjoyed our stay here, the room came with a shared kitchen and bathroom (shared with one other bedroom also rented on AirBnB). Although the hosts were not home while we were there, their key collection and welcome note were well organized, making the stay very easy. The hosts left us a map of local restaurants and grocery stores, brochures and menus for take away restaurants and also outlined where the entrance to the metro was. We would definitely come back and stay here. The street was very safe."
1179399,37747420,2015-07-10,32995416,Pam,Victoria met us as the taxi unloaded our cases and quickly made us feel at home in her lovely home. The property was very well presented and out large bedroom with queen bed was very comfortable. Kitchen facilities were neat and tidy and adequate for our needs. Victoria provided a locality map showing nearby shopping and dining options. She also provided take-away or home delivery menus from a range of local food outlets. Property is close to railway station and it only took 20 minutes to be in the heart of Boston
"We were very pleased with our stay.\"",,,,,
1179399,37991140,2015-07-12,22221101,Tina,"Victoria was very helpful and gave us detailed instructions on finding their place.  The house was gorgeous in a beautiful historic neighborhood.   Everything was even better than described.  The room was large, bed comfortable & bathroom & kitchen were more than necessary.  She was very helpful with tourist advice & directions. Made our first airbnb experience very enjoyable & one I will definitely do again."
1179399,38830058,2015-07-19,6339533,Aarti,Cute place! Awesome communication! Really helpful! Victoria and her husband are really sweet and helpful. The Olav was spotless and directions and interactions were all great! Thank you so much for welcoming us!!
1179399,39308253,2015-07-22,26368179,Siobhain,"I used this rental for a fun get together with an old friend, travelling with a dear friend from high school. (We are women in our 50's) We only saw Victoria briefly, but she was very helpful with information via email prior to our stay. We stayed two nights and were only at the house late at night and early in the morning. This was a perfect place for us in Boston. We are not used to public transportation but were able to manage the subway quite easily and enjoyed the walk to and from the Shawmut station. You can definitely feel the subway underfoot in the house, but it did not disturb our sleep. The room, kitchen area, and bathroom were very clean. One night we shared this space with a friendly young couple from Germany. On the second night we never saw our fellow renters. The neighborhood is quaint and the neighbors friendly, one guided us to the correct house when we arrived, and we chatted with another who was walking his dog.  I can recommend this rental without reservation."
1179399,39613851,2015-07-25,32385368,Gretchen,"This was the most perfect place to stay.  I know I will echo what everyone else has said, but if you are looking for a nice place to stay, don't want to go to a hotel and don't mind that you will be sharing a bathroom and kitchen with someone else, then this location is a must.  It was so close to the 't' and just a short ride to downtown.  I was able to keep my car parked out front all week and felt completely safe that it wouldn't be damaged or broken into.  Due to our schedules I never got to actually meet Victoria.  However, she left the key and detailed instructions for everything.  I was in Boston for a summer college class and the room had a nice comfortable desk, plenty of room and lighting and wonderful air conditioning.  She left towels for me and there was even a spot in the bathroom to put toiletries.  The fridge was spacious and the kitchen had all the essentials needed to cook quick meals.  It was like staying at a suite in a hotel only much cheaper.  I will be returning and loved every minute of my stay."
1179399,40351594,2015-07-30,2133892,Dylan,"Victoria's home is absolutely beautiful with a clean safe friendly neighborhood surrounding a small park. Inside is clean, bright, and inviting. Climate control kept us comfy and the mattress and bedding was way better then any hotel. Victoria was a non-imposing host gracious and polite. We had all the privacy we wanted, but felt like we could contact Victoria or her husband with any questions."
During our stay in Room 1 (of two) the second was occupied. We don't mind a friendly face around and there is ample communal space,and plenty of hot water.,,,,
Everything was clearly marked and available. The host provided towels and clean sheets,there is a computer dest and low table for a suitcase. Kitchen had all the appliances clean and available for use except for a toaster as well as a few basics like oil and salt and peper.,,,,
The parking was amazing for a city,no zoning issues . I felt secure leaving my car for the whole day,didn't even pull the radio faceplate off. This was a nice change of pace,normally parking in a city is a nightmare and costs an arm and a leg. Public transportation in Boston works correctly and Victoria's home is very close to a subway station.,,
If you are a smoker Victoria asks that you smoke across the street in the park and not on the front porch. Access to the back yard is restricted. During the beautiful summer evenings I was staying this wasn't a problem. However in the winter this might have reduced to 4 stars. The park is very nice and a peaceful stroll wasn't an issue this time of year.,,,,,
"We had a wonderful stay.\"",,,,,
1179399,40921437,2015-08-03,25205052,Lupe,Had a very good experience . Very clean house. Victoria always accommodated us with our needs.
1179399,41411425,2015-08-07,32125619,Becky,"Victoria was a great host, making sure everything was fine during our stay and willing to offer suggestions for our stay in Boston. The room was perfect for our stay, very private, close to the subway, plenty of parking, everything we needed during our stay."
1179399,43485194,2015-08-20,13716985,Didi,"\"房东Victoria拥有美丽可亲的笑容,她是我在airbnb遇到的最nice的房东。她的家位于美丽的park street上,鲜艳的花、茂盛的绿色植物,我一到这里就爱上了。停车位非常充足,完全不用担心。由于我下午要接孩子放学,Victoria给我提供了一切的便利,使我顺利地去接到孩子。她的家距离red line \"\" Shawmut\"\" metro station 仅仅5分钟的步行时间"
1179399,45652399,2015-09-05,30652773,Jonathan,"This was our first Air B&B experience and we found it great. This is a beautiful home set in a lovely, friendly neighbourhood   The facilities were very good and our room was very spacious . Although we were too busy to meet Victoria all her pre trip messages were friendly and helpful this property represents good value for money."
1179399,46473154,2015-09-11,35108478,Yi-Fang,"Victoria的房子就在shawmut站附近, 在站內一上樓就要往左邊的出口(非進站入口)才是對的, 不然會越走越遠, 走路只要5分鐘內就會抵達。當晚我們迷路很晚才抵達, 但Victoria很耐心且擔心的等待, 真的很貼心。房子很乾淨舒適, 廚房用品齊全(鍋子,碗盤,刀叉,水壺,茶包...),  房間很大,床也超好睡,浴室很乾淨,乾濕分離,洗澡也是一個享受! 去日本停留時, 真的超想念Victoria的房子。 賣場也離住所很近約5分鐘就會到了。晚上也不太擔心晚回家,路上的路燈都很亮。很推薦去波士頓旅遊的人,到Victoria家住喔。"
1179399,46874076,2015-09-14,36118168,Andy,Nice large room with shared bathroom in a good neighborhood with 3 min distance to the local subway. Complete coordination ahead of the arrival was perfect.
1179399,47173093,2015-09-16,5856233,René,"Victoria and Tim's home and hosting were perfectly accommodating. Great location in quiet and lovely circle around a small park.  Just around the corner from the MBTA with little need to transfer more than once (except to/from airport). Boston is easily enjoyed on foot and the day(s) passes are a terrific value. As a host myself, I not only recommend, but look forward to staying again in Victoria and Tim's home the next time I'm in Boston."
1179399,47626602,2015-09-21,33891733,Ivy,"Victoria is a kindly host. Her house is  very clean, comfortable, quite and so close to the subway Red Line. Just 3 mins! So  I have a good time during these days."
"I will choose her house when I visit Boston next time. ^^ \"",,,,,
1179399,48380454,2015-09-26,31972604,Susanne,Der aufenthalt bei victoria ist absolut empfehlenswert. Huebsches zimmer. Sehr sauber. In der kueche kann gekocht werden.
1179399,48862746,2015-09-29,32084662,Carol,Victoria greeted us warmly and made us feel welcome when we arrived after a long flight from California. Her home is a lovely three story Victorian located in a southern suburb of Boston. It is easily reached from Logan Airport by a short bus ride to South Station and a subway ride from there. The suburb of Dorchester appears to be a transitional area. Victoria's street is especially nice because it borders a park and is lit by gaslight.  The subway is only two blocks away and makes it possible to conveniently reach the historic center and other places of touristic interest without a car.
My friend and I rented both the first floor rooms,because we wanted to have a private bathroom and kitchen. The rooms were simply but attractively decorated and very clean. Coffee,tea,and a few other staples were available in the kitchen. Victoria directed us to restaurants within walking distance,where we were able to have a good dinner. The only downside to staying at this location is that,even though the subway is about two blocks away
1179399,49759327,2015-10-06,4908262,Armin,"Victorias Doppelzimmer ist in einem wirklich historischen Haus - wie der gesamte Straßenzug. Ein echt cooles Gefühl mal in sowas gewohnt zu haben. Als es an einem unserer Tage etwas kühl wurde, ging die Heizung an - eine Warmluftheizung mit Schlitzen aus dem Fußboden - sowas kannte ich nur aus Filmen."
Mit der Red-Line ist mal schnell im Boston Zentrum,also die Wohnlage gut,extrem ruhig und mal fühlt sich sicher.,,,
Meine Empfehlung,"wenn es nicht so teuer sein muss und man das Bad teilen mag mit dem zweiten (Einzel)Zimmer.\"",,,,
1179399,50045943,2015-10-08,14602260,Fiona,"Can be hard sometimes to live up to good reviews but Victoria's place surpassed my expectations. We had the place to ourselves the first night & shared it with another guest the second night. We had the double room which was big & light filled with a great bed & big towels,  shampoo etc. The apartment is lovely & it was so good to have a kitchen we could use, particularly for breakfast. There was tea & coffer & other useful bits & peices in the kitchen which was v helpful.  Victoria was v welcoming & helpful, let us leave our luggage in early,  left lots of great info & also gave us help locating places we wanted to visit.  She is a really nice lady. She was also v efficient in her communication which is often not the case."
"The location is v handy to the T & its is only 15/20 mins to town. You can hear the train at night but I am a light sleeper & didn't find it a problem at all so wouldn't let that put you off.  We had a lovely stay & would highly recommend this airbnb.\"",,,,,
1179399,50622229,2015-10-13,10944626,Shona,"House was in a lovely area, 2-3 minutes walk to subway. Walk to house from subway was well-lit and felt safe. You can hear the trains while in the room, but they aren't disturbing. Room was big, with private kitchen, big bathroom, all well equipped. We only met Victoria briefly, but there was a full list of instructions & guidance about the house left in the room which was helpful. Maps also provided and recommended nearby restaurants which was also appreciated. Dot to dot cafe definitely worth a visit!"
As I said,only met Victoria briefly,but she was always prompt in responding to any email queries prior to check in.,,,
Would really recommend if visiting Boston,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1179399,50914406,2015-10-16,32084662,Carol,"This was my second stay at Victoria's house. You will see I previously posted a review after my September 2015 stay. The subway rumble mentioned in that review was not so bothersome that I didn't want to return. The location is convenient, and I loved having a kitchen to prepare a quick breakfast before setting out for the day or reheat leftovers after a restaurant meal. My travel companions and I rented both units to assure we would have private use of the bath and kitchen."
Victoria is hospitable,"but not intrusive. Her home is simply decorated and very clean. I enjoyed staying here and would do it again.\"",,,,
1179399,51426148,2015-10-20,33015520,Sian,"Lovely little home in Boston, such a short walk to the metro station and we had a very good take away Thai from the menus that were recommended."
1179399,51701787,2015-10-24,16211545,Beate,"Victoria's place was really beautiful, I stayed in the larger room. Everything was very clean. The neighborhood is really nice too. The subway is close by, so you should be aware you can hear it. Victoria has be a nice host, everything worked out perfectly."
1179399,52311701,2015-10-28,8230975,Joëlle,Victoria est à la fois très discrète et présente. Elle a su m'accueillir très rapidement car je devais aller chercher mes enfants à l'aéroport et après nous a expliqué comment trouver de quoi dîner et l'organisation de sa maison.
Le logement est indépendant et on se sent vraiment libres.,,,,,
C'est très propre et la literie est vraiment confortable.,,,,,
Le quartier est populaire et la maison est située autour d'un square entourée de jolies maisons. Le métro est vraiment très proche et le centre ville est rapide à rejoindre.,,,,,

Victoria was in constant communication with us about arrangements and scheduling.,,,,,
"We had a great experience.\"",,,,,
1179399,53455022,2015-11-09,40283756,Catriona,"What a great place to stay! The neighbourhood is beautiful (if you're interested in 19th century Victorians you're in fora  treat), and it's a three minute walk to the Shawmut station on the Red Line - perfect for exploring downtown Boston and Cambridge."
Victoria was welcoming and helpful,and stayed in constant communication with us prior to the visit. The room was clean,warm,"hospitable and very comfortable; and the kitchen and bathroom were excellent.  It definitely had a \"\"home-away-from-home\"\" feel.",,
Additionally; some reviews mention the subway trains going by underneath. We definitely noticed,"but it didn't bother us at all and if you're used to city noise it won't be a problem. \"",,,,

The room was clean and had a comfortable bed. There was even coffee/tea & basic amenities. Victoria was really accommodating & a quick-to-respond host. We had a great stay! Definitely recommended."
1179399,54339322,2015-11-18,48167252,Charlie,Victoria and her husband were the perfect hosts. They let us check in early as we arrived in the morning and didn't want be looking around Boston with our bags.
There are good maps showing you how to get to shops/restaurants etc.,,,,,
The train station literally is a 2/3 min walk away so perfect for getting into the centre.,,,,,

Subway is just a walking distance and it is easy to commute downtown and any other places you want to visit! Victoria is nice enough to offer an umbrella when it was raining. Her husband even helped pick me up when I got lost on the way home! A nice and kind couple and house is clean and neat. You can't ask for any better!!
1179399,55742189,2015-12-05,39390340,Nic,"Great place- everything you want and a beautiful location. No fuss and easy, very close to subway and subway is generally quicker to get around Boston than a car."

My boyfriend was running the Boston Marathon and the house is located about a 3 minute walk to the red line and only 15 minutes from downtown Boston.

1179399,77970875,2016-06-04,11463830,Yuan,"Victoria was really friendly. I stayed in her house for 6 nights. She came check me out see if I was ok and showed me a lot of other fun places I could go, such as Georges island, some museums. I really appreciated. It made my trip prefect! The location was good. 2 mins walking from the south red line, then 15 mins till Downtown. I got a 7day pass, very convenient."

1179399,80000167,2016-06-15,10366845,Alison,"The room was fine, had everything but a little tired, but it is in a gorgeous street which is very convenient for the T, the Red Line takes you straight to downtown and Harvard. The shops aren't super interesting but there are groceries and post office etc. There is a lovely cafe Home.Stead if you don't want to make breakfast, although there is a full kitchen so you can. And i thought Pho So 1 opposite the cafe was really nice Vietnamese food, it looks shabby but was way way nicer than what I had in Chinatown in Boston. All in all a good value place really."

Nous n'avons vu Victoria qu'une fois en arrivant,"mais elle a répondu à toutes nos questions et nous a montré les lieux.

I wasn't in Boston but I gave me all the information how I should arrive from the airport to his apartament and text me a message when I arrived and when I left the apartament. His room was good and his (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) were nice. His apartament was a good optin for renting a room, according to the localization ( 30 min from downtown) and good price. However, the apartament was not clean at all."
4838985,30491709,2015-04-23,23861334,Lee,"The description provided on the site was accurate regarding the apartment and neighborhood.  I did not personally meet our host, but the first to arrive in our group said she was accommodating.  The pictures on the page were much more appealing than the reality of the situation.  The apartment was very hastily cleaned, if at all before our arrival.  The floors were dirty, dirty laundry was out, and the kitchen did not appear to have been cleaned recently.  There was a lot of clutter left out throughout the apartment.  With this being our first use of AirBnB, I was a little disappointed, but only in the fact that the host had not taken the time to give us clean conditions prior to our arrival."

Hasan was willing to meet me at the apartment to make sure I got settled in after my long flight.  After I found out that my flight was more than 2 hours delayed, getting me in at 2a on a Thursday, Hasan offered to meet me at the apartment at 2:30a to welcome me.  He certainly went above and beyond!"

The apartment was clean and fit my needs well as someone staying the night for business, and Hasan even laid out some complimentary snacks and drinks. Hasan himself was very friendly, easy to coordinate with, and made himself accessible for whatever my needs were."

The room was actually ready by the time we went to drop off our bags early which was a nice bonus.  The building had some plumbing problems which affected our unit which was inconvenient, but Hasan came right over and worked through the night to get a plumber there to fix it. The unit is conveniently located near south station. we walked everywhere and took an occasionally T train. We stayed 3 nights and didn't use a cab once."

8830015,76476115,2016-05-27,19961597,Michael,"We enjoyed our two night stay in Hasan's apartment very much. The location was at the edge of Chinatown within easy walking distance from South Station. There were many dining choices particularly Chinese of course, but there were other alternatives as well. We particularly enjoyed coffees at Jaho, just nearby. Hasan was a very kind and helpful host, probably one of the best we have met. Hasan even offered to take us to the Aquarium with free entry on his membership account. Hasan also stocked the apartment with plenty of bottled water and soft drinks. On our first night, there was a malfunction with the building security entrance lock.  Hasan was most prompt in making sure we gained entry to building very soon after we rang him. This apartment was entirely adequate for our party of four on a short stay, however there is no dining area. This could be a problem for anyone planning to dine in. The best features of this apartment were it's convenient location and Hasan's faultless hosting service."

Right from the beginning he was very helpful in giving us instructions on accessing the building and apartment, and ensured we had everything we needed for a great 1 week stay.  We were in Boston for a conference, and the location of this apartment was perfect for that.  We were walking distance to the BCEC, as well as most parts of downtown Boston.

Our host Hasan is very easy to work with and is very considerate. He even provided some drinks,"like soda and tea upon arrival. Checkout is also easy so long as you follow the instruction.\"",,,,
8830015,86882043,2016-07-17,11194390,Joy,"Hasan is a nice host, who gave us detailed directions and suggestions for parking of the car. He also managed to give us an early check-in. As for the apartment, as long as it is located in China town, it is convenient to a lot of Chinese restaurants. And also close to the park. But the neighborhood is dirty and untidy. The equipment and decoration of the apartment are not kind of high quality. For example, the sheets in bed are not cotton and look old. The towels look old too. But it has everything you need to cope with."

5762866,32522512,2015-05-19,30583569,John,Heather was very accommodating and helpful. My wife and I really enjoyed meeting her.
This was our first Airbnb stay so we felt a little uncomfortable. However,Heather made us feel very welcome. She left an information sheet for us with info about the apartment,store locations,transit access,and restaurant recommendations. Her restaurant recommendations were excellent. She even checked in (via text) part way through our stay to make sure everything was well and we were able to use her futon (used as an extra double bed).,
The apartment is on the third floor accessed via stairs only. It is obvious that Heather has done a lot to make the apartment homey and comfortable. It is airy with large ceiling fans and functioning windows. Heather has pets,which went with her for our stay. We were very comfortable there.,,,,
The apartment is located in a young/college neighborhood with easy access to transit,the airport,local universities,and good restaurants.,,
We both enjoyed our stay,would stay there again,and would gladly recommend Heather's place to friends.,,,

5762866,37184795,2015-07-05,6721395,Gabe,Heather was very friendly as she  greeted us with the keys and was flexible with our arrival time. The apartment was in a great location and had everything we needed to enjoy the holiday weekend. I would definitely recommend!
5762866,38040735,2015-07-12,27868015,Kierney,Heather made me feel very comfortable while staying at her apartment. The apartment was very clean and welcoming. The pictures on the site are very accurate. I also loved the convenience of the on-street parking right outside the place. I would definitely recommend this place!
5762866,51144830,2015-10-18,22644520,Esther,"Heather was very communicative and helped us find the place easily. Everything was in working order and the location was very close to where we needed to be. She was very flexible with arrival and departure times, which was helpful for us as we didn't know exactly when we were getting in or leaving besides the general time of day."
The building is quite old and not in great shape,which we didn't quite see in the photos/reviews. Also,the few blocks around the place are quite varied in terms of how comfortable you feel walking by yourself at night. If you want to do laundry,you will need $3.50 in quarters and detergent. The building was very quiet - we didn't see any other residents - but the street was a little noisy at night. With earplugs it was fine!,,
All in all,if you are looking for a comfy,clean bed,hot shower,good coffee,"and great location with free and easy parking - it is hard to beat Heather's place for the price!\""

"Jim Macha\"",,,,,
5308475,32123851,2015-05-14,3382463,Don,"A re-purposed industrial space, Brian's place was a great jumping off point for exploring the awesome city of Boston.  Close to public transportation, relatively cheap cab ride to historic areas, right across the bridge from Cambridge, and about 50ft from Fenway park."
Either Brian,or his roommate,Dan,were in the apartment at all times so we always had someone around to ask questions,etc.  It was a little odd though,to not have our own key
The place is really a bachelor guys pad,so older couples and picky 'girl-types' may not find it as comfortable as we did; we are two 50-something guys who had to attend a conference at a nearby hotel,and like going out,eating and checking out the neighborhoods.,,
The sleeping room is kind of small,with 2 twin beds that are on the short-ish side for tall guys,but for the one night we stayed there were fine.,,,
I wouldn't mind staying again with one of my sports fan friends to catch a game at Fenway and party,"but I'm pretty sure my wife wouldn't like it as much as I.\"",,,,

We were in town to see the Red Sox and I can't think of a better spot to stay for that purpose, as all we had to do to get to Fenway was cross the street.  I would definitely stay here again!"
5308475,38467121,2015-07-15,7738161,X,"It is a really nice place and very convinient to most attractions. Brian and Don are very nice and friendly. BTW, it seems Brian is a big sports fan. You can see all kinds of sports equipments in storage place, haha."
5308475,74148148,2016-05-13,53090286,Susan,Brian and Dan were very nice. They were great giving us tips on where to park and fun places to go before a Red Sox game. I actually fell and fractured my elbow after the game and when I got home Brian got me some ice and hopefully didn't mind my crying too much I was in a lot of pain! Despite the unfortunate injury we had a great time in Boston. If you will be attending a game the location could not be any better!
5308475,76410543,2016-05-27,67992998,Ron,"Definitely one of the highlights of our trip. In town for Fenway, and you can't get any closer. Brian and Dan were both awesome, very welcoming and helpful. Slept great, very comfortable."

The space looks exactly as advertised and provided everything I needed for a pleasant stay. The place is quiet and very clean. Brian even invited me for some drinks in the nearby area, which I enjoyed very much."

13015832,77181138,2016-05-30,35561463,Amber,"I had originally reserved a hotel room for a couple of nights during Memorial Day weekend, but when I found this Airbnb listing for a 2-bedroom in Back Bay, I jumped on it. I sent in a request for the apartment and received confirmation of my reservation."
Not even 5 minutes after receiving the confirmation (and having the money taken out of my bank account),I received a direct message from Beantown Suites saying they actually only had a 1-bedroom for the first night and could move me to a 2-bedroom the second night. I quickly responded telling them that would not work and that I needed what I paid for,a 2-bedroom for both nights. To this day,I still don't understand how they could accept a reservation for one thing and think that it would be okay to switch it as soon as they accepted. Being that the reservation money is instantly withdrawn from the guest's bank account,that method of accepting reservations is an issue.,
I then received a response saying they had another 2-bedroom available at a different location. At that point I was so annoyed and over the situation that I was willing to be at a different location,but obviously wanted to see pictures of what I was paying for before accepting. No one responded to my request so I ended up calling them directly on the phone. I spoke with a rep who was very understanding of the situation and helpful. He verbally confirmed me for a 2-bedroom,emailed me a check-in instruction document and assured me everything was set in stone.,,,
Fast forward to the next day,I received another direct message from whoever was running their Airbnb account saying I was confirmed for a 2-bedroom.. at a totally different location than what I was confirmed for just the night before with the rep. I proceeded to call him AGAIN to clear up what was going on. After some phone tag,he was able to reassure me of my confirmation.,,,
Although I am thankful to the rep for straightening things out and was ultimately somewhat satisfied with the apartment I ended up staying in,the reservation/confirmation process was unacceptable. I feel like the company used a bait-and-switch method to acquire my reservation without even having the actual accommodations available that I paid for. What if they hadn't had any 2-bedrooms at all the first night? Would I have had to settle with a 1-bedroom? It was too late to try looking for affordable hotel rooms and the funds were already out of my account.,,,,
"The booking process alone will definitely make me think twice about booking an Airbnb with the company in the future. Hopefully others will have a more seamless experience. \"",,,,,

Great view. Quick ride to the convention center. Cute apartment. Friendly host. Amenities were as described. Water bottles provided.,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
- Towels were thin and smelled of mildew (though host was kind to provide 2 and wash them multiple times during my 5 night stay.),,,,,
- Mattress topper on the sofa bed was soft,cushy memory foam,but it was only a couple inches thick and the actual sofa bed springs sunk in and gave me poor sleep and back pain. (I have slept on old motel mattresses more comfortable.),,,
- Relocated to the patio for over an hour on two separate nights to give the host privacy with her boyfriend,which I did not expect considering she requested I give 30 minute notice before I arrived at the apartment each day (which I did). I found this disrespectful and uncomfortable.,,,,
This was my first Airbnb experience. Overall,I do not think I will stay on an Airbnb couch again,"and will opt for a private location or hotel room next time.\"",,,

We absolutely loved being able to sleep with the glass door to the deck open and just keep the screen door closed so that we could enjoy the fresh cool ocean breeze coming in on us at night.  That was so nice.
Her place is very clean and she gives you complete privacy if that is what you desire.

Her place was clean and conveniently located plenty of eateries and convenience stores. Also, that was probably one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. She was beyond accommodating and I could not recommend her enough. Thanks for such a pleasant time!"

Her apartment was nice & clean. Her apartment is a 3 min walk from the beach & a great little bar the Seapoint. The bus stop is a block away while the train is a 16 min walk.

It took around 15 minutes to Uber to downtown. I had no chance to check the beach or restaurant nearby. Hope I could do that next time.,,,,,
The only pity was that at the last night there was a big fight downstairs. A couple fought with each other with dramatic words. We both woke up startled and my friend had difficulty in getting back sleep again.,,,,,

There is also a CVS and Starbucks in very close walking distance. Because of timing issues I was not able to meet Lushan in person. All of our correspondence was over the phone and text.

Bob personally walked us to the studio, showed us the Transit and gave us some tips about the area.  He installed a new microwave during our visit as it did not have one.  Studio has TV, nice sized bathroom and kitchen and a regular sized refrigerator, which was extremely helpful.  There is plenty of room for two and has all of the comforts of home.  We would definitely stay again!  My first airbnb stay was a success!"

quiet,comfortable and well-located,discreetly off one of Boston’s major,,,
streets. The greater downtown Boston areas are well within a 10-15 minute drive and Metro west suburban areas within 10 minutes. The option also existed to shortly walk (5 minutes) to the train. This was my first experience with an Airbnb and it was a wonderful and beyond my expectations as far as simplicity and convenience. It's always a added bonus to be able to cook at your leisure while you are away from home. Everything from the communication with the host,to the room itself - no complaints. The owner seamlessly accommodated even an earlier arrival. I would highly recommend if you seek to stay in Boston with more of a intimate,,,,
experience then choosing this location would be optimal.,,,,,

The apt itself was a little small for our 1.5 month stay,but would be a good spot for a weekend get away. It is nicely renovated and clean. During the summer months the apt can get unbearably hot,so installation of an air con would be a plus! Although we never met Lushan,her property manager was available to arrange a smooth check in and check out. The internet connection was spotty,but when the service actually stopped,"Lushan quickly fixed the problem from abroad. \""

I wish I could start my review of this apartment with such warm words, but unfortunately it was quite the opposite of “amazing”. For starters, I’ve never ever stayed at a place that dirty!!! It was extremely gross. When I arrived, Sa wasn’t present since he was travelling. My room illustrated this quite well by being completely entrenched with dust – big time! I found some really nasty dust bunnies all over the room, in, on, and around the radiator and scattered around the bed. I truly wonder if the floors of the apartment have ever seen a mop or a broom. Ever. As in the beginning of time to now. I don’t think so. However, that was not even the worst part. I could barely bring myself to take off my socks during my first bathroom experience. There is a bathroom mat that has never seen the inside of a washing machine and has probably been there since the first tenant moved in. Do not go near that thing! I’m not really fussy when it comes to cleaning, but this place was just too much. Everything was dirty and dusty and the kitchen was extremely sticky on top of that. No matter what you touch, it will always be sticky. Absolutely disgusting. On my first day I didn’t even want to use a glass, because it was sticky as well. The fridge is covered with splashes of fat and of I have no idea what else exactly…I really don’t want to go into more detail at this point. As I said, Sa was travelling when I came to Boston, he returned at the end of my 1st month. When he came back he was planning to stay at the apartment as well and wanted to sleep on the couch (it’s a really really small apartment). From talking to his current tenant, I learned that this is what he always does. But he doesn’t mention this fact in his description of the apartment. His tenant spoke with him about this and he was responsive at first. But then he came back and it was really just a very awkward situation. He came to the apartment during the day to cook on an almost daily basis. I can tell because whenever I came back home it was extremely difficult to breathe in the apartment. The air was extremely pungent. The ingredients he used when cooking smelled absolutely disgusting and instead of using ventilation to get rid of the smell, he lit Christmas-themed scented candles, which only added to the apartment’s natural musk. The amount of money I had to pay for one month’s rent was twice the amount the room actually costs per month, and it is not even close to the value should be. I understand that I was only here for two months, and Boston is expensive, but I learned of..."

The communication prior to arrival was fast and easy and Sa welcomed me upon arrival and quickly dug out some extra sheets that I had asked for. The room itself was clean and nice—absolutely no complaints, although 'stunning' might be a little exaggerated. However the cleanliness of the kitchen and bathroom were a bit more on the questionable side. I talked to Sa about this and he told me that he will look into it, so things are likely to improve.

I could go on and on about all the amenities she provided, but I'll just leave the best one: Since I was arriving late she offered to pick up dinner from a local restaurant!"
She is an extremely pleasant and attentive host and it was a pleasure chatting with her.,,,,,
The room has its own A/C,a very comfortable queen bed (I think) and a great east coast exposed brick wall :),,,,
The living room area is comfortable,bright,and includes a docking station with keyboard and monitor in case you need to hook up your laptop.,,,
The neighborhood is historical Boston and was a great pleasure just to stroll around,including the nearby Boston Commons park.,,,,
This was my first experience with Airbnb and I don't think I can go back to regular old hotels.  I look forward to staying with Olja each time I visit Boston.,,,,,

The neighborhood is beautiful: red brick brownstones and leafy trees. The apartment is plenty roomy and the outdoor patio space is perfect for coffee, dinner or just reading. The giant soaking bathtub is also a plus :) Thanks, Ann and Phil!"

Internet worked very well, I didn't use the kitchen because of all the restaurants and bars arround the corner at Newbury street. Will definitely book again next time!!"

Didn't have a key that worked for my door right away but the very next day she had a new door handle and lock installed.  Neighborhood is great, backs up into a Boston Playground with a quarter mile track and exercise equipment.  Very convenient to get downtown and to Cambridge via T line bus and trains."
Private room in a 5 bedroom house,large shared space and kitchen space; really can't beat it.  Room itself has a decent sized walk-in closet,bed,desk,and dresser.,
Eunice is very accommodating,I had to go out of town for work for two 5 day stints during my stay,and on the second trip I wouldn't be back in town until after my Airbnb reservation was up.  But Eunice let me store two large pieces of luggage in her own storage closet,"truly going above and beyond her role as host.  I would recommend this Airbnb to anybody in town for a weekend to see the sites or an extended period of time for school or work. Certainly would come here again if I ever needed a spot to stay in Boston again.\"",,

There is a full kitchen with everything you could need. The bedrooms have separate bathrooms which makes it ideal for multiple couples. The apartment is only 2 blocks away from a commuter rail station and there is plenty of parking on the street. Irida herself is charming, but also wonderfully efficient. She was very quick to respond to our communication and she was more than patient when we arrived an hour late (Boston traffic!). She is knowledgeable about restaurants and shops in the area."
All in all,"this apartment and host come with my highest recommendation. You could not ask for a better Airbnb experience. \"",,,,

The house was lovely, clean and comfortable even though we were out all day. It was great to have a home like here. Perhaps it can be advertised as a 2 full bedroom with a den/futon. In all it was great. Thank you and see you again."

6300089,46549854,2015-09-11,40454016,Kuzhou,It is quit a pleasure to meet Irida and to stay in her house for a couple days.
Three individual bedrooms with all Queen beds as well as almost everything you can imagine,including dishwasher,laundry,dryer,cooking necessities etc. Way more space than enough for a group of 6 ( 2 bathroom,a large TV lounge and a comfortable dinning room). But I DO NOT think it's expensive for 3 or more guests with all these above.
Plus,Irida prepared a list of detailed information of neighborhood like shopping,transportation and restaurants. Simply read the list and you never go wrong.,,,

I agree with one of the last reviews the pictures do not do this place justice.  WONDERFUL stay.  Everything you could want!  Comfortable beds, very clean and welcoming.  Easy street parking and about a 25 minutes drive to everything you would like to see in Boston Proper."

I have been in many AirBnb houses or flats. Most of them look good,but furnished with stuff which quality is...just ok. However,this spot was amazingly tasteful. Pictures are good,but I think in real life it looks much better.,,

Irida was quick and professional in her email communication and instructions in the apartment about the heat, AC, and stove.  I was there only one overnight and didn't have the chance to meet her.  My parents stayed there for three nights and said that Irida would give them a friendly waive during their coming and going.

His place is very up-to-date and well-maintained, and Mohsen is a gracious and easy-going host.

The entire experience was fantastic, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend both Mohsen as a host and this as a place to stay. The free Silver Line shuttle will get you from the airport to South Station, where you can transfer (again, for free) over to the Red Line. Dorchester is just a few stops away, and Mohsen's place is a hop, skip, and a jump from the subway platform. Speaking of, you can cut through the station to get to the large, well-stocked grocery store on just the other side. There's also a Zipcar lot right as you exit the station."
Anyway,I arrived in Boston on a day when Mohsen wasn't going to be around,but he was kind enough to leave the in a lockbox hanging from the door. His condo is clean,modern,and welcoming,with plenty of natural light. I immediately felt at home. The room I rented was spacious and well-furnished (thank you for providing a desk)

On the positive,the place was clean,bed was comfortable and the general location handy to many areas.  Parking my rental car was easy,as described in the listing.,,
On the negative side,"the listing was misleading by omission.  The listing referred to the kitchen and living room on the \"\"first floor\"\"","with bedrooms on the \"\"second floor\"\".  However",the unit involved a 9 or 10 step walk-up to the font door,then once in the front door,a steep
Further,the lock-box with the key was not in place when we arrived as arranged.,,,,
"It was described as a \"\"luxury condo\"\"... not exactly.  Nice - yes!  But not \"\"luxury\"\".  Luxury would include air conditioning!  The unit was really hot",and with the windows opened,I got to listen to the trains passing,only about 50 metres away.  Also. it was next to I-93 with all-night traffic noise.  The alternative? - close the windows and sweat all night.,,

The room and bathroom we used was very clean and inviting.  The bed was comfortable and Mary and I had a good, sound sleep.  The rest of the apartment was also very clean and well organized."
The only issue is that you have to keep the window closed because of house’s proximity to the rail line.  It can get a bit noisy.  If you keep the window closed,it should not be a problem.,,,,

He was also very flexible in arranging the check out. I liked my room. It just like it's shown in the picture. The walk in closet/storage room is really handy and there are plenty of hangers. The entire 3 floor unit is also nice and clean. The best thing I liked was how close it's to the JFK/umass red-line T (subway) station. Usually around 5-10 min for the wait, 10-15min to downtown once on the train. Really convenient even late in the evening. This residential neighbourhood feels quite safe, especially where the house is, since it's so close to the red-line T-station (you can barely hear the train/highway through the double-glazed windows). There seems to be a vietnamese community nearby, and there's a really authentic Banh mi hole in the wall 10 min on foot if you're into that. So great location for the price, Mohsen is so nice, pictures and comments are accurate. Good place to stay."
4793787,43874916,2015-08-22,9912990,Tyesha,"The room is very spacious and well represented in the pictures. It was a close walk to the red line Jfk/UMass station and made it very easy to get to South station to catch an early bus. This place is perfect for an overnight stay, clean and very comfortable bed. I would definitely stay here again. My only complaint was that when I arrived in the afternoon the owner was doing some work on the roof and it was very noisey when I was trying to take a nap after a long bus ride."
4793787,44454573,2015-08-26,3744067,Christian,Mohsen was a great host. We had a beautiful time in Boston. The house and room is very spacious and clean. We felt like visiting a friend. Our best accomodation experience in the US!!
4793787,45969131,2015-09-07,13792573,Jessie,"Minimal contact but Mohsen gave really helpful instructions about how to get into the house, and etc. He also helped me to find things I left in the apartment."
4793787,46489330,2015-09-11,2873708,Klaus,"Mohsen takes his AirBnb hosting fairly seriously. The house is very clean, the bedroom is very nice, the mattress is firm and not some worn out retired one. Mohsen communicated very well with me prior and during my stay."
I went to a convention on Boston and this place is fairly close to the convention center. I went to the bus/train station close to his house,rented a bike and simply rode it to the convention center. Easy.,,,,
Rochester is not in the middle of the city of Boston but the trip to downtown on one of those rental bikes takes 15-20 minutes. Of course you can also take the subway. It is right there.,,,,,
The house is close to a freeway and the railroad tracks but they didn't bother me at all. I slept perfectly well.,,,,,
You'll share the main bathroom with the host but again: Mohsen keeps everything very clean and that won't be a problem for you at all.,,,,,
"I highly recommend Mohsen's home for anyone that doesn't absolutely need to be in downtown.\"",,,,,
4793787,46653308,2015-09-12,10635180,Mark,"I stayed at Mohsen's one night this week.  We never met but he was very accommodating nonetheless. The apartment is two minutes from the T (red line), very convenient."
4793787,47365915,2015-09-18,693207,Luke,Great room in a very clean and welcoming condo.  Easy access to JFK/UMASS station. Good communication from Mohsen before during and after the stay. This is what makes ABNB so good.
4793787,47996111,2015-09-22,10086492,Natasha,I had a great weekend at Mohsen's apartment. I was in Boston for business and found the place conveniently located close to the T. Only a couple of stops from the free Silver Line airport shuttle. The apartment is very clean and well decorated. The queen bed and bedding provided was very comfortable. I would highly recommend Mohsen's apartment.
4793787,48320557,2015-09-25,43454611,Jessie,"Mohsen was a wonderful host. I had a great time stay here. The room is clean, comfortable and just as pictured. The house is nice and close by the subway."

For future stayers, when you get off the train, go up the stairs that are marked \"\"Sydney St.\"\" You'll get to the place much faster. Mohsen was great and was there if you needed him. I would definitely stay with him again."
The train was a bit loud at times,"but I enjoyed hearing the city noises. \"",,,,
4793787,50154680,2015-10-09,43771269,Deng,The listing description is accurate. Place is nice clean and very comfortable for short term stay. Better than hotel.
4793787,50766209,2015-10-14,6138288,Jesse,"Staying at Mohsen's was a great experience! The house is very modern and clean, the bed comfortable. Mohsen was a great host, checking in when we crossed paths (and making sure I felt free to ask him for anything), but otherwise completely unobtrusive. Very friendly and warm. The location right by the Red Line made it extremely easy to get into Downtown and even across the river to Cambridge."
4793787,50960167,2015-10-16,37777300,Joel,"The stay was great.  The place is modern, clean and comfortable.  Mohsen was easily reachable and the communication was great.  The proximity to the JFK/UMASS stop on the T made it very convenient to get into Boston and Cambridge.  I would recommend to anyone looking for an authentic taste of Boston at a reasonable price."
4793787,51287941,2015-10-19,7382510,Cathy,"My husband and I stayed with Mohsen from Oct 15-18/15 while visiting Boston for the weekend.  The location is absolutely fantastic!  We drove down to Boston from the Toronto area, so were very happy to be able to safely park our car right out front of the condo and then take transit everywhere we went.  The subway is a short block away, and the neighbourhood is safe for walking around with several restaurants and fast food places in walking distance as well.  Mohsen is a great host and made us feel very welcomed from the get go.  We were invited to use the entire house including kitchen and living areas, so didn't feel secluded to a room.  The house is very modern, clean and was ready for our arrival.  The room is large with a dresser and walk in closet so lots of room for luggage and to move around.  Check in was very simple and Mohsen was home when we arrived and came down to greet us and help us up with our bags.  Directions were sent ahead of time as well in case he wasn't there when we arrived, so we would have be fine either way.  Mohsen was able to answer all of our questions and made suggestions to help us in getting around the city.  He was easily accessible and available throughout our stay if things came up.    Definitely better than staying at a hotel!  Without hesitation I would recommend Mohsen's place, and would definitely stay again when visiting the Boston area."
4793787,51569925,2015-10-21,45045546,Matt,"It's a great experience staying at Mohsen's house. The room is very clean and comfortable, and also the whole house. I spent 2 nights here and had a very good sleep. It's also very close to the JFK/UMass station of the red line, about 5 minutes walk after getting off the train. Mohsen is very nice and welcoming, we had a good talk. I enjoyed this stay and made my trip to Boston so wonderful."
4793787,51654344,2015-10-22,5637234,Jay,Mohsen was an excellent host. He is super friendly and a great conversationalist. He makes you feel comfortable and right at home in his place. I had a bunch of work to finish up but I found myself wanting to stay downstairs and keep chatting with him. Really awesome guy.
His apartment was exactly how it looked in the pictures and description. It's situated in a safe neighborhood about 15 minutes away from downtown Boston. It was clean,well-decorated,spacious and felt very cozy.,,,
Communication was near instantaneous. Right when I arrived,I had a question about parking and Mohsen wasn't home. But he literally responded to my text in less than a minute.,,,,
"I highly recommend this apartment and I'll definitely be back in the future. A ++++++ space and host.\"",,,,,
4793787,51801899,2015-10-24,26959888,Sue,Mohsen was a perfect host. Loved the townhouse and location for getting around Boston. Wish we'd had more time in Boston. We'd love to come back and stay with Mohsen longer
4793787,52577360,2015-10-31,22277911,Ahmed,"Mohsen is a great host. He made me feel very welcome in his place, we had interesting conversations every time we met, and my stay was very pleasant."
The house was clean and very close the the train station which was just what I needed for the week that I was staying there.,,,,,
"Definitely looking him up again if I am going to Boston.\"",,,,,
4793787,52985809,2015-11-03,45607740,Patrick,I had high expectations for Mohsen when I saw the super host badge. And he was a terrific host! He was welcoming and very accommodating. The place was clean and tidy when we arrived. I liked the privacy. I never felt like he was checking on us and I never felt like a intruder in his home. I would stay here again anytime.
4793787,53611156,2015-11-10,44855895,Andy,"This is my first stay with Airbnb and I am so happy to stay in Mohsen's home. This is a nice townhouse and my room is on the 3rd floor. The bedroom and other parts of the house are exactly as posted online. The room is neat, clean and bright."
Mohsen is a great guy. He was working while I arrived but he has clear instruction on how to get the key and open the door,pretty straightforward. During my stay we only got short chat but I can tell he is nice,humorous,hospitable and considerate. The neighbor is generally quite and safe. The house is very close to JFK/UMass redline,grocery and a bay park.,
"Quite satisfied about this stay and I strongly recommend Mohsen's home if you plan to travel to Boston.    \"",,,,,
4793787,54377152,2015-11-19,44886113,Ray,"The home is wonderful and very very close to the subway in to town, or anywhere else. The pictures and description are very accurate and was no surprises. I would stay there again with no hesitation."

4793787,54912803,2015-11-25,48437348,Zenita,Mohsen was great at connecting with us beforehand. Very clear about how to get in and the room was as advertised. Unfortunately due to an unexpected power issue we could not access the internet during our stay. However everything else was up and running. Mohsen's place is very close to the subway and it's a short ride downtown.
4793787,55723414,2015-12-05,34020844,Navid,He is a welcoming host. Everything was great. I was there almost one week and nothing disturbing happened. The location is also good it helps you to reach public transportation fast.
4793787,56216725,2015-12-10,47669025,Elkin,"Una casa muy bonita y con una habitación que cumplió con las expectativas, muy buena ubicación por su cercanía al subway. Muy limpias las instalaciones. Mohsen siempre fue muy atento y estuvo pendiente a nosotros. Muy recomendado."
4793787,56620582,2015-12-15,1448001,Alexandra,I had a nice stay at Mohsen's place when I was in town for some interviews. Everything is just as described. The bed is really comfortable- I miss it now that I'm back to my own bed! Its also extremely convenient to the Umass/JFK T station so its easy to get downtown. You will hear the subway sometimes but i didn't find it annoying. If I'm back in Boston I'd definitely stay here again.
4793787,57396869,2015-12-25,9234405,Ricardo,"In spent at Mohsen's place a few days just before Christmas 2015. I enjoyed my stay very much. Mohsen is a very good host, and despite our paths crossed just for few minutes every day (since I spent almost all day doing tourism) he made feel welcome and comfortable since day 1. The room's description is very accurate, and the pictures show exactly how it is, the bed is very comfortable, and the central heating is good for Boston's chilly weather. I took a walk in the neighborhood and I think it's nice and safe even at night, but of course, like in any big metropolis, you need to be cautious. What I enjoyed the most is the strategic location very close to the train station and from there it's just few minutes until downtown Boston where most touristic activities take place. To sum up, it's a very good place with a nice host, at a very affordable price, with a very good location. I will definitely recommend Mohsen's place to my friends, and whenever I'll be back in Boston I will try to book it again."

4793787,66222686,2016-03-20,59544767,Nebula,"The experience of living in Mohsen's house was great excludes the last day I stayed there. The painters came in the early morning and cause smelling terrible atmosphere. Even my cloths in the dryer got the paint smelling, which is awful. Otherwise, the location of the house was great, it is less than five minutes walk to JFK UMass red line station."
4793787,67545277,2016-03-30,44425570,Grace,Mohsen's condo was very accurately listed. The space was great and I felt right at home. The condo was very close to the train station and allowed me to easily travel around Boston as I needed. It was very easy to follow his instructions to the correct location.

The room is amazingly comfortable, with enough space and everything you'll ever need, down to every little detail, desk, power outlets, satellite TV, walking closet, big mirror, extra heat and the bed will give you the best rest you could possible ask for.  Mohsen is an excellent host, very friendly, helpful, responsive, will respect your privacy and will go out of his way to make sure you have everything you need. The place has a great location, less than a 5 minutes walk from the subway station, in total it doesn't take more than a 15 minutes to get to Boston downtown, but you can quickly connect from Mohsen place to anywhere you'd like to go in the Boston greater area. For me it was a great experience!"

Mohsen has a lovely home that is so conveniently located right across the street from the \"\"T\"\" station and a grocery store. It's in a very quiet and peaceful neighborhood with an amazing local breakfast joint just a short walk away. As for the room-- The bed was more comfortable and the shower had better water pressure than our apartment"
4793787,71522151,2016-04-25,48620593,Alli,"This was my first AirBnB experience, so I wasn't really sure what to expect, but from the get go Mohsen's friendly demeanor quelled any worries I had. The apartment is less than a 5min walk from the JFK/UMass T station, which is only ~20min from South Station, if that. Mohsen's apt. is gorgeous, clean, and the room was lovely - a big comfortable bed, a lot of light, and a large dresser if you need it. Mohsen provided everything we could possibly need - towels, a large power strip, and tons of maps/brochures of things to do around Boston. I had a few questions about little things and when I messaged Mohsen to ask, he got back to me immediately! Very considerate and accommodating, whenever Mohsen was around he was always all smiles and checking-up to see if we needed anything. A gorgeous place with a wonderful host, I definitely recommend this room."

The neighborhood was safe and quite for the most part and conveniently close to the T train and breakfast spots. If you're looking for a great diner nearby try Victoria's! And Mohsen was very helpful with travel advice. I'll definitely recommend this for a single traveler that wants their own privacy and is on a budget. Would stay here again on my next trip to Boston.

The location is literally right next to the JFK Redline which made it incredibly easy to get all over Boston (suggest getting a Charlie card 7 day pass if your in town that long way cheaper than buying a ticket each ride) Check in and out was very easy...literally a lock box that the key is located in. Room was beautiful and immaculately clean in fact the whole house was extremely clean! Host was very sweet and respectful and helpful with any questions I had about the city. Very quiet house and neighborhood. Even the locals in Boston will tell you Sydney St is a  quote on quote \"\"good\"\" area/street.

The building itself was very new and in a central location which made sightseeing/moving around fairly easy. The apartment was as pictured, if not larger, everything was working properly and was clean.  Check out was also very quick, while the people working in the reception were all very helpful and accommodating.

Great location in Chinatown close to bars/shops, within walking distance of transit.  Only gripes (which were really small in the grand scheme of things) was that the carpet/floors were a little dirty when we got there (just dirt) and no directions were provided for parking (it was slightly confusing to know where to go/what to do)."

The room has wifi, and a blow-dryer (for interested ladies) and he also offers towels for guests. This was our first AirB&B experience and I could tell my husband was nervous about the idea of staying in someone's home, but his worries went away upon meeting Howard and seeing the room.

We were literally on the Freedom Trail.  You can't get better than that if you are visiting Boston.    Howard was a fantastic host.  He went above and beyond for us - lending us a blanket, printing our boarding passes, and giving us great suggestions as to where the locals eat.  The room itself was neat and clean with our own bathroom and many of the amenities you usually have to pack were right there at our fingertips.  THANKS Howard."

It's in a very good location, just off Hanover St. which is busy with lots of restaurants and cafés and is a very pretty street and is still close to the center of Boston. The room was very well equipped (incl. a massage chair which was a huge plus after 9 hours spent flying, as was the private bathroom) and impeccably clean. We also really liked the cool design of the room. It was a buit dark in the morning but there was a lamp with  a built-in radio and alarm to wake us up in time:-)"

The room was impeccably clean and well-appointed, and Howard went out of his way to make sure that we had everything for our stay; he even gave us an umbrella after noticing we forgot ours. Additionally, Howard was very flexible with our check in/out times, allowing us to get the most out of our trip. Finally, Howard was helpful without being overly involved- he gave us all the privacy we could ask for but was always just a phone call or text message away if we needed him. Hopefully, we'll get a chance to stay here again!"
220676,1207060,2012-05-01,1603698,Jórunn,"Me and my husband had a great stay at Howard's house last April. He was very nice and helpful. Both the room and the bathroom were very clean and the bed was really comfortable. For some it might be an issue that the bathroom is in the hall but for us it was not a problem, we felt we were totally alone in the house as Howard lives on another floor. The room is not big but for us it was not a problem, we just used it for sleeping. A tv would have been nice to have but we knew on forehand that there was none so we can't actually complain about that ;)"

Howard's place was very well located, he was very welcoming, patient and gave great information. Everything was very clean and exactly like the pictures on the profile, very reliable. The North End of Boston is an experience in itself, and his place is right in the middle of it, helped me discover a part of town I didn't know. Howard made me feel welcome and gave me privacy at the same time, I would stay with him again in a heartbeat. Also, great shower!"

He was accessible when we needed him and friendly. The neighborhood was very safe and quiet! If you love pastries at all hours of the day and night, there is one just a couple blocks away. If you don't mind walking (since you are in Boston) the T line is about a 5-10 minute walk. The bed is very firm, but the room is clean and the bathroom is just across the way and we had it all to ourselves. We will definitely stay here again the next time we come to Boston!"

Our flight didn't get in until 12:45am, but Howard insisted on greeting us in-front of his building when we finally arrived around 1:30.  At this time he proceeded to help us with our bags, showed us our room, went over the city maps with us and pointed out some of his favorite things to do, and made suggestions for us based on what we like.  My wife and I are vegetarians, and while Howard is not, he took the time to seek out and share some local fare that we could eat... We tried a few of them, and they were all fantastic!

Easy 24 hour access, excellent WiFi, interesting and convenient location that was nevertheless quiet at night. Howard was friendly and responsive, met me as agreed at a check-in time of my convenience, then didn't see him again .. until he thoughtfully texted me about something I had accidentally left behind on checkout. Would certainly recommend."

He gave us his best tips concerning which place to see first,good restaurants and how things work in Boston.,,,,
We could communicate easily before arriving and also during our stay.,,,,,
It well located and we could visit all Boston walking.,,,,,
Another very good thing was that the door lock works with a code which Howard kindly set in a way that we can not forget it.,,,,,
I highly recommend the place,as it was clean,a lot of privacy,cool bathroom and even a tray with a kettle,coffe,mugs to be able to take a rapid breakfast in the morning.

La chambre et la salle de bain n'étaient pas spécialement propres (malgré le fait qu'il y ait un montant pourvu à cet effet).,,,,,

The room was very nice,very clean and the bed very comfortable. You have your own privacy and we had the bathroom only for ourselves. The location is very good,nearby are a lot of Italian restaurants. Walking in Boston is very easy,and this place is in the heart of Boston.,,

The room and bathroom were very clean and the bed was firm and very comfortable. Howard is a great host. We were only able to meet him once in person but he was very easy to get in touch with via text. I will not hesitate to recommend staying here to any friends or family that plan on visiting Boston.

Howard was an extremely generous host and provided lots of little things that really helped - umbrella, hair dryer, maps, water and so on.

Would recommend for anyone wanting to indulge in Italian cuisine, comedy, history and visiting Boston in general. It's just a 9minute walk from the Boston transit at Haymarket; which is good because parking is next to impossible to find. The room was clean, massage chair is even better in real life and Howard is a great host."

Howard was very nice and gave us plenty of great recommendations. He was quick to respond and his place was very clean! Whatever toiletries we had forgotten, he already has. He checked up on us on the first day, the day after the first and the last day. Can't wait to stay at his place again whenever we visit Boston again."

I will recommend this place to anyone looking for a great place in Boston's North End."
220676,8324246,2013-10-26,6145866,Fabian,"\"Howard es un anfitrión excelente, atento y amable. Muy discreto, solo aparece cuando se lo necesita. La habitación es perfecta para lo que se espera de una breve visita a Boston. Si hubiese tenido que pasar una semana completa, seguramente me habría resultado chica, pero para dos noches fue más que adecuada. El lugar es limpio, bonito y tiene una ubicación excelente ya que la calle está a media cuadra la avenida principal de Little Italy y aún así, es un sitio muy tranquilo y seguro. Las comodidades incluyen una Netbook con WiFi, algo que es sumamente cómodo y realmente nos ayudó mucho. El sillón masajeador es una verdadera \"\"atracción turística\"\". No se lo pierdan. Resumen: si  viajas sola/o o en pareja (con mucha armonía porque el sitio es pequeño)"

The room has a lot of privacy. It was very clean and comfortable - it even comes with a massage chair. It's small but has all you need. The bathroom was separate but we had it to ourselves (I loved that it had a heater for cold mornings). Howard was a friendly and helpful host. We loved the location. Close to a lot of nice restaurants (the neptune's lobster rolls are to die for!) and pastries, yum! It's a 5-10 minute walk to the T. It's easy to walk to town too.

We hooked up with him later, and he was very likable and always made sure we didn't have any problems.  He had the roll away all ready for us when we arrived, and both the bed and rollaway were very comfortable.  The room is very cute, bathroom has a good shower, and the building it's in is one of those beautiful old brick buildings with a cool entryway down a \"\"secret\"\" alley.  The location couldn't have been better - just a block from Hanover Street.  Howard's site information provides very helpful information on how to get in on the subway from the airport"
220676,20495876,2014-09-30,17436214,Ewan,"This was a comfortable room and the listing description was accurate. The best thing about the room is its location, in the middle of Boston's Italian district of North End (with lots of Italian restaurants nearby) and near the city centre and freedom trail. Despite being near busy Hanover Street, the apartment is very quiet even on a Saturday night. Howard was very welcoming and accommodating, including allowing us to leave our bags in the hall after we checked out."

So close to historic sights, public transportation and great dining!  The room was very comfortable, and we even had an extra bed in there for my son.  Howard was very friendly and had great advice about the area, but he also gave us plenty of space to come and go as we needed.  (We had a very busy schedule!)  He was also so understanding when our arrival was postponed by bad weather, and he let us leave our bags at his house after our check out time so we could continue sight seeing until our flight.

La ubicación es excelente, esta en North End en donde se encuentra una zona de restorantes y bares muy linda.... Súper accesible para recorrer toda la cuidad a pie. Por otro lado las comodidades del departamento también excelentes, ya que la habitación y el baño se encontraban en el primer piso junto a otra habitación pero nunca nos cruzamos con el huésped, por lo que era súper privado. El baño está equipado con todas las cosas que uno pueda necesitar (hasta afeitadora eléctrica). La habitación cuenta con un sillón masajeado, ideal luego de las caminatas diarias. Nos quedamos 3 noches y nos hubiese gustado quedarnos mas."

220676,47289214,2015-09-17,40817828,Sylvia,We totally enjoyed our rental from Howard.
220676,47628733,2015-09-21,33782735,Graham,A very pleasant stay in a great area of Boston.  Howard was very accommodating and flexible around some awkward arrival and departure times.
220676,48215853,2015-09-24,43443066,Bernard,"Howard nous a très bien reçu et conseillé pour la visite de Boston, les restaurants du North End. Le logement est propre, calme et bien situé pour parcourir le Freedom Trail."
220676,48715705,2015-09-28,40518299,Shabbir,"Howard stayed in touch with us as we landed and was at the entrance to welcome us, introduced to the area and what we could access. spent time discussing and answering our questions."
"we did have access to a refrigerator and he provided us with an electric kettle but could not provide microwave access \"",,,,,
220676,49343960,2015-10-03,42787710,Sharon,"My stay with Howard in his accommodations in the North End of Boston was wonderful. Howard was a generous host and the rooms (bedroom and bathroom) were comfortable and luxurious.   The photo does not do it justice. The bed and furnishings was very comfortable. The massage chair was a nice perk at the end of a long day. Howard also provided maps, umbrellas, robes, and great advice about near by restaurants.  The location could not be more perfect. It is blocks away from Faneuil Hall, the North End church, restaurants and museums. It was also private and quiet.  The neighborhood was charming and felt very safe.  All in all, I had a great time and hope for a return visit."
220676,49996516,2015-10-08,5028012,Susan,"Howard was there when we arrived, late on Saturday, and was available via text throughout our stay.  The room was exactly as pictured and very comfortable and quiet.  Our stay in the North End was just the vacation we hoped it would be."
220676,50476965,2015-10-12,43205024,Qiong,"The place is close to Old North Church at Boston. The neighborhood is also safe and convenient. The subway is only 10-minute walk. More importantly, Howard is very nice and considerate. The room and the bathroom are private. You can almost find everything you need, e.g., towel, shampoo, tourism booklets, sleeping coats ... He also keeps the place to be very quiet. We had a very good experience at his place."
220676,51434099,2015-10-20,36902023,Fleur,I was really happy with our choice to stay here. Howard's place was in a charming area and convenient to explore many of Boston's historic attractions on foot. There were also a host of restaurants and the best cannoli only 100 metres away.
"The available rooms were really pleasantly presented and Howard had a brochure rack with all the local Boston attractions which was very thoughtful. \"",,,,,
220676,51961697,2015-10-25,6327925,Marco,"Howard's room is in a perfect location in the North End of Boston, where all the action is taking place! It's in the middle of the Freedom Trail which is a great attraction and super close to all you may need for your stay. The room is clean and quite private and Howard checked in with me several times to make sure my stay was great. And it definitely was. He also had lots of great advice on what to see, where to eat, et cetera. Oh, and there is an awesome massage chair in the room which the best thing in the world after a day of walking around town and if you are visiting Boston, believe me, you will be doing lots of walking!"
220676,74538256,2016-05-15,62592075,Mary,"We had a wonderful weekend stay at Howard's Airbnb. The newly renovated bathroom was beautiful with excellent water pressure.  Everything is within walking distance including delicious restaurants, improv theater, and even a seven-eleven. Howard was the perfect host keeping in touch with us to make sure everything was to our liking. We highly recommend Howard's accommodations!"
220676,75573506,2016-05-22,70497377,Kate,"Our experience with Howard was great!  The room was clean and comfortable.  Howard was very nice and helpful without being overbearing.  The location is amazing, but it was also surprisingly quiet.  He even has a massaging chair in the room.  We would definitely recommend Howard and his bnb to others."
220676,78178102,2016-06-05,45664744,Ryan,"If you are visiting Boston, Howard's place is absolutely a great place to stay. The apartment is very comfortable and was recently renovated. It is quiet with lots of privacy, and the location is incredible: in the north end right on the freedom trail. Howard was a gracious and welcoming host. He talked with us for a while when we checked in about the neighborhood and Boston in general. We highly recommend!"
220676,80640403,2016-06-19,28797653,Therese,"The host, Howard was very welcoming upon our arrival.  He pointed out some near attractions and told us where the nearest T station was located. Our location was amazing.  We were near the Freedom Trail, the harbor and not far from the T.  And because we were in Little Italy we had some great options for food. The room was exactly as described.  We were very comfortable and I would recommend this AirBnb to my friends.  thank you Howard for a great stay in Boston"
220676,81288051,2016-06-22,76379469,Christopher,"Our stay in Boston with Howard was or first using AirBNB. We fulfilled a lifelong dream and Howard made it just perfect. His location is seriously the best, the place is clean and comfy and Howard is so accommodating you could almost go with nothin planned and he could help you have a good time. Howard is an A+ host and we will definitely be back to stay with him, as we actually ended up getting engaged on the trip!"
220676,81792187,2016-06-25,10486021,Luke,Howard was great. Proactively reached out to ensure our stay was comfortable.
220676,83196714,2016-07-01,24643404,Flaming,"這是我們第一次使用Airbnb,Howard給了我們非常棒的體驗,他的入住時間非常彈性,而且地點就離Haymarket地鐵站走路不到十分鐘的小義大利區,離鼎鼎大名的自由之路走路甚至不用兩分鐘,不只交通方便而且生活機能很好,便利商店和餐廳就在幾步之遙完全不用擔心餓著。另外,他十分細心地提供所有我們可能會使用到的備品,例如防曬乳、刮鬍刀,雨傘和筆電等等,所有我們沒想到的東西他都替我們想到了,如果下次還有機會再次到Boston旅遊我一定會再次選擇住在Howard家的!!!"
220676,86978580,2016-07-18,75488980,Nicholas,"Just stayed this past weekend with my girlfriend. We actually never met Howard but he provided great hospitality from start to finish by making everything easy for us. He checked in to see if we needed anything, and also let us know of fun things to do while we were there. The place was very clean and comfortable, and the location was excellent."
220676,87805739,2016-07-21,62766779,Jeff,"Talk about an awesome location.!! Right in the heart the North Ends Little Italy. Steps from all the best restaurants, coffee shops, bakeries and bars."
We only met Howard on our first day of five but he couldn't be more accommodating. Left us notes and texts if there was anything he could do to make our stay more comfortable.,,,,,
The room is pretty basic but very comfortable.,,,,,
"We would definitely stay again on our next visit.!!\"",,,,,
220676,90058973,2016-07-31,85210320,Matt,Had a nice stay with Howard. Couldn't ask for a better location or host.
220676,92375553,2016-08-08,14579431,Melissa,"Howard was an awesome host. He was so friendly, and made sure to make us feel welcome. We had a wonderful time in Boston, and would not hesitate to recommend Howard. Thank you so much for having us!"
220676,93398411,2016-08-12,3010439,Perri,"Awesome location, very private and quiet. Howard made check in and checkout sure easy and he was very helpful and knowledgable about the area. I'd definitely stay here again!"
12781774,75755243,2016-05-22,63051356,Guillaume,"Great host, very kind. Everything was exactly like it was announced. Great neighbourhood for a stay. It would be a great apartment for a longer stay, like a week or so."
12781774,79753284,2016-06-14,67961830,Jennifer,We thoroughly enjoyed our time in Jamaica Plain at Paul's place. Very quaint and comfortable.  We appreciated the extra touches like Sam Adams and cold prosecco in the fridge.  Great location - lots to see and do.
12781774,80966990,2016-06-20,41579236,Susanna,"Paul was an excellent host. Provided me with transportation options and greeted me at the door. The space is wonderful and very comfy. I also was very impressed with the additional amenities: snacks, drinks, and toiletries. Very thoughtful. The neighborhood is great! Tons of character and unique restaurants. Very easy access to the downtown Boston. I literally had corner to corner access to my conference."
12781774,89152383,2016-07-27,13007602,Henry,"What a great apartment! And what great hosts! This small, but very well laid out and beautifully equipped apartment was a total delight. Great use of the space, all needed amenities, well equipped kitchen, and very comfortable. Paul made sure we were OK, and had left supplies in the fridge like milk, cheese, crackers, beer, coffee, etc. He and his wife were available if we needed them, and though I had a bit of a concern about the shared staircase, it worked out great and they were totally unobtrusive at all times. The neighborhood is wonderful, with easy street parking, and lots of stores and restaurants. We would eagerly stay with them again next time we visit Jamaica Plain."
12781774,92537806,2016-08-09,73844063,Christine,"The studio apartment was great!  Paul provided snacks, beverages, and toiletries, as well as brochures and a binder detailing a large variety of activities in the area.  The flexible check in and check out were convenient.  Really cute neighborhood!  I'd definitely stay here again!"
12781774,94330921,2016-08-15,66897700,George,"yes and no...he was a little nudgy about certain things, but eventually very accomodating..location was great for the Jamaica Plain wedding"
12781774,97472908,2016-08-27,48517361,David,"The apartment was great! It had everything we could want, and the hosts even provided milk and cereal! They were incredibly welcoming and the place was great. We'd highly recommend it!"
13414367,82725283,2016-06-29,62456880,Michael,"Had a great stay at Emily's place! It's very quiet and clean, and pleasant, and in a great location for exploring Boston!"
13414367,84553524,2016-07-08,29110689,Rogerio,Emily has a great apartment located in a beautiful neighborhood in Boston. It's right next to the freedom traila and close to a great number of amazing places to eat. We were three persons and we fit ok but I think it's perfect for couples. Emily wasn't available this time but her friend was very attentive and helpful to us. I highly recommend staying here.
13414367,84976026,2016-07-10,26764919,Davin,Emily was a great host and would recommend her place to anyone who needs a place to stay in Boston!
13414367,85937513,2016-07-14,2278487,Jennifer,"Location, location, location!  You can't do better than half a block from Hanover Street in the heart of Boston's North End.  This place is ideally located within a short walk of many of Boston's main sights:  the Freedom Trail, Boston Common, Fanueil Hall etc.  The T is an easy walk away and the lovely paths along the nearby Rose Fitzgerald greenway are spectacular."
Even though it's centrally located,the place was nice and quiet,just as advertised.  No parking.  Don't even think about trying to be here with a car.  The pictures and descriptions are extremely accurate:  the bedroom is spacious and lovely and  the kitchen is extremely well outfitted.  The only downside is the teeny living room which is a little spartan.  The bathroom is small too,but my two daughters and I were comfortable staying there.,,
Emily was a great host:  very communicative in advance and left a nice packet of suggestions we definitely used.  There was also a fun bowl of candy for guests my daughters appreciated!  She was out of the country while we were there,but the friend she arranged to meet us was quite helpful.,,,,
"If you want to stay in the heart of the North End this is a great choice.\"",,,,,
13414367,86818835,2016-07-17,19539340,Amanda,"My stay here was wonderful.  Booking and arranging arrival was easy thanks to Emily and her friend.  The location was wonderful, many restaurants and bars.  The walk to the downtown area and T access was quick.  Emily's place was clean and spacious! I would definitely stay again."
2776391,16850440,2014-08-03,10732655,Ajibola,"Beautiful, fully-equipped flat in an excellent location. 2 minutes from State metro. 30 seconds from Hubway cycle hire. On the Freedom Trail. Next door to Quincy Market. Lufthansa lost my luggage, but this apartment more than made up for it. Elyne was extremely helpful and easy to contact. Many thanks."
2776391,17631531,2014-08-15,17997249,Mandy,"This apartment was great!  Very clean, and a perfect location!  I highly recommend it.  Thank you!"
2776391,18559197,2014-08-28,19030325,Philip,"A very nice, well equipped apartment in a superb location, right in the centre of the city close to two subway stops and as well as multiple tourist attractions (Faneuil Hall, Quincy Market, New England Aquarium). Lots of stores close by as well as plenty of restaurants to choose from."
Elyne was quick to respond to messages and checked in to make sure we had settled in OK.,,,,,
"Thanks for making our stay in Boston an enjoyable one!\"",,,,,
2776391,19880220,2014-09-20,9312682,Christopher,Great apartment in a great part of town. The apartment was on the third floor in updated building situated on the freedom trail. All was found to be as advertised. We really had a great stay. I think it is suitable for both business or vacation trips to Boston.
2776391,20647993,2014-10-03,18635312,Kelly,The listing description for the property is accurate and very accommodating. The apartment was clean and had all the useful amenities we needed while traveling. The neighborhood was in a nice location with lots to do and see.
However the bar scene was noisier than expected,which was not too much of a problem for us. We are students and were up late studying anyways,but if you wanted an early night for sleep that could be difficult. Although the weather was nice for the time we were there so that could have contributed to more people in the area than usual.,,,
From the previous review I expected more from the host. I had mentioned that my travel schedule was difficult and less than ideal,I did not really have access to communicate well. So upon arriving the host did try to meet me conveniently but did not really have a friendly attitude.,,,,
We had some difficulties with working amenities when arriving. The host did contact someone to repair the microwave but due to having to order a part it was not functioning the entire time we were there. We tried to see if we could be accommodated for this in some way but again had unpleasant interactions with the host. She made it seem like we should have informed her that the microwave would take longer to fix than a day. We did not feel like this was our responsibility. We feel as the manager of the property she should have been aware of what was going on and not expect guests to manage that situation.,,,,,
Overall a good location and nice place – we hope the customer service improves because we’d like to stay there in future!,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
2776391,21086681,2014-10-11,21100424,Robin,The apartment was absolutely perfect for us with two bathrooms and plenty of space.
It is above a friendly bar/grill with good food but quiet enough as it is on the top floor of a 3-story building.,,,,,
Right on the Freedom Trail and opposite the busy market area,there are pubs,restaurants and sights galore right outside the front door.  Loads to do!,,,
"It really couldn't have been better for a long weekend followed by a base to work from - thanks Elyse!\"",,,,,
2776391,21429515,2014-10-17,3592842,Sarah And Chris,Elyne was great communiacting and the place was exactly like the pictures. You cannot best this location!
2776391,22066003,2014-10-29,14713366,Office,"Great central apartment, has all amenities and hubway cycle station in front of house."
2776391,27836807,2015-03-13,20976709,Kevin,"We loved this apartment.  It is exactly as described.  Great interior design.  Very spacious. There is an upper bedroom and bathroom with skylights, and a rear bedroom on the main floor with bathroom, kitchen, living room.  The living room is cozy and very comfortable for hanging out watching HDTV.  The location is excellent, only a two minute walk to Quincy Market, five minute walk to the subway, several pubs on the same block, also a short walk to Little Italy/North End."
The pub/street downstairs can get noisy,but the apartment is on the third floor and you can only hear the bar noise if you are in the living room.  The bedrooms are quiet.  The pub owner offered to deliver food upstairs to us if we wanted - nice neighborly touch.  There are three flights of indoor stairs to get to the apartment,so it might not be great for the elderly or if you have heavy bags.,,,
Elyne was very communicative before we arrived and made sure we had all the information.  There was a slight snafu with the wifi login,but she diligently worked with me to quickly get it resolved.  She checked in via email to ensure we were enjoying our stay.,,,,
We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Boston.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
2776391,37454270,2015-07-07,16909956,Patty,"The apartment was in such an amazing location of Boston, truly, couldn't asked for a more perfect spot. The 3 floor walk up is a lot, but a nice work out :-) Couldn't hear the band too much from the downstairs bar on weekends. The apartment was adorable. There was not a door, only a curtain, for the first floor bedroom and just stairs leading up to the giant loft bedroom upstairs, (no door) but the upstairs bathroom is a lady's dream. Our host was very responsive about the broken kitchen faucet and fixed it within a day or two. The upstairs bedroom has a nice ledge next to the bed but over a few days I noticed black brick residue (from the wall above) and a cobweb or two but that is to be expected from an old remodeled building. There is a bright EXIT sign in the upstairs loft, as I think the building used to be commercial before turning it into an apartment. Overall, this place was great for my co-worker and I staying here for two weeks. Truly was an amazing location. I recommend it and would definitely stay here again!"
2776391,44756622,2015-08-29,31744373,Damla,"We stayed at this place during July and August (Me, husband, mom, dad). Elyne was very professional, a great host and was very responsive of our needs and took care of them quickly. The place was very nice, well designed, clean and had everything we needed even for the long time we stayed. The neighbourhood was also great! It was in the heart of the tourist attractions as well as shopping alternatives. There were so many places to see in walking distance and all the subway lines were pretty close. (5-10 min walk at most) It was a very convenient location. If I come to Boston one more time I would definitely choose this place again."
2776391,50614086,2015-10-13,17347765,Sonya,Great apartment in a great location.
2776391,51529310,2015-10-21,37322980,Bill,Apartment was exactly - no even better - than what we expected.
A brilliant spot from which to explore and enjoy Boston.,,,,,
"Host fulfilled their role without fault.\"",,,,,
2776391,54988824,2015-11-27,1816870,John,"Great apartment, excellent location, new appliances, practical furniture. It is a long walk up, but that was not a problem for us and we have a 1 year old."
The music can get loud from the clubs below,"but this did not stop us sleeping.\"",,,,
2776391,58157886,2016-01-01,44255295,Rujun,"Our flight was little delay, Elyne patiently wait for us, sorry to make her waiting.  The department is exatly as it described, very good location,  easy for everything.  A good experience in Boston"
2776391,67040058,2016-03-26,57675577,Michelle,We had a great time staying at this cozy location! Elyne made it super convenient to check in and check out which was great for us coming in for a business trip. There was no hassle and she was always super responsive! We can't wait to come back and stay again.
2776391,68458486,2016-04-05,49022472,Oliver,"Well described and good apartment. Helpful host, with very clear communications. Hope to stay again."
2776391,70672650,2016-04-19,44271363,Drew,"The location can't be beat!  It is right in the middle of everything.  We were a little nervous about staying on top of a bar, but we never heard any noise when going to bed.  The place was clean and comfortable for two couples to share since we each had our own space."
2776391,71905292,2016-04-29,48304991,Cate,"Great communication beforehand and very easy check-in and out process. Exactly as the listing describes and great location for exploring Boston! Would definitely stay again if returning to the area, thank so much for having us!"
2776391,72928887,2016-05-05,9075831,Lucie,"We didn't meet Elyne personally, but she left us the keys and made sure all worked out, great communication. The apartment is as shown on the photos, has two bathrooms, equipped kitchen. All great! Just two things to keep in mind: there are quite a few steep stairs and the apartment might get little noisy from the restaurant downstairs, but we didn't have a problem at all, slept like babies. :-) We would definitely recommend the place and like to stay there again when coming to Boston! Thank you Elyne."
2776391,73394280,2016-05-08,30076735,Linda,"The apartment was incredible!  I would say that it looks exactly like the pictures, but it's even better than that!  It is decorated so cute.  Plenty of room, very clean, and a great location.  The host made arrangements for us to get the key with no trouble at all.  Since there wasn't another renter coming in after us, she even let us leave our luggage inside the front door as we went to a graduation that lasted past check-out.  Very responsive and very accommodating. We are already planning a Girl's Weekend to return and stay here.  Great place!  No complaints whatsoever."
2776391,76055299,2016-05-24,29118149,Mike,We really enjoyed stay.  Place as advertised. We did not have a car and were very pleased with location-especially since this was our first time in Boston. The Freedom Trail goes right in front of apartment.  Large TV  nice bonus for NBA playoffs. Very fast internet. No problem communicating with host. Definitely recommend.
2776391,76714389,2016-05-29,33889849,Hussein,"Elyne was an excellent host. Her apartment is extremely charming, and very well furnished and equipped! We really enjoyed our stay in it, as well as its central location. The only very slight concern is the fact that it is located on the 2nd floor of the building which does not have an elevator. Otherwise, an extremely charming apartment designed with very charming taste."
2776391,78183273,2016-06-05,61844163,John,"We had a great experience with this rental. The unit was quite large, well-furnished, comfortable, and was an outstanding value. The management was very acommodating to our needs. The location - across the street from both Faneuil Hall and Boston City Hall - was great in its own right and was ideal to get around Boston. Sound insulation was pretty good, with some limited background noise getting through on weekend nights. Accessing the unit requires walking up three flights of stairs."
2776391,78864304,2016-06-09,13570714,Michele,The host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2776391,79298407,2016-06-12,24381175,Dave,Great Apartment!
Great location,great amenities,"and a great value.   The apt is centrally located near Faneuil Hall.   It is nicely decorated and very functional.   The place gives you an \"\"authentic\"\" feel as soon as you enter with the brick walls and leather love seat.  Kitchen is smartly organized and fully functional",although we ate downstairs in the bar most nights.  The upstairs bedroom has a very comfortable bed and a large shower.,,
For using the subway,it is just a short walk to Haymarket or the Aquarium.   We used the bus and Blue Line subway when  flying in and out of BOS.  The hostess was an excellent communicator and promptly responded to any email/txt/ph.  We will definitely stay there again!,,,,
"Dave\"",,,,,
2776391,80513352,2016-06-18,63930673,Leslie,"First of all our trip was amazing and the apartment lovely and support people were very helpful BUT: I need to say this very clearly so that if these two issues are deal breakers for you this is not the apartment for you. 1) there are a lot of stairs, so pack lightly and be prepared to walk up to get to your apartment. 2)  you are  above a bar that has live entertainment. We were there in the summer so their windows were open, ours were not. Their music was our music and loud every night except Monday until 1:00 a.m. So if either of these two issues will bother you please take this into consideration."
The apartment itself is lovely,just like the pictures. The location is also wonderful; Quincy Market steps away,nice restaurants steps away,"lots of daytime and night time activities. So all in all this is a wonderful place to call home when you are in Boston.\"",,
2776391,81689304,2016-06-24,63804886,Kelly,"Me, my wife and two teenage kids loved this apartment!  Separate rooms and bathrooms were perfect. Loved the exposed brick and beams and furnishings. A little loud, being on top of an Irish pub and city life outside, but it added positively to the experience. Overall, I would definitely stay here again!  Now for the minuses...  The washer didn't work, clearly before we got there. Maintenance did come but said part would have to be ordered. Didn't see them again. Don't leave bagged trash on the floor as it attracts ants. Found them in kitchen and bathroom. Two bottles of ant spray under kitchen sink indicated this was an ongoing issue. Finally, the host, Elyne, directed another group of renters to our apartment who thought they had our space. After a very awkward phone call to her at 11:00 pm, the host determined she had directed the other group to the wrong unit. When you get directions for getting the keys via text to her, confirm the unit you have reserved. There were more positives than negatives and we enjoyed our stay overall."
2776391,84918633,2016-07-09,66636687,Sarah,"The location is perfect for tourists - you're within walking distance of most things, and there are constant passing cabs if you need to travel further. It's not for the light sleeper, or for anyone who likes quiet - the apartment is immediately above a pub which has live music until 2am, and you can hear it all. This actually didn't bother us at all, but it might for some. Being on the third floor, the stairs do give you some exercise!  The flat is clean and well presented."
2776391,87364145,2016-07-19,60656149,Brenda,"Check-in was super-easy and the apartment was beautiful - just as described.  Location was fantastic: third floor above bars and restaurants, directly across from the Holocaust Memorial and just around the corner from Fanueil Hall.  Subway stop was at Haymarket Square, a block in the other direction, which made getting to virtually all tourist attractions quite easy."
"The separation between the living area/bedroom and the upstairs \"\"main\"\" bedroom gave everyone their space after a long day of sightseeing.",,,,,
Live music at street level could be heard a couple of nights,but it did not keep us from enjoying our stay.,,,,
Would definitely stay there again and would recommend to friends.,,,,,
"Thanks!!\"",,,,,
2776391,89070476,2016-07-26,71551058,Leslie,"Apartment was beautiful and clean. Fun mix of modern in a historic building. Easy check in. Plenty of room for a family of 4. My teenagers liked being able to have space away from us. Location is amazing. Walked to everything, a food Mecca! Public transit and rental cars available within 2 blocks. Yes, there are stairs, but not really an issue. Some noise from the bars downstairs, but we brought earplugs after reading previous reviews, but didn't even need them. Wifi and A/C worked great. We stayed a week and the only issue was the washing machine didn't work. Host informed us the apartment is being offered without washer and dryer which weren't told in advance and hadn't packed accordingly. She did try and help us with a solution. Would stay here again and highly recommend."
2776391,91408531,2016-08-05,46034553,Dennis,The place is very nice; attractive modern decor.  Comfortable furniture and beds.  Large comfortable bathrooms and showers.  Very clean upon arrival. Well equipped kitchen. Good communications with owner / manager who seemed genuinely interested in making sure everything was OK.  Location is great.  Short walk to North Side and its Italian restaurants.  Popular bars along the same block.  A block from subway.  Freedom path passes right by the door.  No negative aspects.  Live music in the first floor bar didn't filter up to our unit.  Anyone with leg trouble should be aware that its 51 steps to the third floor.
2776391,93892720,2016-08-14,58198774,Desirae,"I can't even say enough how amazing this place was! Everything was PERFECT! The best part was the location. Literally right across the street is Fanieul Hall, a big destination for tourists and locals alike with lots of shopping, restaurants and entertainment. We saw so much our 4 days in Boston and walked everywhere right from our place. If I ever go back I want to stay in the same place. Great value too, a hotel would have been way more expensive. It was 5 of us so once we split it all it was really affordable. Only drawback was it's up 3 flights of stairs above a pub with no elevator and we all had very heavy suitcases. But we really got our exercise between that and all our walking around the city so it was a good thing. I'd you vacation in Boston, you MUST stay here! Host was very responsive to questions and even text us to check in and see how we were liking it."
2776391,96242205,2016-08-22,9462007,Matt,The apartment was perfect! it was exactly as described and honestly don't think you could have stayed in a better location in Boston. It was in the heart of everything and made getting around easy. I would highly recommend anyone coming to Boston to stay here. Even though the apt is over a bar (Blackstone Grill) you cannot hear any of the noise. I would very much like to come back and stay here next time I am in town.
8224214,47937530,2015-09-21,44508868,Laura,We were a group of 6 friends who stay at the house the last weekend and it was great! Andy let us water and he let us stay a little bit longer because he didn't has any guests behind us and we had the pleasure to met him in the morning. The only thing I could say is thank you so much Andy! We really had a great weekend in the house :)
8224214,48624531,2015-09-27,41077911,Hye-Yun,"We could not have a chance to meet our host but he was quite helpful. The place was great as he described. However, at the beginning of the booking process the price was not accurate as he posted on the website. He changed his statements a bit but I believe that we ended up with we both agreeable price."
8224214,51043974,2015-10-17,44508936,Casey,"\"Andy did a great job communicating and the house was great. We had a team of three doctors doing contract work at Boston Children's Hospital for most of the month - this a a terrific alternative to a traditional hotel and gave the team a sense of \"\"home\"\" - In short"

8224214,67212702,2016-03-27,59594000,Eduardo,Nice location.  Andy was there to welcome us.  The apartment is exactly as you can see in the pictures.
8224214,68771209,2016-04-06,1766792,Stefan,"Eine schöne, praktische und geräumige Wohnung: Jede Menge Platz und alle Betten waren sehr bequem. Die Küche ist gut ausgestattet, nur Besteck war etwas knapp - wir haben uns zusätzlich Plastikbesteck besorgt, alles kein Problem."
Die Wohnung ist für Boston zwar nicht gerade zentral gelegen,aber mit der T-Green Line ist man in ca. 45 Minuten in Downtown,das ist völlig in Ordnung - und die Haltestelle ist wirklich direkt gegenüber der Wohnung,was sehr bequem ist.,,
Von Andy wurden wir sehr freundlich begrüßt,obwohl wir ziemlich spät abends angekommen sind; er ist auch sonst ein ganz unkomplizierter Gastgeber - sehr angenehm.,,,,
"Alles in allem: absolut empfehlenswert.\"",,,,,
8224214,69656202,2016-04-12,63783247,Tim,"Andy could not have been a better host and his rental was better than we expected. Everything was clean and comfortable, and the sitting room off the master bedroom was perfect! It was comforting to know Andy and his wife lived on the first floor, but we never even knew they were there. This was our first time using Air B&B and it wont be the last."
8224214,70630374,2016-04-19,874886,Erin,"We came to Boston for the marathon. The location of this place is so ideal! We were less than half a mile from the race course. It also an easy walk from Cleveland's Circle which has a ton of awesome places to eat. The T is literally right there, across the street."
Andy was great on communication and very helpful and accommodating. The apartment was exactly as described,and fit our party of 5 perfectly. The place was clean and the bedrooms were really comfortable. We were all very happy with this place and would stay here again.,,,,
A small thing to note,and it is small,but this place is close/next door to student housing. We were here for a 3 days weekend,which the neighbors happily took advantage of. This is nothing the host has control over,but something worth noting. Again,"we would easily stay here again. \""
8224214,71226286,2016-04-24,58112266,Steven,Well coordinated and comfortable home.  Easy access to transportation.  Perfect for our needs. Kind and generous hosts.

Andy was very accommodating in letting us check in early to leave our luggage so we could tour the city and also let us check out late on the last day since we had a late flight."
"The Green Line T station is less than a minute's walk and the surrounding area is nice. Be aware that the Green Line is very slow so plan on taking 45-60 minutes to get into Boston's central area.\"",,,,,
8224214,79931804,2016-06-15,36217620,Isabelle,"Andy is a very professional and considerate host; even though we only stayed one night, he facilitated a lot the checking in/checking out. His apartment is a spacious 3 bedroom, everything was very clean, very convenient; the location is perfect close to the Universities. Excellent communication with Andy. The neighborhood is totally safe. We really recommend Andy."

Whenever we come back to America we will definitely come over to Andy.,,,,,
Thank you for your hospitality and especially your kindness towards the kids and also thank you for giving us such a pleasant stay .,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
8224214,85617857,2016-07-12,1344070,Clemence,"We stayed at Andy's place for 2 nights. The apartment is very nice, three separate bedrooms, a nice bathroom and a kitchen, all equipped. It was very comfortable for the 4 of us (2 couples). Andy's place is quiet, nice and just near by the green line metro stop. It was easy to do street parking for the duration of our stay for free and there are a few stores, restaurant and bars within a mile from the apartment. We met Andy when we arrived at the apartment and were able to communicate with him for the duration of our stay very easily. We enjoyed our stay and recommend Andy as a host."
8224214,86154077,2016-07-15,29201102,Kathleen,"This location was perfect for visiting Northeastern, BC, Emerson and Tufts."
Unfortunately,Andy was having a lot of personal issues before and during our stay that made it very difficult to reach him. He would not furnish a phone number so I had to keep e-mailing him through airbnb to try to get any response,which in most instances took several e-mails and days to get a response.,,,
We had several issues with the unit once we got there and during our 3 day stay. We didn't know where to park; my 16 year old daughter had no window coverings in her bedroom the first night; there were no pots so we had to change our dinner plans; unit needs to be painted to cover glaring red marks on walls in most rooms; there was no cutlery; there is a coffee maker but no mugs; no recycling; front porch and yard are a disaster.,,,,,
Also,Andy showed up at 10:30PM our first night getting my 16 year old daughter out of bed.,,,,
Andy and his wife seem very nice,"but I did suggest to him that he remove this listing until he gets his personal issues resolved.\"",,,,
8224214,87035250,2016-07-18,76547748,Rich,Great quiet neighborhood and located right next to the T's green line which made it super easy to get anywhere in Boston. Quick responses from Andy as well as accurate pictures and descriptions made for no surprises. New appliances and very clean. First time using Airbnb and had a fantastic experience. Can't wait to use again.

The apartment is very spacious and clean,and we were very comfortable staying there.  It has all of the amenities we would want or need- and it was so much better than staying at a hotel.,,,,
As stated,the unit is close to the subway- which is very easy to navigate.  It is so much easier than having a car and looking for parking in the city.,,,,
Our only small concern was that we could hear the upstairs neighbors at night,as they were coming and going.  It was loud enough to disturb us,but once we put on some white noise,we were totally fine.,,

You must go and visit this great city of Boston. I will return next summer and I most definitely will try to stay at Yonatan home.

We were pleased the subway into downtown Boston was 0.2mi away, an easy walking distance.   Along the way, we ran across numerous restaurants, and several laundry mats.  We were able to drop off our laundry, at less than $1 a pound and pick it up the next day on the way home from the subway.  Needless to say, the apartment is convenient, but it is also spacious and well decorated.  Checking in and out was a breeze.    Ample room for our party of four, including two comfortable beds and two full bathrooms.  The kitchen is big and open leading into a great room with three large couches and a television for entertainment.  The apartment has several steps to get in and out, and has a handrail for assistance.   Overall, we enjoyed our stay in Boston, and Yonatan's place made the experience all that more enjoyable."

This area of Dorchester is perfect for getting to highway and main roads quickly. Home is very clean and remodeled well, neat building. Area has some well done remodels (such as this one) on houses over 100 years old but also some that need love. Twice the space at half the cost of a Boston hotel. House assistant was helpful, friendly, and quick to respond. Comfortable with all the amenities of my own home which made for an easier trip with children plus allowing adult space. Parking in street was never a problem regardless of time but steet is narrow with both sides lined with cars. Overall it was perfect for our summer family vacation!"

Des plus grande serviettes de bain serait appréciées. Et plus d'une chacune pour 4 jours. Des attentions sont offert, eau, vin, friandises. C'était très gentil. Seul point négatif, les alentours de l'appartement. À tous les jours nous avons vue dans la cours du voisin, des rats et souris. Moi j'ai peur de Ca alors çe n'était pas agréable."

Estaba todo muy limpio y cuidado. Todo como se ve en las fotos. Las camas eran muy  cómodas y la ropa de cama muy limpia y agradable. El metro estaba cerca y comunicaba fácilmente con los puntos de interés de la ciudad. Supermercado cerca. Sólo tuvimos un pequeño problema para obtener el código de entrada. Sería deseable que los anfitriones enviaran este código por mensaje a través de Airbnb tal como nosotros hemos recibido en otros alojamientos. No todo el mundo dispone de teléfono con cobertura USA y la persona de contacto no nos lo puso fácil. Sin duda, si volviéramos a Boston nos volveríamos a alojar aquí."

Unfortunately,everything else left much to be desired. When we arrived after an 8 hour drive,within one hour,"we were disturbed twice by someone there to \"\"show\"\" the place. The man was very friendly and apologetic about it but it was not the best way to start a trip when you're trying to nap.",,
The walls are made (URL HIDDEN) The three nights we spent were soundtracked by a man with a constant cough,spitting up phlegm so loud that we had to use our computer to download relaxation music to drown out the sound at night in order to sleep (which was not restful because the bed is uncomfortable). You can hear EVERYTHING (I mean everything) through these walls as though it's all in your room. We had to take very short showers because the drain wouldn't drain so within a few minutes the bottom had filled with water to your ankles. Not cool. Perhaps I should've read a bit more closely,but typically through an airbnb,something is provided like soap in the shower,or mini shampoo or conditioner bottles. Nope. Not here. So we had to make a run to CVS. Lastly,the place smells wet

Bed was comfortable and had just about everything we needed for our stay (I know they list that they don't have soap, but it's kind of a pain to travel with.) All in all a great stay."

The room is smaller than that shown in the picture, but it was enough for my needs. It was clean and organized. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. The only drawback is that the walls are really thin and you hear everything from the other side, but as I was very tired at the end of the day it just didn't bothered me. Overall I had really good experience and Would highly recommend!"

A few days before the trip, my plans had changed and I needed to have a parking spot. They were quick and responsive with reserving the space for me. Space was a little smaller than I thought it would be.... It would be tough to do this with two people. Overall good stay."
5075267,30495372,2015-04-23,26961620,Skyler,"Brent was great. We had a bit of a hiccup in booking, but Brent went out of his way to make sure we had an even better place to stay in an even better location. The apartment was clean, spacious, and in a good location. Next time I'll try to stay a little closer to the T, but it was still just a short walk away."
5075267,33262620,2015-05-26,30814828,Berenice,"Everything was perfect, small appartment but with everything you might need. It´s in a beautiful neighborhood called South-end, near the metro station and prudential center. The appartment was clean and nice."
5075267,34856301,2015-06-13,15562544,Yusuke,* I stayed in a different room in the same building offered by Brent. Please note that the review below is not exactly about this room :)
I stayed in Brent's place for a week,and had a good experience. The room was a professionally maintained furnished apartment located in a very convenient location (walking distance to the Hynes convention center). The room was equipped with everything I need during a one week trip,and check in/out processes were very smooth. As other reviewers commented the walls were a little thin,but besides that I did not find any problems. Especially if you are looking for hotel alternatives in Boston,"I can definitely recommend his properties.\"",

5075267,38873673,2015-07-19,9701705,Sabrina,"We had a fine stay in our room which was slightly different than the one pictured due to it's unavailability for our chosen dates, but we were given a larger room at the same price when we booked. The keyless entry worked well for us and we loved the neighbourhood. Neighbour noise was not a problem for us, although we could hear people going up and down the staircase which adjoined our room. The bed was comfortable, and having a hot water kettle, refrigerator, MW and dishes was really useful for our 4 night stay. We used the air conditioner and ceiling fan to keep the room cool in the very hot temps during out stay. Not a personal experience but really comfortable place to stay for 2 people and a great location overall for geting around Boston."
5075267,40169605,2015-07-28,3549670,Nina,"I loved the neighborhood, it was very close to good restaurants and walking distance from most touristy sites. We ubered a lot and it was very cheap to get around. The place was just what we needed since we didn't spend much time in the room. Think of it as a hotel room, it had everything you would ever need for your stay. It was very clean and comfortable and we really didn't have to have any interaction with the host. I would stay there again as I am in love with the neighborhood."
5075267,40452103,2015-07-31,34070433,Corinne,The location was perfect for walking to all the famous Boston sites. I loved that we walked down the stairs of a neighborhood building just like locals. The room was clean and comfortable with a great bed and cold AC. We would book here again in a heartbeat.

5075267,46174313,2015-09-08,18880298,Mary,"The Airbnb that I reserved does not look like the pictures shown here. It was the same building but different unit - I am realizing this now. This disappoints me especially because the unit I stayed in was much smaller than the one I was expecting. I never received an e-mail 48 hours before my reservation so I had to email Brent. He sent me the email on how to access the Airbnb right away but told me that his email system had already sent one and that it was apparently already read by me. I am not sure why he said this since it was not the case. After arriving at the Airbnb, I felt that it was very cramped. The bed (while clean and comfortable) took most of the room. There was not much space to walk. The bathroom was fine but the shower could have used some cleaning. Towels were very rough. The price was too high for the quality and size of the room. Communication was lacking. The rooms were different as mentioned. Although the location was good, I would not stay here again."
5075267,48413918,2015-09-26,1553040,Kevin,"Great location, but do note it was a sixth floor walk-up. I didn't mind at all."

Excellent location. Only a pleasant 10 minutes walk to Boston Common.,,,,,
Equally short walk to loads of great places to eat and drink.,,,,,
Straight forward check in with pin codes sent by email before arrival. (Write them down though before hand... My mobile phone overseas data plan ran out on my phone before arrival and we were nearly unable to get in!,,,,,
Room was clean and tidy.,,,,,
Felt like a very safe neighbourhood.,,,,,
Quiet location too!,,,,,
Negatives....,,,,,
The room is a very small studio. There isn't actually room to walk down both sides of the bed,without moving the bed out such that it then blocks the built in wardrobe. Not really much of an issues for us as we were out for most of the time,but would be irritating for an extended stay.,,,
Impersonal. The idea of booking through air bnb was to have some personal contact and seek some 'inside knowledge' of the area and places to avoid etc. We simply had two pin codes emailed to us and that was pretty much it.,,,,,
Summary...,,,,,
If you are only staying for a couple days or are on your own then the room is fine. Basic,"clean and ideally located for a short city break.\"",,,,

5075267,51992414,2015-10-25,20377179,Trang,"The apartment was cozy and fits 1-2 people. The bathroom was fine but the shower was tiny. There were some loose tiles in the shower. Towels were provided but I would recommend bringing your own. The entire building has thin walls; can hear the hallway/neighbor conversations. No elevators but we were on the same floor as the entry door and did not have to lug everything up. If you have a car and plan to park, it is highly recommended to reserve the parking spot ASAP as there are only four spaces (info will be included in confirmation email). Otherwise, there are nearby overnight parking garages but a little bit of a hassle. Convenient location because the train was only a couple of blocks away. Consider this place if you plan to spend the majority of your visit out and about, and will only be back to sleep. Bring your own towels, slippers, and ear plugs though! Also, don't expect the typical Airbnb experience of chatting with your host because this was contracted to a third party rental manager."
5075267,53064124,2015-11-04,22023439,Benjamin,"Great place to stay inside the city. I saved alot of money using the T instead of renting a car. The place was nothing fancy, but a comfortable place to hang my hat at the end of the day."

5075267,65938803,2016-03-18,44720657,Kelly,The apartment is small but necessary for what we needed for our stay in Boston. The studio is within short walking distance to most sights and is easy to navigate to and from. The amenities within the studio are good for a short stay.
The studio itself is good,however,if you are unlucky enough as we were to have noisy neighbors - you will not get much rest. The walls are very thin and you can pretty much hear everything that is going on. Luckily,the studio is situated within a quiet area.,,

One bad part was that the cleaning lady who came when I was checking out spoke no English and I had to communicate basically through sign language, not a pleasant experience."

5075267,76034949,2016-05-24,56997427,Balázs,"The apartment is very very small - we could not even open the drawer that was in front of the bed . In addition it was surprisingly noisy, due to thin walls - heard a lot of the neighbors, heard the room rumbling whenever someone was going up the stairs etc... Also, it seemed that lot of the equipment in the room was old, (i.e. the tv, the fridge - the fridge made very loud noises during the night, it sounded like someone was using the washing machine)."
For getting in you get a 4 digit code to the main door and to your room as well,but I'm not sure if these codes are being changed for every new guest.,,,,
The location is good,very convenient to the back bay train station - overall,I would say this apartment is OK to stay one or two nights,especially if you need to be around this area,"but wouldn't stay here longer.\"",

Only downside was that the heater and A/C were not on a thermostat - they only had a knob that you turn up or down, so it took some tinkering to get the right temperature during the night."

The location on Monument Square, is an easy walk to the North End or drive into Cambridge or Somerville. This was our second stay and Seth has been easy to reach and communicate with. At this point he feels like a friend to us. He has dropped the keys off at my parents condo a block away, allowing us to arrive at a convenient time for us. He has a roof top deck providing great views of the area and a relaxing place to sit and have a beer with friends and family. We will try and stay with Seth whenever we are in Boston."

The home is meticulous and comfortable. The deck is to die for. Seth was very easy to communicate and coordinate checkin/checkout. I would recommend his place with no hesitation."

The place was small but clean, and had two fans to keep us cool (no a/c, which we knew coming in, but if that's important to you, please keep in mind.) Also keep in mind that this is an old, vintage building, so adjust your expectations. We loved it, and it matched our expectations. Boston is a very expensive city, so if you're looking for an economical stay, this small studio apartment is great. We were able to walk everywhere and were very close to public transportation, a beautiful park, Fenway, the art museum, restaurants, and many college campuses."

The apartment was very spacious, and I definitely made use of the living room for watching tv! The bedroom had air conditioning which was much needed this August.. Made sleeping very comfortable. I didn't see Will much but messages over Airbnb were answered right away. Only problem I had was opening the second door to the building, the lock is very finicky and I had to buzz one of the neighbours to let me in sometimes. Make sure to try out that key to see if you can open the lock before heading out for the day! There's a huge park right across from the apartment, with a nice pond. To get to downtown Boston I mostly used uber pool, super cheap."

I can absolutely recommend his place. It is way bigger than expected,very well maintained,very modern and clean. He made us feel welcome and gave us privacy and space when needed.,,,

12639344,73129283,2016-05-07,33004310,Courteney,"The pros: the apartment was huge, beautiful and very clean and the complex was very nice, safe and clean."
The cons: With no warning,I was moved to this complex from another apartment that I had originally booked about 24 hrs before I got on a plane to Boston. The original booking was about 1 mile away from this location,which was hugely problematic as I booked the original location based on the proximity to a conference I was attending. They were responsive and offered me a small refund (after I requested one) and then gave me a larger refund when I realized and told them that the place they moved me was going for $100 less per night than I had orginally paid,which essentially more than doubled the size of the refund I was initially offered.  What was most concerning was that between the time my plane took off from San Francsico and the time I landed in Boston,I had been contacted by 3 different people from the agency that rents these units out each asking me to text or call them once I landed so that they could give me keys and one person asking me to fill out paperwork where I was instructed to give all my credit card information. When I told her that I had already paid and asked why she needed my credit card information,she then sent over different paperwork and said the original paperwork was sent by mistake. Could have been an honest mistake- struck me a bit sketchy though.
Ultimately,this all worked out- though not as I had hoped and with much more stress and effort than I have ever had to put in using Airbnb. Just know you are working with a management company here and you will not always get what you think you're signing up for. If location doesn't matter to you,it might be a fine choice. Again- the apartment was wonderful. However,my experience here was very stressful and disorganized. As such,"proceed with caution. \"",
12639344,75784438,2016-05-23,17591013,Nicolas,This is a great place. For sure it is not cheap to rent it but it worth it. Luxury buildings with big space to leave. Perfect for 4 people.

1638584,7760768,2013-10-01,7831086,Jason,This might be the biggest bedroom that exists in all of Boston. It's that big. The closet is equally spacious. Really big windows on all sides allow tons of light in with trees providing a large amount of privacy. The bed was extremely soft and comfortable. A surprisingly beautiful little hidden park is literally steps away from your home.

I loved the location just a block or so away from the T and from there it was a quick ride to Coolidge corner. We were also able to walk to a target, starbucks, and movie theater. Felt very homey. It is on the top floor of the building. But that was fine. The bed was pretty decent. It was nice to have a good home base around all the stores and easy access to the T. Thanks for letting us use your space."

3593290,21299327,2014-10-14,5281102,Sarah,"Nikki and her husband were such wonderful and thoughtful hosts! They emailed us a few days before asking if we would need anything for breakfast as they wanted to make sure we weren't left hungry in the morning. On the day of our arrival, Nikki checked in with us just to make sure we made it to their house safely and everything was ok.They made themselves available via email and phone throughout our stay in case anything came up (luckily, nothing did!). They also left some nice personal touches such as a welcome basket and messages on their chalkboard welcoming my family to their house."
The house itself was fantastic! Recently redecorated,it is very comfortable,clean and spacious,with lots of natural light and great decor. The kitchen is amazing and has everything a cooking enthusiast would need.,,
It is in a great,residential neighborhood of Boston. Center street is right round the corner from their place and has some wonderful restaurants! Getting into downtown Boston from Jamaica Plain could not have been easier (the T stop is a quick walk from their house).,,,,
We had such a wonderful stay at their house,"thank you Nikki! I highly recommend Nikki's house.\"",,,,
3593290,24353494,2014-12-27,19068607,William,"The house was the perfect place to stay for our short visit to Boston. The house provided a great base location for our family visits to the North and South of the city during our Christmas Holiday stay. The location brought back memories of my childhood, having grown up just a few blocks from the home. The short walk to Center street was enjoyed by all. Checking out all of the local stores kept us busy, while a stop into the Same Old Place pizza shop was required."
3593290,42382402,2015-08-13,292803,Dana,"The house is beautiful, clean, airy - and much larger than I had understood from the photos. It was prepared perfectly for guests, with clear instructions and tips on getting around Boston and available amenities in the area. Everything was perfect - comfortable beds, functional and extremely pleasant kitchen and living areas. I couldn't recommend this house more - we had a wonderful time and would stay again in a heartbeat. Thank you!"

The home is appointed with wonderful furnishings; the kitchen is perfect for all your cooking needs. Each bedroom was comfortable-the bedding, pillows and blankets cozy.  Even though our stay was very brief, it was home away from home! I would recommend this beautiful home for a short or extended stay.  It was truly wonderful."
3593290,70738752,2016-04-20,17101582,Erin,I can't say enough good things about our Jamaica Plain experience at this Fab House.  Nikki was a most gracious host and we felt completely at home in her beautiful house.  She was in contact with us and left wonderful information about the house and the Jamaica Plain area.  We tried several of her recommended restaurants and they were all perfect!
My husband ran the Boston Marathon and Nikki was so kind to leave a welcome basket full of supplies to help him recover.  Such a nice touch!,,,,,
The beds are incredibly comfortable as is the entire layout of the house.  We spent a lot of time in the kitchen,visiting with each other.,,,,
I would absolutely visit this area again and would stay at Nikki's place in a heartbeat.   Very walkable,safe,friendly,and easy access to Boston.  And if you are a runner,Jamaica Pond is the perfect spot!,

Steven was very responsive and accommodating with my late arrival. As I was planning my day in Boston the next morning, he was helpful with suggestions of things to do and most especially with how to get around using the train. Although my time was limited I was able to hit a couple of great Boston highlights. Thanks Steven!"
2811937,13821031,2014-06-05,13821544,Mariann,"The place looks exactly like on the photos, a very friendly and nice apartment, very well equipped. Steven was a great host, we got everything we wanted. The subway is very close, the area is peaceful, clean."
2811937,14031677,2014-06-10,8911792,Julie,Stephen was nice and flexible. We experienced both rooms in his apartment witch are very cleans and comfortables. There is big stairs to climb up before arriving to the apartment and it was not easy with big luggage but absolutely not a big deal with regular luggage. Safe neighborhood and close station. I highly recommend this place witch is one of the best I have ever been through this website.
2811937,14173414,2014-06-13,13308561,Jan,"Yes, it was as described and as on the pictures."
2811937,14518103,2014-06-21,5000427,Benjamin,"Stevens room was great. Comfortable bed, great for a few days instead of a conference hotel. WiFi was quick too. I really liked the the Dorchester neighborhood, especially the Ashmont Grill nearby. Steven is a perfect host."
2811937,14718595,2014-06-24,5698342,Ella,"Steven is a fantastic host: he's fun, social, very well travelled, and really embodies the airbnb spirit. In our two-day stay with him, he has been very helpful and thoughtful: from the Boston coupon book, to bathroom shelf space, to the breakfast food supply for airbnb guests,etc. His place is very close to the red line T train, makes the commute to downtown Boston very convenient. I highly recommend staying with him in Boston."
2811937,14808243,2014-06-26,17223548,Arun,"The accommodations Steven provided were exactly as presented.  The room was clean and comfortable; it's equipped with a powerful AC unit, and is conveniently located near public transit."
Steven is himself a relaxed,courteous,"and attentive host.  It was a pleasure to stay with him. \"",,,
2811937,15402238,2014-07-08,15398930,Hosam,It was nice to stay his place in Boston. I enjoyed staying there! I recommend him & his place.
2811937,15603146,2014-07-12,17613511,Barbee,"Everything was exactly as Steven had described it,and he was a very gracious host.  The bathroom was very clean, as was the kitchen (which guests can use).  The bathroom has new modern fixtures including the shower.  The kitchen is new and clean as well.  There is a nice porch off the kitchen overlooking the back yard."
The room itself was clean and quiet,with bed,very large desk,chair,wi-fi,nice closet space
If you arrive at night,motion lights illuminate the front steps and the front porch,and the hallway lights automatically come on as well.,,,
Steven's directions for transit were complete and accurate.  The Ashmont T station is a Red line stop,about 5 minutes away from Steven's home.  Well lit,newer station.  You wait indoors in a bright airy space for the train,much like a glassed in atrium effect.  No outdoor platform waiting here!  No below ground dinginess here!  There are also several buses that stop at the Ashmont T that you can pick up outside the Ashmont T station.  (and if you're new to Boston---no need to bring a car here,driving is tough in much of the town,parking expensive
The only thing I might caution,for older individuals or someone who cannot walk long distances,is that the Ashmont T station is about 5 minutes away,and there is a bit of a grade just as you come up to Steven's home.  The sidewalks are all even and nice except in front of one house further down the street,and it looks like they're repairing that short couple feet of concrete,but again
But,keep in mind Steven's offer to pick you up from Boston Logan Airport for a very reasonable price if he is in town and you make arrangements in advance.  So then it's just a matter of walking to the Ashmont T each day to get where you need to go.,,,,
I am new to Airbnb and this couldn't have been a more perfect first time experience.  Steven is exactly the type of model host Airbnb wants.,,,,,

2811937,15875861,2014-07-17,11523900,Andres,"Steven's house was just like the pictures, he was very kind and when we arrived he gave us the tour of the property and explained the details of the house rules. The neighborhood is good as long as you don't go any further south, we did not have the chance to talk much with Steven thus we ventured on our own to look for a grocery store and ended up in a sketchy neighborhood."

2811937,16687084,2014-07-31,3861331,Marc,Steven was a great host!  I reserved the room the day before and he was able to accommodate my request and stayed up to welcome me and provide me keys to the apartment although my flight came in after midnight.
"\"",,,,,
2811937,23833316,2014-12-12,18018375,Turker,I stayed with Steven for an extended period of 4 months in the fall of 2014. He is a great host and has been incredibly accommodating. He was also very quiet such that sometimes I wasn't sure whether he was home. He signed for my packages and even helped me find a reliable taxi for my early morning ride to the airport. I would highly recommend staying at his place when visiting Boston. For me this has been a great experience.
The apartment itself was clean and specious within close proximity to the Ashmont station. I had to ride the train to Cambridge every day and it took about half an hour from this station. This is a residential neighborhood. I understand that parts of this neighborhood can be sketchy at night sometimes but I never had any problems. There are several convenience stores and a few nice restaurants nearby.,,,,,
The information given in the listing is accurate. The apartment has a large balcony to get some air and the washer/dryer in the basement. Although all three apartments in the building use the same machines,they always seemed to be available whenever I needed them.,,,,

Although it was fairly warm outside when we visited, even though it was December, the heat worked wonderfully, which can be hit or miss in old Boston architecture. The neighborhood was pretty quiet, only a short walk to the T stop, Dunkin Donuts, another coffee shop and a solid pizza place. Probably the best Air BnB you'll find in Dorcester! We really enjoyed our stay."
2811937,59700377,2016-01-14,24018243,Lauren,Steven was a very communicative and generous host! He quickly and easily answered all of our questions. Be sure to ask him for dining and entertainment recommendations.
The neighborhood was quiet and residential,and the close proximity to the red line train was very convenient. The apartment was nicely furnished and spacious,"but not spotless. Note that guests are asked to clean up after themselves. The price and location more than made up for any untidiness though. \"",,,

Our room was very clean when we arrived and we felt right at home in his apartment. We particularly enjoyed having dinner with him at one of his favorite restaurants and appreciated getting to know him better when we saw him. His apartment was very easy to find and conveniently located near the subway. This is a great place to book, especially if you're a new Airbnb user, like we were, and are nervous about how the experience compares to a hotel."

The location is fantastic: one block from Fenway, close to shopping and restaurants/bars and the T. Would highly recommend."

I stayed there with family and friends for a vacation in Boston. There was plenty of space for 5 of us to stay comfortably. The amenities were more than enough, and the welcome package was comprehensive. The concierge was very helpful. No problems checking in or out or finding the apartment. Easy to travel around from this location due to being very close to the Fenway T station (on the green line), and a short walk to the Kenmore station (where you can travel on various train lines)."
3309941,19836554,2014-09-19,20528618,Thiago,I was in Boston for business and this apartment attended all of my expectations.. Everything organized and the location is excellent. The apartment is exactly as the pictures and it is an excellent option to stay in Boston.
3309941,20699098,2014-10-04,20395212,Jan,"A colleague and I stayed here for a week as part of a work business trip, and I would highly recommend the apartment."
We opted for Air BnB after we found that hotels in the city were extremely expensive,so the apartment offered here represented very good value for money in comparison.,,,,
I would say the pictures are slightly misleading,in that the apartment we had was much more spacious and luxurious than the ones pictured here,nice surprise!,,,
Both rooms were very well sized,had large en suite bathrooms and great views of Boston. The kitchen facilities were all brand new,and the living area had a spectacular panoramic view of the city.,,,
Travel to the city is a bit of a pain,it's about a 20 minute walk or 15 minutes on the T,but Fenway is a brilliant area and very charming. Fenway Park is just a stones throw away and there are plenty of shops and eateries nearby.,,,
Churchill were very helpful in the booking process and before our stay,my only quibble was we asked for an extra key but did not receive it,but this was perhaps due to a miscommunication between the reception desk and Churchill more than anything,and they kept my up to date regularly.,,
In all,I would thoroughly recommend anyone travelling to Boston to stay at this apartment,"and think twice before booking a dreary hotel in the city.  \"",,,
3309941,21790643,2014-10-24,21520369,Michael,"I stayed here with my wife, two-year old, two-month old, and mother-in-law, so our priority was a convenient and clean location.  We were happy that the apartment exceeded our expectations and even included basic amenities (e.g., soap) that made our lives a lot easier.  Being right across the street from a 24-hour supermarket is super convenient, and this building is also close to multiple T stops.  The inclusion of a washer/dryer and dishes in the unit was also extremely helpful."
Mostly I was impressed by the excellent and responsive communication from the Churchill Suites team.  While another host didn't bother to respond to my inquiries,Churchill Suites was very prompt.  Knowing that their team was responsive was very important in easing my concern that we may have a problem upon arrival and no quick way to resolve it (which would lead to a lot of anxiety from my mother-in-law).,,,,
This particular unit didn't have a great view (but that wasn't important to us) and it did appear to be ADA outfitted (which didn't matter to us,but wasn't a negative,either).,,,
I would recommend this unit to other travelers,"and I would definitely recommend Churchill Suites.\"",,,,
3309941,22117210,2014-10-30,12235246,Nadya,Great location. Great apartment. Easy check in/out procedure. Will definitely stay there again if in Boston.
3309941,36307166,2015-06-27,3665993,Valentina,Apartment is owned by a rental company. Mike was great during booking/check in process.
Apartment is in a great location with a quick 5 minutes uber/cab ride to all you need to get to in Boston.,,,,,
Apartment was NOT as described (unit 1046). Listing is for 3 beds (one of which is a pullout couch) but we were surprised to find that the 3rd bed was missing. Turns out some units had the couch replaced with a pullout ottoman and in particular our pullout ottoman was even missing the mattress so impossible to sleep.,,,,,
Mike & team were decently responsive in solving the issue but still one of us had to unpleasantly sleep on the couch for the night and then they delivered an inflatable bed the day after.,,,,,
Also,AC is broken so one room is about 15F warmer than the other … and AC pumps right on master bed.,,,,
They gave a 10% refund which is not nearly enough for the discomfort but an appreciated gesture.,,,,,
Last,"you will check in at the central lobby and then walk miles to the actual apartment so have one person with no luggage take care of it and just have everything else wait for you in the lobby of the actual building you will be staying in.\"",,,,

3309941,54784876,2015-11-23,48862933,Matthew,"Perfect apartment for five of us for a long weekend. Had plenty of space and was just a really nice apartment in general: great location, very reasonable price, nice neighbors and front doormen, in-unit laundry, etc. Leaving us guest baskets with basic supplies for the apartment was an unnecessary but thoughtful touch. Everything about this apartment was phenomenal and I would definitely stay here again."

989163,6987689,2013-09-02,7497175,Denny,"I stayed at Laura's place (Victorian Dream Studio, South End) for three weeks and had an enjoyable stay. Despite being a studio, the unit is quite spacious, with almost entirely brand-new kitchen, bathroom, and furniture. Internet is fast and cable TV is a nice addition. What I love most about the studio is that it gets a lot of sunlight due to the three big, tall windows. The separate bath and toilet area takes a little bit of getting used to, but I ended up loving it. Laura is a nice host and and is responsive to my questions and inquiries, even though our paths didn't cross that much (I was out working during the day and she is only in the building during the day but lives somewhere else). She even offered to have the studio cleaned halfway during my stay there, which I gladly took. I highly recommend Laura's place without reservation."
989163,7769218,2013-10-02,6948890,Ron,Really central to South End.  Surrounded by great dining. Very short walks to other cool places in South End and to Back Bay/Newbury St.
Stayed a month and had a blast.  Very short walk to the T where you can go anywhere.,,,,,
Laura very professional,"but relaxed and easy going.  Very helpful with letting you know whats going on in the area.\"",,,,
989163,8193677,2013-10-20,8322571,Ning,"I booked Laura's studio for my uncle when he was visiting Boston for two weeks. My uncle enjoyed it very much, especially the location. Since my uncle didn't want to drive, the 5-minute walk from T station made it an excellent choice. The neighborhood is nice and cozy. There are a lot of restaurants nearby. I couldn't have picked a better location for my uncle."
Laura was a very nice and easy-going person. She was responsive throughout my uncle's stay. My uncle had everything he needed in the studio. If there were anything that he needed assistent with,I am sure Laura would be there to help out.,,,,
Overall,I think this studio was a choice well made. If my uncle visits Boston again,"I wouldn't hesitate to book it again.\"",,,
989163,8884449,2013-11-24,9417022,Courtney,"I'm based in London but started with a new Boston-based company and needed a place to stay for a month.  This was my first time using airnb so I was a bit nervous but Laura's flat was a perfect home away from home!  It is a gorgeous flat, has a lot of light and looks just like the photos.  The neighbourhood has everything you could want and it is an easy walk to most places in Boston.  Laura was absolutely lovely, she made me feel very welcome and was extremely helpful when I had questions.  I would definitely stay here again!"
989163,11687216,2014-04-12,12773553,Brenda,"I would absolutely recommend Laura's studio. I stayed for one month and had an overall great experience. Laura was a perfect host for me, available when I needed something but left me to myself and I was able to make the place feel like home. The apartment is newly renovated, tastefully decorated, and clean with lots of light and is in an ideal location, easily accessible to downtown where I was working, and near dozens of excellent restaurants. Thank you Laura!"
989163,12133194,2014-04-23,4342312,Jessica,"My husband and I stayed here during our trip to Boston for the Marathon.  The studio was comfortable and fit our needs perfectly.  I used to live in Boston so I was familiar with the location and excited Laura made an exception for us to stay here during the marathon.  It's a great location with many restaurants nearby, walking distance to the Back Bay/Copley Square/Prudential Center and a quick cab ride to the North End or the Fort Point seaport area."
Laura was honest and responsive in her communications.  We weren't able to meet her in person,but mailed the keys to us,responded to our needs from afar and sent us well wishes before the marathon.,,,
Our stay was short,though we wish it could have been longer and would love to stay here again.  For those that do stay for a month or longer,"I think you'll be very comfortable and enjoy the location. \"",,,
989163,12720729,2014-05-09,7402287,Shravan,"Laura was a great host. She was very understanding during our stay and even popped in once or twice to personally check if we were doing alright. The apartment was well stocked with all the supplies we needed, and if at any point we  felt there was something else we could use (notably a microwave, and a heater), she was quick to aid us and supply it to us. I would recommend staying with Laura if you have the chance."

989163,21582698,2014-10-20,19290667,Dora,I loved my stay at Laura's studio apartment. The studio is small but has everything you need for a month long stay. Laura was very intentional in designing the unit to ensure comfort for a long-term stay.
I loved the neighborhood so much. There is a wide array of fantastic dining choices within steps of the studio. In addition there are multiple venues for theatre,classical music and jazz within walking distance as well.,,,,
Laura is an extremely gracious hostess. She's a lot of fun and interesting as well!! She was very responsive to my needs and/or questions. I always knew I could reach her quickly should something arise.,,,,,

Both contractors enjoyed their stays and thought the apartments were in perfect condition and in a great location. I would absolutely work with Laura again!
989163,29178796,2015-04-05,9013976,Greta,"Lara keeps an incredibly clean and welcome place for visitors. She is always easy to get a hold of and very responsive.

The bed is good and the decoration of good taste.,,,,,
The kitchen is funcional and complete.,,,,,
The heating and cooling worked well. Laura fastly provided a cooling when it became hot during heating season.,,,,,
Laura always helped when we needed.,,,,,
One should take care with the floor and furniture during the stay cause it is everything brigth and clean.,,,,,
Stayed 32 days with wife and daugter and loved the stay. They went walking everywere too.,,,,,

989163,39754646,2015-07-26,33149187,Laura,I had a great first airbnb experience at Laura's studio. It's a very nice place in a lovely neighborhood. At my arrival the place was clean and organized. The check in and check out process was very clear and easy.

989163,44900544,2015-08-30,1221544,Todd,"Very cute place. It's not big, but it's designed with a really clever use of space. There's a lot of light with big windows and a nice kitchen with everything you need. Great neighborhood too. Would definitely stay there again."
989163,52679736,2015-11-01,39222721,Marc,"The place is really nice! It is exactly as described and looks and feels really nice and stylish, the kitchen is fully stocked, and everything just works. You will often wake up to sunshine coming in from the windows every morning, you will see floating particles of sunlight in the air that make you think you're still dreaming, and anything you do during that time makes you feel like you're in an indie folk song video on a vintage filter (it's really a good thing!).  It's really quiet and in a really nice area in Boston, it is a minute away from several bus stops and you can walk to the best restaurants in town, and everybody in the building and in the neighborhood is really friendly, would definitely like to stay there again."
989163,58135158,2016-01-01,7248903,Nay,"I stayed at Laura's studio for around two months and absolutely LOVED it! I cannot rave enough about this place; it has been my favourite Airbnb stay to date. The studio is exactly as described and pictured - clean, beautifully decorated, functional, fully equipped kitchen, and it's a perfect, cozy size for one person or a couple. Laura is an amazing host who makes you feel right at home from the start, and she is frequently around the building and always tries to help in any way she can or give some recommendations whenever she runs into you. Another amazing thing about this studio is the location. There are so many great restaurants nearby, and its in walking distance to so many great places. I run in the mornings and this location was perfect for discovering Boston during my morning runs! Highly, highly recommended for all aspects. I'm so glad I found this studio! Thank you Laura for a wonderful stay!"

the apartment is a bit overpriced.,,,,,

13110631,80264425,2016-06-17,39370011,Josh,"What an absolute gem of an apartment.  It is perfectly located near the SouthWest Corridor Park, which is a pleasant place to walk in the morning or evening to get to/from any mass transit stations.  The apartment is newly restored and feels immaculate.  The hardwood floors are amazing, and there are little homey touches throughout.  It is very clean, and well maintained."
The unit is situated on the corner of the building,and the 3 windows each provide great views of the surrounding area.,,,,
There is an air conditioning unit in the window,which does a super job of cooling the place down.  It wasn't too hot during my visit,I can tell that summer visits would be the pits without that window AC unit.,,,
My only complaint is that the bathroom sink/mirror is super tiny.  That is just how the old buildings in Boston roll though.  Makes it kind of fun.,,,,,
Lana and Tatiana were excellent hosts.  They were very prompt to my request to stay and checked in throughout my 5-night visit to make sure all was well.,,,,,
I would absolutely recommend this place,and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.,,,,

Although we did not meet, I think they were very nice and went out of their way to make sure I was taken care of. The location of this apartment is absolutely great. (One mile from Fenway.) The apartment is nice and clean."
13110631,89734672,2016-07-29,22209142,Clothilde,Le logement correspond bien à sa description (il faudrait peut-être ajouter que le lavabo de la salle de bain est minuscule et qu'il ne faut pas être corpulent pour y accéder).  Tout est très bien organisé et efficace. Nous étions juste surpris - par rapport à des expériences précédentes- qu'il n'y ait aucun contact humain. Une suggestion : le préciser pour qu'il n'y ait pas d'attente de ce côté là.
13110631,92442132,2016-08-08,29331275,Evan,Hard to imagine a more perfectly located spot if you are visiting Boston.  We walked all over the city and when needed took a short uber here and there.  Place is small but clean.

5166870,26342144,2015-02-09,1931680,Ian & Molly,"This place is simply amazing. Beautiful New England charm in a great location. You get an entire floor to yourself including two bedrooms, a living area, a full kitchen, bathroom, and lots of closet space. Plus you can go up and hang out in the amazing turret room to enjoy the view. The place has Victorian charm with all the modern amenities, even laundry! It would work equally well for a romantic getaway or a family vacation. Matt and Eva are lovely hosts and they even gave me toothpaste since I had forgotten mine. It was a 10 minute walk to the Green Street T stop and a little further to various cafes and shops."
5166870,29666740,2015-04-11,25746571,Willem,I worked for 6 months in Boston and lived with great pleasure in the tower apartment of Eva and Matt. It is a characteristic building with a lot of nice and quirky features. The two rooms in the tower make it an apartment that I loved. The bedrooms are spacious and both have good beds. Kitchen is well equipped and what I missed was quickly added by Eva. Didn’t miss the TV because the internet provided me with enough TV shows from the US and the Netherlands. Franklin Park is just across the street and it is just a 10 to 15 minutes’ walk to the orange line on the T. From here it’s another 15 minutes to downtown Boston.
Eva and Matt both are very friendly hosts that are very helpful and will come to your aid if you ask. Also Eva’s parents are lovely people and it was an honor to meet them and have one Friday dinner together.,,,,,
"I am returning to Boston later this year and this place is already rented so I cannot return. Otherwise I would!\"",,,,,
5166870,30443636,2015-04-22,13101751,Dirk,Matt and Eva's place is a really great place to stay. The building itself is fantastic - and the turret a perfect spot to relax watching over the area. There is plenty of park area just outside the door and Jamaica Plain is a nice neighborhood. And with public transport you're in no time in downtown.
Matt and Eva made us very welcome,"even some nice flowers on the table so that we felt at home straight away. If back in Boston this place is for sure a first pick.\"",,,,
5166870,30926198,2015-04-29,17615898,Elizabeth,"The listing description was accurate and the house was lovely. Matt and Eva have done a great job with it. Both the kitchen and bathroom were upgraded and done very nicely and the other rooms retained their historic charm. Everything was clean, comfortable, and decorated nicely. The views were beautiful and the skylights added charm and made it light and airy. The location was wonderful in that it was 10 minutes from a couple of coffee places and the Orange line train. I love that there is parking at the site and that once we arrived, we never had to drive in the city, a plus for sure. I will definitely stay again on my next trip to Boston."

The apartment was as described, well equipped, clean and tastefully furnished. The neighbourhood is friendly, a big park just a couple of hundreds meter away and the underground station only a 10 min walk down the street."
The weather was very hot in Boston during our 3 night stay which caused a bit of a sleeping problem at night since the ACs in the bedrooms were old and noisy. We opted for using the stand fans instead. There is a bit of traffic noise from the street,but it fades down at night. It's a beautiful traditional Boston house,"and we enjoyed our stay in this tastefully and newly renovated apartment with its 'elevated' atmosphere. \"",,,

Eva greeted us and showed all the little things we needed to know about Turett House. They have a beautiful garden,nice towels,linens,coffee. Beds are fairly comfy (I need a firm mattress). The Turett is lovely...I took my morning coffee up and meditated,"good spot for yoga too!\"",

The house is beautifully renovated and the space is great (though if you are very tall, the low ceilings might be an issue!).  The apartment had everything we needed and was extremely clean and comfortable.  We had a car and it was a quick drive to restaurants in Jamaica Plain, with easy parking.  And it was very convenient to have a parking spot in the driveway at the house."
5166870,44704497,2015-08-28,10021865,Andy,Very enjoyable stay in a charming house. Nice garden and very well-equipped kitchen.
5166870,68062740,2016-04-02,43025502,Kurt,"Matt and Eva were amazing hosts with an amazing place.  We spent the mornings writing in the sunshine of the living room, lunches eating at the delicious bakery Canto 6, the afternoons checking out Boston (close to the T), and the evenings eating out at delicious options in JP.  Other favorites include walking through Franklin Park and having morning coffee in the turret.  Comfy beds, cozy living room, bright kitchen.  Victorian charm with modern amenities."
"Six out of five stars.\"",,,,,
5166870,68496595,2016-04-05,35909264,Ron,"We had a wonderful time at Matt's and Eva's tower apartment. Eva was there to great us and made us feel at home instantly with extra supplies in the kitchen. The apartment had tons of character and lots of elbow room. We are runners, so the location across the street from Franklin Park could not have been more ideal. The ability to sit with a cup of coffee in the tower room was relaxing and a great way to start the day."
5166870,70769216,2016-04-20,43768234,Shawn,"We had the greatest experience at Matt & Eva's place.  Before we arrived everything was coordinated with our arrival and entry into this great house.  The description of the place does not pay tribute to how classic the house was.  We occupied the top two floors of the house and it was located next to the largest park in Boston!  We were there for the Boston Marathon and it was nice to be away from the crowds downtown.  It was generously stocked with pots, pans, & dishes.  The clothes washer and dryer came in handy during our 8 day stay!"
5166870,71975971,2016-04-30,38101527,Barbara,"We had a wonderful week in Boston, the accommodation was perfect for us as a base to explore. The flat was light, bright and airy, clean and comfortable, plus only 15 mins walk to the tube station. We used the information provided on the local eateries, sampling many breakfasts from the local bakery - Canto 6. If you are looking for that place that is away from the hustle and bustle of the city, whilst having easy access, then this is the place for you. Matt was very helpful in ensuring that our stay was comfortable, and he also came to the rescue with the loan of a sat nav. Without his help our son would have missed his bus back to NY. Thank you again Matt."
5166870,75734290,2016-05-22,2415789,Joan,"My family traveled to Boston for a graduation and we stayed with Matt and Eva for a long weekend. It was the perfect setting for our family -- my husband and I were in one bedroom, my daughter in another, and my son on the pull-out couch. The apartment has a full kitchen and Eva stocked it with everything we needed to make a meal. The house is fascinating, with lots of little cubbyholes and interesting features, and close to restaurants, recreation, and shopping. We really enjoyed our stay and highly recommend Matt and Eva's apartment."
5166870,77390869,2016-05-31,18199904,Jenica,"Matt and Eva's place is gorgeous, and everything was thought of. They were kind and unobtrusive yet available as hosts. Of the many interesting things we saw and did in Boston area over the week we stayed there, our time in the apartment itself was one of the highlights of the experience. I wish all AirBnBs were this well furnished and cared for!"
5166870,77983797,2016-06-04,32097652,Ziqiao,"Matt and his adorable daughter welcomed us in person and responded to our questions and requests very quickly, making us feel at home. The apartment is amazing!! Looks exactly like the pictures. Spacious, clean, and well-equipped. Lovely restaurants within walkable distance. We enjoyed our stay very much and would definitely recommend it!"
5166870,79024508,2016-06-10,60762335,Melanie,"Garret and I had a fabulous time at Matt and Eva's Turret House in JP.  They kindly put in provisions for basic breakfasts, the accommodations were exceptionally clean and well appointed with laundry.  Views fabulous from the Turret Room, and a lovely garden to enjoy."
Matt and Eva were responsive to our requests and questions and we hoped we didn't keep anyone up by laughing too much.,,,,,
Building huggers everywhere should be glad of the stewards of this unique home.,,,,,

"\"",,,,,
5166870,81033559,2016-06-20,62486152,Sharon,"We stayed for a week in the middle of June at this lovely home.  It was roomy and clean with everything you need for a comfortable stay.  The place was full of character with views in each direction and lovely wooden floors and staircases throughout.  The weather was hot and sunny, but rather than use the air conditioning, we preferred to open all the windows which gave us plenty of air and spent each evening in the peaceful and cool turret room.  As mentioned in the other evaluations, it was well located and 15 minutes’ walk from the orange T station.  The area was very friendly and safe with cafes, restaurants and shops within walking distance.  The family were very helpful – Matt met us on arrival and showed us around the apartment and arranged a taxi to take us back to the airport home. Eva’s mum was very hospitable inviting us into her home whilst we waited for the taxi. We loved Boston and would recommend it and this wonderful accommodation to anyone for their holiday."
5166870,81445174,2016-06-23,70391439,Auret,"We had a wonderful stay at Eva & Matt's gorgeous home. The appartment is large and comfortable with modern AC units in every room. Beds were comfortable and linnen crisp and clean. Kitchen is well stocked and we had eveything required to cook a decent meal, including necessary condiments. Eva was kind enough to leave us bread, eggs, milk and coffee for breakfast, which we did not expect at all. Parking was great, just outside the entrance door in the driveway. We could leave our car and use public transport which is a 15 min walk away. Took us about 40 min total to get to downtown Boston. The walk back late at night felt completely safe too. Eva communicated very well and responded proptly to my messages sent. Great hosts and home in a comfortably located area."
5166870,82564937,2016-06-28,3104419,Odile,"This place looks exactly like the photos. Very cute, clean and everything we needed was right at hand. Eva always responded very quickly to my text messages about any questions/concerns that we had. She also recommended coffee shop and groceries. She left us foods in the fridge and a ticket pass for 2 days."
There was some street noise at night,but closed windows with a fan fixed the problem.,,,,
Also only a 10 -15 minute walk to the subway . It was not convenient at all,but nothing related to this airbnb.,,,,
Regardless,"we had a pleasant stay!\"",,,,
5166870,85877330,2016-07-13,65392214,Sharon,"We had a late arrival and it was no problem for our host. Also, they'd left bread, milk and eggs and a fairly well stocked larder. We found this quite useful as normally we're asked to clear cupboards before we leave and have to throw out good food, but we were encouraged to leave non perishable food for next guests."
5166870,88027242,2016-07-22,25736281,Susan,"The experience was great.  Lovely and unusual apartment near the park, far enough out of the city to be out of major traffic but near enough to easily get into central Boston using the T.  Interesting neighbourhood - it's nice to stay where real people actually live.  The hosts were welcoming and very helpful.  When we arrived there was bread, milk, eggs and fruit already in the fridge."
I'd definitely recommend staying here.  If you are without a car please bear in mind that the nearest 'proper' supermarket is 25 minutes walk away (although there are corner shops that are much nearer).,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
5166870,92490295,2016-08-08,59591704,Gavin,"Matt & Eva were great - they were quick to message and reply to any questions prior to arriving and during our stay - they set us up with milk, bread, eggs, coffee etc which was very welcome and the apartment was lovely and clean."
The apartment was super - really quirky (which we like) and very different to the very dull hotel rooms which had been another option. It was great having parking on site and the park also so close by. We did a lot of driving around (using the place as a main base) and the property sits in a very convenient position for accessing roads out of Boston etc.,,,,,
It's only a 10-15 min walk (depending how quickly you walk!) to the T stop Orange line and I loved (URL HIDDEN) much easier and more efficient than the tube network we're used to. It took about 30 mins to get to Downtown direct on the Orange line and getting a 7 day pass worked out at incredibly good value.,,,,,
Jamaica Plain is lovely - a really friendly and diverse neighbourhood...I'd happily live there if I was to move to Boston. Great selection of restaurants/bars in Centre St and around...and everything is walkable!,,,,,
Highly recommend - if ever head back to Boston I'll be sure to stay here again.,,,,,

5166870,93610924,2016-08-13,22892968,Michelle,"We loved the space!  Such a cool old home with lots of nooks and crannies but also with the modern conveniences of cold A/C (much needed on our trip when the temps were in the high to mid 90s), a dishwasher, and a new and very nice bathroom.  We wished that we had rented a car instead of taking the T...there is free easy parking at the house, and the Green Street T stop is a bit of a walk from the house.  And is uphill both ways!  For someone who likes urban hiking (like my husband and I), it's a nice walk, but for anyone with mobility issues it's a bit too far.  We stayed with our 3 and 5 year old children, and when they had a hard time doing the walk, our hosts were kind enough to loan us a stroller.  We also really appreciated having pantry necessities, basic toiletries, and eggs/bread/milk/coffee already in the unit for us.  They even put some age appropriate toys and books in the unit that my kids really loved!  That went way beyond what we have had available at other Airbnbs.  We found our hosts to be extremely responsive and helpful, for everything from restaurant recommendations to how to access the unit.  The upper floor/turret, while a really neat space with awesome views, is not heated or cooled, so we couldn't use it much when the weather was so hot.  I imagine it is heavenly in spring and fall!  We would not hesitate to book this unit again in the future."
5166870,97483871,2016-08-27,56407453,Joseph,"The apartment has loads of character and charm. It was just as cute as could be. We loved all the nooks and crannies and adorable closets. The turret is so great. We enjoyed the history and the renovation pictures of. the building. It was comfortable, clean, and had everything we needed. It easily accommodated our party of 3 and 4 people would be comfortable there. We could not be more pleased with our stay and highly recommend Matt & Eva's home!"

Nous étions deux couples avec un enfant de près de deux ans et nous ne nous sommes pas pilés sur les pieds! Un petit verre de vin sur la terrasse après une longue journée de marche est un must! Le restaurant Bukharra est à essayer si vous aimez manger indien (dééélicieux poulet au beurre)."

"Seuls points négatifs : un bon coup de balayeuse serait requis sous le divan et les lits et le métro qui est à éviter ces jours-ci vu les réparations. C'est beaucoup plus long qu'à l'habitude. On recommande l'autobus pour les semaines à venir... \"",,,,,

It was very easy to access the apt with the door code so we didn't have to worry about losing a key or coordinating a key pick up/ drop off.  Parking on his street wasn't bad and we found nearby parking easily everyday."

The neighborhood is one of my favorites, super safe and accessible to multiple T stations. I didn't spend a ton of time at the apartment but everything was great.

Just a few blocks away from Boston's Public Gardens,this is THE perfect place to stay if you want to be centrally located to all the sights of the city. Each day,"we enjoyed walking up the quaint street and through the beautiful gardens on our way to the Arlington T stop. The apartment is also right near a wine shop and several restaurants.

After calling her, she offered her own apartment, which was a lot bigger and , according to her, was rented for twice the price, but it was not what I had booked. She provided a quick response to the issue which was the most important matter as it turned out well. I can't make any statement about this apartment as we were placed in a different one. I would try to follow up with her before the arrival with a couple of email so that it does not happen again."

The location is great too - at the Back Bay, A walking distance from Boylston street, Prudential Center, Massachusetts Avenue and even MIT. There is also a supermarket nearby.

The neighborhood is great - just blocks from the Berklee College of Music yet on a quiet street.

Close in Back Bay walk to everything and an easy cab ride from to Logan.  Love the fact Whole foods is just a couple of doors down too.  As he was not in town he made sure his friend met me, let me in, and showed me around his place.  And even though he wasn't there, he texted and called a couple of times to make sure everything was ok.  His place is a typical college apartment but if that is all you need like I did, you will love it.  And you couldn't find a more proactive host.  Great experience all around.

It's easy to get to almost anywhere in Boston from here on the MBTA or even walking. We walked from the apartment to Newbury street (about a 35 min walk) and it was so pleasant. There are great food options in the area and Elise also has a list of great recommendations for you once you arrive at the apartment!

Estoy muy feliz de mi experiencia,"mis hermanas quienes me acompañaron (fuimos tres personas y fue realmente cómodo pues la cama de la habitación es muy grande en donde caben incluso tres personas) también están muy agradecidas con Paula. :D\"",,,

Il manquait une serviette à notre arrivée,Pamela à été très réactive en allant nous en acheter une dans la journée même de notre arrivée.,,,,
L'appartement est bien équipé,salle de bain,cuisine,chambre ...,,
Néanmoins un peu déçu du canapé lit qui n'en n'ai pas vraiment un,pas de matelas,pas de draps,petit,pas confortable,vraiment peu pratique pour y dormir.  L'appartement est donc annoncé pour 4 mais est idéalement fait pour 2.

Although she wasn't able to meet us the first day to give us the apartment keys, she made sure her friend did and texted us immediately to confirm that everything was fine. The apartment location is ok; the metro green line is really close, probably less than a 3-minute walk away."

Awesome location (a block from the T B-line streetcar that runs from Boston College all the way downtown, with plenty of coffee, alcohol, food a short walk away and a GREAT mini-mart right across the street) -- VERY comfy bed with clean sheets -- hot shower with great water pressure -- air conditioning in the bedroom and kitchen (it was hot as hell outside!) -- strong Wifi -- clean towels.  Carl was also very quick and thorough with communication and getting me settled in."

Allston is a cool neighborhood, and the T (subway) ride to Fenway park took about 30 minutes.  Definitely an amazing place to stay when visiting Boston."

On the same block I had access to the T, food, coffee, traffic was never that bad most people use the T in that burrow. It was a short ride into downtown and easy access to get back to the airport. 10/10!"

Nearly the entire apartment can be air-conditioned, so thats an added-bonus in summers. Carl is an excellent host. Fast to respond to any questions and was most accommodating to any requests I had. Most of all, the welcome at the apartment will take the weariness of the day away. I am sure I will be booking this place in the future. Thanks Carl!"

13019695,85851954,2016-07-13,8593305,Amanda,Clean apt as advertised. Know there is really no common spaces so if you want to hang out you have to hang out in one of the bedrooms. Love that Carl stocks the fridge with beer. Definitely a nice way to be welcoming.

13019695,96672553,2016-08-23,16885536,David,Carl's house was conveniently located and easy to get to during our stay in Boston. The neighborhood was pretty noisy and we had some issues with the shower not working well. Otherwise we really enjoyed our time here. Carl was super helpful and we really enjoyed knowing exactly how to get into the space.

7456890,45984460,2015-09-07,35322620,Megan,"Christina's apartment was absolutely gorgeous - as someone who lived in Boston myself and visited the apartments of many others, Christina's was easily among the nicest I have been to. Great location, lots of restaurants and shops nearby, and really close to the T.  She was very accommodating and easy to get in touch with. We had 3 guests and it was the perfect size, despite only having one bedroom (the bed is large enough for 2 and SUPER comfy. The girl who slept on the couch said it was really cozy too!) It could not have been better!"
7456890,50400457,2015-10-11,27659474,Joshua,"Christina was great! Prepared a delightful booklet of all the best restaurants and spots around the home, and diligently made sure we had everything we needed before she left. The home is comfy and well-decorated, and was located in an awesome part of Boston."
7456890,51923444,2015-10-25,11006039,Mike,"The apartment is a beautiful space for a getaway in a lovely neighborhood for walking, eating. Christina was available and communicative every step of the way, responding quickly and answering any questions I had. The space looks like the photos and is as she describes it in the post - very cozy, well appointed,with attractive design details."
"The only trouble we had was that we visited on a weekend when temperatures dropped before the building had turned on the heating so the place was chilly - just meant we had to snuggle up in the blankets! \"",,,,,
7456890,70685773,2016-04-19,22210773,Ashley,Christina was an amazing host. She was very accommodating and so sweet!  Her place was beautiful and very cozy. I was there for the Boston Marathon and it was a short walk away from the finish line. When I come to Boston again I will definitely be staying here. Thanks again so much Christina. You Rock!!!
7456890,75495500,2016-05-21,11052271,Mimi,Super Host! Amazing location! Cozy Apartment!  Christina made our stay in Boston easy and comfortable! She answered our queries in a timely manner and was very accommodating.  Already planning on going back!
13371105,83560444,2016-07-03,34265639,Cristina,"I'll like that someone was there to recive me when I arrived. I notified the time of my arrival, but had to wait (after a 13h travel)."
After s few minutes,the person who the host sended to recive me,didn't knew well the keys well,and that doesn't make a host make confortable.,,
Also the place wasn't really clean,specially the common areas. When someone pay a cleaning fee fore the Rbnb,hopes for s better cleaning situation.,,,

13078025,80109230,2016-06-16,35479485,Susan,"This place was AMAZING! I was in Boston for a meeting.  Hynes Convention center was a half mile from Eric's apartment. Great location!

"Thanks again Torry!\"",,,,,
915272,3872692,2013-03-23,42277,Marc,Torry's place was extremely well situated - a 5 minute walk to the subway and 10 minutes from most places you'd want to go to in Boston. The Beacon Hill neighborhood is very inviting and a thrill to wander through the narrow brick walkways & buildings.
The apartment is cozy,and Torry did a great job communicating. We especially liked the layout for accommodating a pair of people. The bed was comfortable,and well secluded for being a single room.,,,
The place is a studio in an older building. Once you come to terms with that and that everything won't be brand new,"modern or super quiet it is really very nice.\"",,,,
915272,3947535,2013-03-30,1376756,Виктория,This apartment is well situated. But it's awful smelly and old apartments. The hostess is very punctuality and indifferent to their guests. I had a lot of displeasure to stay there.
915272,4148033,2013-04-14,5237778,Mayra,I had a great stay at Torry's place.
Torry was very flexible to accomoda to my needs.,,,,,
Great location !!!,,,,,

915272,4265967,2013-04-23,4964620,Pamela,"The location of this place is incredible.  Right by Boston Commons and the subway.  Short walk to pretty much everything we wanted to see.  Torry was very communicative and accommodating, especially when our arrival flight was very delayed so we got in late.  As it has been mentioned, it's an old building so not super modern but that wasn't really a big deal.  We had everything we really needed for our couple days in Boston!"
915272,4358374,2013-04-30,1959019,Latha,"The apartment is in a great location on Beacon Hill and was very comfortable for the 3 (thirty-something women) of us.  It is an older apartment, which is typical of the area, and therefore not fancy but we thought it was fine. However, I'm not sure the apartment is air-conditioned, which might be uncomfortable in the summer."
Torry was in touch before our arrival and there was no problem getting into the apartment,but we hadn't confirmed our departure with her and she needed us out a little earlier than we desired - which was fine,"but she did not reply to my last text message. But everthing else about the apartment and visit was great!\"",,,
915272,4530027,2013-05-11,4738656,Judith,"I had a great week staying in this appartement exploring Boston:)  it was clean, comfy, it had everything and was easy to get into. I didnt even meet torry, but we had good contact by tekst messages. I would recommend this appartement because of the beautiful area beacon Hill, and its closesness to everything you want to see in Boston! Really nice experience!"
915272,4568445,2013-05-13,5081965,Tarah,"We had a lovely stay at Torry's apartment - what a perfect location!!! It's on such a beautiful, quiet street in Beacon Hill but less than 5 minutes walk to Park Street station with great links plus the lovely park itself. If you walk the other way you get to the picturesque Charles St with great little cafes (Paramount - WOW! Go there!) and restaurants and antique stores. The apartment itself is large with period features, and quiet. It's not a hotel room, it's not perfectly done up (but it is clean), which was exactly what we were after - we loved every minute of our stay. We didn't get to meet Torry but she was helpful and accommodating. We will definitely stay here again if we come back."
915272,4675092,2013-05-20,5135707,Laurence,"Torry was a great host, she let the keys where she told she will, she offered to install the AC because of warm, and she was very fast to answer question."
The point is that the apartment was dusty and the kitchen really poorly equiped (we were 3 and we didn't find the spoons),there was a lot of useless stuff in the cupboards,leading to a lack of place for used stuffs (after a few minutes of research we found glasses in the freezer!).,,,
It is very sad because if we basically decided to rent an apartment,it was to have the possibility to cook on the evening (in order to not to go every night to the restaurant) but it was quite difficult because of this mess which let no place to cook.,,,,
I think it could be a nice appartment if it was cleaned and tidy.,,,,,
The location was awesome,"just closed to the park where the freedom trail start and where the metro link lead to every places to visit in Boston.\"",,,,
915272,4856924,2013-05-29,5134025,Jeff,"As mentioned by other guests, the location and price combination cannot be beat. The kitchen is awkward, which may be annoying for some guests. I would definitely stay here again."
915272,4935856,2013-06-03,4359489,Brian,Fantastic location in a classic Boston neighbourhood. Very easy walk to restaurants and the hop on hop off bus stop for all the various companies is a few minutes walk away.
If your only looking for somewhere to sleep this is ideal apartment,full of character and charm. If your after something more I'd  probably look elsewhere.,,,,
Very limited cooking facilties. We got by with cereal for breakfast and boiling water in a pot on the stove for a morning coffee. There was some type of griller available if you'd prefer toast. We were out for lunch and dinner each day. The apartment does have a lot of the owners personal property around - clothes,books,"shoes etc \"",,,
915272,5010667,2013-06-07,6377755,John,"Fantastic location and everything one needs for a visit to Boston, at half the price of downtown hotels."
915272,5181214,2013-06-17,419580,Mathew,"The apartment was in a great location, everything we wanted to see was in walking distance or close to a mbta stop. The only disappointment was not being able to spend more time in Boston. The building is dated, but as already mentioned, so is the neighborhood. So for someone looking for quiet old neighborhood charm, Beacon hill is the place to visit. Torry was also quick to respond. We had no issues."

Torry was very accommodating; she worked with us on check out time, recommended places to eat, ensured cooking utensils were available and got a coffee pot.  The studio was clean and comfortable.

The building has seen better days. It is among some very beautifully restored buildings but this is not one of them. The apt. is on the third floor,"there is a rickety elevator. The whole building is shabby and so is the apartment. It felt none too clean. We did not enter the kitchen. It was grimy and tiny. There was no house manual. We eventually found a small packet of papers on the last day which had a few instructions. I would not recommend this place to anyone.\"",,,,

Just one caveat - it might be a good idea for guests to wear some form of footwear (bedroom slippers or shoes),"as some parts of the wooden floor have some short exposed nails from prior carpeting.\"",,,,
915272,8249190,2013-10-22,5248972,Katherine,"A truly outstanding location in the centre of the beautiful and historic Beacon Hill neighbourhood, which also puts it in walking distance of the Common, the state house, downtown, back bay etc.  As such it's terrific value, and it felt like we got a small taste of what it might be like to be a local Beacon Hill-er.  The studio is well appointed and has a lovely view of the city.  Torry provided helpful and timely communications and left some very useful guidebooks and maps which were of great use. It's a historic property but it does have a (period) lift, so we didn't have to walk our bags up the stairs, and it was very quiet for a building of its age (though we took our shoes off on the wooden floors out of courtesty for the people below us).  Recommended."
915272,8365377,2013-10-28,7887182,Julia,The apartment is in a great location and Torry is a lovely host.
Small caveats to bear in mind:,,,,,
1) There is no option to control the temperature in the studio. The windows let a lot of air through (one panel is covered with plastic that is taped to the frame),and the heating was off when we stayed,so it was very chilly.,,,
2) While the studio is advertised as housing a maximum of three people,little bedding was provided for the third person (no sheet,a warmer blanket as cover that was worn out and had many holes).,,,
Nonetheless,given the location,it is still decent value for money,"so would recommend for budget-conscious travelers.\"",,
915272,8598970,2013-11-07,8312711,Sara,"Thumbs up for Torry and her place.  She's very on point communications-wise.  Provides the info you want and need, and does it quickly, without being overly communicative.  The apt is in a great location -- very walkable to the Common, Downtown Crossing, Beacon Hill (of course), and the what not.  It's a good space for 2 folks, clean, and has a really nice vibe.  Thanks for a great stay, Torry!"
915272,8660606,2013-11-11,9217137,Mai,"Great location! This place is walkable to South Station in just 5 minutes and there is seven eleven near the station.

The studio is a great size for 2 people and honestly the sofa is really comfortable and we both fell asleep on it so a 3rd person could squeeze in. The building is really quiet and the lifts are SO fun."
Boston Common is literally around the corner,with Park St station at the side. Torry's place is a fantastic base for travelling in and around the Boston area,"whether by foot or by T. \"",,,
915272,9384231,2013-12-25,706348,Melissa,"Torry's place was in a fantastic location; right above the ice skating rink at Frog Pond in the winter! The apartment was very warm, and was even decorated with a Christmas tree. We didn't use the kitchen as we were out and about a lot. The bathroom had everything you could need, though the shower was temperamental. Great place."
915272,9881873,2014-01-16,8145459,Bryant,"This is exactly the type of place one would hope to find on AirBnB. If you are looking for something perfect, stick to Hotels. If you want something different, this was a great experience. I found Torry's description of the place to be 100% accurate and had no surprises. The Beacon Hill neighborhood is amazing and Torry's place is an amazing way to experience it."
915272,11245118,2014-03-26,7119662,Daniel,"Torry's place was awesome. It was right between Boston Common and Charles St. so getting anywhere and finding a good place to eat was too easy. If you're looking for a place where you can comfortably sleep, relax, and have easy access to anywhere (less than 10 min) this is your place."

The place was accurately described, clean, and Torry was helpful with any questions I had during my stay.

I would suggest this for 2 people rather than 3. The studio is pretty small and it was a tight fit for us especially with the tiny bathroom."

Torry had everything well organized and it was possible to get in delayed and leave early. The city-guide and the few indications very very useful. A place where we could well imagine to return."
"Thanks a lot\"",,,,,
915272,16100182,2014-07-22,1039352,Claudia,"This was a great spot to stay while visiting Boston.  The Beacon Hill are is so charming. The apartment was very comfortable. Loved the big window and I thought the bed was pretty cozy. The apartment was very cool when we arrived.  Instructions on how to enter were very clear. Parking is difficult, you would need to find a garage. The location is great. Walking distance to so many places like Quincy Market and Boston Common.Elevator is  a little scary as it's an older building, but not an issue at all. 3 flights of stairs if you want to walk it up.  I would recommend this place and stay there again in a heart beat."

915272,18884105,2014-09-02,17839178,Debbie,"As a single female traveler, Torry's apartment was just perfect for me. It is just as described online. The kitchen has a coffeemaker and a toaster oven as well as what is pictured. Plenty of hot water for shower. The location is fantastic, you can walk anywhere within 15 mins at most. The T is just down the street if needed, as well as hop off and hop on bus tour stop is just as the corner of Beacon Street, if that is your choice. The apartment is not fancy but if you are looking for a great safe location, and clean comfortable bed, hot shower/bath and adequate kitchen, then this is the place for you. Torry was very quick with communication and pickup of key was easy. Highly recommend this place."

Beacon Hill is a fantastic location (literally minutes from Boston Commons, the Freedom Trail and the T) and the studio itself was cozy and had everything we needed. I went with a friend (we're two young women) and we felt safe walking around at night. Would highly recommend."

915272,20986356,2014-10-09,4890802,Felicity Gifford,"We were made very welcome by Torry, she provided useful information about transport on our arrival, and that was helpful. The apartment was in a fabulous location, central and close to lots of the tourist highlights of Boston. The wifi was excellent, but the TV was complicated. Unfortunately we were a little disappointed with the kitchen facilities. There were only 2 coffee mugs, the kettle had gone missing since the previous visitors, and there would be no chance of cooking a meal because the kitchen was so dark and small. There was virtually no toilet paper though Torry later told us there was some in the vanity. We don't remember actually seeing a vanity. We were asked to wash up but there was no plug for washing up in the sink. Torry was somewhat aggressive when I raised these things with her."

Perfect!! Would definitely recommend and stay here again!"
915272,22178832,2014-11-01,16622599,Jan,The studio apartment could not have been in a better position - great for walking everywhere; even a wine shop around the corner!

The location was unbeatable; we parked our car as soon as we arrived, and walked everywhere for the entire weekend, since all corners of Boston are so accessible from her apartment. I think we only had to ride the T once. The Common was just a block away, which was also a huge bonus when walking the dog, and her apartment is pet-friendly! I can't stress how convenient her location is. We walked to the Liberty Hotel, Freedom Trail tours, North End, Back-Bay, Copley, Chinatown, Fanneuil... everywhere! She's also surrounded by Green and Red line T-stops."

Great water pressure in the shower and she even had a little Christmas tree which was awesome.  She also provided a whole closet for our use which was awesome because we pack ...a lot."
I agree with other reviewers that the kitchen is small and not equipped for large meals but is perfect for small breakfasts and as a staging area for munching on snacks.  Great amount of space for a studio in Beacon Hill.,,,,,

All of the furniture was clean and comfortable,and the bed sheets were soft and warm. There are many pillows on the bed,and the comforter was also thick and warm. The bed is right by two large windows which had a slight draft during our stay,but it was easily fixed by making sure the curtains were shut,as they were thick and kept out the draft. The heat can't be controlled,but it turned on periodically when the apartment started to get slightly chilly. We stayed nice and toasty even though it was freezing outside! It should be noted that the bed frame is slightly wobbly but it was fine for two people - we are light sleepers and we both slept soundly.
Although the apartment was old,it was clean and the ceilings were high,and the room had a lot of natural light. There are two-pronged outlets throughout the room,and three-pronged outlets by the bed (for laptop chargers).,,
The bathroom was clean and fully functional - there is shampoo,towels,conditioner,toilet paper,and soap readily available. There's also a full-length mirror on the bathroom door! The water pressure in the shower was fine,and I never had an issue getting a hot shower.
There are plenty of awesome restaurants within walking distance (we tried and loved JM Curley's) as well as an entire shopping center just across the park that has a Macy's and other convenient stores. There's also an ice rink in the park that seems to open early and close late! The apartment is right up the street from the beautiful park and the Capitol Building can be seen from the park.,,,,,

915272,29964858,2015-04-15,21967548,Daniel,"We had a fantastic four night stay at Torry's flat. Instructions were easy to follow and the flat is in a great location. The Apple TV with Netflix and Hulu was a bonus, the flat is very spacious and it was clean and comfortable. We found it to be the perfect place to base ourselves while exploring Boston. Thank you Torry!"
915272,30438901,2015-04-22,23699989,Nichole,"Awesome Stay! Torry was very responsive, accommodating, and provides good recommendations for places to visit within walking distance. This was the 6th trip to Boston for me and my best friend and the location was by far our favorite.  It was right in the heart of everywhere we needed to be/go and the building was quiet. Would absolutely stay again."
915272,30860630,2015-04-28,6095193,Christy,Loved the location and accessibility to Boston common. Torri was easy to work with.
915272,31288090,2015-05-04,24192370,Rachel,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Torry's sunny studio. The studio is exactly as described. The studio feels quite large because of the beautiful high ceilings and large windows - we had more than enough space for all of our suitcases and belongings. The space is  clean, neat, and wonderfully decorated. Torry is a fantastic host. Communication with her was easy. She answered most of my questions before I could even ask them and was fast to respond to any questions that arose. The location of her place is amazing- it is an easy walk to several T stations, great restaurants, shopping, and more. I highly recommend staying at Torry's studio."
915272,31790697,2015-05-10,5075046,Eponine,I booked Torry's place for my parents to stay for a couple of days. It was their first trip to the U.S. and being at Torry's beacon hill studio made their stay very enjoyable. The place is very nice and cosy as well as being very conveniently located. My parents found the place very clean and communicating with Torry was very easy. I would recommend our apartment!
915272,32101802,2015-05-14,20286404,Leonardo,"La ubicacion del departamento es excelente. El barrio de Beacon Hill es precioso y se llega caminando a las principales atracciones. El tamaño es correcto para dos personas, los muebles son viejos y el apartamento necesita una limpieza profunda. La cama necesita ser cambiada porque se hunde un poco al acostarse. El equipamiento es correcto, pero la cocina es muy chica para cocinar. El agua sale con presion y temperatura correcta."
915272,32810048,2015-05-22,25414305,Ignacio,"Nuestra experiencia no fue para nada buena. Llegamos a las 13:00 y aún el inquilino anterior no se había ido. Según nos comentó Torry (la anfitriona)  el error había sido de Airbnb por tal motivo tuvimos que retirarnos por tres horas para que el inquilino se vaya y para que Torry limpiara el departamento, no teníamos donde dejar las valijas por suerte habíamos alquilado un auto y pagamos una cochera que la gente de Airbnb prometió pagarla."
Pudimos ingresar a las 18:00 el departamento cómodo para dos sólo para dos NO para tres,pero era una mugre todo sucio!!!! para colmo estábamos alojados con una bebé de 11 meses que gateaba por todos lados un verdadero ASCO. La cama rota!!!! tuvimos que dormir en el sillón.,,,,
"Sólo se destaca el barrio y la ubicación. No es para nada recomendable y menos por el precio.  \"",,,,,
915272,33221788,2015-05-26,26081456,Tyler,"The apartment was easy to find in Beacon Hill and Torry left the key for us which was great because we had an early arrival! The apartment fit the description- small, sunny studio which was perfect for what we needed."
915272,33493814,2015-05-29,25780196,James,"Great location in picturesque Beacon Hill within close proximity to Boston Common and the city. Apartment was just as described, large and light-filled and contained all that we required for our stay. Torry was unable to meet us but was very helpful, quick to respond and arranged a location for us to collect the keys. We would highly recommend to friends and family visiting Boston."
915272,33771269,2015-06-01,26168501,Jonathan,Torry was wonderful and kept her promises about this wonderful studio apartment in the Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston. Her instructions on getting into the apartment were spot on and my girlfriend and I felt quite cozy there. The amenities were just enough and the apartment itself seemed like it was two blocks away from everything. I strongly suggest this apartment to anyone looking to see the best side of Boston!
915272,34035076,2015-06-03,12010646,Andrew,Beautiful apartment in an amazing location. Really felt like home the minute I walked in the door. Torry was amazingly helpful and easy to correspond with. Perfect.
915272,34194329,2015-06-06,26154061,Phoebe,Torry was a great host- very responsive and helpful with tips on where to go in Boston. The apartment is really close to the common and you can start the Freedom trail from your doorstep!
915272,34406736,2015-06-08,2555733,Julie,"The apartment is in an excellent location in historic Beacon Hill. There were a few hiccups with the place - when Inqrriced the keys weren't where they we're supposed to be, and it took some time to get in touch with Torry.   The apartment is cosy, but could use some upkeep."
915272,34844424,2015-06-13,26211639,Euan,"Yes Torry's online description/ rules/ and arrival instructions were very useful and accurate. She kept appropriate contact leading up to our stay keeping us well informed. Her apartment was also comfortable and spacious, with everything we required for our stay."
The Beacon Hill area of Boston was an incredible area to stay in Boston. A very beautiful and quiet street for getting good sleeps,but yet just a short walk away from downtown Boston + Harbour / Boston Common and Backbay East area (all areas we wanted to visit on our stay) so did not have to spend any money getting public transport anywhere. There were also some amazing restaurants nearby e.g Figs/ Mooo restaurant/ Zen.,,,,
"Overall an unforgettable stay\"",,,,,

915272,36798317,2015-07-01,16439605,Care,"We enjoyed this cozy studio on historic (and convenient) Beacon Hill. Clean, very quiet, with fast WiFi, a comfy double bed, and plenty of hot water. We found the apartment to be smaller in reality than it appeared in the photos, so it’s better for a short visit than for an extended stay. Overall, the apartment could be refreshed, and needs a fresh coat of paint. The tiny kitchen works best for re-heating takeout, rather than for any serious cooking. Also, the lighting is very dim, making reading difficult—needs brighter bulbs and more lamps. Torry was super-helpful and a gracious host!"
915272,37451907,2015-07-07,22005705,Gina,"\"My boyfriend and I had an amazing 4th of July weekend in beacon hill! The location of the apartment can not be beat...we were within walking distance of everything! The description and pictures of the apartment were accurate; it is a perfect space for two people. I imagine that three people would be a tight fit. We did not spend much time in the apartment, but it met our minimal needs. The apartment building itself is very dated, but we loved the \"\"old school\"\" elevator! You can't go wrong with this location; we are looking forward to coming back!\""
915272,38133472,2015-07-13,32787333,Jennifer,"The neighbourhood was beautiful and very central- such a great location.  The listing was very accurate, we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  Torry was a great host, very accessible and gave us all the information we needed without us having to ask for anything."
915272,38485699,2015-07-16,3749478,Sophie,Terry is a nice host and her studio is located in a great area. However it is smaller than on the pictures and is not cleaned to my usual standards even though I live in Paris in a 19th century building. We even did not have breakfast because the kitchen is dark and not welcoming even though we are French and love cooking. And the entrance key opens the door after playing with it during 5 minutes. But Terry was always available on the phone for us and helpful .
915272,39914002,2015-07-27,19804433,Avery,"We had a great time in this Beacon Hill studio apartment! It was in the perfect location, right in the middle of the city, close to shopping, dining, T stations, Boston Common and more. The apartment was as advertised, easy to find, clean and tidy and super convenient."
"Torry was a great host who provided us with all the information we needed and she was easy to communicate with. We had a wonderful time on our trip and I would most definitely recommend this Beacon Hill apartment!\"",,,,,
915272,40903088,2015-08-03,31465506,Jeffrey,We really enjoyed our stay at Torry's place in Beacon Hill.  The location cannot be beat and there are great coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance.  Torry provided some great recommendations of new places to try that were excellent.  The apartment fit all of our needs and we had no problems whatsoever.  I would definitely recommend and hope to use again in the future.
915272,43485156,2015-08-20,30849761,Priscilla,"We know this neighborhood well and understand what old buildings are all about...we used to live similar buildings one block over and also in the North End. I also grew up in a house built in 1695. So that you don’t get the impression that we are habitual complainers, in all our travels we have **never** issued a complaint for any place we have ever lodged…for anything. And we don't expect to be coddled either...we do primitive camping 15-20 days a year."
I am very sorry to inform that this unit completely failed to meet our lowest expectations. A $225/night price for small unit such as this implies a level of quality and cleanliness that was simply not met. The fact that this rental has a 4.5 star rating brings into question the accuracy and value of the AirBnB rating system.,,,,,
The building itself is run down. From the outside,it is the worst looking building on the block. This,it turns out,is also indicative of the inside. The interior common areas are also run down. For example: there is plaster decay depositing debris from ceiling in the hallway leading to your door. Once inside,the apartment is hardly well lit,as the title of the ad says and the over-exposed photos in the posting imply. The carpeting by the bed was filthy. To claim the unit works for up to three people is questionable

915272,44115010,2015-08-24,33369463,Zachiah,"Thank you again, Torry, for sharing your Airbnb with me. It definitely became a refuge for my private study time away from my class."
The studio was comfortable and I slept really well when I had the time to do so!,,,,,
As you had shared it was a sweet 10 minute walk from the Hyatt where my seminar was being offered!,,,,,

915272,46464819,2015-09-11,29276498,Sarah,The neighbour was great! Beautiful historic buildings everywhere (including the building Torrys apartment is in). It was easy to arrange key drop off and arrival as well. Great experience!
915272,47458085,2015-09-19,31190964,Rachel,"The pros and cons of this apartment are all there in the property description.   It is in a great, central location near the top of the hill.  From the apartment you look over the lights of Boston's skyline and the trees in the Common.  Easy walking distance to the city, Beacon Hill shops and restaurants and the T-line.  The neighbourhood is beautiful.  We really enjoyed our stay here.  The cons are that the building and apartment are old: full of character or run down depending on your perspective.   The bed and bathroom were both fine. But if you want an apartment because you would like to cook a meal, sit at a table to work or eat, or do laundry, then this one is not for you.  We did not meet Torry, but her instructions for finding the key and using the apartment were all clear."

915272,49873847,2015-10-07,30789650,Christiane,"The Beacon Hill area is lovely and very convenient for the City. We found the building quiet and peaceful with very little background noise inside or out.  The building is an old one with the communal spaces having  a certain faded charm.  Not for you if you want sleek modern finishes. The apartment was pretty much as we expected from the description posted.  The main room is comfortable - in the UK it would be described as shabby/chic. It is large and airy and the divider effectively creates a bedroom space with plenty of storage. The bed was a standard double and very comfortable, it was great to have sheets and blankets rather than a duvet to allow for personal preferences on both sides of the bed! As the kitchen and bathroom are painted in a very dark blackish green colour, they are not quite as light and bright as the photos imply. But in terms of functionality they are as described. There were toiletries for our use in the bathroom. Communications with Torri were fine, both prior to our stay and on arrival and she was quick to respond to queries."
915272,51425398,2015-10-20,33912464,Jacqueline,"Torry was extremely easy to get in touch with via text and very helpful/willing to answer all my questions about the reservation and location of the apartment. This was my first Airbnb experience and it was awesome. The listing description is very accurate and the neighborhood is beautiful and charming. The apartment is in an old building, but it has the Boston charm I was looking for. I actually was dropped off in the wrong location by my taxi driver (my fault), and Torry very quickly helped me get to where I needed to be. This meant the world to me as I was in a city for the first time and had no idea where I was. Torry, thank you for facilitating one of the best trips I've ever had!"
915272,52308098,2015-10-28,30764986,Norm X Oli,The neighbourhood was quiet and charming and the location very convenient (we walked nearly everywhere) with a great breakfast place nearby. The studio was clean and sufficient for our purposes and the listing quite accurate. Bed was comfortable and the duvet kept us warm when it got colder at night. Picking up the key was simple and getting into and leaving her place didn't require any coordination at all.

She gave us good restaurant suggestions in the area and even left me a heavy winter coat because it was supposed to be very cold while we were there. The apartment is in an amazing location--so close to the Boston commons and the Park Street T stop. We could walk or take the T everywhere. Although the apartment is small, it was very well laid out and perfect for just 1 or 2 people. I would highly recommend staying at Torry's place!"

Their apartment is adorable,has great eclectic decorations,and comfortably fit three of us. We heard from others that the neighborhood might be kind of sketchy,but didn't have any issues ourselves. It's about a 1.5-2 mile walk to downtown Boston,or a quick ride on the T (the closest T stop was about a 5 minute walk away).,

We were happy and satisfied on all of these points. The apartment looks as good, or better, than the photos, is comfortable, with a small outside porch with chairs, and we loved the rooftop terrace where we drank coffee in the mornings."
The neighborhood,just off of Mass Ave. is in walking distance of so many restaurants and shops,and not as touristy as Newberry or Boylston Streets.  It is also close to a few places with live music.  It is central enough to get anywhere in Boston/Cambridge easily.,,,

The roof deck was lovely at night. The apt is a short walking distance to the charming historic South side, with its beautiful homes, flowers and neighborhood restaurants. I highly recommend Dan and Gina's home as a home way from home."

Boston is a compact city and Dan's home is centrally located which allowed me to walk to everything.  I appreciated and made use of Dan's recommendations for Boston dining.  Dan gave me all the space I needed and was available if I had any questions or concerns.  If you plan on visiting Boston I would strongly recommend staying at Dan's home."
4879702,86109633,2016-07-15,78815595,Denise,"My husband and I recently spent 3 nights at Dan and Gina’s place. This was our first experience with Airbnb and Dan did everything he could to make it a comfortable experience. We had a lot of questions and Dan was always quick to respond. In addition, we were given an extensive list of restaurants to try as well as hot spots to hit in the area. The apartment was within walking distance to the subway making it easy to travel around Boston. True to the pictures, the place was immaculately kept. Dan and Gina, thank you for opening your home to us. Anya, thank you for being so welcoming and for your great recommendations! Sincerely, Denise & Brett"

The apartment was very welcoming, and we felt right at home. Dan was available and willing to answer any questions. I would definitely plan another stay here."
7214920,38970367,2015-07-19,4182344,Kevin,"The best part was Dan's quick response. I made the reservation the morning of when we needed to check in and Dan made it work without a hitch. Also was very nice having a parking spot. I drove up from CT, just being able to park the car and Uber/walk/taxi everywhere for the weekend was great, and not paying/finding parking was nice. The apartment was in great condition, just as it is described. Nice quiet neighborhood, but close to everything you could want to do at the same time. Dan left instructions for where everything was, wifi information, etc. Would definitely stay here again."
7214920,42892539,2015-08-16,2027131,Susan,We had little time in the area but it looked like it would be a fun area to explore with lots of interesting restaurants. The nearby diner was a hoot.  Our host at the Airbnb wasn't there but left instructions on how to get in and info about the condo. The second bedroom was small and the mattress appeared to be an air mattress.
"The condo was clean and well appointed.\"",,,,,
7214920,48560126,2015-09-27,42597345,Marise,Dan was a great host. His space was clean and perfect for 4 girls looking to explore Boston. He left detailed instructions about the apartment and was helpful with all our requests. Well decorated too! Would recommend it to anyone.

Definitely a safe neighborhood. I would recommend Dans place to anyone I know. I would even stay here again if I'm back in Boston!"
7214920,54669373,2015-11-22,30878624,Maggie,Dan made us feel so welcome in his beautiful home. The place was super clean and the parking was really easy. We love the South End neighborhood - definitely recommend!!
7214920,70669934,2016-04-19,46110847,Rebecca,"Dan's apartment is just as described; comfortable, very clean and walking distance to Boston Common, Copley Square, Fanueil Hall, Fenway Park and provided a convenient base for participating in and watching this week's marathon. Dan's instructions for finding and then entering the apartment were clear and detailed and he quickly responded to any questions we had. The parking place is definitely a plus. We enjoyed having some living space to relax in and a kitchen to prepare a couple of meals. The queen bed in the first bedroom was super comfy, but our daughter found the twin in the second room had a pretty hard surface; still, not a deal-breaker. I would definitely recommend his home to anyone contemplating a visit to Boston. Thanks for a lovely stay Dan!"
7214920,74504152,2016-05-15,21983369,Liza,"Everything was great! The listing was accurate and South End is a great neighborhood to stay in when visiting Boston. Dan provided everything we needed, and he was extremely responsive to messages/e-mails. I would recommend staying here."

He was great with communication and was clear with his directions. The place is on the small side, but comfortable for 2-3 people (that pack light)."
7214920,92029301,2016-08-07,80724679,Cassie,Fantastic location!  Couldn't have asked for a better host than Dan.  He was very helpful and responsive.

The apartment was spacious, homely and clean and Dan provided all the amenities necessary for an overnight- clean sheets and towels, fresh soap, shampoo ect. It was greatly appreciated as as we were super rushed getting ready for the wedding! As a host, Dan was communicative, helpful and gracious. We couldn't have been happier with our experience would definitely book again during another jaunt up to Boston."

Marc was very accommodating in making us feel welcomed and provided recommendation on restaurants nearby.  We discovered a street of restaurants in a 15 minute walk.  Also, his house is right in front of the 64 bus route, so easy access to Cambridge on a 10 minute bus ride.  Overall, we had a great stay at Marc's place!"
9114896,55301897,2015-11-29,24168639,Karim,Marc's place was very neat and clean. Marc was available and helpful for anything we needed. The place matched the pictures and description exactly. I recommend this place. Having parking there was great as well ;)
9114896,57665846,2015-12-28,16907943,K,"Marc was a wonderful host! He was traveling while we were in town but made sure we had everything we needed and a way to contact him should we need to! The space is wonderful - cozy, clean, bright and airy! We had extra toiletries and pillows and blankets should need them as well.  We had no problem parking, and the house is close to I90 and Soldiers Field Road -- both of which can get you to where you need to go.  The 64 bus also runs right by the house in case we didn't want to drive in Boston.  Oak Square is close by and offers coffee, nail salons, delis, restaurants, bars, convenience stores, and a Y! Have bookmarked Marc's place and will definitely rent from him again!"
9114896,58745586,2016-01-04,6627483,Bruno,"Our experience at Marc's house was awesome. The place is very spacious, extremely clean and cozy. Marc and his wife are great and receptive hosts. We definitely recommend Marc's place."

9114896,61124200,2016-01-31,44630613,Tenzom,"Spent a weekend at Marc's place which was exactly as the photos portrayed it. The bed was comfy, the entire floor was really neat, the building was at a convenient location and it really helped that a parking spot was offered right outside the door. Marc was understanding enough to let us check out late in the afternoon. I would recommend this space to anyone visiting Boston."
9114896,63116780,2016-02-20,27666780,Donna,"I've just returned after spending 5 nights at Marc's place.

I would definitely recommend it!"
9114896,64010011,2016-02-28,19131422,Kiley,"Marc's place was exactly what I needed and just as described online. It was clean, quiet, and comfortable. The private access was nice, and it was convenient to have a parking space right next to the door. I would definitely recommend staying here!"

9114896,65280195,2016-03-12,33764753,Jessica,"Marc was a great host, very accommodating and easy going. We booked two nights, but when we told him we may need a third night, he was very flexible. He was very flexible about the check-out time too. Marc responded right away with any questions or help we may have needed. The apartment is the way it looks in the photos. It was comfortable and clean. Cleanliness is the most important thing for us.  Parking was in the driveway and getting around Boston was very easy. Marc was honest about not having a door at the top of the stairs, and warned us there would be construction noise on our last day because they were planning on having one installed for more privacy. We chose to stay anyway even though it seemed like we were in their basement while they lived upstairs. The rental will definitely seem more private once the door is installed, but for the two nights we were there, we didn't mind the curtain. I definitely recommend staying here. Thanks Marc!"
9114896,65904071,2016-03-17,62664593,Slavi,"The pictures describe exactly what you get and I couldn't be happier! Despite the slight confusing with locating the entrance and key, our stay here was good. I loved how much space there was on the floor and how quiet it was -- perfect for relaxing. Also really appreciated Marc's prompt responses when we had an issue with the internet. Truly a good place to stay and would highly recommend it!"
9114896,66272164,2016-03-20,62644518,Mariana,Marc was great! He was available when needed. The place was just as described. It was very clean!

The size for 3 people was perfect, and it also can equip for more! The home is right next to bus 64, and Marc also has a car spot behind the house, as well as free street parking for nonresidents! (Great perk when visiting the Boston area)"
9114896,69268039,2016-04-10,57874436,Megan,Marc was very courteous.  The space was very clean and comfortable.  A great place to go running - close to the bike path along the river.

9114896,73298394,2016-05-08,60118772,Dave,"My belated college graduation brought us back to Boston after many years away. Joined by my wife, Mom and Dad, we needed a place with simple breakfast amenities and 2 or 3 beds. Luckily, we found this beautiful downstairs apartment."
Marc our host was very prompt with answering our initial questions at booking and any other questions that cropped up as our 3-night stay approached. Self check-in was a breeze upon our late-evening arrival,and we ordered some pizza for delivery (We wish we'd told the delivery guy that he needn't be wary of walking down the driveway to the back entrance: with two automatic sensor security lights,and an automatic porch light,it was very safe and welcoming. But Marc took delivery at the front and saved our dinner!),,
The basic kitchenette had what was needed for a simple breakfast (microwave,toaster oven,fridge,Keurig and accessories). The beds (we used two,but had the option to also use the sofa bed) were comfortable and we all slept well.  Bath towels,face cloths were provided for each guest (and there were even some hotel travel soaps & hair products).
With WiFi and parking onsite,our stay was private and comfortable in the beautiful,quiet area of Brighton. Many restaurants and stores were only a short 10-minute walk away on Washington St.,and the bus stop was right outside the house on the corner. There were many good routes into downtown,including taking the nearby Mass turnpike (toll $1.25) right into the heart of the city.,
"The whole place was clean and just like the pictures. Lots of light and a cozy atmosphere. We hope to be back to Boston and stay here again sometime. Thanks!\"",,,,,

I left for 2 nights and returned and was able to leave some items at Marc's place. Made my quick trip to NH easier since I didn't have to bring everything with me."

We used a public transportation app that assisted in getting us right where we needed to be from Marc's unit and made getting around the city very easy.  Marc was probably the most responsive AirBNB host I've had and was accessible when needed and even worked with us on check out time.  I would stay again on future visits.

His instruction to enter the room was clear.  It was a big apartment (lots of space) and rooms were clean and it looked new.  He had 2 bed rooms and one large living room.  There is no kitchen and therefore, we used bathroom to wash fruits and cups.  It was very nice stay and I highly recommend Marc's place."

The accommodations were exactly as pictured in the listing, & it was a quiet, comfortable, safe place for us to return to each evening after exploring the beautiful city of Boston! Check in/out was a breeze, and Marc was so accommodating with our request for early check in/early check out time. The neighborhood felt safe, & the well-lit entrance put us at even more ease during our stay. Marc went above and beyond to even provide us with a map of nearby locations, & some extra Charlie (transit) cards. The house was steps from one of the bus routes which made getting into the city a breeze, and our Uber rides downtown were very inexpensive! Thank you so much for making our trip to Boston a great one!"

We were made to feel welcome but not overwhelmed. The room was private, clean and comfortable; the private bath (with hot tub) was outstanding.

Unfortunately though, this has been an unpleasant Airbnb experience for me.  When I was about to go to sleep, I discovered that the bed sheets were badly stained.  I was thus unable to sleep in the bed and left at the crack of dawn.  I texted Caroline to tell her that I will not be coming back to spend the second night as per my original booking.   She apologized for the discomfort it caused but I thought I should still mention it here as that is not acceptable for any accommodation, let alone one listed as \"\"luxurious\"\" !!!"
I was also not able to log on to the Wifi despite multiple efforts.  All in all,this was my very first bad Airbnb experience.,,,,

4510513,27599434,2015-03-08,10604183,James,"I had a great experience with my 7 night stay. The apartment is surprisingly roomy for a studio and was very well equipped. It was perfect for my needs, and was by far the best Airbnb I've stayed at in Boston."
4510513,28943829,2015-04-01,28291081,Emily,"An email was clear instructions was provided days in advance and a welcome folder made moving in very smooth. The apartment was as described and very comfortable. Overall, a great experience. The location is exceptional!"
4510513,29761188,2015-04-12,28588539,Jennifer,"Everything was nice and clean.  Getting access to the apt was very smooth.  Appreciated the welcome packet, snacks and coffee! Apt picture is accurate not a lot of room but enough for 2 people and great windows. Located right by the elevator but didn't notice.  If you are a light sleeper (unlike my husband), when the refrigerator ran it was noticeable given how close the bed is to the kitchen.  Nothing a pair of earplugs couldn't fix.  Great location to the T station for several different lines. Would stay again!"
4510513,30247470,2015-04-19,21815110,Cynthia,The studio is compact for one to two people. We did not spend much time in the apartment so it was OK.
The studio is located in downtown area with easy access to T station and major attractions.  Boston Common Park is within minute walk.  There are Macy's,CVS,food court,Starbucks close by.  It is very convenient to everything.,,
I enjoy my stay here and would absolutely recommend it.,,,,,

4510513,31656783,2015-05-08,20653124,Brett,There were no hitches. Everything in the  apartment was exactly as the description said. It was easy and painless.
4510513,32523765,2015-05-19,30688781,Vipada,The listing description was accurate. The room was amazing and comfortable. The location was also very convenient.
4510513,33007544,2015-05-24,32390239,Rachel,"The description of the unit was accurate. The place was clean and all details were as promised. I truly appreciated the complimentary snacks and they came in handy during my tours of Boston. The location was GREAT. Walking distance to two T-line stops, a block from Boston Common (near the start of the Freedom Trail) and near some good restaurants. The unit contained all the items one needed, to include pots and pans, etc. It is a studio apartment (limited square footage) but that was exactly what I wanted."
4510513,34734960,2015-06-11,2541822,Matt,"The Good: The apartment and location were wonderful. The place was clean, literally steps from Downtown Crossing. Adam was friendly and responsive with correspondence. The instructions were detailed and accurate, and I had a wonderful stay."
The Bad: There was a small sign with wifi login info on the table. The problem is the network did not exist. An email to Adam was replied to immediately,but needed to be passed on to bldg management to handle. They needed a day to fix. When I returned they had put a router in but left the dresser pulled out from the wall. The wifi stopped working 24 hrs later the night before I left.,,,,
Overall great place,technical hiccups and hurdles during my stay.,,,,

4510513,41652860,2015-08-08,35354331,Craig,"This was a very convenient location and the instructions and follow up were very thorough. The apartment was well equipped and very clean with some thoughtful additions such as snacks, water and a laundry card. Very close to two subway stations."
4510513,46434628,2015-09-10,38005319,Marc,Great place to stay. Location is epic. And the apartment was less expensive and more spacious than a hotel.
4510513,59230474,2016-01-08,51597234,Marita,Apartment was great. Very nice and so convenient to work.  Thanks Adam for making it super easy to rent.
4510513,66254595,2016-03-20,62177366,Douglas,"This apartment was a great place to stay in Boston. It was impeccably presented and is very modern, clean, and easy in all respects. The apartment is in a great location, with convenient food available a few steps away at Roche Bros. Even though it's centrally located, the apartment was extremely quiet too. All round, just a lovely place for a visit to Boston. Thanks!"
4510513,71404518,2016-04-25,46631515,Jonathan,"I never met Adam, but he was extremely clear and succinct in all his communication with me. The apartment we stayed in was spacious, quiet, and extremely clean. On top of that the location was incredible. Overall it was one of the best AirBNB experiences I've ever had."
4510513,72219206,2016-05-01,32353214,Beka,"Clean, functional, very nice apartment in a great location. Check in is a breeze and the stay was fantastic!"
4510513,73077294,2016-05-06,62033387,David,"This apartment is perfect. Optimally located across from down town crossing station, park street station, Boston Common and a late night grocer, the location couldn't be more convenient."
The apartment itself us well equipped and spacious,with kitchen and laundry services. Internet is of good speed.,,,,
As a host,Adam is excellent; he's readily contactable and responsive to questions. The welcome snacks were a very kind gesture.,,,,
The only negatives:,,,,,
1. Internet dropped out twice during my 5 day stay,but Adam was very quick to resolve this and provide an alternative solution while this was being fixed.,,,,
2. Laundry card has a minimum credit deposit of $20,which seems odd,given that a single load costs $2.75,,,
Overall a fantastic experience,"which I would highly recommend and do again. \"",,,,
4510513,76146206,2016-05-25,60867865,Volodymyr,"The studio is great: quiet and cozy, recently renovated and well equipped. The location is great: right in the city center next to many cafes and shops, 1 min to T and 5 min to a nice park. The concierge is amazing: she was very welcoming and helpful, and she accommodated every request we had. One possible improvement is to add a work desk to the room."
4510513,76953050,2016-05-30,5839625,Olaf,The appartment was as described. Location was perfect. A/c was not working properly - it was too hot in the appartment.
Communication was poor and slow.,,,,,
It is a commercial company and not a privat condo.,,,,,
I would rather not book it again.,,,,,

The apartment was exactly as listed , clean and comfortable and has everything you could ask for. The location is perfect and central to shopping, grocery and subway and Boston Common. Thanks to Adam, I am sold on Airbnb and have already booked other trips!"
5606682,32865552,2015-05-22,33593481,Jenny,Andy is wonderful. The location is golden - the T is right in front of the house. The apartment is very well-kept and clean. The rooms are neat and there is AC available. The kitchen has the necessary items to cook. He was very helpful in terms of providing utilities - we were able to use the hairdryer (provided by Andy) and needles (upon request). The bathroom is small but neat. This is an excellent choice for families traveling for a little while in Boston.
5606682,34300969,2015-06-07,4224077,Perihan,"The place was nice and clean. Andy was very responsive and friendly. Parking was not easy around the house though. And the apartment is in the basement, I could hear neighbours above walking around, which was sometimes not nice. But overall, my experience was great. And the rooms look exactly like the pictures."
5606682,34722691,2015-06-11,33251135,Debin,Positive:
The room is big and clean as the photo shows. The bed is very comfortable and big. Andy kindly provides clean towel and water for us.,,,,,
Negative:,,,,,
It's a basement. So it's lack of sunshine.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
5606682,35088610,2015-06-15,5503380,Kathy,"First the positives:  The location is fabulous – close to the train and close to Brookline (you can walk to restaurants, bars, stores, etc.).  There’s a lovely reservoir just down the street which made for very nice early morning walks.  The apartment has been recently renovated – it’s freshly painted, the furniture and kitchen appliances seem new, and the beds are very comfortable (with very nice bedding and fluffy towels).  The bedrooms are air-conditioned, which is a big plus since you can’t open the windows.  There is parking available on site at a charge of $15/night – we were given one of two garages, which worked for us (although I will say it was a tight squeeze for our Ford Fusion; if you have a larger car, you might want to request a different parking spot).  And finally, Andy is a friendly host – he lives in the same building, and he was quick to respond when we had questions (such as the password for the Internet access)."
Now the negatives:  This is a basement apartment,which means there’s not much sunlight.  That wasn’t a big deal (and it was made clear in the listing).  What was a bigger deal was the lack of a living room.  The apartment has two decent-sized bedrooms,a small kitchen (more on that in a minute),and a tiny bathroom.  But there is no living room.  That means the only places to sit at the end of the day were the kitchen table (which has two wooden chairs) and the bedrooms.  And finally,the kitchen isn’t really a kitchen – there is no oven,and the “stove” is really a hotplate.  There is a full-sized refrigerator (the ice-maker wasn’t working
Overall,we enjoyed our stay – the apartment was a 5-minute walk to our son’s place,which made the visit very easy.  If you’re looking for a convenient place to stay in Brighton (or near Brookline) – and you don’t mind the lack of a living room – Andy’s place is a good choice at a reasonable price.,,,

5606682,35270513,2015-06-16,20628255,Luke,Andy was a great host and accommodated my parents busy schedule who were traveling to Boston to help move me into my new apartment.  The apartment was very clean and Andy's father helped to straighten out my parents parking situation since our van couldn't fit in the garage (parking space).  Thanks Andy!
5606682,36954986,2015-07-03,32137595,Angela,Andy was very helpful and always available. He provided us with high chairs and other items for our children. The area is nice with a nearby pond and playground. Very easy connection to Boston university areas and city centre.
5606682,38169091,2015-07-13,27727287,Bettina,"We did not met Andy personally, but the descripiton of finding the key was perfekt. The bathroom and the Toilette were not as clean as we expected. We heard other People walk around above. Thanks Andy"
5606682,42253533,2015-08-12,30268234,Cindy,"我和朋友带孩子在Andy的房子住了整整一个月。房间崭新整洁。床很舒适,床品质量也很好。最让我们开心的是厨具餐具一应齐全,和家里并无太大区别,我们几乎每天都自己做饭吃。房子地点极佳,步行一分钟即可到绿线,四通八达。步行十分钟可到wholefood,我们食品几乎全从那里采购。Andy和家人住在楼上,一家人有知识有品味有善心。特别美好的一个夏天!"
5606682,43482600,2015-08-20,29243977,Evelyn,"The place was clean, comfortable and easy to access.  Did not have a tv but when I mentioned no tv the next day one was put in.  Host was easy and fast to contact and any requests were taken care of right away.  Would recommend to family and friends .  Really enjoyed our experience"

5606682,45464383,2015-09-03,33684457,Jeffrey,"This was our first airbnb experience, and it worked well for us for a number of reasons. We were in Boston to help our college student son move into a house in Allston, so our occupancy number of people and days was a little variable. Andy was accommodating which was really nice. The location was excellent for us, convenient to our son's new neighborhood,  restaurants, stores, UHaul, you name it. Andy's parents greeted us and made us feel welcome, including offering safe, garage parking for our minivan which would remain full of musical instruments and equipment for two days. The garage is small (!) but reasonable as city parking goes. We never did meet Andy as our schedules just didn't mesh, but he and his parents made it clear they were there to assist."
The apartment is clean and fresh,lots of closet space,good bed linens,soaps,shampoos,hair dryer
5606682,46506869,2015-09-11,101929,Nathaniel,Andy was very accommodating and nice.  There were some minor snags with AC but he did his best to fix the issue and provide us with a nice stay.

"Tara\"",,,,,
5606682,65618434,2016-03-15,7262694,Rose,"Andy is a welcoming and enthusiastic host!  This is a freshly remodeled daylight basement apartment.  It was clean and efficient with pretty large bedrooms for a city apartment.  Our daughter and her husband said it was a lot nicer than the dungeon their friend lives in just down the street, and I have to say, it felt very efficient and clean.  The only seating in the common area is the dining room table, so if you want to watch TV, you're at the table.  There's great storage for your things in the hall closet and in the bedroom closet."
Parking is a real trick,but once you find a place you can go everywhere on the train if you like.  If you can't find parking,Andy can rent you his garage for less than city pricing.,,,
This was a great taste of city life in an awesome neighborhood in one of the last historic houses on the street.  Great walking and nearby coffee shops and dining.  If you want to check out BU,this is a great location,"and the reservoir is a scenic place to walk.  We recommend getting a Charlie Card straight away for city excursions.  You can get one at the nearby Seven Eleven.\"",,,
5606682,66005728,2016-03-18,1619247,Sara,"Andy was a very attentive host and our arrival went smoothly. The apartment is as described and has plenty of space for a big group. It is worth noting that this is a basement apartment, so not a lot of natural light, but not an issue if you are going to be out and about."
We had a car and did not find it too hard to get a street spot nearby,but it is nice to have the option to park in the driveway for an extra nightly fee.,,,,
"Thanks again for hosting us!\"",,,,,
5606682,67877205,2016-04-01,290580,Emily,Thank you for hosting our colleagues. Good communication.
5606682,69303078,2016-04-10,11375171,Adam,Andy made us feel welcome and the listing was as described. There's not much in the immediate area but there's some nice bars/restaurants within walking distance. Andy has a nice place and we enjoyed staying there.
5606682,69985346,2016-04-15,32531664,Mark,We had a great time in Boston using Andy's place to explore Boston area colleges. We walked to Boston College (about 20 minutes) and took light rail into the city for dinner. Andy was very nice and even loaned by son a book on video games after a conversation about the PaxEast conference during booking. The neighborhood is great with obviously a lot of college students and plenty of food and shopping options within walking distance.
5606682,70627273,2016-04-19,12080792,Kelly,"Andy was very clear in his communication with us before and during our stay with him.  He made check in very easy and smooth despite some changes in our original arrival time we had discussed.  He was very personable and a joy to work with.  The location is great, very easy to get to various parts of the city and walking distance from many shops/restaurants/convenience stores."
5606682,70853411,2016-04-21,60969887,Pamela,"My sister and I had a very pleasant stay in Andy's apartment.  My nieces (age 11, and 14) loved how comfortable the beds were and didn't want to leave in the mornings to explore Boston.  The apartment was exactly as described.  Although the apartment is in the basement, we found it well lit and bright with the morning sun.  Everything we needed was provided including a hair drier.  The shower was perfect and had plenty of hot water after long days of exploring the city.  The location for us was the key as we were visiting my daughter who is attending graduate school close by.   There was a Thai restaurant across the street that was excellent, and a cafe just a block away with a great selection of foods, coffee, and tea.  Andy was unable to meet with us during our stay, but we were greeted by his friend and were lucky enough to know the area and get around without any assistance.   I would stay at this apartment again and noticed there was parking available if needed.  For this trip our family only used the train for travel, but driving to this location seems like it would be pretty easy.  (This is from someone who lives in a small state and doesn't do BIG city driving.) Thank you Andy and I hope to pick up that piece of origami on my next visit to Boston!"
5606682,73347706,2016-05-08,13707363,Steve,"Hi,  We were happy."
5606682,75608894,2016-05-22,54263634,Scott,I had a great time in Boston staying in Andy's apartment. The apartment has everything you need for a weekend trip and is conveniently located right by the T. I highly recommend for anyone going to Boston.

I arrived slightly earlier than I had expected, but his lovely mother was there to let me and my family in and give me the keys. It's a nice, little half-basement unit, two bedrooms and kitchen, everything very clean and comfortable. Would definitely recommend!"
5606682,79874567,2016-06-14,4412818,Leigh,"Andy was always very accommodating from the start. The apartment was just right for what we needed. Even though it was a basement, there was plenty of space and good storage. There isn't a lounge area, however, the kitchen has tables and chairs.  The location is great as it's so close to the Tram stop and close to shops, cafe and the reservoir."
"We needed some extra things such as a food mixer and Andy was happy to supply this. He was also happy to supply my mother with clean bed linen as she had the place for 7 days prior to the rest of the family arriving and taking over the place from her.\"",,,,,
5606682,80279848,2016-06-17,38287229,Alfredo,We were very well received by Andy! He promptly managed all our requests. The pictures correspond to the place and it is extremely well localized. We enjoyed our stay.

A fun place to stay and convenient to get around on public transportation.  Andy was a great host.  We recommend his place to future customers."
5606682,83343906,2016-07-02,45571636,Hua-Chen,I had a great time in  Andy's place. The facility he provided was really nice. A very quiet neighborhood. I will be back next time.
5606682,84542194,2016-07-07,47179685,Sarah,"Andy was very welcoming and the apartment is in a great area. Only seconds away from the B line into Boston, and a short walk from the C and D lines for a slightly faster journey, and loads of bars and restaurants within a short distance. There was a supermarket only about 15-20 minutes walk away as well. The apartment is well-equipped and the air conditioning was very welcome in the heat!"
We did have a couple of issues that made our stay a little less comfortable. We weren't able to check in until quite late,which could have been a real issue if we had only just arrived in Boston. Andy was incredibly apologetic about this,however,and really worked hard to compensate for this issue. He explained the reasoning and it certainly seems that it couldn't have been avoided in this instance,but I thought it worth mentioning. One other problem was not having enough notice to leave the apartment for maintenance work to be carried out. Again,Andy was very apologetic
Honestly,these issues were minor and Andy worked hard to make up for them. We still enjoyed our stay,but it was perhaps just not as relaxing as we might have hoped. The apartment itself is great; it's a brilliant base from which to explore Boston,Brookline,Allston and Brighton,"there is tons of space and loads of closet room. The location is fantastic and I imagine we were just booked over an awkward few days! \""
5606682,90162549,2016-07-31,61090869,Anders,Andy was a great host. Very flexible with the pick up and drop off of the key. When we needed supplies we had them the next day.
5606682,92082907,2016-08-07,73880818,Justin,"Andy was a great host and was very welcoming to my group. Check-in and check-out was very flexible and smooth. He provided everything we needed (although most of it we ended up not needing to use), and we had a good time. The outlets seemed to shut off at night (maybe linked to the room light?), which made it hard to charge phones at night. The Wi-Fi was also a little spotty at times. There was a small stint with one of the keys he gave us not working to get into our room (and it was around midnight), but Andy came over, gave us a working set of keys, and was very apologetic. He was also very accommodating when one member in my group accidentally left the keys inside (locking us out), and Andy was able to provide us with a spare set. Overall, we had a good experience and I would recommend it to others looking for a place to stay in Boston!"
5606682,92885922,2016-08-10,30724885,Brian,"\"Andy's a super responsive host - he answers you in minutes or seconds, so if there's anything you need - he's on it! We had three in our party so we needed extra towels and he brought them very quickly and was super attentive to our texts. I've stayed in a lot of places, but no place I've every been has been as conveniently located as Andy's place. It's literally less than a minute to the \"\"T\"\". For a business or leisure traveler"

5606682,94839784,2016-08-17,13077614,Jenny,"While we were surprised to find that this was a basement apartment and that it didn't have a living room, we found the location to be perfect for us and we were impressed with how incredibly clean this apartment was. Beds were very comfortable and the a/c was amazing and much needed during our heatwave visit. If you have a medium to small sized car you should pay for parking in the garage space. Our average sized SUV was too large so we found street parking nearby. Gracious host. We would consider renting here again because of location (around the corner from our daughter's apartment)."
5606682,98016367,2016-08-29,76965596,Jaime,Andy was very good at welcoming us to the apartment and showing us where everything was. If we ever needed anything he was only one phone call or text message away.

I used the gym during my stay (it is big and has everything!) and also did work in the common area. Herbie's apartment was immaculate and pristine. Everything was in perfect order. The view of softball fields, basketball courts, and soccer games below is so nice to take in. I walked to Harvard Square which was really nice. And I took an Uber from Herbie's apartment to Boston Common (which was super easy). In short, great host, great apartment, and I plan to stay again when I visit in the future!"

The building is amazing, his unit is very clean, there is even a washer and dryer in his apartment which I used. The place is even nicer than advertised. The location is phenomenal - steps away from Harvard and a short Uber ride to the best spots in Boston. Herbie was responsive to me before and during the stay, and I'm grateful! I absolutely recommend his place if you're visiting Boston/Cambridge!"

7449448,44671857,2015-08-28,35503838,Stefanie,"Frederique was an amazing host. Great communication and very accommodating - the only thing I regret is that we didn't get a chance to meet in person. This was my first airbnb experience and my host was very patient during the reservation process (as I made some mistakes). Frederique checked in often to be sure that I had everything I needed, accessed the room ok, etc. The room was simple, no frills - and it was exactly what I needed. Great dresser and place to hang my things. The bathroom was very clean and there were some special touches to make it nice. I selected this airbnb for it's location, which was very convenient for me and it did not disappoint. Easy access to the room and the other tenants were pleasant. I felt very safe and sound - a home away from home. I was in and out due to work demands and wished I could have stayed longer. I would definitely stay again!"
7449448,73207556,2016-05-07,54807119,Lyndon,"Dimitry was very friendly and offered to pick me up for a small fee. The house was nice and so was the room. The bathroom was always clean which I appreciated, and there is a laundry room as well. Internet was fast. The neighborhood did not have many major shops around, but public transportation was very accessible (take the 21 or 31 bus at Harvard St to Forest Hills, or the 28/29 to Ruggles). Thanks Dimitry for being a great host. Highly recommended!"
7449448,74855168,2016-05-17,59548596,Sean,"This place was clean, low key, with a nice breeze coming in from the B room. The keyless entry was convenient.. and Frederique the host was easy going with a good welcoming conversation. I need a copy of his book too. For the price... I definitely recommend this place."
7449448,77533090,2016-06-01,23272719,Nisarg,"I had a nice stay at Frederique's place. The room is as described and shown in the listing. It was very easy to communicate with Frederique. He also gave me a ride from my hotel to his place and showed me near by stops to catch a bus/subway. The only issue was the location as it is a bit far from the Boston downtown and no nearby T (subway) stops. However, there is a bus stop nearby to catch a direct bus to Ashmont/Forest Hills T stops."
7449448,78497434,2016-06-07,37345567,Manfred,"Frederique Appartement ist etwas abgelegen, man muss umsteigen und etwas laufen - das sollte man bei der Planung der Boston-Reise berücksichtigen. Die guten Seiten: Eine interessante Umgebung, um mal eine andere Seite der USA kennenzulernen. Ein sehr günstiger Preis und eine ruhige Umgebung (außer Sonntag morgen wg. Kirchen). Den Gastgeber habe ich leider nicht kennen gelernt - ich war viel unterwegs..."
7449448,80055646,2016-06-15,12128139,Tom,"I felt welcomed by clear communication before I arrived on the code to get in, which room, and who I could contact if I needed anything (which I didn't). The room was as described (clean, comfortable bed, and a good-sized room for one), as was the neighborhood (quiet, nice neighbors, and a 5-10 minute bus ride to the Forest Hills Orange Line station). Thank you for an affordable place to stay for a week."
7449448,84752833,2016-07-09,40461115,Sem,Good experience. The house was Clean and quiet.

The house is as described,and there is also a train 5 minutes walking from there that leaves you in the heart lf the city in a moment.,,,,
"Good choice\"",,,,,

7449448,91262821,2016-08-04,25264396,Harshul,"Frederique was a very nice  host, although i could not meet him, but he was always available to answer my questions. He was  very patient with my tons of questions. He arranged the arrival very well. The place was really nice.  The room was a small and lovely room. It is a shared apartment with other people. The living room had pretty furniture and also a TV. The place also had washing machine, although i did not use them. I met one girl she was also very friendly. The place was very clean. The buses and trains are nearby. Overall it was a very nice experience"
7449448,92037427,2016-08-07,38818208,Antonio,Very comfortable place to stay and the host Frederique made me feel very welcomed
9974833,70782688,2016-04-20,38018301,Elizabeth,"The description was very accurate, location was perfect for getting around Boston.  Our host was very helpful getting us the key and answering questions."

"\"",,,,,
3606396,16282725,2014-07-24,18312764,Nicholas,"This was the perfect place for our two day quick visit. It was easily accessible by public transportation in an up and coming neighborhood with lots of restaurants. Hassan was an accommodating host, though we did not get to meet him. For a great slice of pizza, check out Fast Eddie's right across the street."
3606396,16435318,2014-07-27,17939303,Megan,Hassan was very accomadating and was ready and eager to help with any issues. The neighborhood was nice and was just a step out to public transportation.

5478135,70677831,2016-04-19,55587034,Michelle,Our group of 4 had a fantastic trip to Boston! Elizabeth was an excellent host. She communicated with us prior to and during our trip and was flexible with our schedule. The property is absolutely beautiful and the location is perfect. The property has two bedrooms and one bath. The beds were very comfortable and the shower provided hot water for all four of us each morning. The house is right near the airport and the water. The view was amazing!
"The proximity to Boston is a huge plus! We walked about three blocks to get to the train called the \"\"T\"\" (the Blue Line",Orient Heights station). It was a ~15 minute ride into the city. We used the trains all weekend and had no issues getting around. The Blue Line also connects to the airport and to Revere Beach! It was very convenient!,,,,
"I can not recommend this property enough! It was absolutely perfect and I am so thankful to Elizabeth for opening her home to us!\"",,,,,
5478135,72899544,2016-05-05,69520654,Kasey,"I was so relieved to come across this property (and Elizabeth herself!) as I made last-minute arrangements to fly in from the west coast for a family member's funeral in Winthrop. From the get-go, everything worked smoothly. She was quick to confirm my request and was very communicative with me in the days before my arrival, helping to ease some of my concerns about travel logistics. Though my flight arrived late at night, she arranged a Lyft pickup from the airport (which is  only about 5-10 mins away) for me and offered to help me get to anywhere else I needed to go throughout my stay. She also arranged to have my mother picked up from the airport, who arrived the next day, which I felt was really generous."
The house itself is an absolutely beautiful,classic East Boston home that was stocked with everything one could need. There were sweet little touches like fresh cut flowers and little candies in each of the bedrooms. Elizabeth's welcoming,accommodating way really helped make it feel like I was staying with family. Next time I need to stay somewhere in Boston,"hers is the first place I'll think of!\"",,
5478135,74623128,2016-05-16,42710478,Jennifer,"Great place! Elizabeth made sure I had everything I needed. Her house feels like home. Loved it, thanks!!"
5478135,77749580,2016-06-03,72605439,Julius,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5478135,77807092,2016-06-03,22442569,Elisabeth,Elizabeth was a very good Host. Very helpful.
The house and the location are very good. Quite,relaxing,safe,very close to Boston downtown.,,
"We enjoyed our stay and definitely recommend this house.\"",,,,,
5478135,80140168,2016-06-16,76646881,Bill,"Our host kind, caring and especially generous to accept our request at short notice. The home is well laid out with two large bedrooms and is close to the train and restaurants. We also like the proximity to the water, train and to Logan Airport as we were working there."
5478135,80977059,2016-06-20,74829657,Shelby,Elizabeth was an incredible hostess! Her home was perfect for a father daughter trip and she gave us an amazing recommendation on dinner when we got there. Thanks Elizabeth for helping make our trip perfect!
5478135,82854511,2016-06-29,59549982,Joanne,We spent 8 nights at Elizabeth's gorgeous home.  We received such a warm welcome when we arrived and were made to feel completely at home for the duration of our stay.
The front porch was great for an afternoon glass of wine while soaking up the view and enjoying the feel of the quiet and friendly neighbourhood.,,,,,
Great location,"great house and great people!  Highly recommend.  \"",,,,
5478135,84153109,2016-07-05,69541675,Nancy E,I hesitate to write this wonderful review - about one of Boston's best kept secrets (East Boston). Elizabeth's place is beautiful and very comfortable. As a host she was warm accommodating and even left us snacks.
"The setting of the neighborhood is quiet right almost on the water and very close to the airport.  Wonderful coffee shop close by and some great places to eat.  Also very close to the T (subway) and all Boston has to offer. Loved it - would stay again in a heartbeat!\"",,,,,
5478135,86086735,2016-07-14,72702349,Urmesh,This is a wonderful place that met all of our needs.  And Elizabeth went out of her way to ensure we had a great trip.
5478135,86279699,2016-07-15,2631519,Chad,"\"Even though we were only staying here for a night during a layover, I would definitely consider this spot for a longer stay. It was a very nice renovation in an older building with plenty of space and a modern, well-equipped kitchen. We personally really liked the neighborhood; yes, it is directly across the water from Logan airport. But you'd be surprised how relatively quiet it is, and the noise from the planes was really not an issue. East Boston/Winthrop is a slice of the \"\"real\"\" Boston"
5478135,87653782,2016-07-21,77617710,Katie,"Woneedful host! Thoughtful, helpful, friendly. Picked us up at the airport."
5478135,88105097,2016-07-23,52684729,Brandon,We had a fantastic time staying at Elizabeth's place and it was just as she described it. The place has a very unique feel -- historic and eclectic on the outside but very modern feel on the inside. The kitchen is completely redone with granite counters and new cabinets.
Elizabeth left some snacks and coffee pods out for us,and we enjoyed sitting out on the little patio drinking our coffee in the morning. There is also a cool little coffee shop within walking distance called Adriana's. Good for a morning walk or a quick stop on your way into the city.,,,,
The area has a good feel to it. It's close to the airport,but also has a cool view of the ocean. We rented a car and were able to find a parking spot out front both nights,so we had no issues getting into town.,,,
"Would definitely recommend it if you're looking for something in that area of Boston. \"",,,,,
5478135,90003066,2016-07-30,4318308,Evelyn,"We loved the apartment, is is very tastefully furnished, has easy access to the airport, pubic transport AND beaches. The neighborhood was super safe and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. And there is a super delicious cafe in walking distance!"
5478135,91031604,2016-08-03,78472348,Stephen,Elizabeth was very welcoming and collected us from the airport.  The apartment was very well equipped and nice and clean.  The area felt safe and was convenient for public transport.
5478135,92916975,2016-08-10,15260108,Eleanor,"Elizabeth met us on arrival at the airport & is so friendly. Nothing was too much trouble & we all had a fantastic holiday. Loved the house, great location with only some slight noise from the airport. We'd definitely go back and Elizabeth sorted us out as I had mixed up our leaving dates. Thank you so much. x"
5478135,94641731,2016-08-16,84512206,Nick,This is the first time we've used AirBnb and it was a Great choice over a Hotel!! Elizabeth is a Gracious Host who thought of Everything right down to leaving several charging cords out in case you forgot to bring your own! There were towels and hair dryers left in each room and she even had milk and bottled water in the fridge for us!! plus she left Ice cream in the freezer!!
The house is absolutely Beautiful!! It was redone about 10 yrs ago but you would think it was more recent as everything looks New!! The location is great only 2 blocks from the metro station which we used everyday! Definitely better than driving! $5 to park there at the Metro you get into the Aquarium in about 10 mins and if you buy the all day pass you can ride to any place you need,Sam Adams tour,Prudential Building,MIT,Boston Harbor and the Aquarium!,
We will definitely stay here again. Elizabeth and her Aunt were available for anything we needed.,,,,,
The neighborhood is great and with so many police officers living in the area there's no worries of safety for yourself or your vehicle! The only thing I would let people know is that the house is right across the bay from Logan and there's a lot of plane traffic. you would think it would bother you but after just a few hrs we hardly noticed!,,,,,
Overall this was a Great place and will definitely stay here again!,,,,,
"Elizabeth Thank you so much for everything we had a great time Discovering your amazing city! Also glad we both kept our word on Not Talking Football!! LOL \"",,,,,
6015021,32596297,2015-05-19,31796394,Zoey,"I booked the apartment for my friends who visited Boston for a week. The apartment is exactly as the pictures shown. Kara is nice, she replies promptly and does whatever she can to accomondate my friends' request. The location is convenient. My friends are very satisfied and will stay at Kara's next time."
6015021,86211373,2016-07-15,27541426,Ronny,"The apartment was in a great location, basically two streets away from Fenway park and with many restaurants and a Target nearby. The apartment itself was very clean and spacious, and better than shown on the pictures. It is also in a luxury residence building with 24h concierge, and safety was not an issue at all. However, we did have a problem with communication and customer service. We had informed the hosts that we would have three people and needed to use the living room sofa bed, and while extra sheets were provided, there was no blanket/comforter. I was initially not too concerned and sent the host a message, but we did not receive the requested blanket until 3 days later. I expected better service at this price. I would recommend the apartment based on its location and cleanliness, but would have reservations about additional customer services."
1373520,7386001,2013-09-17,6512363,Christine,"Only spent one night here, but would have loved to stay longer! The apartment was beautiful with a very sweet cat, a very comfortable bed, and in a very nice building. And there's free parking on a side street nearby, which was a treat. I didn't get to meet Alisa, but her fiance, Casey, was a gracious host-- he stuck around to let us into the building, offered us beer, and helped us guide our confused cab driver when we got lost on our way back to the apartment! All around great stay!"
1373520,7662487,2013-09-28,1699064,Meredith,"Nice apartment and very friendly hosts! They have a curious and sweet cat, and also offered us beer!"
The space has high ceilings and comfortable furniture,and the private room was fine for our two night stay. The bathroom could have used a wipe-down,"but we were last minute guests and Alisa and Casey were very accommodating. \"",,,
1373520,7955995,2013-10-09,9216708,Alex,"Great place, much larger than the photos suggest."
Awesome location with very quick access to downtown Boston and surrounding boroughs without being stuck in the bustle and confusing maze of streets of the downtown core,,,,,
much thanks Alisa and Casey,"great hosts\"",,,,
1373520,10670319,2014-03-02,12346252,Symphony,Had a great stay with Alisa ... Close to public transport .. The room was clean and comfortable.. She and her husband made me feel right at home .. And I love their cat Data
1373520,11383980,2014-03-31,13504132,Jessy,Had a great stay in a spacious room with great hosts. Would recommend .
1373520,18911205,2014-09-02,19280510,Flurin,"I haven't seen Alisa and Kacey until the last night, but when they came home from a trip they were so nice and made me feel even more comfortable. Before that we have been texting to organize everything and Alisa always answered very fast."
The apartment looks better and taller in reality than on the pictures! It is situated only a short walk away from Jackson Square Station (Orange Line) that brings you directly to the city. From my experience (first time to Boston) it is generally worth checking your possible way to work/school because it can take you some time to travel to certain points in Boston with public transportation.,,,,,
Although I only saw Alisa and Kacey once,"I am sure that they are truly great and uncomplicated hosts!\"",,,,
1373520,19165403,2014-09-07,18499005,Karen,"Alisa and Kasey were wonderful hosts.  They did not give me a key, but they made extra effort to stay in touch with me and to be home whenever I needed to get into the apartment.  The room is very comfortable, and bigger than it looks in the photo.  Their apartment is a beautiful loft conversion in a neighborhood that looked a little rough around the edges to me at first, but was perfectly fine.  I was visiting my daughter at Northeastern, and this was a great location."
1373520,19387522,2014-09-11,4466385,Chahine,"The hosts (Alisa and kasey) were very nice to welcome us at night (very late, sorry) and gave us some advices and tips to visit the city."
1373520,19728782,2014-09-17,13977967,Gemma,We had a fantastic stay with Alisa & Kacey!
They have a really lovely apartment,the room was very large,and we found the bed very comfortable,and it was very helpful to have a desk.,,
The bathroom was always clean,and we cooked in their kitchen once or twice,which could not have been more well equipped!,,,
The location was great! Less than 5mins walk to the orange line train,and we always found the neighbourhood felt really safe,even when we got home late at night.,,,
And they were kind enough to lend us the key to the laundry room,which was very reasonably priced.,,,,
Our favourite part of the stay was definitely their lovely cat though :),,,,,
The only thing we found not ideal is that you don't get a key to the apartment/building,generally Alisa or Kacey will be home to let you and in and that's not a problem. The only time we had an issue was when they were out for the night,and we wanted to just go down the street for dinner,but if we left the apartment we would've have had a key to be able to get back in until they got home late.,,
But we had a really awesome stay,"I would definitely recommend :)\"",,,,
1373520,20025535,2014-09-22,20181033,Jason,Great hosts who are fun and engaging! The room is definitely bigger than advertised (at least per the photo).
1373520,20610664,2014-10-02,13794554,Mark,"The space was as described, though the photo of the room makes it look a bit smaller than it really was. It was spacious and comfortable, and the desk and workspace were very convenient. Alisa and her husband Kacey were friendly and welcoming, and made the stay very comfortable. As other comments noted, the only potential inconvenience is the lack of an individual key, though Kacey and/or Alisa were always around to let me in (they both work from home, and were easy to catch up with by text or message)."
The location is quite nice: 5 mins from the T orange line,35-40 mins via the T to Logan airport and just 15-20 mins on the T to downtown. The neighborhood immediately around the apartments has fairly few easily-accessible amenities,but this was not an issue for me as I usually ate dinner before coming back for the night.,,,
Would certainly recommend to others.,,,,,
Warm,"comfortable and inviting.\"",,,,
1373520,20980502,2014-10-08,21088277,Marius,"We stayed with Alisa and her husband for two nights. The room we had offered lots of space and everything was clean. We didn't get a key, but that wasn't a problem since someone was almost always home or managed to get home to open the doors for us. Alisa was so kind to let us put our luggage already in the room when we arrived in Boston early morning and we could leave it in the room until the evening we left, which was perfect!"
1373520,22516362,2014-11-08,22654588,Hiroki,It was my very first airbnb experience and I loved it.
They kindly accepted our sudden request,and I really appreciate it.,,,,
They welcomed us very friendly.,,,,,
Their room was very nice and everything was great.,,,,,
I wish I could have a little more time to hang out with them.,,,,,
"Thank you so much!!!\"",,,,,
1373520,22931791,2014-11-17,23467326,Jake,"Our stay with Alisa was fantastic. The room is much bigger than it looks on the web page, and the apartment itself is great. My girlfriend and I were out most of the day and only stopped back to pick up a few things once or twice a day, and Alisa was very accommodating. She gave us a key on days that she and her husband would not be home during the day which was very helpful. The apartment is very close to the T which makes everything in Boston accessible. I would recommend this listing to anybody. Affordable and convenient!"
1373520,23620075,2014-12-06,19400913,Rebecca,Beautiful apartment. Beautiful room. Alisa and her husband were great hosts!
1373520,23929778,2014-12-14,23026585,Thomas,"Wunderschönes Apartment, super nette Gastgeber! Wir hatten eine klasse Zeit bei Alisa und ihrem Mann. Das Zimmer bietet alles was man sich wünscht. Alles ist sehr gut gepflegt. Die Gastgeber waren sehr warmherzig und man fühlte sich von Anfang an wie zuhause. Die Wohnung ist definitiv weiterzuempfehlen."
1373520,25488281,2015-01-17,22546682,Deborah,"Alisa and Kacey were wonderful hosts and they have a lovely home.  The room was pretty much how it looks in the pictures though I would agree it's a little bigger than it seems online.  The building is nice and newish with elevators, their apartment has a fully equipped kitchen and a good sized bathroom with tub/shower with decent water pressure.  All of the basics you need for a short stay, including wi-fi, were supplied including towels and plenty of bed linens."
We had a car so I can't speak to the walkability of the neighborhood,however it was close enough of a drive to the Brigham Circle area we needed to get to that it was super convenient.  There was free street parking near the building,just not right outside.,,,
Their cat was also a good host!  He kept an eye on us,but never bothered or got in the way.  I have a slight cat allergy which didn't affect me even after I gave him a few pets,which was nice.,,,
The only downside I can mention is that the building is right across from the train line so it is noisy when one comes in,particularly at night.  After a while you tend to get used to it,"however it can be jarring if you like to go to bed early and startle easily.  So pack earplugs if you are noise sensitive otherwise I would definitely recommend this as an Airbnb stay if you're looking for a place in Boston.\"",,,
1373520,26012707,2015-02-01,25311900,Colin,"Alisa and her husband were very inviting and friendly hosts. I immediately felt welcome. The room is easy walking distance from the T. The room it self was way larger than the picture makes it appear. The apartment and room were very clean and cozy which was great since there were 2 feet of snow on the ground. Also, the bathroom was very large and very clean. Data, their cat, also added to a great experience by being very friendly and sweet. I would definitely stay here again next time I am in boston"
1373520,26144490,2015-02-04,21453560,Richard,"We had a very enjoyable stay in Boston with Alisa, Kacey and Data. Their apartment is lovely and modern, very warm despite the cold outside, and what we saw of the neighbourhood seemed nice. The apartment is very close to the T-station (and close enough to the bus station which was handy when snow stopped the trains!) Alisa was at home during our stay; we had a good chat and she had good suggestions for things to do and see in Boston. We happened to be staying during the Superbowl, so we were treated to a Superbowl party with Alisa and Kacey's friends and a mountain of chicken wings, which was great! We would definitely visit again!"
1373520,28721857,2015-03-29,27251557,Diego,"El apartamento es magnifico, todo muy nuevo y muy limpio. Tanto Alisa como su novio son muy amables y respetuosos, y su gato Data es muy cariñoso y simpatico. Han sido muy amistosos con nosotros y nos han facilitado la estancia en Boston. El unico pero es que seria recomendable disponer de unas llaves propias para poder acceder al apartamento. Por lo demas una estancia tal y como se espereba, muy recomendable."
1373520,30916305,2015-04-28,31524146,Belal,Alisa was very kind and welcoming. The room I stayed in was neat and the bed was comfortable. I checked in really late on a Sunday and she couldn't have been anymore courteous.
1373520,32091451,2015-05-13,2212443,Yangshen,"Alisa and her husband are super nice people and they provide us every thing we need. They usually work at home so they are always able to help. The location is safe and only minutes walk to subway station. It only take half an hour to get to downtown Boston. There are enough parking space on one side of the street so we didn't have parking problems. The room is clean and tide, just as shown on the posted pictures. Before we got there we were a little bit worry that the building might be close to the railways. But it turned out to be fine, I slept well when I stayed, even though I sometimes lost sleep all night long at home. Data, the lovely cat, is super cute and we love to play with him. Highly recommended."
1373520,34369230,2015-06-07,24917615,Udani,The room and the apartment was fantastic. Very roomy and comfortable. I was worried the house was close to the railway lines but once the windows are closed you cant hear a thing. Alisa and her husband made us feel very at home. Plus they have a adorable cat.
1373520,36147592,2015-06-25,1678664,John,"The hosts were very friendly and helpful. They work from home so they are home all the time, but they were respectful of my privacy. Neighborhood was a little rough, but it's close to the T and I didn't have any problems. The biggest downside to staying here; there are no keys! For the most part, this is not an issue, unless it is. I had an instance where it was extremely inconvenient/frustrating, and almost scuttled the work portion of my work-cation. Also, I had one morning where I needed to be up early and the hosts were playing video games loudly until early in the morning. I asked them to keep it down, and they did get a little quieter, but sucks to have to ask. If you are planning to live on the hosts schedule, or don't really care about your schedule, this place is comfortable. If your time is not flexible, you may want to keep looking."

1373520,40691509,2015-08-01,39810365,David,"Alisa and Kasey made me feel at home in their home.  I had a wonderful experience at their home.  They are very nice, receptive people and I would stay there again.  The room was as described - clean, private, and accommodating.  The house was clean and well kept.  The location was close enough for me to walk to the area hospitals and I felt safe walking there, even at night.  The onstreet parking was fine - no issues with anyone doing anything to my car, plus it was free so that was a plus.  This was my first time using airbnb and it was a very positive experience thanks to Kasey, Alisa, and Data."
1373520,43304090,2015-08-18,29756712,Danilo,"Alisa è stata molto dettagliata, precisa e molto veloce nell'orientarmi verso la destinazione finale. Il soggiorno è stato piacevole e senza nessun intoppo, i padroni di casa sono stati molto cordiali ma discreti. La camera è addirittura piu grande di come appare in foto e tutto è esattamente come descritto. Il quartiere è tranquillo e l'appartamento è situato in uno splendido stabile completamente rinnovato."

1373520,47019844,2015-09-14,4562198,Priscila,"Alisa, her husband, and her cat were the perfects hosts for a wonderful weekend in Boston. They're truly Air BnB pros, providing their guests with wi-fi, maps of the city, fun places to go, clean towels, and a very comfortable room. They live in a part of Boston really worth exploring and are lovely to converse with. I will certainly reach out when I'm back in Boston!"

The room is as shown, nice and cosy. High ceilings is a plus (15ft?) Have to keep the glass windows shut though as passing metro does cause a commotion."
1373520,51320994,2015-10-19,15100313,Trish,"Very pleasant hosts, welcoming but not intrusive. The room is plenty big and very comfortable. The neighborhood was convenient to my son's university."

1373520,58741295,2016-01-04,20973442,Olga,Alisa and Kacey are nice people. The apartment is pretty clean. We could easily find a spot to park our car on the street near the apartment. The subway is close. It takes about 7 min to get to the subway on foot and then about 15 min to downtown by subway.

They gave me good instructions on how to get to the address using public transit which was quite easy. They let me have plenty of privacy, but invited me to join them in the public area if I chose to. They had a nice map of their location and places to eat near by."
1373520,62572528,2016-02-15,26280529,Alyssa,"Alisa and Kacey were very accommodating when it came to picking up the keys for the apartment. Data was adorable. The place was cozy and close to a train that is a straight shot to Downtown Boston. The train noise didn't bother my boyfriend or I but if I was a lighter sleeper it might be a problem. The bed was very comfy. Parking was a breeze. We were given lots of privacy but we were also invited to hang out in the common area. Overall, great experience."

There are trains passing right in the back of the house,"but the room is well isolitated and it didn't disturb our sleep at all. We can recommend a stay at their room!\"",,,,

"\"",,,,,
1373520,77662069,2016-06-02,65822263,Lauren,"Alisa and Kacey are warm, welcoming people. They greeted me when I arrived, showed me around the apartment, and gave me a key. A note about the key - there is not only a key for the apartment but also for the apartment building. This was a simple detail that I never considered would feel important to me before; however, I highlight it because it made me feel very safe. The apartment and room were as described. Data is a wonderful cat, who watched me from a distance (but always nearby) for the first couple of days and by the end of my stay would lay near me or on my lap. He is friendly but not all over you."
1373520,79735716,2016-06-13,73760441,Jessica,This was a great place to stay! Our hosts were very nice and accommodating. The room was clean and the bed was comfy. I would definitely stay here again. The only downfall was that my boyfriend and I packed to much stuff to do in 3 days so we didn't get to spend as much time hanging out with Alisa and Kasey as we would have liked to :)
1373520,80903556,2016-06-20,74927228,Ryan,Alisa and her husband Kacey were very warm and welcoming.  Their apartment loft is located in what seems to be a newly renovated building.  The room was exactly like the pictures provided on her page.
The location is close to the train station which will take you straight into downtown Boston.,,,,,

1373520,87734910,2016-07-21,80872973,Wylie,"Alisa and Kacey were very welcoming and helpful in my visit to Boston.  They helped with places to eat and ride my bike.  I only stayed two days and it flew by.  The apartment was clean, beautiful, and an easy place to come and go to local places like Fenway park.  I would definitely recommend them and would stay again in the future."
1373520,88115608,2016-07-23,1490743,Anthony,Alisa did everything to make sure the check in went smooth.   Communication was superb and the room was clean.
We were a bit concerned as to whether we would be ticketed for parking on the street and Alisa organized for us to have a temporary parking pass for the building parking lot.,,,,,

There was plenty of street parking close by which can be a hassle in Boston. Apartment is clean,  well air conditioned and the room is spacious. Cat is very friendly."

I love the (URL HIDDEN) is spacious and organized. the cat is cute, but you need to watch out! my friend and I were so unlucky that the cat didn't like us, and she pooped on my pillow the night before we leaving! so please lock your door very well when you go out in the daytime!"
1373520,95653022,2016-08-20,5266684,Savita,"We enjoyed our stay with Alisa and her husband in Boston. The apartment was located within short walking distance to the T and there was free street parking for our car. While we didn't spend too much time chatting with them, their communication was great and they were flexible with our arrival and departure. We appreciated the maps and recommendations they had available in our room... all signs of a seasoned, professional Airbnb host. I'd recommend staying with them."
4670285,30686587,2015-04-26,6620518,Jordan,"Deborah is an incredibly nice lady who made me feel very welcome in her home. She invited me to join her for dinner on several occasions, and even made me an Easter basket as I was there for Easter. I enjoyed talking with her in the evenings when we were both around. The buses made it easy for me to get to the Back Bay area when I was working there. And there was ample, free street parking. I would definitely consider staying here again when I am back in Boston."
There are two things that I mention just because I think that others would want to now about them before making a decision to book a room in Deborah's home. First,the common areas of the house (bathroom and kitchen,in particular) are somewhat cluttered. Second,there is a limit to the privacy that you can expect in this particular room. The door does not latch (but will mostly close),and Deborah usually enters the room during the day to water the plants and adjust the shades. Neither of these things were huge issues for me,"but I figure that they are worth mentioning as others may have different expectations.\""
4670285,33802297,2015-06-01,31222980,Lindsay,"My past month with Deborah was an amazing experience. When I arrived at her house at the beginning of May she had made a May Day basket for me as a welcome gift, along with a basket full of shampoo, conditioner, shaving cream, body wash, etc. It immediately made me feel so welcome. The bedroom was a perfect size with tons of drawers and a small closet to keep your belongings. The bathroom was across the hall which was very nice. Her kitchen had everything you could imagine you'd want or need. Deborah's house is so comfortable, and the location is the best in the Boston area, in my opinion! The 57 bus is around the corner and comes every ten minutes. It can pretty much get you anywhere you need or want to go. Coffee, restaurants, laundry, nail salons, and even a YMCA are moments from her. I would come back and stay in a heartbeat, and hope to keep in contact with Deborah. She is a great host, and truly makes you feel like a part of her family."
4670285,34450510,2015-06-08,31222980,Lindsay,"Just as I mentioned before, Deborah is an amazing host! I'd stay here again in a heartbeat."
4670285,41017813,2015-08-03,34165739,Joseph,"Deborah was very attentive from the moment I inquired about the location.  She provide directions for using public transportation that were far superior to (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN).  In addition, while she didn't have a complete understanding of my travel due to my not having Data available on my phone, she still waited for me until arrived so that she would be there."
4670285,42151154,2015-08-11,37167252,David,"I had a wonderful stay with Deb. The accommodations were perfect: clean, quiet, and a great location. Deb is a great host and always very helpful to make your stay comfortable. The house is super cool, every direction you look there is something cool to look at, a poster, decoration, etc. I highly recommend staying here!"
4670285,44447187,2015-08-26,39352984,Duncan,"A lovely home which was made even more welcoming by Deborah. Anything you need to know about the local area and Boston she will be able to inform you about it. The house has great character and is fantastic for books lovers, I'd highly recommend staying here for anyone wanting to explore Brighton and Boston and I never experienced any issues or had any complaints while staying here."
4670285,44817678,2015-08-29,40797014,Allyson,"Deborah did the most fabulous thing one can do in the Boston area for a guest arriving in a car - she saved a parking space right in front of her house!  I'm usually pretty introverted and was looking for a quiet comfy place to crash while getting my son settled at college.  Deborah was the perfect host for me - friendly and interesting enough for me to come out of my introverted shell, and respectful of my need to retreat at the end of each day.  It was a pleasure meeting her, and the room was clean and comfortable, without pretension, and felt like a safe retreat."
4670285,56836142,2015-12-19,24663309,Cristina,Can't praise this place enough. I extended my stay which speaks for itself. I will write a full review after this extended stay.
4670285,57198826,2015-12-23,24663309,Cristina,"Four months ago, I came to Boston, having temporarily left family and friends to take up an international fellowship at Boston college. It was an adventure but also really hard for me to adjust to a new life and a new place. Being able to stay at Deborah's house was a real blessing for me because it was like entering a second home. Deborah was welcoming, showed interest in the things I did, and ready to give handy tips about doing things in Boston and getting around the place. We shared a good many chats over dinner and a couple of bottles of good Italian wine with another person staying there from Italy and another from Austria. Just as many stories have been shared over her dining table in her gorgeous full chef's kitchen, so does the house itself tell of many stories and memories. Like the velveteen rabbit, it is a place that has been loved and love has been shared, but also not in its pristine original self. There are missing knobs on some doors, floorboards gently creak as you go up and down the stairs, the lounges and stairs to the third bedroom are lined with memorabilia from a lifetime of love shared with a family who have now grown up and moved out. But this is all part of the character and charm of the place. If you want a cold, pristine hotel room, then this is not the place for you. But if you want laughter, intelligent conversation with Deborah and fellow guests, and another home to go to - well this might be the place for you. I can imagine how it may be stressful to have a constant flow of different people entering into her home as an Airbnb place and yet Deborah receives all of them with so much welcome. The place was 15 mins walk from Boston College, 30 mins to downtown Boston and 40 mins to Harvard Square. It is close to all the great food places like Johnny D's and Ronan's. As I said in my previous review, I can't give enough praise about this place. Thank you Deborah for welcoming me for 4 months and also my family on my last night there. Time flew by in a flash faster than a ride on the tardis. I wish you all the best, Cristina."
4670285,59262462,2016-01-08,40788533,Teal (Robert) Ashby,"Deborah's House is a lovely old being. It sits as close to perfectly, in location, as one could hope to find."
The interior is a kaleidoscope of colors,shapes,and things,both deep and rich in the way they work visually. Deborah has a great eye,and an ability to bring harmony to all the diversity.,
And the host?,,,,,
Just awesome.,,,,,
She will give you your space,or discuss literature,movies,the world with wit and passion.,,

Deborah made me feel completely at home, and I had both the privacy of my own room when I needed it as well as the pleasure to exchange a good chat and sometimes a glass of wine with her when we met in the kitchen. The room was at the same time very spacius and cosy, precisely what it looks like in the picture! And the neighbourhood is full of more or less hidden 'culinary jems' that are definitely worth a try - ask Deborah, she will give you great advice :) Deborah is a great host and an intelligent and resourceful woman, and having lived for a long time in the neighbourhood chats with her were not only always interesting but also a great way to settle in. Couldn't recommend her more and would definitely come back when in Boston."

There is a bus stop right in the corner of her house, which makes it much easier to get to the downtown. Deporah is very affable person who simultaneously communicates with her guests as well as respects their privacy. Moreover, I enjoyed chatting with her sometimes at night about various subjects. She also suggested many places worth to visit in Boston, which made my visit much more enjoyable. If I have a plan to visit Boston anytime later, I would definitely stay again at Deporah house."

Jay was very accessible,responding to calls and text and left pretty much alone unless we needed him.,,,,
The space is good for two people,a bit cramped for three. There is a full sized bed and a sectional couch. One person on the couch and two in the bed is doable,one in the bed and two on the couch,not as much.,,
It's a typical back bay Boston apartment. It's not the fanciest thing (the shower is a little spastic),but if you need somewhere with a great location,"this is your spot. I would stay here again. \"",,,
3673688,21548850,2014-10-19,20321163,Chris,"Absolutely amazing location; easy to walk to a ton of awesome restaurants, bars and shopping. The apartment was exactly as described. Small, cozy and clean. Jay was very accommodative, offered to help with whatever we needed, and made sure we had everything around to have a comfortable night in town. Would definitely recommend and will be using when back in town."
3673688,22557324,2014-11-09,23167273,Terry,Very nice and very helpful host. Jay was very quick to get back with messages and made sure we knew how to get around. The apartment location is fantastic and easy to walk to subway and shops. We really enjoy the stay and will come again for sure.
3673688,26162295,2015-02-05,24930575,K,"This apt. Is in a perfect location of you need to do anything in Copley place.  It is also only about three blocks to boylston st....bars, restaurants, etc.  it has a room with a bed then the couch is big and can sleep someone.  It is a third floor walk up in an older brownstone building...cute. 7-11 across the street."
3673688,26678238,2015-02-17,23029078,Catharine,"The host was responsive and prompt. This is not a penthouse apartment. The apartment was not clean, including the bathroom and kitchen area. There is no coffeemaker. If those two problems were solved I could recommend it for the location"
3673688,27907854,2015-03-14,26875202,Jeff,The good:  the host was easy to work with and the location is excellent.
The bad:  the place was very dirty - the counter tops,stove and refrigerator were disgustingly filthy and the bathroom was marginally better.  The window blinds were broken and could not be closed - they were both hanging upside down due to the proper top ends being broken.  Dirt (maybe a spilled plant) and debris were all along the edge of the carpet.  This apartment is old and it shows.,,,,
"Also - there are no forks - I could not find a single one.\"",,,,,
3673688,28703086,2015-03-29,15196575,Tracy,"Great location - very close to the T, shopping, restaurants. Felt safe in the neighborhood. Smooth check-in procedures. Host easily reachable by cell. Wi-fi access provided. The apt was on top floor of a brownstone, accessible by stairs. Despite the perfect location the apt itself was disappointing. It was dirty with dust on all surfaces and bathroom was grimy.  There was a bad odor in the apt. Window shades were uninstalled on the floor. It was advertised as a 1 bedroom + sectional couch that sleeps 3 but only 1 set of sheets and 1 blanket were provided.  I can't see more than 2 people fitting on the  couch to sleep."
3673688,29192020,2015-04-05,3522434,Alexandra,"Jay's apartment was cozy and as described in the listing. The location was great, just what I was looking for.

3673688,30384064,2015-04-21,18604728,Eric,"My friends and I had a great stay at Jay's place during the Boston Marathon.  His condo is in an amazing location and he makes sure everyone staying is familiar with the surrounding area.  In addition, he was available 24/7 in case we needed anything."
3673688,31838679,2015-05-10,10780133,Gian Maria,Jay was really nice and efficient! The location is great and the house is the perfect spot to enjoy Boston! Highly recommended!
3673688,32234881,2015-05-16,23270809,Mike,"Jay was very accommodative regarding check in and out, and he provided information about the surrounding area. He was also available anytime for assistance, if needed. Apartment location was great for my activities at Northeastern, as well as for access to the T."
3673688,33501546,2015-05-29,6421803,Jeff,Jay was very helpful and professional. He really knows the neighborhood and provided lots of good info. The apartment is in a great location and everything was easy. Thanks Jay!

"Would use again.\"",,,,,
3673688,34144236,2015-06-05,32866237,Tammy,"Jay met us on the steps when we arrived from the airport. He showed us his apartment and had maps, notes, and recommendations written down for our use. My husband would have much preferred to have a coffeemaker in the room, but having a 7-11 on the corner saved us. Great location, quiet neighborhood and best price we could find for MIT graduation. Thanks Jay!"
3673688,34614295,2015-06-09,35200054,Dan,"Cute place, very centrally located near Prudential and Back Bay T stations. Jay was super friendly and hospitable. Clean, comfy. The bed was more comfortable than many of the hotels I've stayed at recently."

3673688,35421898,2015-06-18,34752853,Cyndi,"Jay's apartment is in a terrific location. It really can not be beat. Jay was extremely flexible, allowing us to leave our bags before check in and after check out, (our flights were early in the morning and in the evening). The apartment is as pictured. I would describe it as a top floor walk-up studio apartment. No frills but perfect if you do not plan on spending a great deal of time in the apartment."
"Thank you Jay! We had a great trip to Boston and your location is fantastic!\"",,,,,
3673688,36134696,2015-06-25,35520399,Cory,"Jay was a great host, waiting for me as I was running late to check in. Nice and tidy place, prime location. Would stay again."
3673688,37607969,2015-07-08,13613922,Mariana,Jesse's apartment was a great 1 bedroom apartment in a prime location in Boston less than a block away from the T. The apartment itself was very clean and exactly as described with a full kitchen and working AC and wifi. Jesse was very acommodating for check in and helped me with my luggage. There is a 7 eleven across the street which is very convenient.
3673688,37906003,2015-07-11,35792279,Robert,"Immediately after booking Jesse was in communication. He gave great advice on getting to his place. When I arrived in BackBay Jesse was waiting at his stoop where he gave me a tour of his apartment. He explained all the amenities that he had to offer, he also included lists of detailed locations of where to go in the area. The location in Back Bay is perfect. Public transportation as well as an arrangement of things to do in the area will keep you busy your whole time there. I walked to Boston Commons in less than 20 minutes from his location. The apartment is perfect for 3 people. As mentioned the corner 7 Eleven is quite convenient.  If you're looking for a great place to stay with a guy who will take the stress out of your travel book this place."

Le logement n'est pas immense ni particulièrement luxueux, mais il est propre et  confortable, et il est doté de l'air climatisé.  Lorsque nous avons visité, c'était la canicule dehors, et l'air climatisé nous a sauvé la vie !  Mention spéciale au lit et aux oreillers, très confortable.  Nous avons donc très bien dormis !

He went above and beyond to help us stow our bags after check out so we could enjoy the city unencumbered and met us to retrieve the bags before our departure.  The flat was as described,  tidy with lots of light and a convenient and efficient lay out.  The bed and couch were extremely comfortable, nice AC, well-equipped kitchen, fresh linens and towels.  The location is beautiful, a quick walk to Copley Square, but quiet and quaint with a \"\"neighborhood\"\" feel.  Just at the end of Newton is the Southwest Corridor Path/Park"

The great running paths running along the bay are directly behind and the T is short distance away.  The neighbor hood is great with shopping and dining close by.  The place itself is quite cozy, quiet, and had everything I needed - small kitchen, fast internet connection, and super comfy bed and great pillows.  Marina was easy to communicate with and always answered my text messages or emails.  She was also very accommodating with my late flight out.  I highly recommend staying here."
311240,1169016,2012-04-23,1158676,Teresa,"LOCATION, LOCATION,LOCATION.  This apartment was not only beautiful and clean it was walking distance to a number of hot locations. We caught a Red Sox game at Fenway, and easily walked there and back."
We also walked to the downtown area the opposite way with ease.,,,,,

311240,1270334,2012-05-13,1823729,Anita,The apartment is in a fantastic location in Back Bay. Beautiful views onto the Charles river and very close to excellent shopping & dining options. Marina was always very prompt in dealing with any queries and went out of her way to accommodate requests. The apartment is very tastefully decorated and a really pleasant place to stay. So much more character than a hotel. Would not hesitate to book here again.
311240,1333717,2012-05-23,1405561,Dr Bob,Marina's Back Bay apartment was a great location for us. Marina was a great host and everything worked out well. The apartment was on the 3rd floor which was a challenge since we had alot of luggage.

311240,2194083,2012-09-04,2787282,Mark,"We had a great stay at Marina's apartment. It is very well located (probably better than we thought when we booked it) in a lovely street of beautiful brownstone apartment buildings, and has great views over the Charles River. We also didn't realize that the Back Bay area is a very good food and shopping destination - on Newbury Street and Boylston Street respectively. It is a 10 minute walk to the Copley subway station, and not too far to walk into downtown Boston and the historic parts of town if you are feeling energetic - about 30 mins walk to Boston Common and the start of the Freedom Trail."
The apartment is exactly as described,in fact probably more charming than the photos show,and there are 2 flights of stairs to get up to it - not bad with a big case and thankful it wasn't any higher. Everything worked as you would expect (TV,internet etc) and the only thing we missed in the kitchen was a toaster. There is a Laundromat about 3 blocks away on the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Marlborough Street  - the Back Bay Laundry. Marina was very helpful with our checkin and since we had no problems at all,"we did not need to to call on her after that. \"",

"It needs a little TLC.  We could not make contact with Marina. There was no answer from her cell phone and the mailbox was full. Somebody did contact us after a couple of days offering assistance.  However this did not stop us enjoying our stay.\"",,,,,
311240,2784986,2012-11-02,3507493,Claire,"I stayed in the studio apartment for 11 nights. Marina had been very helpful and accommodating re: making the booking some months ago, however, a lack of communication re: meeting up, meant I was left waiting outside the apartment for over an hour. Finally, after sending an email, a friend of Marina's came to let me in. Marina was out of the country during my stay, but her friend, who looks after the place when she is away, was very helpful and left her number in case I needed anything."
The apartment is situated in the leafy 'Back Bay' area of Boston. It was very comfortable but I wouldn't call it luxurious. The kitchen and bathroom are in need of some up-dating but are in full working order. The apartment overlooks the river and a six-lane busy road but the building itself is very quiet.There is no lift so it can be a struggle with luggage.,,,,,
The TV and wi-fi worked well.  There was a hairdryer and towels but no toaster and nowhere to grill bread in the oven,that I could see.,,,,
The apartment is located about 10 min+ walk from the nearest T; 30 mins+ walk from the nearest WholeFoods; 20 mins walk to Boston Public Gardens/Common and about 8 mins to Newbury Street. There is a Shaw's supermarket located near Copley Square,however I didn't discover this until my penultimate day!,,,,

It has everything you need for a longer stay, we stayed for 6 weeks. We took a walk down the Esplanade daily and loved going to all the restaurants on Newbury Street (which is less than 10 minutes away!) There is ample storage space.Getting in touch with Marina was super easy, and when we had a minor issue with the internet she fixed it immediately.

311240,7983706,2013-10-11,3863516,Sönke,"\"Marina's place does live up to its fotos and discription. It's centric, quiet and fully equipped (although I did not manage to handle the gas cooker, but this may be for my ignorance of US-security standards). It has a beautiful view on the river (for those who need to sleep with the windows open, bear in mind the four-track speed-way between the river and the river you see on the fotos). The access to the appartment may be a bit tricky as the flat is at the second floor and the stairway becomes narrow climbing up with a bigger suitcase. I had a great week in Boston staying at Marina's, although the arrival and departure were a bit of a shambles (her own words and she felt very sorry about it, on arrival the flat wasn't cleant up and on departure the cleaners came without previous hint while I was still in the flat). Nevertheless, I enjoyed the appartment and the stay in Boston very much, spite of being a bit pricey for what you get (both, Boston and appartment). I do recommend the appartment to those who are not too demanding with regards to the teaser \"\"luxury\"\" and  are prepared a higher price which is not really justified.\""

All and all it was very nice, we were there to visit our daughter as well as going to a wedding, so my ONLY complaint was there was no mirror in the place except for over the sink in the bathroom, so when dressing up for our event we had no mirror.  but that was a very minor item.  Great place, highly recommended, we would stay there again for sure.   :)"
311240,8597892,2013-11-07,2511054,Jen,"The location of this charming brownstone cannot be beat! In the heart of Back Bay, full view of the Charles River, it's a cozy space, and worth the two flights of narrow stairs to access it. Our host helped us resolve issues with the Internet, there are lots of channels on the TV, and the space was clean and bright. The only drawbacks were a saggy bed and a stove that didn't work (all other appliances worked fine). The host left good instructions and emergency contacts."
311240,8645131,2013-11-10,9697796,Sally,"The studio apartment is very nice and the view of the river was great. I loved being in the authentic Back Bay area of Boston  However, if I had known that it was a two-flight walk up with narrow steep stairs I would never have booked it. Getting my suitcases up and down those stairs was a nightmare."
311240,8702277,2013-11-12,7390590,Karina,"I stayed at Marina's apartment for a weekend and it was a lovely experience. The apartment was very nice, Back Bay is a great location and Marina was a pleasure to communicate with. I definitely recommend this apartment when visiting Boston."
311240,9973236,2014-01-22,10400733,Yinon,"The apartment is beautiful, great location. Very roomy and relaxing. The hosts were incredible, always responsive and glad to answer any questions/concerns etc. Wonderful stay!"
311240,10856681,2014-03-10,1542871,Albert,Wonderful location.
Marina was very available through email,we never met,but I feel we did.,,,
Her beautiful Studio grows on you,just did not want to leave…,,,,
Very warm and cozy place,everything worked well…!,,,,
"Will stay here again on my next visit !\"",,,,,
311240,12885980,2014-05-13,13026748,Bridget,"This is a beautiful apartment in a lovely residential area of Boston.  Marina was extremely helpful and responsive to any problems.  It is very close to good shops and all amenities so there is absolutely no need to have a car, unless like us you are visiting family outside the Boston area.  If you do have a car parking is a complete nightmare because all local parking is residents only, and beware because even the metered parking reverts to residents only after 6 pm.  After climbing the steep stairs it was a delight to open the door onto such a lovely view across the river."
311240,13146081,2014-05-20,2224262,Natalie,The location of Marina's place was excellent! Couldn't be happier with the apartment and the view. Apartment is well maintained and felt like home. Check in was super easy and Marina was accessible by phone and email. Highly recommend!
311240,14203707,2014-06-14,596405,Elizabeth,"Marina's place was a lovely retreat to come home to after long days out and about. The views of the river were so soothing, and her apartment was cozy, well designed, and very convenient to all that back bay has to offer. Even though Marina lives in a different city, she was super easy to communicate with and check-in/out was seamless."
311240,15278532,2014-07-06,944228,Xavier,"A very nice view, and the place is comfortable. Marina is kind and caring! The only issue - the Internet connection is not always very reliable."
311240,15844278,2014-07-16,17607637,Tim,"\"Marina was awesome, clear instructions on how to get in, very timely and responsive to booking. The best part of this unit is location right in Back Bay and walking distance to everything. Beautiful view as well. The only cons for me were that mattress clearly needs replacing and \"\"air conditioning\"\" appears to be a window unit that needs to be installed for each use? Furnishings are tasteful"
311240,16647841,2014-07-30,14079461,Nataliya,"Its impossible to describe our horrible experience. To be short, Marina accepted our booking, we were charged for that and she didn't show up to provide access to her apartment in Boston. All my messages, emails, calls were without answer when we arrived. I think its not necessary to say about  discomfort of being in a different city without a point of contact! The only one thing we could do (staying with our luggage on the street) its just to find the hotel. At that time it was a big conference in Boston and we had to pay much more then we were planning just to have a place to sleep."
311240,21819118,2014-10-25,11249001,Sibylle,... I stayed at Marinas apartment for three months. It was a great stay in a beautiful appartment in Boston's nicest neighborhood ... I'll come back - soon ...
311240,28947300,2015-04-01,20005940,Rich,"The location of Marina's apartment is perfect and very safe, close to newbury and boylston street shopping and restaurants and easy to get anywhere.  It overlooks the Charles River and is close to the Mass Ave bridge, which I enjoyed running over for the view and to visit cambridge.  The only problem with my stay was that  I had no internet connection for 5 days of my stay.  Marina was empathetic and offered me an extra night for free(which she didn't have to), which I was happy to have.  It was then fixed and I had internet towards the end of my stay.  The place is very clean and as described in pictures, though the bed is not comfortable (concave in middle).  Overall, there were some hiccups, but Marina was accomodating and I would possibly stay here again."
311240,30003775,2015-04-15,30744153,Sam,"The apartment was perfect.  Clean, spacious, and in a great location with a great view.  If you're coming to Boston, you should definitely stay here."
311240,30094608,2015-04-17,17261947,Andrew,"The apartment is in the ideal location and check in was a breeze. The place is classic, cozy and charming. The only negative is the bed: desperately needs a new mattress as it's essentially concave in the middle. Very uncomfortable. Otherwise great. I'd stay again."
311240,33828208,2015-06-01,22036123,Darin,"Once we established the process, picking up the keys and checking in and out was very straightforward. Apartment has a great view of the Charles and is a short walk to Newbury St. A comfortable apartment in a perfect Back Bay location."
311240,36321414,2015-06-27,17704074,Yolanda,"Would not recommend Marinas Boston place: overpriced for a dirty, mouldy apartment. Bed was awful with major dip in the middle. Host communication poor, ignored my request for a partial refund, but did refund cleaners fee as I had to do the cleaning & new linen day we arrived... Good location, book a hotel or Airbnb in the same area if you can."
311240,38180586,2015-07-13,36708114,Martha,"We loved staying at Marina's apartment! It was in an awesome location, on a beautiful Boston downtown street. Marina couldn't have been easier to work with, the instructions were super easy and she checked in with us along the way. The apartment was the perfect size for our needs and had a great view of the Charles. We will definitely try and stay there again."
311240,39793830,2015-07-26,23756457,Ellen,"Marina's Back Bay apartment is lovely and in a perfect location for walking anywhere-with the added bonus of the Charles River view. I was there for an extended stay after surgery and the new bed was extremely comfortable. The windows all have room darkening shades that allow for wonderful sleep, and she even provides a sleep machine! The air conditioning and  internet worked beautifully. The fully stocked kitchen & bath exceeded my expectations. Marina was thoughtful and considerate making certain I had access on time, and checked in on me via text periodically to be certain all of my needs were met."
"I would recommend Marina as a host and plan to stay at her property again when I return to Boston. \"",,,,,
311240,46235930,2015-09-08,6385655,Renata,"Marina was very helpful and prompt. Great location for Boston stay. Very close to the hustle and bustle of restaurants, bars and great retail stores."
311240,46532945,2015-09-11,9472468,Lauren,"Wonderful apartment and easy check-in. Loved the location, the view, the set-up, everything. Marina is a wonderful host."
311240,47220907,2015-09-16,464044,Corey,"The apartment is cute and clean and the location was great. Marina was a great communicator, too."
311240,47773784,2015-09-21,13166146,Victor,Fantastic location.  Comfortable bed.  Host was very responsive.  Older unit (careful with the closet door...) but all necessities covered.
311240,48232186,2015-09-24,36366085,James,"A well presented apartment conveniently located within walking distance of amenities, and great views overlooking the water. Marina was very communicative throughout and provided a seamless experience."
311240,49032655,2015-09-30,14906813,Jessica,"I very much enjoyed my stay at Marina's. She was super responsive even prior to booking as I had a few questions that she quickly and thoroughly replied to. The apartment is clean, comfortable (including the awesome new mattress!! Disregard old reviews about that!) and in a wonderful location with easy access to the best of Back Bay. I'd definitely return on future trips."
Only suggestion for those who are noise sensitive and/or light sleepers... Bring earplugs as the noise from the highway between the building and the river is pretty constant. Not horribly obtrusive,"but enough that I needed earplugs to sleep. The view and proximity make it worth it!\"",,,,
311240,49356272,2015-10-03,32274547,Silje,"Very nice location in Boston! :) quiet street, but with some noice from the traffic because the aircon is placed in the window. Nice apartment for a couple. We stayed there with a baby, and that worked out well! But be aware of steep and narrow stairs. I could stay here again :)"
311240,49921011,2015-10-07,44312899,Molly,"I had a wonderful experience in this apartment. It is a spacious studio in a gorgeous neighborhood in Boston. A walking trail along the Charles is 1 block away, Newbury St. with shops and restaurants is a few blocks away, and the train station was close by as well!  The host was very nice and responded to all emails very quickly."
311240,50096431,2015-10-09,6089887,Christine,Marina was great host and was able to respond to any all question right away.  The apartment is as pictured but the view is even better in person.  It is a great location and you are able to walk everywhere or access public transportation.  I definitely enjoyed my stay and will be contacting Marina when I'm back in town.
311240,50677201,2015-10-13,41293857,John,"We had a great stay (perfect weather helped). Very cozy & charming little studio - Fantastic location with spectacular view. Quiet stately neighborhood, but just a couple of blocks from all the shopping and dining action. Just a short walk to the beautiful riverside park. Friendly neighbors. The building is showing it's age a little, but that adds to the charm. Marina was very helpful getting us in and out and the apartment was clean and well furnished - thanks Marina!"
311240,51453561,2015-10-20,43804118,Amanda (And Joe),Great location with fabulous view of the Charles. Woke up to sunny days with sailboats racing on the river. Nice open apartment with a super comfy bed and comforter. Great location several blocks from Newbury Street with many great restaurants and shops. A short walk to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. A cab ride away from everything else Boston has to offer. The host was very accommodating. We arrived in Boston prior to the check-in time and were able to leave our luggage in the apartment until the cleaners were done. Thank you!
Should note that the apartment is up several flights of narrow stairs (no elevator) and the bathroom is very small.,,,,,

It was the ideal place to stay...a home away from home just a few blocks away from all the back bay shopping and restaurants, a quick walk to the Fenway area, Cambridge (or catching the T to just about anywhere). The condo has an amazing view with a giant chair for taking it all in...The entire place was very clean, the kitchen is well equipped allowing me to make coffee and a good healthy breakfast every morning as well as the occasional dinner. The bed is really comfortable and the shower has endless hot water and great water pressure.. I'm sold.. I'll be looking for marinas place the next time I'm back."
About Marina...Prior to and during the stay,she was great about communication and was very responsive.  I found her so pleasant to work with as a host.,,,,

311240,56171657,2015-12-09,31477174,Nikka,"Marina was very helpful and responded quickly when we had questions about the apartment. The studio is in the heart of Back Bay, on one of the most beautiful streets. Everything was very clean when we got there, and instructions were very clear. The bed was very comfortable and the studio got tons of light. Even had a view of the Charles River! Overall had a great stay!"

311240,62658144,2016-02-15,50537,Noel,"We had a great experience from start to finish! Marina was always very responsive via the Airbnb messaging app whenever I had any questions and was very accommodating. I had never been to Boston before and I'm so glad we stayed where we did! The studio itself was very nice and comfy, we made use of the coffee machine and made breakfast each morning during out stay. The kitchen had all the utensils we needed. I would be happy to stay here again the next time I'm in town."
311240,64371911,2016-03-03,23756457,Ellen,"This was my second stay at Marina's place and I am so comfortable there. She is accommodating if anything comes up, the view is beautiful, and the apartment is well maintained. I lived in the area for 5 years myself, and this is a perfect location too! I will return, no doubt."
311240,65407044,2016-03-13,36217620,Isabelle,"Contact with our host was good. Marina has the Airbnb app and it was easy to communicate with her. The place and furniture are a little bit older than the pictures are showing; Excellent location close to everything. And a beautiful view on the Charles river.We recommend Marina' s studio if you are healthy as there is no elevator but it worths it.If you are sensitive to noise, the week end is calm. During the week days and nights, the traffic is very high on the River Charles side.Lovely host and lovely view!"
311240,67310209,2016-03-28,25912199,John,"Great location in a beautiful neighborhood. Apartment presented exactly like the pictures. Clean and warm, would stay again. Bring your running shoes and go for a jog around the Charles River Esplanade."
311240,69710258,2016-04-12,28283739,Ryan,Awesome location and views of the river!  Great neighborhood.  Close to everything.  Marina was also very flexible.  Would stay there again if ever in Boston.  Great experience overall!
311240,70195845,2016-04-16,50198140,Georgios,The apartment has an excellent location and is as described. Marina is a very responsive host: she resolved our wifi problem immediately upon hearing from us via Airbnb. I would recomnend Marina and this apartment with the gorgeous view of the river.
311240,70629324,2016-04-19,64067783,Manuel,"This was an ideal location. Just a few blocks to the Boston Marathon finish line, shopping on Newton street, walking distance to Copley mall. We ran on the Charles River trail which is the view out of the window. A+"

311240,71860675,2016-04-29,65826399,Shereen,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was indeed a great one. Marina has been an amazing host! Despite being away, she was very helpful and responsive via the Airbnb app. Her studio was equally amazing too. It was clean, very central, had an awesome river view and was as convenient as it can get. I also loved that there was a personal touch to the interior of the studio - fashionably homely indeed. Would love to visit again when I get the chance. Thanks, Marina!"

"could use a chair for the desk... better instructions about how to retrieve the key. the place where the key is stashed is VERY HIGH UP. I had to stand on my suit case to reach it! This studio is not recommended for those unable to navigate narrow staircases with heavy bags.\"",,,,,
311240,76318100,2016-05-26,50027995,Kathie,"Marina was the best host for my first Airbnb experience! From the initial acceptance of the reservation, to timely communication from check-in and throughout the week, she made this a pleasant, trouble-free stay. She also allowed us to stash our luggage on the last day while we squeezed in one more jaunt before we flew home. The apartment was just as described - bright and sunny and in a great location. The view of the river is amazing! The bed is very comfortable, and there was a decent quality air mattress in the closet that my son slept on."
With the windows open,traffic noise can be quite loud,but thankfully there is so much to do in Boston that we returned each night exhausted and slept with them open anyway! The air conditioner is a small,portable window unit that you wedge into the open window - my expectations were low but it was surprisingly effective!,,
As the listing notes,there is no elevator so be prepared for narrow stairs as you find in an older building. The bathroom is also very small and a person of size would have difficulty using it.,,,,
Something that turned out to be an added bonus - there is a fire hydrant directly in front of the stoop. This provided the perfect pick-up/drop-off location for Uber!,,,,,

I wanted to come back and visit my old friend Boston for a two night needed break.  I think if I could retire back in the city I would move to the Back Bay where this apt is located.

Walk to the Boston Common to start the Freedom Trail, or to Fenway Park for a baseball game? All within a short walking distance!"

311240,82753083,2016-06-29,8902293,Grace,"\"I was surprised to find Marina's listing on Airbnb.  The photos of the apartment are beautiful, and yet the rate is so low. I was afraid that the listing was too good to be true - and unfortunately it was. The building, while charming due to being an old brownstone, is in terrible condition. The hallway is filthy, dingy and smells like rotten food.  The apartment itself was not much better. The sofa is stained, as are the curtains. The apartment looks like it was decorated with discount furnishings from Salvation Army. The quilt left of the bed was tattered, stained and very uninviting. I even purchased my own bedding to use during my stay and covered the sofa with a sheet. There were hairs on the bed sheets sheets, and the bed sheets were even freshly stained. I sincerely doubt the sheets were cleaned. The mirrors were dusty and full of finger prints. I washed any dishes before using them, as they were also not up to my standard of cleanliness. There is food in the stocked kitchen cabinets - and much of it is expired. There were even tampon wrappers and a panty liner on the bathroom floor. This apartment was dirty, neglected and not well maintained. Marina told me she would refund the cleaning fee. This has not been done. She did offer to have the cleaners come while I was in town, but this was just more of an inconvenience, as I had already settled into the apartment and had a full schedule. I found it easier to spend an hour to clean it myself. She wanted to have someone \"\"inspect\"\" the apartment"
311240,91821915,2016-08-06,48207284,Pc,"I lived here for almost one and half months.  This studio's location is great because it is very convenient but has great view! You can go shopping for fun; you also can take a walk for peace. You also can go jogging  which all Boston people will do! I have a wonderful living experience here. By the way, when I live here if I have question, the landlord will response very soon. Hope people live here have wonderful trip, too!"
12998272,99631842,2016-09-05,92675836,Youming,It's an amazing apartment located at a very nice place in Boston. It has two bedrooms with kitchen and bathroom. Chris is nice and very flexible about the check in and out policy.
13445221,99967424,2016-09-06,80310249,Brenda,The host canceled this reservation 37 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

Not only did the apartment have everything we needed, but it was super cozy and clean and had beautiful decor. We didn't see Chris in person, but he contacted us via email and text. He even sent us a document containing tips about the apartment and Boston before we arrived."
The apartment is in a wonderful location,in a quiet and nice neighborhood with lots of dining options. Make sure to check out Tatte bakery right around the corner! The apartment is within walking distance to places such as the Public Garden,the State House,etc. We even walked to the harbor and went on a short cruise.,,
Thanks so much for letting us stay,"Chris! I will definitely recommend this listing to friends and family. \"",,,,
11701611,80701684,2016-06-19,64676739,Nancy,"We had a wonderful time at Chris' apartment in Beacon Hill. It was very clean and welcoming. The living room looks just like it does in the picture. It is very quiet. Chris did a great job of letting us know how  to get into her apartment and what we would find in the apartment (coffee and coffeemaker, for example).  She also gave us some great ideas for places to visit in the neighborhood. My friend who happened to be going to a restaurant she recommended and he said the review was spot on."
The building dates back to 1899 so it can be startling when you enter. It has concrete floors in the entry halls and an old elevator with a door that slides open and a gate. It's somewhat dark in the evening. Once you get past that,you will be rewarded with Chris' place that has exposed brick and a comfortable feel appropriate to the neighborhood. She also has a well-stocked library and nice artwork for a homey feel.,,,,
We stayed at the apartment during the longest days of the year.  That means it gets light very early in the morning in Boston (5 am). It was helpful for those days when I had to be up very early.  Not so great when I wanted to sleep in a little.  This will improve as the days get shorter and I suspect with some darker curtains or shades.,,,,,
If you like central air (which we didn't need since we had perfect weather),then this is not the place for you (remember the building is over 100 years old). The  bedroom has a window air conditioner that really cools off the bedroom,which was all we needed.,,,
For storage space,there are two closets in the bedroom. I didn't discover the largely empty closet behind the bedroom door until the third day. There was also some shelf space in the top shelves of the dresser and in the hanging shelves in the closet. I had a lot of clothes because I was attending a conference with different outfits during the day so it was a little short on space for me (plus I tend to pack on the heavy side) but not too bad.,,,,
The neighborhood is one of the best in Boston and is a good reason on its own to stay here.  I had to walk through the Public Garden and the beautiful Back Bay streets each day to get to my conference. (15 minutes to Copley Square.)  The streets are beautiful and historic. You are only blocks from the Statehouse and incredible architecture from the 1800's. In the other direction you are a short walk to the Esplanade on the Charles River.  The Boston Commons is just across Charles Street from the Public Garden. And Charles Street offers excellent dining and shopping options (Tatte Bakery is great for morning coffee and pastries.) Cheers is close by on Beacon Street.,,,,,

The listing lived up to all its promises. It was easy to check in and check out. We used both the bed, and the pull-out sofa, and that worked out fine. The location is fantastic, with plenty of shops, restaurants and attractions within walking distance. We parked the car in a nearby public garage, and didn't touch it for three days."

There is plenty of room for a family and much better option than a hotel. All furniture, fixures and fittings look new. Ed is extremely helpful and organised - nothing was left to chance. He has a genuine interest in making sure his guests have a good experience. At first we were worried the place would not be child frielndly due to the staircase, but it was no issue. We also saw his penthouse which we soon be available for booking, that looked impressive too. We would come back again for sure."

Our family's stay here was one of the best vacations we've had. It was easy to enjoy Boston. We got to the Aquarium, Boston Common, Cambridge, a Red Sox game at Fenway and more with no trouble or hassle. The unit itself is very comfortable and spacious.

There's even a deck that wraps around a tree. Edward is a gracious host who has put a lot of love into the architecture. Don't miss getting a tour of the place.

We were 4 adults and 1 child at age 5 and stayed 16 days. Edward is wonderful person who is helpful and patient in every kind of situation. We are all thankful for lovely sun flowers,delicious cheses,breads,fruits,coffee,milk and variety of marmalades ready for us before we artive.
House is well decorated for especially quality-simple style lovers.,,,,,
House and all amenities were enough for us snd i strongly recommend back garden terrace with full of bird voices:),,,,,
South end is great area in boston who wants to be close city center and really no need to drive car for this place. Back bay station,symphony metro stops are close to home. There is 24 h open market across the street and of course starbucks is at the corner:),,,,
For long stay we found everything at home,well devorated living room and kitchen forced us how we can cook better:). For children house is safe and around there are lots of playing grounds.,,,,
Bedrooms were also confortable and we again understood  what a good selection ac including house at summer term in Boston.,,,,,

Upon arrival, Ed showed us the apartment: in reality it is even more impressive than on the pictures (though it's pretty impressive on the pictures: we saw them and knew right away: that's the perfect place to stay in Boston). The place is very spacious, it has two large, bright bedrooms with extremely comfortable beds, an even larger living room, a kitchen that could not be equipped any better (Ed even provided a selection of fresh fruit and some other food for us), and two perfectly equipped bathrooms. The house in the trees was a perfect place to enjoy the warm Boston summer evenings. Ed put a lot of thought and love into the apartment: we felt at home from the first minute, a perfect place to relax after an eventful day in beautiful Boston. The area: South End, beautiful, many shops & restaurants, you can even walk downtown. Ed was very helpful during our stay, telling us about places worth seeing or where to go out for dinner. On the last the Ed showed us the rest of the house including a penthouse - just as amazing as the duplex. In the end, Ed wasn't only a perfect host but also someone we definitely want to stay in touch with. In sum: we had the perfect stay at Ed's place. Thanks so much! We will be back!"

We were in Boston for the last couple of days of our East Coast trip, Ed even made possible that we check out late - this was just great because our plane back home to Germany left at 10 pm. I can say without any doubt: this was the most pleasant \"\"home away from home\"\" that we ever had. If you come to Boston"

Se nota que ama a su ciudad,y hace que tu experiencia en Boston sea especial desde el primer momento. Nos dejó la casa llena de mapas y folletos con sugerencias de que hacer en Boston,donde se encontraban los parkings más cercanos a la casa etc.,,,
El Duplex es genial,el mejor apartamento que he visitado de Airbnb. Totalmente limpio,decorado con una belleza impresionante,y con una librería de lo más curiosa con libros de un gran interés cultural.,,
El salón de la casa consta de dos sofas triples y una mesa para 6 comensales,todo esto dentro de un espacio muy amplio. Tiene una TV plana enorme con televisión por cable y AppleTV :O. En esta misma planta hay un lavabo con bañera y la cocina. Cuando llegamos teníamos incluso hasta comida en la nevera para nosotros y Aceita de oliva! (algo muy importante para un español jajajaja.),,,,
Las habitaciones (que estan en la planta de arriba) tienen dos camas de matrimonios grandes y las dos habitaciones son muy amplias,con un pequeño escritorio cada una. el baño de arriba con una ducha estaba situado perfecto en la casa,,,,
También hay servicio de lavandería a la entrada de la casa,nosotros lavamos allí toda nuestra ropa y quedo perfecta.,,,,
La localización dentro de la ciudad es inmejorable. Muy cercana al centro y a varias paradas de metro (The 'T') que están a 2 minutos andando.,,,,,
Sin duda si algún día vuelvo a Boston,que espero que si,volveré a casa de Edward.,,,

Gleich um die Ecke auf der Tremont Street sind einige nette Cafés und Restaurants und zur nächsten U-Bahn Station braucht man keine 10min. Es ist ausreichend Platz für 2 Paare (2 Schlafzimmer u 2 Bäder); schön eingerichtet, es gab Handtücher und Bettwäsche und alles tipptopp sauber. Im Kühlschrank war sogar Käse und Marmelade, außerdem gab es Frühstücksflakes, Kaffee, Obst, Spaghetti und eine Pasta Sauce. Da wir nur für 3 Nächte da waren, haben wir aber anstatt zu kochen die umliegenden Lokals besucht. Die Schlüsselübergabe hat auch problemlos geklappt; wir hatten Edward (der einem auch bereitwillig Tipps für den Aufenthalt gibt) vom Flughafen aus kontaktiert und er hat uns dann im Apartment erwartet. Wir können das Apartment nur weiterempfehlen."
Great location in a nice area with typical brick stone buildings. Right around the corner on Tremont Street are some nice cafés and restaurants and the next tram station is less than 10min by foot. There is enough space for two couples (2 bedrooms and 2 bath),nicely furnished; there were towels and bed linen and everything tip-top clean. There was also cheese and marmalade in the fridge and breakfast flakes,coffee,fruits,pasta and sauce in the kitchen but as we stayed only for 3 nights we rather went out.

Ed was a fantastic host and his duplex apartment is absolutely beautiful! Exactly as described and depicted online! The beds and bedrooms are huge and well stocked with fun books! The living room is also well set up with very convenient access to Netflix and apple TV. If you don't have an account Ed has some fun dvds you can watch. We cooked a few meals and had all breakfast and lunch at the apartment and found it well set up for all our needs.,,,,,
My only regret is the weather was not conducive to taking advantage of the amazing deck off the living room. It would be SUCH a beautiful   and unique outdoor space in the spring and summer.,,,,,

I am a Boston native,so I knew the area and the things that I wanted to do,and yet had never lived in the city.  Edward's lovely space allowed us to experience city living for a few days and we enjoyed it completely.  The location is fantastic and very easy to get to the Prudential Center or Back Bay station as launching pads for any place in the city.  Plus you have the revitalized South End all within walking distance.,,,
The weather didn't want to cooperate with us while there,so one evening we opted to stay in,order take out from a great restaurant near by,and watch Netflix on the big screen TV.  We felt like it was a home away from home.,,

Ed suggested a couple of great restaurants to us and they were right on the mark. There is a small, fully functional kitchen that we didn't use but would be fine for occasional meals. Also, the duplex has many media options (Apple TV, Netflix, DVD, etc.) but not live TV. I wanted to watch the Olympics but since I had my laptop, I was able to login to Comcast's online service to get live TV. The only downside of the visit was some noise in the morning from the workers renovating a similar duplex next door. But other than that, we'd definitely stay again during our next trip to Boston."

Despite having business out of town, he was always available via text and made sure I was settled in.  I would repeat without hesitation."
798957,12523328,2014-05-05,1172787,Heather,"We had a very pleasant stay in Ed's apartment while in Boston.  The apartment was very clean, well-equipped, and very spacious, and was centrally located while still being on a quiet street.  The heating/cooling system was easy to adjust and worked flawlessly, which was appreciated given the temperature fluctuations in Boston in the springtime. Ed was very quick to respond to any questions that arose during our stay, and we would certainly stay at his apartment again."
798957,12913213,2014-05-13,5103454,Mary,Ed was an AMAZING host! So amazing that I decided to stay another night! Spent two nights in the studio and then moved up to the duplex. Will consider Ed's lovely home my new home in Boston.
Also,neighborhood could be more perfect chock filled with yummy restaurants so we never had to really travel out to far for a perfect meal.,,,,

798957,12983170,2014-05-16,1302520,Andy,Ed was a fantastic host. I wish I had more time to get to know him better. The unit is beautiful and the location is fantastic. I highly recommend it to anyone.
798957,13127186,2014-05-20,6826582,Susan,Ed and I talked several times before I arrived in Boston so I was not surprised at all by his most gracious and generous spirit.  His home is beautiful and the neighborhood enchanting.
We had come for my daughter's graduation.  It was a special time for our family.  Three generations were there celebrating,including my 85-year-old mother! And we spent a lot of time in the duplex,sharing memories and meals,laughing,enjoying good wine.  Ed's lovely home is now part of our family's story!,
And whatever we needed - whether it was an iron or a simple suggestion - Ed was always there happily willing to accommodate.,,,,,
I told Ed upon leaving that I might just move in permanently!  OK,that might be an expensive way to live in Boston,but we have already booked it for Christmas!,,,

If you have an over-sized car, parking might be a challenge. Otherwise, the location is near Prudential Center and public transport. Would definitely come back!"
798957,13729208,2014-06-03,9035042,Margaret,"We stayed for 10 days whilst our daughter was getting married near Boston and the duplex was a perfect base for us.  The spacious living area was great for entertaining friends and family. The Prudential Mall, supermarkets, and places to eat were all in easy walking distance. We loved the way Ed had furnished the duplex and Ed was on hand to answer any questions. The neighbourhood was very quiet but handy for Back Bay and other central areas of Boston."

The space exceeded our expectations and was the perfect fit for our family and our informal 20 person rehearsal dinner gathering.  Ed is a great communicator who is focused on his guests' stay.  He went the extra mile to insure luggage storage for our early arrival and late departure, provided easy breakfast options including coffee and cereal (much appreciated as we were busy!), and was readily available by phone at all times.  The location and combination of available spaces owned by Ed are great for families traveling together - easily accessible to commerce, tourist sites, and a variety of convenience stores and reasonable restaurants.  We'll be back - Ed's place is now our go-to home for future visits!"

Accidentally, one of my family members locked us out of the house, but Ed came to the rescue so quickly! It was a pleasure to stay at this residence.

The duplex was in a perfect area - 10 mins walk from Copley, beautiful Victorian streets, quiet, safe with lots and lots of super restaurants.  It would be a great place to come and write for a month!  The duplex was very well presented and had everything my family could want.  It was exactly as advertised.

A few interesting things, the place it delightfully petite. I personally like the intimacy of the space. The place is well decorated and feels comfortable. Parking is a little tricky so I would definitely recommend taking a cab or bus here."
798957,16648178,2014-07-31,9268196,Isobel,We really enjoyed our stay in Boston and this was made all the better for having such a lovely place to stay in.  Ed was incredibly helpful and responsive ahead of time which was great for me as we were a family of four travelling from the UK.  The apartment is as stylish and comfortable as the images depict and was the quiet haven and larger space we needed following 5  full-on days in New York City.  The neighbourhood was very friendly and easy to walk to everything whether it be to the T or wandering into the Back Bay area.  Would definitely recommend it to others.
798957,17449907,2014-08-12,12033055,Nicole,Staying at Ed's duplex was great.  It looks exactly as pictured and was very clean.  The beds are both comfortable as well.  My friends and I had a great time there and would stay there again in the future.

He also provided me and my group tips on where to go, what restaurants to visit, and how to use public transport most efficiently."
The apartment itself was lovely,well maintained and very homely.  Location wise it was also great being only a short walk to some of the best restaurants and cafes in Boston.,,,,
It is also only short walk to some of the must see attractions like the Museum of Fine Arts and Fenway Park.,,,,,

We arrived in Boston late morning,and Edward graciously agreed to meet us at the apartment so we could store our bags before heading out to enjoy the city prior to check-in. He also gave us great recommendations on how to get around and where to eat. One that future guests should not miss out on is dinner at Carmen. Fabulous food and wine in a cozy and romantic setting. Edward,thanks so much for that recommendation!,,,
The apartment itself was wonderful. Well-appointed,quiet,and spotlessly clean right down to the white towels,wash cloths,and bed linens. The mattress was very comfortable and the pillows firm and fluffy. We all definitely slept very well!,
The fountains in the front and rear of the apartment added to the air of tranquility,"and the only improvement we could possibly think of would be the addition of some kind of outdoor space. But supposedly that’s being worked on. We wouldn’t hesitate to book at Edward’s place again.\"",,,,
798957,19257623,2014-09-09,11765930,Eveline,Edward hat uns auch spät Abends noch erwartet und in die Wohnung eingecheckt. Bereits Tage zuvor bekamen wir von ihm die genaue Beschreibung betr. Anfahrt und wie wir in die Wohnung eintreten können. Die Wohnung liegt in einem sehr schönen Viertel. Wir haben praktisch alle Besichtigungen zu Fuss gemacht. Tolle Lokale zum Essen und Bars nur ein paar Strassen entfernt.
798957,19403401,2014-09-12,9749181,Kelly,"Beautiful two level apartment below street level on a charming street of walk up brownstones. Exactly as photos. There is a coin operated washer and dryer just outside the door which was handy. Also all doors to the apartment are opened with a numerical code-which means, no need to worry about keys! If you are the type that travels with lots of luggage, just be warned that you'll have to carry your stuff up a spiral staircase to the bedrooms upstairs. The place is right around the corner from Tremont St, which is crowded with amazing restaurants - try The Kitchen, Pico, Butcher Shop. It is also a short walk to Washington St, where we had excellent cocktails and Poutine at The Gallows. All in all, loved our stay!"

Abbiamo scelto sul sito questo appartamento perché dalle foto ci pareva molto bello.,,,,,
Amici,... dal vivo l'appartamento è ancora più bello di quello che ci aspettavamo.,,,,
La pulizia dell'alloggio era perfetta,"maniacale. Tanto pulito che avremmo  \"\"potuto mangiare per terra\"\".",,,,

Ci ha dato delle indicazioni precise per raggiungere l'alloggio e si è messo a nostra disposizione per eventuali necessità.,,,,,
La casa era molto silenziosa ed il quartiere residenziale è tranquillo. E' vicina alla fermata del Bus 43 e non molto distante dalla stazione di Back Bay dove si trova la Metro - Orange line ed il treno.,,,,,
Nel nostro prossimo viaggio in Usa sicuramente passeremo da Ed per qualche giorno. Grazie Ed.,,,,,

Since we are from California, staying in Boston where there is \"\"cold weather\"\"  is completely different from our environment."
Ed's home was quiet,upscale,conveniently located and well prepared,not to mention... clean as a whistle!,,
The condo was well equipped with new supplies,high end appliances,kitchen ware,bedding and it had just been tastefully remodeled.  The gleaming wood floors and red brick walls truly gave us the Bostonian experience along with the spiral staircase and high ceilings.  The natural light in the bedrooms upstairs was warm and inviting and just begged us to cozy up with a book and take a nap,both of which we did.  It was a joy to look out through the oversized windows to see rain,amber colored leaves still on the fall trees and stoops festively decorated for the season.  The location was ideal since we were within minutes from the Prudential building

798957,31418604,2015-05-05,6356657,Edward,"Edward's place is really nice.  It is located in a very convenient part of town.  The bedroom on the back side of the house is beautiful.  The bedroom on the front side is a little noisy because is next to the front entrance where everyone is coming in and out.  The photos make the place look nicer than it actually is.  The pictures make it look like a model home.  But, in reality, it is a very normal place.  I thought that it was overly priced.  These days, you could book a really nice hotel room in Boston for a reasonable rate.  Given what we paid, I would have rather stayed at a fancy hotel booked at a discount rate online.  There were apparently tenants below us too, and they were not very friendly.  Overall our stay here was underwhelming."

The duplex is fabulous and thoughtfully decorated, with great attention to the fine details such as luxurious sheets, towels, pillows and duvets. I loved browsing Ed's great movie and esoteric book collection as well, all tastefully available to the guests. The apartment is in a superb, convenient and quiet location in the South End, near many restaurants and public transportation. I was also happy to find that there was a Boston Sports Club gym with a lap pool nearby as well -- for those who are looking for a gym -- and the running trails along the Charles River only about 1/2 mile away.

The apartment is spacious and has a good layout:  Large bedrooms upstairs with desks in case you need to work, and a large living space downstairs for relaxing and eating.  The neighborhood is quiet, yet it is close to restaurants and shopping."
The apartment was clean,and Ed is very communicative and personable.  He was proactive in suggesting places to park or eat,and made it very clear how to contact him if we needed any help.  The one request we had (we were low on toilet paper) was addressed in five minutes!  The beds were comfortable and the towels were of good quality.  Plenty of hot water,and a pay washer and dryer were in the hallway just outside our door.,,
On check-out there were a few little things we mentioned that could be improved (such as adding dish towels and fixing a loose towel rack).  Ed said that he would fix them immediately,"and I have little doubt that the place will be even better next time.\"",,,,

798957,45764333,2015-09-06,26412824,Gary,Edward was a wonderful host.  The home is absolutely beautiful.  The location is excellent. It seemed like everything was in walking distance or a short Uber ride (which we used for the first time.)
There was plenty of space for my wife and I and our two teenage daughters so that we all were able to not be on top of each other all the time.  The girls loved being able to go out and check out the nearby shops on Tremont St.,,,,,
I can not recommend Edward highly enough,"it's a beautiful space and a great location.\"",,,,
798957,46464294,2015-09-11,19176505,Kyle,"It's in a great location and very swanky with a lot of little details that make you feel welcome. The neighborhood is historic and has that old turn of the last century feel but the interior is definitely modernized. The air conditioner was a welcome surpirse because I had no idea how hot Boston gets. The 3 doors you have to get through are a little tricky at first but simple once you get the hang of it. For the 2 of us who stayed it was hundreds cheaper than staying in the hotel near the convention and 10 times better. An Uber was always only 5 or 10 minutes away. Some features: High ceilings, modern cabinetry, super fluffy thick towels, super quiet dishwasher, coffee in the kitchen, WiFi, huge flat screen with DirecTV and Hulu and more, great location. Ed was always quick to reply to any messages, he even let us store our bags in the foyer for a few hours until the flight and came out to greet us upon departure."

The decor was beautiful,  living room has black sleek office furniture, not that comfortable.  A short walk to the main downtown area thru an old neighborhood that was very charming with old brownstones that were really beautiful.  Ed invited us to see the view from his loft apartment.

Edward is an attentive and congenial host.  We would definitely stay at Edward's place again!"
798957,85453604,2016-07-11,46364621,Karen,"Edward was a wonderful host and very welcoming. We really loved the accommodations ans had everything we needed. The neighborhood is very nice and quiet. The residents of the area are very quiet and expect the same from quests. So just be aware . Overall, we had a fantastic experience and would return."
798957,86093242,2016-07-14,2538776,Nate,"Edward and his place were both exceptional. I don't feel like I need to write a long review, because all anyone needs to know is that the house is completely as advertised. Amazing location, super-clean, well appointed and truly memorable. With two young girls, we probably weren't the standard guests for the place, but Edward went out of his way to personally welcome my whole family, provide recommendations and keep us up to speed with everything happening both at the house and in the neighborhood. A truly great ambassador for AirBNB and a very easy recommendation for anyone going to Boston."

798957,88148752,2016-07-23,14990408,Angie,I stayed at Ed's place with my Mom for a couple days while exploring Boston and we really had a nice time. We were actually sad to leave.
The apartment is very nicely decorated and quite spacious. The beds are very comfortable and having the 2nd bathroom is great. The location is perfect and we ended of walking most of the time,as we found most things in the city that we wanted to see were in walking distance of the apartment. The neighborhood itself is very nice,with lots of places to eat nearby. We enjoyed The Buttery and Gaslight,just to name a few.,,

Upon arrival there were a couple of miscues out of Gustavo's hands that he tried to remedy quickly.  The location was great and easily within walking distance to the Fenway area and the roommates were all quiet and accommodating.
5832127,35702628,2015-06-21,34747135,Terra,Gustavo was great at communicating with us and making sure we had contacts at his apartment.  This is a private room in a shared apartment.

The house is located quite close to 2 T stations - 10 minutes if you walk, and the locality is also pretty good. We got back from the movies at 1AM one night and didn't face any problems at all. Gustavo wasn't in town during our trip, but he responded promptly to my messages. His roommates are wonderful people who're extremely friendly and quite willing to help you out if you need anything. The only unsatisfactory part was that the air conditioning did not work in our room, though it was quite alright in the hallways."

In this particular apartment,the dining table was wedged between the kitchen counter and the window - quite unusable (does not look like the picture with the listing).  Listing says 3 real beds,but the unit really has 2 queen beds and a pull out sofa bed,with uncomfortable mattress. When renting an apartment,I am used to having some basic pantry items in the kitchen - i.e. salt,pepper
The listing agent is a professional who deals with many properties,so did everything that was professionally required,but was very hard to deal with otherwise.  Any questions above and beyond the listing were not dealt with common courtesy.,,,

She replied to my txt msg on anything and even drove me to catch my plane when the taxi didn't show up in the morning.  ( I feel terrible about that since it was 6 am in the morning). Michelle insisted.   She is a genuine Bostoner and as kind as they get I can only assume?,,,,,
Roxbury is not down town but close enough.  The flat is spacious an shared with two other apartments.   No conflicts what so ever.  Michelle is a decent baker and although you should not expect it,she might leave a cake or a pie or just something for you to nibble on.   Good place of you will be spending some time in the Longwood mefical area.,,,,

1374434,22801514,2014-11-15,8017192,Carol,"From the memoent I arrived so early, Michelle made me feel welcome and appreciated. The visit resounded with warmth and hospitality and Michelle's careful attention to my needs. The room and bed were A++...very comfortable and cozy. Clean bathroom and amicable house guest! It was a wonderful experience all-around."
1374434,24407233,2014-12-28,6883400,Katja,"\"Michelle is a great host and much more than \"\"just\"\" a landlady. She does everything to make her guests feel comfortable. We even got a Christmas tree"
"Thank you Michelle!\"",,,,,
1374434,28978375,2015-04-02,15664584,Molly,"Michelle welcomed me and helped me with the big adjustment of moving from sunny Alabama to New England during Boston's snowiest winter on record. She was always incredibly helpful and responsive to any requests, and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in her house. The room is as pictured--it's small, but always nice and warm (super important!). The area feels safe and is close to public transportation. Michelle will advise you about finding anything you need, from grocery stores to the best route to take places! She even gave me good advice when looking for a permanent place to live in Boston. I stayed with Michelle for about two and a half months, and I had a rotating international cast of roommates, who were all generally respectful and kind. I never had any issues, and I enjoyed our occasional potluck dinners! I would highly recommend Michelle as a host and this room as a great place to stay!"
1374434,30033917,2015-04-16,29447861,Rapolas,"I arrived to Michelle's home on my first evening in Boston. I was also my first evening in the U.S. and my first time on airbnb. Being a wonderful host, Michelle did everything to make me feel welcome. She gave me valuable advice and support (a reference!) in my search for permanent housing, and everyday life in Boston. During my stay, I really felt at home. At the same time, I had just as much privacy as I needed. The room and common areas (shared with another two visiting students at Harvard) were clean. I spent there 8 nights and the only thing is could regret is not to have booked the room for a longer period."
1374434,30374942,2015-04-21,23268186,Alec,"Michelle was very accommodating and flexible with my needs for check-in and check out. She is also very welcoming and hospitable in making sure I was taken care of. The house itself was beautiful, and close to public transport. A great place to stay in Boston!"
1374434,32880736,2015-05-23,26953954,Quentin,"I spent a really nice month in Michelle's house. It was my first trip in US, and Michelle was very welcoming and helpful. The first day she walked with me from the house to the train station and to the place where I worked. Always smiling, full of energy, it's just perfect for a guest who discover Boston and the US. For my first stay with airbnb, I'm not disappointed at all ! And last but not least, her muffins are delicious ! Thank you for all."
1374434,33366200,2015-05-27,29472591,Chantal,"\"Michelle seemed like a lovely woman and I can see why people would enjoy her company. However I felt as though there was a discrepancy with the photos of the room and the actual room. The room was extremely dusty and dirty despite Michelle saying that the place is \"\"professionally cleaned\"\". I found quite a few dead bugs in the room that should've been cleaned up. There was also a lot of flies"
1374434,41573252,2015-08-08,27106272,Rick,Nice bedroom; great and friendly host that really cared about my well-being. The neighborhood is near the T which got me around the city pretty easily. Overall 5/5!
1374434,56908365,2015-12-20,1521655,Felix,"I stayed at Michelle's place for nearly four months and I had an amazing time. Michelle was always very helpful and made my stay very easy. The place was very clean, perfectly equipped and central to the city as I was studying at Northeastern University."
"I can absolutely recommend the place!\"",,,,,
1374434,67122977,2016-03-27,43794173,Tabatha,"Michelle is a considerate, thoughtful host. She made time to check in periodically to see if I needed anything, and if I did, she was always available within 24 hours. She also arranged and prepared occasional dinners and treats - always delicious! The room is small, but I also brought more than what I needed for my three month stay, and I managed to make it work. The bed is comfortable and the room is quiet although it is connected to the bathroom (the city door is not used and is blocked by a dresser for privacy and extra storage).  I also traveled with a car, and always found easy parking in front of the house. The Roxbury neighborhood itself is low to middle class; the neighbors are friendly and it's an easy walk to Back Bay, South End, Brookline, and other surrounding areas. It's completely comfortable during the day (caveat: I am from Chicago, so my standards may be a little lower than someone not from a large city), but I made it a point to return to the apt before the sun went down as some areas on the walk back (not the neighborhood itself) feel a little sketchy.  Overall, this was a positive experience and I would stay here again. Thanks Michelle!"
1374434,94421936,2016-08-15,44830529,Clara,"My stay was perfect, I stayed 6 months and everything was perfect. She always cared if I needed something. I absolutly recomend staying here. 10/10"
6446940,35494914,2015-06-19,34788726,Christopher,"We never saw Ismail, but were actually hosted by his roommate. He was friendly. Since we were out most of the day, evening, and night, we only saw him twice during our two night stay. The location was great. Close enough to downtown and within walking distance of interesting places, including a large beautiful nature park. We really enjoyed the city's Hubway bicycle rental system and there are bike parking stations within walking distance from the apartment."
Pros:,,,,,
* Extremely close to a subway stop on the green line.,,,,,
* Close enough to Hubway bicycle rental stations.,,,,,
* Clean enough.,,,,,
* Two bathrooms,so you're not in the way of them getting ready for work.,,,,
* We came in very late at night both nights. We were very quiet and respectful and it did not seem to be a problem.,,,,,
* There's a great little college dive bar just a couple minutes walk from the apartment. Cheap drinks and a relaxed atmosphere. We really enjoyed it.,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
* There were no bedsheets or towels available. You are expected to bring your own. This was massively inconvenient since we stayed there the night we flew in and didn't particularly want to pack these items with us. This is the only reason I'm giving 4 stars out of 5. To be fair,it does say this in the listing,but it's still quite inconvenient.,,,
* Had to plan to pick up the key after 6 pm,"since the host wasn't home from work before then. This was only mildly inconvenient for us.\"",,,,
6446940,36130598,2015-06-25,24679737,Samantha,Perfect for a single night stay for a baseball game
6446940,43687730,2015-08-21,38731297,Monya,"Perfect location, the train is nearby. The room is clean and nice but it'd be better if it has ac cuz it's kinda hot sometimes even there's a fan. Two male roommates are friendly and very nice people. It was a very pleasant experience to stay here!"
6446940,83779027,2016-07-04,80539236,James,"SPOILER ALERT: black mold, filth, trash, and a disgusting bathroom"
So here's the deal,I paid a total of $110 and what I got was a dirty room and apartment that looked more like a college dorm.,,,,
- the bedroom was filthy with things all over the carpet,trash laying on the floor and the trash can was full from other people,and everything was just generally dirty.,,,
- the bathroom that is shared with another roommate was absolutely disgusting.,,,,,
-there is black mold all over the drywall around the shower and cracks.,,,,,
- the rest of the apartment is more like a college dorm with filth and trash and clutter laying everywhere,which makes it pretty much unusable.,,,,
- every surface is filthy and my girlfriend hesitated to even use the toilet.,,,,,
- the toilet has a pretty nasty bidet that looks like it is 5 years old attach to it.,,,,,
- the shower tub doesn't drain well,so the filthy water was up to my calves before I was finished.,,,,
-there's no air conditioning in the entire apartment,the box fan that was set up by the bedroom window had dust caked on the outside.,,,,
The Host is out of the country which is why he has his room up for airbnb,so I had to deal with his roommate. He was pleasant,but it would have been nice to deal directly with the host instead of some roommate who isn't invested in the system.,,,
The thing is,if I paid $30 just for a place to sleep it would have been fine,but for $110 I thought my girlfriend and I would be staying in a nice place while visiting Boston for the first time. but what we got are good memories of Boston,and bad memories of our Airbnb experience.,,
For anything more than $40,"I don't recommend ever staying here. Ever.\"",,,,
6322283,33632912,2015-05-30,3514570,Oliver & Christina,Der Aufenthalt bei Pam war einfach fantastisch.
Der Wegbeschreibung von Green Street Station zur Wohnung konnte ich in dieser sehr ruhigen,angenehmen Nachbarschaft leicht folgen und Pam sagte sogar einen Termin ab,um mir einen herzlichen Empfang zu bereiten (ich hatte durch den Berufsverkehr ein bisschen Verspätung). Es war als besuchte ich einen guten alten Freund.,,,
Die Wohnung war sehr liebevoll eingerichtet,das Zimmer ruhig und hell. Am Morgen hörte man die Vögel zwitschern. Alles war sauber und aufgeräumt.,,,,
Pam war eine sehr zuvorkommende Gastgeberin,versorgte mich mit hilfreichen Informationen,Cafe und sogar ihrem Fahrrad,dass ich mir zweimal ausleihen durfte.,,
Ich kam nach Boston um uns hier für ein Jahr eine Wohnung zu suchen und Pam hat massgeblich dazu beigetragen,dass ich mich für Jamaica Plains als neue Nachbarschaft für meine Familie entschieden  habe. Ich freue mich,jemanden wie Pam in meiner Nachbarschaft zu wissen.,,,
Herzlichen Dank!,,,,,
"Oliver\"",,,,,
6322283,36701363,2015-06-30,6736740,Laurence,I stayed at Pam's place for a good two weeks while looking for a more permanent accommodation in Boston. Pam's place is a 'home-away-from-home.' The room gets a lot of the morning sun which is really nice.
Pam made my stay in her place a very welcoming one. She spent a good amount of time explaining where I should focus my search . Without this insider information,the process would have been a difficult one.,,,,
Highly recommended for AirBnBers looking for a quiet,"close to the T place in Boston!\"",,,,
6322283,37437630,2015-07-06,25720609,Mariana,"Pam was very accommodating and flexible to let my partner and I, along with our small dog, stay at her place for 1 night. I stayed in the bedroom meanwhile my bf slept on the pull out couch in the living room. We were also lucky to park in the driveway since the neighbor was leaving for the night. She also gave us great advice about Boston neighborhoods and where to move, in addition to a reference in JP. Thanks for all the help!"
6322283,40184535,2015-07-28,36429045,Gary,A delightful and pleasant experience.  Pam is a terrific host and the location was great.

6322283,45393454,2015-09-02,38483505,Etta,"Pam was an absolutely wonderful host, making me feel comfortable and at home in a new city. She was flexible as my timing changed, was generous with her home and kitchen, and the bedroom was darling. I truly appreciated how helpful she was in telling me how to get around. She accommodated my having a cat, and let her wander which was so nice. I would highly recommend staying with Pam, especially if you're looking to live in a comfortable, diverse neighborhood. I have no complaints!"
6322283,47830155,2015-09-21,43635566,Luis,"A quiet and comfortable place, made my stay in Boston very pleasant.   I would certainly return."
6322283,48124150,2015-09-23,9669446,Emily,Pam provided a perfect place for my brief stay in Boston. The location was excellent - on a quiet street a few blocks from the train. The bedroom was comfy and beautifully sunny in the morning as described. Pam provided good directions to an excellent place nearby for breakfast. I would definitely stay there again!
6322283,48465971,2015-09-26,35230667,Georg,"This is a very pleasant, quiet place in Jamaica Plain.  It is close to the subway and convenient for heading to downtown Boston.  Pam is an excellent hostess.  I would stay there again if I am in the Boston area at some time in the future."
6322283,50334602,2015-10-11,7652178,Jan,"I enjoyed my stay at Pam's. I appreciated the quiet neighborhood, big window with light streaming in and proximity to all JP has to offer as well as easy access to the T. Thanks to Pia for welcoming me, and next time I hope to meet Pam."

The neighborhood is quite fantastic with lots of great restaurants,bars and little mom n pop shops.,,,,
Pam's place is very cozy,welcoming and comfortable. It's very close to the orange line if one wants to explore the city.,,,,

The apartment was lived in but clean and comfortable. There was more than enough space for 2 couples each with their own bathrooms. Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks are at street level right outside the apartment. We caught a game at Fenway which was only a 5 min walk away. I would definitely recommend staying here again!!

10231714,59419885,2016-01-10,7408423,Tae,Ben was a great host. He was at the property to personally hand us the keys and inform us of what/where everything was. The apartment was exactly as described: newly renovated and extremely clean. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks alot!
10231714,62707398,2016-02-16,52885182,Jim,"This was my first time using Airbnb so I had a fair amount of trepidation about trying it over just going with an overpriced local hotel. I can tell you that my experience with Ben and the accommodations could not have been a better. His place is very clean, the beds comfortable with a convenient location to Boston proper."
"Ben was an outstanding host who left coffee and other items for our convenience. He was responsive to any questions we had and I would absolutely come back and stay with him again. \"",,,,,
10231714,63075880,2016-02-20,53443994,David,"Ben is a very thoughtful host. We had no problems at all, and look forward to renting this property in the future."

10231714,63810304,2016-02-27,1619247,Sara,"Although we did not meet in person, Ben was a wonderful host and very easy to communicate with. We had a very smooth arrival as Ben gave us detailed instructions on how to access the apartment. The place is in a great location with lots of bars, restaurants, and supermarket nearby, and just steps from a few different public transportation options."
The apartment itself is very clean and well-equipped with furniture and new appliances. The apartment itself is very calm and hidden from street noise,"however I would suggest that any light sleepers bring earplugs as the heating occasionally made some funny noises. All in all a great experience and definitely would recommend!\"",,,,
10231714,64069818,2016-02-29,54802608,Elizabeth,"The apartment was exactly as described and pictured. It was easy to find, thanks to the host, Ben. He was also very easy to contact when we had questions, both before and during our stay. To say this location is close to the T is an understatement - the location is amazing! Such a wonderful setup and it made our stay in Boston a great deal!"
10231714,64379498,2016-03-03,58491864,Bonnie,Very nice and cozy place. My friends and I had a great time here. Close to subway and Boston University. Also there are great restaurants and grocery store around. Very clean and fast wifi. Also the owner prepared cute cups in the kitchen. The bed is comfortable and also the couch can be folded into a bed. There is also air mattress. The owner Ben is very patience and helpful. He gave us very clear directions for how to get in.
10231714,64906087,2016-03-09,30304577,David,Ben was very attentive and accommodating. The apt was really nice...definitely would go back anytime in Boston!!
10231714,65043273,2016-03-10,14985107,Summer,"Ben's apartment was fantastic. It was remarkably clean and comfortable. It is in an excellent location - you will be right next to the metro (only several stops away from downtown Boston), and very close to stores like Whole Foods, Target, and a large shopping center, along with restaurants and bars. It is within walking distance to the Back Bay and Fenway Park areas. The area is a quiet and calm neighborhood with little noise pollution. We particularly enjoyed the memory foam mattress, the kitchen, and the spaciousness of the apartment. It is a cozy apartment like the listing says, but only in terms of comfort, definitely not size. The high ceilings and the furniture layout make the apartment feel even larger than it is. It was only the two of us staying there, but I am sure it would be an equally great stay for groups of three or four - there is plenty of space. Ben was a great and flexible host. He was always available by phone and he made the check-in process very easy. Thanks for everything, Ben!"
10231714,65131620,2016-03-10,14862326,Jon,Great place and awesome location! Would deffintly stay here again!
10231714,65964219,2016-03-18,2127421,Samuel,Ben's apartment was a fantastic place for us to stay because it was literally steps away from the T station  (Green Line). This made getting to and fro extremely easy.
I appreciated the clear directions Ben gave us for checking in,finding his place,and making our way in. Without these instructions,we surely would have been lost.,,
Ben's apartment was clean,and the bathroom was especially tidy. The shower was a nice touch as well. Our one concern was that during the night,there were constant noises - they almost sounded like tapping or hammering - that seemed to be coming from the either the walls or ceilings. In any case,we got used to these sounds by the second night,but it did impact our first night's rest. I am a sound sleeper,but these sounds may have bothered a lighter sleeper.
Overall,"I would recommend this space due to its excellent location and clean and sleek amenities.\"",,,,
10231714,66157769,2016-03-20,53889643,Sara,"We had a seemless stay in this great apartment. Check in/check out was very easy, everything was exactly as it was portrayed online, and it was immaculate. I felt safe in the neighborhood and it was convenient to many things, including Fenway Park and the House of Blues."
10231714,66778875,2016-03-24,10411781,Roya,"Beautiful, clean, pristine. Just as pictured - but nicer! Entering the apartment from the muddy back alley, we weren't sure what to expect -- but the interior completely belies the exterior. So leave the blinds down and enjoy. As previous guests have said, the heating system is noisy, so light sleepers will want earplugs. Otherwise, everything was great. New and complete kitchen, clean bathroom with super fun shower head (multiple settings, including waterfall!), great lighting , comfortable beds and bedding. Location is easily walkable to Fenway Park or BU, and an easy Uber ride to Northeastern. Ben was great and very responsive to all queries."
10231714,67498960,2016-03-29,15587910,Matt,"A great location and super convenient to the T, BU, Fenway Park, Kenmore Sq and the Emerald Necklace, would totally stay here again!"
10231714,67607638,2016-03-30,33318164,Carlo,Apartment was extremely clean and cozy. All the necessary accommodations were in place. Our stay was short but would revisit again if in the area. Highly recommended.
10231714,67889286,2016-04-01,18024924,Haley,Ben has a very nice place! Easy to get in and very close access to the T station to take you anywhere in the city!
10231714,68306789,2016-04-04,22547381,Margaret,"Ben's apartment was the perfect spot for us! My daughter and I were visiting Boston for an event. The apartment is in an older building just a few steps from the Fenway T stop. We easily made the trip in to TD Garden in 30 minutes. It is a cute neighborhood with both large commercial stores ie: Target and small businesses like local bakeries, a wine shop and a small Whole Foods. The apartment is very modern with a new kitchen and bathroom, lots of natural light and plenty of bright white fluffy linens and pillows. There is also a small deck with a table and chairs outside the back door."
Ben was a gracious host who was accessible through phone and text,but gave us plenty of privacy. He was also very kind to accommodate our time frame which was slightly outside the published times.,,,,
"We will definitely stay with Ben again should we return to Boston!\"",,,,,
10231714,68749293,2016-04-06,2658836,Andrew,"Ben's apartment was centrally located right next to the Fenway tram stop, it was easy to get into and all instructions were easy to follow. The apartment was clean, well laid out and all linen, amenities etc. were provided by Ben. It was a little noisy, but nothing that a pair of earbuds couldn't fix up! If I was in Boston I'd happily stay at Ben's again."
10231714,68798575,2016-04-06,43357896,Carlos,Ben was super clear about how to get into the apartment.  And was responsive to my questions.  I enjoyed staying in the apartment.
10231714,69087087,2016-04-09,58804663,Matt,Ben's apartment was super clean and very comfortable to stay at even for a family of 4. Everything we needed was there and Ben was very proactive in ensuring we got everything we needed.
10231714,69827185,2016-04-13,65495292,Lynn,"This place was perfect! My husband, mother in paw and our infant all were very comfortable here. The apartment t was the perfect place for me to visit with a friend over a glass of wine whilemy husband and his mom took in a red Sox game. On-site parking was great! The place was clean and comfortable. We will be back and will recommend this to our friends!"
10231714,70048396,2016-04-15,33473996,Alvin,"Good: really clean, well-furnished yet not cluttered/ responsive host/ safe neighbourhood and near public transport."
Not great: tapping noises on the ceiling throughout the night (not Ben's fault),,,,,
I really liked staying at Ben's place,it was near a supermarket,food places,a mall,and train station. And near Fenway park stadium too! (for baseball lovers). We felt safe walking around at night too and Ben's place came with parking which was awesome.,
The only thing that bugged me was that when i was trying to sleep,there were constantly tapping noises on the ceiling. I talked to the neighbours upstairs but they said they did not do it. I asked Ben if it had to do with water pipes or something which he helped me to check,but my second night still had the same sounds throughout.,,,
Tl;dr: tapping noises at night. Not a problem if you're a heavy sleeper,but avoid if you're a light sleeper. Apart from that,"definitely recommended!\"",,,
10231714,70645478,2016-04-19,29832272,Andrew,"The apartment is very nicely renovated and well equipped for a pleasure or business traveller.  Perfectly located next to Fenway T Line and also close to good cafes, restaurants, and Wholefoods.  The only minor issue is that the drapes don't block out the light of the city at night, and as an older building the pipes make noise that is noticeable at night.  We did not meet Ben but the instructions to enter and collect the key are clear and he was very responsive."
10231714,70957528,2016-04-22,24258899,Ryan,"Very nice, simple apartment and was accurately described in the posting. Location is outstanding and communication with Ben was great."
10231714,71142328,2016-04-24,28658414,Stephanie,"Ben was super welcoming in providing up with plenty of super detailed information on how to access the apartment and where to find everything we needed. The apartment was in a great location as advertised, very clean and comfortable.  Ben was also very quick in responding to any questions or concerns before and during our stay. Could not have asked for anything more! Thanks for a great stay!"
10231714,71644999,2016-04-27,19405384,Emily,What a great stay my husband and I just had at Ben's place.
First of all,Ben is supremely organized,and ahead of the trip he provided detailed instructions (including photos and videos!) to aid in checking in to the apartment.,,,
Too bad my iphone was misbehaving,because when we got there I had to call Ben to refresh my memory about a few things.  I felt terrible because he had so clearly and comprehensively outlined everything beforehand,but...He was patient and gracious and so warm.,,,
The place is perfectly located,near two different MBTA stops and near a great cafe (Tatte Cafe on Beacon St.) in one direction,and convenience shopping in the other direction.,,,
The apartment itself is comfortable,clean,and quiet. Great shower,and  I loved the mattress (firm). It was thoughtfully stocked with plenty of towels and tp,shampoo and soap,and I used the iron and ironing board.  There are plenty of electrical outlets
In short,everything was as described and Ben could not be a better host.  Highly recommended.,,,,

10231714,72455387,2016-05-02,59789142,Dara,"The apartment was nice, clean, and extremely close to all Boston has to offer! We had a wonderful time and highly recommend staying here if you visit the area."
10231714,72816916,2016-05-04,2822132,Chitra,"No frills! Ben's apartment was tidy and had all the necessities you would need for a few days stay: fresh towels, clean linens, a nice kitchen stocked with dishes and utensils.  It was pretty spacious for an apartment downtown. There is also a huge flat screen TV.  Although there aren't many channels on it, we hooked it up to our computer and enjoyed some Netflix on a rainy night. The location was very convenient - close to the T, and a few decent restaurants nearby."
Ben was great - provided detailed instructions on how to get to the apartment,where to park,and how to open the door.  We arrived in Boston a few hours early,so asked him if we might park our car in the spot a little early.  He responded immediately that the apartment was ready and we could check in right away.  Just a word of caution that you have to walk through an alley to get to the back entrance. At night it gets dark and muddy when it rains,so best to have someone with you. It was a challenge to enter the apartment from the front entrance,so we just used the back.
Two things to keep in mind: the bed is extremely firm (I think memory foam). I'm sure some would love it,but it was too hard for me to sleep on.  Additionally,because the building is so old,"the pipes/air ducts make a lot of noise all night.  We were not able to sleep well either nights due to all the noise.   \"",,
10231714,73455231,2016-05-08,27752298,Danchen,Ben's place was easy to find. The back alley parking entrance was a little bit tricky but it does have two entrances on Park drive. The road condition was not very good and you will probably encounter several puddles along the way to the parking spot. Just beware of this especially if your have a lower-body car. The apartment was pretty nice and clean. It is exactly what Ben described on the website. We walked from the apartment to copley place and it was about 15 - 20 minutes walk depending on your pace. My parents have never been to Boston and they like the streets and atmosphere here a lot! We will definitely recommend this place to other friends!
10231714,74018962,2016-05-12,29349252,Guilherme,The apartment is really comfortable and well located! By the check in time everything was clean and set! Ben is very organized and I had no problem whatsoever. I'll definitely consider staying here again on my next visit to Boston.
10231714,74427967,2016-05-15,35154614,Allison,"Staying in this apartment was a wonderful experience!  As a first time Air BnB user, our host and living space were delightful. Our host, Ben, was very accommodating, giving us specific instructions about how to enter the apartment.  Inside the one bedroom space there was a beautiful up-to-date kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom, and even a little porch outside that allowed for direct alley access to and from the apartment. This was especially nice for parking. The space was spacious for our party of three adults. The apartment was fully equipped with kitchen utensils, coffee maker, and towels for the bathroom as well as toiletries.  There were ample sheets, pillows and blankets.  The apartment was immaculate.  A short walk to the Fenway T stop and complimentary parking in the back made the stay highly convenient.  I would book this place again with Ben without hesitation. This was an overwhelming positive experience and I have nothing negative to say."
10231714,75146627,2016-05-19,43737519,Chad,"Ben's place was fantastic for us - great location with easy access to the T (subway), good size (not too big or too small), clean, neat, and easy to get to."
Our primary needs in Boston were the right location and right price. Ben's place fit on both accounts with a short trip on the T to Boston Common (and therefore all other areas of Boston) and a price that beat out most other Hotels in the area.,,,,,
The apartment was just the right size,providing us with plenty of space to move around without feeling like we wasted expense by not being there. It was clean and ready for us early on our check-in day. The building is older and you can hear others from time-to-time,but that's part of the charm,for me. We never once had an issue with any of it.,,
We were close to Fenway (a few blocks walk) and had local restaurants not far at all.,,,,,
Ben was a great communicator and provided us with all the information we needed in plenty of time for review. His directions made sense and the video/pictures made finding the place a breeze.,,,,,
I would definitely do it again without hesitation and wouldn't bat an eye at its location compared to other areas of the city.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
10231714,76485144,2016-05-27,62082842,Jenny,"First off, Ben provided incredibly detailed instructions to make our arrival very smooth.  Then we got to the apartment and it was better even than the photos!  It was so conveniently located for us and the amenities were perfect to suit our needs.  Even had a private little porch so we could enjoy the beautiful night!   A+++++!"

He not only waited exactly on time to hand over the keys,but also was open to pick them back up at the end of my stay.  The apartment was spotless and clean with washed sheets,towels and other accessories,which are always appreciated.,,

8737466,50575635,2015-10-12,4005317,James,"The apartment was clean and just as described in the listing. It's not the biggest place, but is more than sufficient as a place to rest after busy days exploring the city. It is in one of the best locations in Boston - quiet upscale neighborhood and close to everything.  I didn't use the kitchen, but the bathroom was tidy, the bed was comfortable and the linens were soft and clean. Raul was super flexible with my arrival and departure. I was delayed several times due to incoming flights and he was more than accommodating to hand off the keys.  Highly recommend!"
8737466,51785126,2015-10-24,1771938,Craig,"\"This is a studio apartment in a fantastic location in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston, a block from the \"\"Cheers\"\" bar. It faces the back of the building which overlooks the alley so it is very quiet. A partial wall provides visual privacy between the queen bed and the rest of the apartment. The benefit of the location combined with the quiet building is really great."
Raul is a new host so we are offering tips on how to make his place a better rental. I would suggest bringing in a professional cleaning crew after each guest. If you,Raul,are living here when not renting it,you need to have it cleaned before the guests arrive. It was not dirty,but it was lived in,and it is an older unit with only a few upgrades over the years
It really is a great little place,and when staying in a city like Boston,location is everything. I will stay here again if it is available on my next trip to Boston. Raul was easy to communicate with by email and text. Thanks Raul,"and best wishes on becoming a great host!\"",,

His place is very spacious for a studio and has a great setup with a good air conditioner, the water pressure is good and water is hot.  The location is so near the Boston Gardens and Common and Newbury Street/Copley.  The street is quiet.  The fridge is a good size.  There is a bit of a urine smell in the hall but no smell at all in his apartment.  It is like an oasis after a long day of work or a long day of sightseeing."

Upon arrival, she was so friendly and welcoming. They even had cute snack sets for all of us - talk about adorable! Their apartment was very neat, clean and comfortable, and they were very gracious with everything we could ever need or want. They clearly put a lot of thought into their listing, with a great attention to detail and an abundance of recommendations and ideas to do in the Boston area. Words cannot express how welcoming they made us feel. They both had a great spirit and attitude that surrounded them. My friends and I really enjoyed staying with them, and would highly recommend them to all."

They weren't home when we arrived, but left a lockbox with the keys in it to make it very easy for us to get in. The apartment was very clean and looks just like the pictures. The bed/pull out couch wasn't the most comfy bed, but it did the job for a short stay. Their kitties were super friendly and very entertaining! The apartment was in a great location and very close to two different train stations, which makes it so easy to get into downtown! I would definitely recommend staying with them!"

They gave us a good sense of what their community is like so we felt very comfortable walking around and interacting with people.The neighborhood is great -lots of terrific restaurants and shops as well as safe and comfortable walking about, even at night. There was even a list in our room of local businesses we might enjoy and sights we might like to see. Our hosts are warm and welcoming people and the accommodations were just right! Also, the aero press makes a Great cup of coffee! The private parking made things super easy for us too. We would absolutely book with them again if we're visiting Boston!

We only had a short time with our hosts, but they were great company and made us feel at home. We had a great night's sleep too!"
4820071,34626092,2015-06-10,29444871,Ilia,Francine was a wonderful and friendly host whose two cats made the experience feel extra welcoming and special.

This is my first time using an airbnb and it was fabulous thanks to our amazing hosts!  Miles, their adorable cat, is an amazing host too! ;)"
"Thanks again Francine and Patrick!\"",,,,,
4820071,34815815,2015-06-12,33535967,Christian,"We arrived in Boston in the middle of the night and found Francine's place to be conveniently close to the airport. The keys waited in a lockbox, the bed was ready and we had a great sleep. Also the host put some water and some small things to eat, which we found very nice. But the best thing were the super friendly cats, that welcomed us immediately and were very enjoyable company. We highly recommend that place and thank Francine and Patrick for making this early/late arrival possible. Thanks"

More than the beautiful house, our host really deserve the ranking as \"\"super host\"\". Francine and Patrick are friendly"
4820071,35474001,2015-06-19,33083203,Sarah,Great location for easy access to Boston Logan airport.  The hosts were very friendly and welcoming.  They had great suggestions of places to eat and explore.  We definitely enjoyed our stay.  Thank you!
4820071,35540740,2015-06-20,9105604,Leah,"Very easy to find and was a good fit for our trip (landed at midnight in Logan and had to go back to the airport for our rental car in the morning). The two friendly cats made the stay extra special. It's not a private place, so there is some noise and sharing of the bathroom. Noise woke us up a little earlier than we wanted, but it really was okay because we needed to get up early anyways to get back to the airport.  I would recommend it for a similar trip (staying near the airport)."
4820071,36101443,2015-06-25,2459620,Gladys,"Francine and her husband Patrik were the best hosts we had during our two week (a total of 10 Airbnb booked) road trip around New England!!! The room was perfect, with lots of city info & maps, a very comfortable bed and they even had the cot ready for my son when we got there. We were welcomed by their super friendly and handsome cat, Miles. A second cat, Tres Leches, peeked from behind the bedroom door. The room comes with a parking space in a nearby lot, which was extremely appreciated (most street parking is by permit only), but also the train station is 5-10min walk away from the place. The days that we got back home on the earlier side, we hung out with them like we've known each other our whole life. Eating ice cream, talking about our day and sharing pictures. If we find ourselves in Boston again, Francine and Patrik will be the first ones to get a call!! :) Thank you guys for being awesome!"
4820071,36167498,2015-06-26,27705883,Susanne,"Francine and Patrick are wonderful hosts and we felt welcome at their place. The apartment is just as seen in the pictures, our room was clean and tidy and had everything we needed even extra blankets and drinks,snacks. our kids loved the friendly cats which provided entertainment for them. The close proximity to the airport makes it ideal for travel and the neighborhood seems safe, with lots of restaurants and a nice park to walk in. We were so happy to have found a place to stay, at a fraction of the cost of a hotel and would definitely recommend staying with Francine."
4820071,36330931,2015-06-27,36116637,Fred,We only stayed with Francine for one night and she was very welcoming and helped us out with what to do during our stay in Boston. If I ever return to Boston I will definitely come stay with Francine again if possible.

The room was very comfortable,  and their cats may have changed my opinion on felines. They gave great suggestions to nearby restaurants,  and we're quick to lend a hand when needed."
4820071,38133480,2015-07-13,16748024,Daniel,"Stayed one night on my way to New Hampshire. Apartment is walking distance (after a short ride on airport bus) from Logan airport - even with a suitcase and guitar. Neighborhood has a number of good restaurants nearby so convenient to get dinner. Francine recommended several. The bedroom was fine - bed very comfortable. Apartment was totally quiet at night. Shared bath worked out OK. My hosts were friendly and engaging and eager to make sure I had everything I needed. Got a lesson in a Aero coffee press which proved to be a superior device to my Melita. Communications from the initial contact when booking through pre-arrival, to arrival were excellent and she was quick to respond to any question. I'd stay there again if I take the same trip next year. Good alternative to $300/ night airport hotel."
4820071,38486342,2015-07-16,26298684,Paul,"Francine has been a great host. She cared about a lot of details. The apartment is super clean and very convenient: one metro station to the Aquarium, quiet location. In addition Francine offers a parking for the car, which is very welcome inBoston area. I do recommend strongly this place and Francine should be acknowledged for her constant availability in answering question and providing the best assistance possible"

Instructions on how to get in were provided well in advance and Francine (the host) was very welcoming and friendly. We really enjoyed talking with her and she helped us find places we would want to go and communicated with us throughout our trip. We loved her cats as well. The room was very nice with plenty of room for our luggage and we were provided with nice towels and baskets of toiletries. This was such a great stay and we would definitely want to do it again!"

This was perfect for us,as we needed to get to the airport for a very late night flight. It's a great multi-ethnic neighbourhood with some good cheap eateries (beats the airport!). Some fight find it a little edgy,but as a mother and young daughter we never had a problem.,,,
Francine answered my many questions promptly and in detail - such a shame we didn't get to meet in the end,but the amazing cats were wonderful hosts and Miles has the loudest purr!,,,,
This was our first airbnb stay but it won't be our last,"and hopefully not our only visit to this home. Thank you so much! \"",,,,

They were there when we arrived and Patrik helped us carry our bags in, while Francine showed us our room, gave us information about how to use the subway system and access activity information, and was helpful in general navigation issues throughout our stay. We were even able to do a load of laundry during our stay. The listing description was accurate and there were not any surprises about the accommodations, parking, etc. We really enjoyed getting to know Francine, Patrik, Miles, and Tres (their two wonderful cats) and found them to be warm, responsive, and very gracious."
"The quality of the neighborhood was fine. We were frequently walking home from the subway station after dark and never felt concerned for our well being or that of our 12 year old daughter.\"",,,,,

And this even more, because we did not have to struggle with our baggage the day after, as we could leave it at her appertment until we had to go to the airport in the evening. So many thanks for that!! It is very good that the airport station can be reached by foot in less than ten minutes, from where the free shuttles to the terminals leave."
We also enjoyed the lovely two cats,"they are really social and open to foreigners ;-)\"",,,,
4820071,43480255,2015-08-20,5827658,Dariel,Francine's place looks exactly like the photos. The room was nice but a bit tight for 3 of us especially when we each had a big luggage. However the apartment was very clean and the bathroom was beautiful. The best thing(s) about the apartment had to be the 2 cute cats! Miles and his friend would come visit us in the room when we came back after sight-seeing. Francine was helpful from the time I booked her apartment and gave good advice on where we could eat when we arrived. Thanks again Francine for hosting us.
4820071,43669776,2015-08-21,20210937,Paula,"Great place and very convenient location.  Unfortunately, we were unable to stay through the night due to a work related emergency.

They had a lot of helpful information in packets in our room and were very helpful in answering our questions and giving us recommendations. I would definitely recommend staying here.

Francine and her husband were very helpful: we had a problem with our taxi, who left us at the wrong address in the evening and the came to rescue us!! I am so grateful for this! And the following morning Francine also helped us with a Uber reservation to reach the station. The apartment is lovely and the bed is very very comfortable. The bathroom is very spacious too!  Highly recommended!"

Francine und Patric waren wunderbare Hosts und bemühten sich, unseren Aufenthalt angenehm zu gestalten. Alles war super sauber und gepflegt. Die Lage der Wohnung ist ideal im Latino-Viertel East Boston mit vielen kleinen Restaurants. Die Subway-Stationen Maverick oder Airport sind nur etwa 7 Minuten Fussmarsch entfernt, und schon eine Station später ist man in der Innenstadt Bostons. Sogar der Flughafen ist zu Fuss erreichbar! Alles in allem \"\"highly recommended\"\"!\""
4820071,47040066,2015-09-15,1830957,Brittney,We stayed with Francine and Patrick on our way to and from Iceland and had a great stay both times. The bed is big and comfy and the close proximity to the airport we just what we needed. The sweet kitties made us feel back at home (we have 2 cats as well :)) and were an added bonus. It was just what we needed! We would definitely stay here again.
4820071,47180710,2015-09-16,30376372,Sallie,"It was really enjoyable visiting with Francine, Patrick, and the kitties. Each one of them made me feel at home.  The location was really close to the metro station, their home was impeccably clean, and they were wonderful hosts.  Thanks so much!!"
4820071,47613999,2015-09-21,7389782,Natalie,"We enjoyed our time with Francine, Patrick, Miles and Tres immensely. You will not find more thoughtful hosts- as soon as you arrive you are greeted with water, snacks, tourist info and travel essentials in case you left something behind. The house is spacious and super clean. The room is really comfortable and the bed is just heavenly. The location is super convenient - a short walk to the train and one stop into the city."
Our favorite part about our stay was hanging out on the couch with Francine and Patrick and chatting about the differences between Australia and the USA. It was like we were hanging out with old mates! They made us feel so welcome and comfortable,and are very easy going and caring hosts.,,,,

4820071,48079486,2015-09-23,18658978,Cynthia,"Francine and Patrick were perfect hosts. Directions were easy to follow to find the place.  Milo and Trey were wonderful cats (I'm a cat lover so I enjoyed their playfulness).  I was so tired after having cycled 400+ miles.  Francine and Patrick were so generous to share dinner with me.  It was awesome!  We had similar likes when it comes to food, nutrition, and fitness.  I enjoyed sharing thoughts and ideas with both.  It was a very enjoyable stay.  The neighborhood was very family oriented, mostly residential.  If you are looking for fancy food alternatives you may need to travel a little ways to get to it.  The airport shuttle was just a few blocks away, which made it easy to get to the airport.  It was free, so I didn't have to pay for a taxi.  Overall, I would highly recommend staying here."

Das war kein Problem für sie. Sie hinterliess uns die Kombination der Eingangstür, so konnten wir schon früh einchecken und noch schnell ein bisschen in die Stadt gehen. Das ist das Tolle an Francines Wohnung: 5 Minuten bis zur Maverick U-Bahn Station, dann eine Station bis Aquarium, und schon ist man mitten in Downtown. Und den Flughafen mit den Autovermietern erreicht man auch in 5 Minuten. Francine ist eine aufmerksame und lustige Gastgeberin, und ihre beiden Katzen sorgen für Betrieb.

4820071,56547882,2015-12-14,23434245,Vikki,"We had such a great time, and it was nice to have a comfortable environment to end our busy days exploring Boston. Francine and Patrik gave us a lot of recommendations for places to eat and helped us navigate the T. They were wonderful! Their apartment was pristine, a very quick walk to the T, and their kitties made being away from my dog much less painful!"
4820071,56725824,2015-12-17,48019433,Xiaolong,"Francine and Patrik are superrrr cool and friendly! It's really nice to stay in their house, clean comfortable and 独一无二! 虽然只住了两晚, we talked a lot about Murakami's books and stories,那对我来说真是难忘的关于波士顿的美好回忆."
4820071,57189962,2015-12-22,23587329,Anh,"Very well-decorated place in a safe neighbourhood. It's very close to the airport--which is a plus. My partner and I appreciated that Francine was accommodating to our late arrival because of confusion with the GPS's destination. The walk to the parking spot is about 10 minutes from the apartment, which is a little longer than we had hoped. But overall a great stay."
4820071,57661543,2015-12-28,47828218,Lilia,"The place is very clean and nice,and Francine is a good host. It's like home,and the cats so cute."
4820071,57894666,2015-12-30,33034932,祁,"Francine's house is good, about 5mins to subway station. Boston is not a big city, you can use subway or just walk in the downtown. Francine provided almost everything we need, including toothbrush and towels. The thing troubles me a little is that her cat likes to go out when we open the door, so sometimes it took us 10 mins to get the cat back home."
4820071,58645349,2016-01-03,40749771,Elizabeth,"This was my 1st time using the service and what an awesome expirience it was super comfortable, safe area , very diverse you can get any type of food ,and stores have anything you can imagine that you would need   super close to downtown and the hospitality was 100% 5 star"
4820071,59061692,2016-01-06,47663246,Kae,"Francine and Patrick were super awesome! The room and house were really clean and lovely! They are really friendly and great personalities. Whenever we had some questions about Boston, they gave good suggestions! Also, they took us ice cream store by their car! We had a wonderful time. Thank you so much!"
4820071,59241699,2016-01-08,23542003,Rachael,Another wonderful stay with Francine and Patrik! Can't say enough good things about this listing.

4820071,59868815,2016-01-16,20217486,Claire,Francine's attention to detail is apparent in her Airbnb space. The directions to the parking spot and apartment were extremely helpful and the apartment is immaculate! We loved the bedroom and its Tempur-Pedic mattress! Would definitely stay here again.
4820071,61460638,2016-02-04,47645309,Alexa,"My experience was wonderful, Francine was very helpful and tentative.  She provided everything we needed as soon as we walked in the door. Her home was exactly as pictured, and very cozy at that.  Definitely worth 5 star Airbnb!"

4820071,61653972,2016-02-07,53307445,Meng,The host is very kind. I modified reservation twice. She is very patient. The room is very clean and the two cats are really cute. We had a very good night there.

4820071,64127158,2016-02-29,58588998,Gracybabay,"The apartment is really quite close to the airport since USA has quite fantastic transportation system. Francine is quite nice and efficient, helpful. Patrik is much more handsome than the picture and he is nice and make you feel staying at home. It's a good experience living in Boston home stay."
4820071,64329076,2016-03-02,41535738,Camille,"Francine was a delightful host. Her place is really nice and cosy with everything you need (towels, snacks, maps, electric plug adaptor, hair dryer ...) It was very close to the city center by train. She also offered us a good and safe parking spot for our car."

4820071,65822920,2016-03-17,57787711,Lindsay,호스트는 착했습니다. 첫날에 lock number 때문에 문제가 좀 있었고 한시간가량 밖에서 기다려야 했지만 10퍼센트 디스카운트도 해주셨고 문제가 생긴것에 대해 미안해하셔서 괜찮았습니다. 지내는 와중에 다른 개인적인 손님들이 있어서 소란스럽긴 했지만 전체적으로 방도 깨끗하고 필요한 것들도 다 있어서 만족스러웠습니다.

4820071,67819319,2016-03-31,46609304,Majchrzak,We had a very nice stay in Francine's flat. Our bedroom was very cosy with a nice bed and Francine and her husband were very kind and welcoming. The flat is nicely located as you are five minutes away from the subway that can take you anywhere in the city and 10 minutes from the parking lot.
Do not hesitate,,,,,
Nous avons beaucoup apprécié notre séjour dans l'appartement de Francine. La chambre était très agréable avec un très bon lit et les hôtes étaient très agréables et accueillants. L'appart est très bien situé,à 5 minutes à pied du métro qui permet de circuler partout en ville et à 10 minutes du parking.,,,,
"Ne pas hésiter\"",,,,,
4820071,68134464,2016-04-02,60835463,Saralyn,"Francine and Patrik were great hosts! We were able to arrive early to drop our bags & leave them late, and come and go as we please. They are very friendly with great suggestions about places to go/things to do/things to eat. Their cats are very friendly also; especially Miles. He likes naps as much as I do! Their home is beautiful and extremely spacious. I would highly recommend staying with them if you have the chance!"

4820071,68643948,2016-04-06,51410795,Kade,"Francine was really lovely. She was super kind to us and the tour of her apartment showed off a really lovely space that we were lucky to share for a night - it made us wish we were staying longer. It couldn't have been any easier, travel wise, being merely a few minutes walk from the Logan blue line stop. A+, would recommend."
4820071,69123617,2016-04-09,20915491,Cassie,"Francine is a great host. Her house is near airport subway station. Although we only stay one day in her house, she is considerable and provide many useful travel information. Her cats are so cute. I enjoy staying there."
4820071,69519388,2016-04-11,33613702,Christopher,"Staying with Francine was a great experience. My wife and I were travelling for 10 days across New England with our 7 year old daughter and wanted a spot next to the airport on our last night. We could not have asked for a better place to stay. First of all, Francine and Patrik were very accommodating and opened their home to us. The room was clean, the bed was super comfortable and the apartment was very modern. They had wo cats, which our daughter loved playing with. Next, Francine and Patrik are all around great people. It was nice to sit down and talk to them, they were very down to earth. They had any recommendations of things o do and places to eat. Lastly, the area is ideal. It is a 3-5 minute walk to the airport MBTA station, so if you wanted to shoot downtown, you are right there OR if you wanted to be near the airport, the free shuttle cycles through the MBTA station and will get you to your terminal. All around a great experience and when we go back to Boston, we will def stay will Francine."
4820071,69730374,2016-04-13,35580272,Albert,"Francine and Patrick were great hosts. The location was great/safe and the bedroom was very comfortable. Both had great energy and were very respectful/helpful with me. I enjoyed my time with them and would recommend them for those traveling to Boston. They also had a very clean and spa-like restroom (definitely a huge plus, especially for those who are picky about restrooms). Safe travels!"

Could not have made us feel more welcome. Exceptionally clean for a house with cats you would never know cats lived there. Even supplied a noise machine for my girl as she usually needs tv noise to fall asleep to. Very knowledgeable about area and gave great places to go for dinner then some drinks. They even left a gift basket with snacks in bedroom.

They were friendly and gracious hosts (despite our very late check in and very early departure), sent helpful check-in info in advance, and provided a very comfortable room. The close proximity to the airport was perfect for our stay."

Quiso cobrarme 750 dólares aduciendo que yo no le deje las llaves.Fue una mentira mendaz ya que luego ella misma reconoció que yo dejé sus llaves donde estaban sus zapatos a la entrada de su casa. Como pueden no haber visto  ella o su esposo sus llaves en tantos días? Me cuesta mucho pensar mal de la gente pero ha sido una actitud deliberada que me ha causado daño sicológico. Sus ataques en la página web de AIRBNB a mi persona hicieron que tuviese que ser asistida por un servicio de urgencias por presión arterial emotiva."
Tome fotos de la habitación : a la cama teníamos que subir pisando sobre una silla. No es una  cama según los dictados del sentido común.El colchón esta a aproximadamente 1 metro de altura! por eso en las fotos que publicita no muestra el dormitorio.,,,,,

4820071,81383600,2016-06-22,57855434,Springs,"It's convenient to get to the metro station and the parking lot, and the most beautiful thing is that there is a park near the home, besides, the two cats are cute and quiet. However, there are some disadvantages should be realized: The room is too small for three guests, and the spaces between hosts and guests are so tiny that it's hard to live without disturbing."
All in all,"it's a nice experience.\"",,,,
4820071,82648857,2016-06-28,64792146,Suellen,Francine was great -- extremely helpful and accommodating of my (and family members) comings and goings.

The room was more than big enough for my husband and I, as well as the cot they had for our 4.5-year-old daughter. They were both lovely to talk to and both spent a lot of time chatting with my kid—an unexpected bonus! Icing on the cake: when I asked Francine in advance where I should go to pick up soy milk for my kid, she said she'd pick some up for me so it would be there when we arrived!"
The condo is in an excellent location: we took a cab from the airport for about $14,though we could have taken the free airport shuttle (preschooler + bags = can was totally worth it) and the closest T stop was about a 10 minute walk through a safe,clean neighborhood. From the Maverick Square blue line stop,it was one stop to the heart of the city. Just a great,"great place to stay all around. SO much better/easier/nicer than a hotel—no way could we have afforded to stay this close to the city center had we booked a traditional hotel room. Will definitely plan another stay with them the next time we're in town!\"",

The bed was very comfortable. The cats, Miles and Tres added to the whole great experience of staying at their AirBnB. Miles eventually slept on me as we all hungout in the living room sharing stories into the wee hours. I came as a stranger, but I left with saying goodbye to some awesome friends (including Miles and Tres). I'll be definitely keeping in touch with all of them! Maybe even plan a trip someday!"
4820071,84126506,2016-07-05,64389919,Ellery,Comfortable house and kind treat! I'll recommend Francine's house to all travelers to Boston.

They are in a very convenient location close to the T, and getting around Boston was a breeze!  There is also a water taxi you can take from the Aquarium to East Boston (about a mile from their place) that was fun also!  Francine had great recommendations for dinner, and we loved her cats! I recommend and would stay there again."
4820071,84927099,2016-07-09,53884698,Tian,"Had a great stay with Francine and Patrick! Their photos are very accurate, what you see is exactly what you get. Good location, it's only a 10 minute walk from the airport and 7 minutes to the subway. Their cats (especially Miles!) are sweet and friendly. We didn't see much of the hosts during our stay, they weren't home until late so we had the place to ourselves most of the time."

She was always very responsive and made sure I felt comfortable since my husband and I had a three-month-old baby with us. She even made sure there was a white noise machine in the room so our boy would sleep peacefully after a long day of travel. They have a very friendly cat so make sure you are OK with that and not afraid to move the cat if needed. There is dining and a grocery store within walking distance which was great since we wanted tasty food, quickly. I would definitely recommend staying here."

We did not spend that much time with the hosts, who are usually staying in the flat with the guests, but I am sure the same can be said about them, too. When we did interact, Francine and Patrick were very kind and welcoming and interesting to chat to. The flat is spacious and clean and as it is so close to the airport and tube, perfect for travellers staying just a day or two between flights, conferences, or other shenanigans."

Francine and Patrick were busy and we were off at Boston Comic Con. The bed is so comfortable, to the point where I asked Patrick about what they had purchased. Francine and Patrick were super nice when we ran into each other. Miles makes such an impression, he's a great, huge, and friendly cat who loves to snuggle. Tres is more shy, but gorgeous. Once we figured out our transportation (cause Apple Maps is silly), the place is in a perfect (like 6 minute walk) location to the Airport Blue Line T-Station. Can't recommend the place enough."
4820071,95083078,2016-08-18,35233224,Jenny,"Patrick and Francine were great hosts.  The shared bathroom was not a problem, although I was a little nervous about it initially.  They were gone in the evening and left us to our own devices. They had a white noise machine so we barely heard them when they came home. The bed was extremely comfortable, slept like a rock.  The working class neighborhood was fine and very convenient to Boston.  Lots of maps and guidebooks provided - very thoughtful. I was traveling with my 13 year old son. we both felt very comfortable here."
3641545,21975560,2014-10-27,20600396,Meghann,"Barney and Mary were such great hosts! Very welcoming and sweet. The house matched what the description offered. Clean rooms with complementary robs/slippers on arrival. Each morning a light breakfast is offered with coffee/tea, fresh muffins, fruit and english muffins. The house is beautiful and backyard views on the water are breathtaking."
Savin Hills is a quick trip into Boston. The house is about a 5-7 min walk to the T and once on the T about 5 minutes to South Station. For those coming out of state,all I will say is that the Locals mentioned some parts of Savin Hills were a little sketchy/dangerous so it's best to be very cautious at night. However,the house is located in a very cute area with very nice neighbors.,,,

They even had flowers, walking guides, a cliff bar, and new towels for me!  The apartment looks quite beautiful and new, and has all new amenities.  And the neighborhood is quickly accessible to the rest of Boston with a free shuttle that drops off at North Station.  For people who care about bed firmness, the bed in the private room is pretty firm."
5481243,48359843,2015-09-25,20015867,Herminia,"I  definitely recommend everybody stay in Prasan&Ram's home. Not only they are a lovely couple but also they try to make feel home. At one's arrival everything is ready: fresh flowers and towels, chocolate and even a toothbrush! Charlestown is very well connected by a free shuttle. Everything in their home is brand new and clean. They are the best hosts I have ever met!"
5481243,48467225,2015-09-26,38810804,Dane,Great location in North End. Metered parking in front and on side street of building. Newly developed apartment in Boston Navy Yard.

The neighbourhood is nice and quiet. We only stayed there for one night due to our tight schedule, but we definitely would like to stay there again if we plan to go to Boston next time. Thanks again Prasan!"

Really really nice and interesting  people!,,,,,
House is cleaner than clean,everything at the right place,in a new building with 2 elevators.,,,
Room is cozy and with a nice view.,,,,,
The building is located in a very nice and quiet neighborhood,next to the Constitution USS Museum and only a 10 minutes (panoramic) walk from city center.,,,,
4 minutes walk and you'll get restaurant Pier 6,where  it's a must to eat something really good with a stunning view of the city!,,,,
So let's stop writing.....a great experience that we'll definitely have again when we'll return to Boston!,,,,,

5481243,52521282,2015-10-30,27933053,Juulia,"Ram & Prasan were very informative and kind hosts. Their home is very new, and there were some surprising kinks (e.g. dishwasher not working), but they were very helpful with those."
The neighbourhood was fairly quiet,but the free MGH shuttle runs between Charleston Navy Yard and central Boston 2-4 times per hour,"so with a little bit of planning it was surprisingly easy to get around.\"",,,

When my luggage got delayed they offered to take the the phone call from the delivery guys, so that I was sure to receive my luggage."
"I can highly recommend Prasan as host and the beautiful apartment and location in the Navy Yard.\"",,,,,
5481243,56173522,2015-12-09,50612201,Tammy,Staying with Prasan and Ram was very comfortable and extremely convenient to Charlestown Navy Yard facilities where I was working this week.  Prasan met me to give me the keys and show me around.  Everything was clean and quiet; perfect place to spend a night and very easy to get around Boston from their home.
5481243,59261917,2016-01-08,9028140,Danny,Prasan made me feel right at home.  The space was clean and everything was open to me.  I only stayed for 1 night and left early the next morning but they were nice enough to give me a ride in the morning!

5481243,68586745,2016-04-05,13155090,Doug,"Awesome experience in a nice, quiet area of Boston. It was a clean, modern apartment with a private room for me. Well laid-out, spotless, and with plenty of room for my stuff. The neighborhood is nice, about a 15-20 minute walk from downtown with lots of Uber drivers around for a quick pick-up. Prasan was great. Knowledgable about the city, friendly, cool, polite, very helpful. Would 100% recommend."

4823089,27630018,2015-03-08,15973614,Ronen,I arrived pretty late to victor's apt. due a  to train delay.
yet,even though it was half past eleven,victor waited for me and made me feel very welcomed.,,,
I left first thing the next morning and haven't even got the chance to thank him.,,,,,
The apt is a student apt with 3 other roommates,the room is at street level so you hear the bus and tram.,,,,
there is an almost private bathroom at the rooms floor,small but comfy.,,,,
for me the stay answered the minimal requirements i needed but it might be insufficient for people with higher demands.,,,,,

4823089,28226633,2015-03-20,28829382,Tatiana,It is a good room in a good location. It’s takes about 20 min to get to downtown Boston. Victor was nice and careful host. Recommended!
4823089,28485851,2015-03-24,145679,William,"Nice room, occasionally a bit noisy early evening from being in the basement, but otherwise warm, dry, clean and comfortable. The house was busy with a lot of graduate students, who were very friendly and considerate. Victor was great, very helpful. The house is about 10 meters from a stop on the Green line with direct  connection to downtown Boston (however beware, the Green Line breaks down about once a week!), as well as bus connections. Overall, a good place if you like that fairly basic, graduate student atmosphere, and a very friendly, helpful host."
4823089,30475524,2015-04-22,30987389,Brett,"Room was just as described, and Victor made sure everything was in order. The room felt private and I felt safe in the neighborhood, even walking back late at night. Also very accessible - being so close to T and bus stations was incredibly convenient and made my travels to all the different sights quick and easy. I would recommend to anyone who is satisfied with a simple place crash. Keep in mind that this is a college apartment in an old building (as described in his posting), but had all the needed amenities to enjoy a quick visit to Boston! I would gladly return if the chance presents itself. Thanks Victor!"
4823089,30836837,2015-04-27,2592490,Cendri,"Victor was really accommodating and incredibly thoughtful. The room was just as pictured - basic but comfortable, and in a quiet location with incredibly convenient access to the T."
4823089,31069815,2015-05-01,31525899,John,"Victor and his roommates are extremely polite and make you feel very welcome.  The bedroom is comfortable and private.  The bathroom is a little small but still has everything you need.  I think you share the bathroom with one of the roommates, but this was no big deal.  Victor even provided toiletries in case I had forgotten my own.  Wifi is reliable and fast.  Victor checked in with me during the middle of my stay to see if I needed anything to improve the quality of my stay, which was nice.  Location is great if you want to get around Boston, as it is located right on the E branch of Green line of the T in Mission Hill.  I would recommend this place to friends coming to Boston."
4823089,31674694,2015-05-08,3265631,Stephen,I had a nice stay at Victor's place. The room is clean and quiet and close to transit. Good place to lay your head at a good price.

4823089,33305348,2015-05-26,33159254,Atima,"Our stay was comfortable at Victor's place. The room has all the basic facilities needed for a short stay. Moreover, Victor is very polite, friendly and concerned to make the guests comfortable at his place."
4823089,33533340,2015-05-29,31628317,Ting-Fen,"Victor's place is just in front of T. The room and bathroom are really clean. He replied our message quickly and really helpful for everything.  As his description, the apartment was noisy sometimes due to the old plumbing so he provided the earplugs. It doesn't really bother us because we are heavy sleepers."
4823089,34014868,2015-06-03,33295820,Alex,"Victor was very welcoming. I arrived in Boston past midnight on a Friday night and he was up and ready for me. The room was cozy and clean. The bathroom is small but also clean and Victor was clear that I was welcome to use the bigger bathroom upstairs as well as the kitchen and any other amenities. The apartment is literally in front of a T stop, which was very convenient. Would definitely recommend and would stay again."
4823089,34344703,2015-06-07,34013349,Miguel,Victor was very nice.  Room was clean  bed comfortable.  The small bathroom and shower next to the room was clean and  functioning great.  There. is a bathroom that is bigger upstairs which I do not use.  Location was right next to train station and bus stop so that was fantastic.  Overall great for price
4823089,34653580,2015-06-10,33615802,Kimberly,"The place was beyond our expectations! It was as advertised with one bedroom and a small bathroom next to it, but the kicker was that it was in the basement of a brownstone building with a beautiful metal spiral staircase. Victor was in constant communication as we headed into the city. He was there to greet us and show us around the house. We did not notice the noise, but he provided us with ear plugs, just in case we were sensitive. He also laid out towels, shampoo, and soap for our convenience. There was plenty of space for two people to end the day and recharge. The green line T-train is LITERALLY right in front of the house, which was greatly appreciated because it was forecasted to rain while we were there. We, two girls, stayed out late for the NBA Finals game, and felt safe coming back to the home around midnight. He checked in with us during our stay, and again as we were getting ready to leave. It was a great experience. We highly recommend it, and would definitely stay here again the next time we're in Boston!"
4823089,34815537,2015-06-12,34776263,Jenny,"Victor was such a gracious host and the room was great. Good communication so that everything went smoothly. The room was huge and there was easy access to the bathrooms. The location was also very convenient, right next to the T stop."
4823089,35150109,2015-06-15,34771392,Clément,"I want to say thanks again to Victor for the welcoming in the appartement, he is a really good guy, nice and friendly. he gave me a lot of informations about Boston before and during my week-end. the place was really cozy and clean like pcitures and the bathroom too. The street is really calm and not far of the excited life of Boston with subway. You found a really good pizzeria not far. Well, I'm so happy for this 1rst Airbnb experience and met Victor and his friends. Thanks again ;)"
4823089,35344405,2015-06-17,33328600,Gullafroz,Victor was very respectful. The house was very close to Train that helps with easy access to the all areas of Boston. I enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend it to everyone.
4823089,37075233,2015-07-04,35237532,Calvin,"Victor made the place really nice. I was surprised to see the bed nicely made, fresh soap and snacks."
4823089,38412165,2015-07-15,35345201,Mariah,"We had a very pleasant experience in this cozy room. Being so close to the T made it easy to travel and explore Boston. Victor was very friendly and helpful, though we rarely ran into him or any of the room mates.  Our only complaint was the lack of air conditioning, making the bedroom more like a sauna. Victor did provide fans to help us through that though."
4823089,38781391,2015-07-18,20702590,Patricia,The host was very welcoming and gave us some tips.  The room was clean and it is bigger than it shows.  The location is perfect because is very near the T-Stop (subway). I definitely recommend the room.
4823089,39184127,2015-07-21,34868019,Justin,"Victor was a great host. We arrived early but Victor was able to accommodate us so we can begin our journey in Boston. It was a very economical, and convenient location for us to explore the city. The apartment was open for our use and the room mates we met were friendly and welcoming. I would recommend Victor's listing to anyone who needs a place to rest their head at night."
4823089,40037018,2015-07-27,20813735,Christina,"We had a good stay in Victor's room. It is one of I think 4 rooms in the apartment however I only met Victor and a girl that lived there also. The room is downstairs and there is a bathroom right next door. There is another room downstairs but I never saw anyone go in or out. We were welcomed to use the upstairs bathroom and kitchen facilities but we did not use them. Victor greeted us at the apartment and showed us to the room where he had laid out soap and mints and earplugs for us (a nice thought, thank you) and he offered us towels however we had our own. We saw him a couple of other times and he was very pleasent and told us of some things to do in Boston. There are two fans in the room as there is no ac however we were not too hot and we didn't find it very noisy either! Thank you Victor."
4823089,41108565,2015-08-04,28188836,Maikon,Victor's house is amazing! I was very well received. The room is cozy and it seems such as the photos. His friends are really cool and felt privacy at the house. The house is so closest to the public transport as well.
4823089,47093843,2015-09-15,38296554,Carolina,"Victor and his roommates were very nice and informative about the city and good places do go. The room was exactly as the picture shows, except its bigger - there is a bathroom in the next door."
If you're going to the Hospitals in  Longwood Medical Area as I did,it's a 15min walk and there's a lot of places do eat around.,,,,

The apartment was quite, Victor welcoming and I didn't see him or anyone in the apartment very much. It was a convenient place to stay."

This upset us, frightened the other family, and made our long day even longer."
Thankfully,the front desk clerk had master keys to the other units and said he would try to find us a room. Room #2 we walked in had yet another family and finally room #3 was empty and did have paper work with my name on it.,,,,
We called the 24/7 emergency line and no one answered. Eventually we got a hold of someone at Churchill and after expressing my concern that we didn't feel safe (who knows how many keys are floating around??) all they did was apologize and say that never happens. An apology didn't make me feel any safer!,,,,,
That night was extremely hot so we were forced to sleep with the windows open as the AC wasn't working. Ever stayed near Fenway on a weekend? It's noisy and made it hard for us to sleep.,,,,,
The next day I called again to complain about the AC and after Churchill called the building they informed us the AC won't be turned on until May 1st.,,,,,
"The listing for the rental says \"\"\"\"our apartment offers individually controlled AC/Heat\"\"... a little false adverstising?",,,,,
This is just the hardest things we dealt with and I could go on,but will stop by saying that we talked to customer service and once again was just apologized to so I asked to speak to a manager.,,,,
It has been FOUR days since I was told a manager would call me.,,,,,
Do NOT rent from this company if you care about customer service. I worked in customer service for over 8 years and I understand that mistakes happen,but also know that when problems arise the company needs to not just offer a simple apology and expect things to be swept under the rug.,,,,

Her home is historic and beautiful, and had I been staying longer than overnight for a job interview, I would certainly have taken advantage of the lovely back yard/garden area. The room and bed were comfortable, it was easy to connect to wifi, and Phyllis provided towels, some toiletries, breakfast in the morning, and even invited me to enjoy dinner with her and her partner. She also provided transportation to and from the airport, and to and from my interview, for a very reasonable price (definitely less than cab or car rental). I had a little trouble with the shower, but nothing that interfered significantly with plans. Overall, would recommend, and would stay again."

Phyllis was a very gracious host and made us feel at home immediately.  She really opened up her home to us - including homemade cookies upon our return from a day of wandering in the city!

First of all,Phyllis is a very caring,friendly,helpful and generous host. She and Ken welcomed us with some very decadent cookies and then they let us visit the entire house. Phyllis also had parked her car on the street so we could use her parking space,for free.,
The house is absolutely gorgeous!!! Our private room had a super comfortable bed with water bottle,little chocolate in the refrigerator,wifi access,a television,etc. No need to say that we had everything we needed to feel like at home :),
The breakfast was very delicious with plenty of fresh fruits,yogurt,bread,coffee and of course,cookies!!! We had the chance to eat outside in her lovely backyard.

One of the things that attracted us to her house while looking for a place was the beautiful decor and it did not disappoint. Everything was exactly as we had hoped. She provided a great breakfast and cookies to snack on.  We really enjoyed our time there and wished we could have stayed longer! I would definitely recommend her home to anyone looking to stay in the Boston area!"
1815326,16816379,2014-08-02,19210243,Aditya,"Phyllis and Ken were truly wonderful hosts! My friend and I reached their place quite late, but were made to feel welcome. The house is a 19th century structure and has a bit of history attached to it, but has been kept in great condition. The neighbourhood is nice and not too noisy. The morning after, Phyllis offered us an enjoyable breakfast and also helped my friend who wasn't feeling too well. She dropped me off to South Station later with a couple of her home-made cookies (where were amazing!)."
I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Thanks again guys and Phyllis,"keep on swimming!:-)\"",,,,
1815326,17150691,2014-08-08,16050216,Sheryl,The house is cozy and gorgeous. Phyllis and Ken are warm hearted.  Strongly recommend staying in there. We had a great time in Boston.

We loved the character,ambience and plaice energy that flowed through your home and two people that help to channel all of it.,,,,
Your breakfast,cookie and soft shower were a delight and if I'm ever in boston again,will make sure I return to your place.,,,

The home was very comfortable and the room had everything we needed including a small refrigerator that had bottles of cold water for our travels around Boston.  Phylis provided home cooked cookies in the evening and a great breakfast; both were delicious.  Most importantly, since we were traveling around Boston, Phyllis and Ken were available to drive us to many of the locations that we need to be, and also from and to the airport.  It was very helpful for us.  Overall we loved being there and would definitely stay again if we returned to Boston."
1815326,18128853,2014-08-22,13676897,J,Phyllis greeted us upon our arrival and welcomed us in her home. She was very helpful in showing us where to park for the Red Sox game at Fenway. Our 12 minute drive lead us to a good parking spot on Beacon Street and we enjoyed a nice meal at Bertucci's before walking to Fenway (10 minutes). We would've appreciated assistance regarding our second day touring Boston.
1815326,18545717,2014-08-28,17144703,Laura,We had a lovely stay with Phyllis! She was a great host and provided everything that we needed for our stay. The breakfast was great to have every morning. It was relatively easy getting around as there are many bus services within waking distance.

"It's clear that Phyllis has invested ample time in making her home beautiful. \"\"Back Bay Elegance\"\" is an appropriate name! We were treated to a pleasantly bright dining room",an impressively spacious bathroom,and a perfectly cozy backyard where we enjoyed our morning coffee. Every detail has received careful attention.,,,
In many ways,"this was more like staying at a professional BnB than someone's home. Our only regret is that we were there for just one night! It would be our pleasure to stay with Phyllis again on future trips to the Boston area.\"",,,,
1815326,18942046,2014-09-03,16725381,Lauren,"Phyllis and Ken were very kind to my friend and I during our stay. As soon as we arrived she gave us a quick tour of her home and our room. As promised in the description, a continental breakfast was provided each day. This made our stay much easier because we had that meal provided for us each morning. We had good conversation with one another and were able to get to know each other over our 5 day stay. Whenever we had questions about the accommodation, they were easily available and quick to answer. Our stay was problem free, and I would definitely recommend Phyllis' home for others looking for a place to stay in Boston that is just off the beaten path."

She gave us a tour of her beautiful home and the room we stayed in had everything we needed. Phyllis and Ken are both incredibly knowledgeable and approachable - if you want your privacy here you've got it, but they're both there to answer any question and help with absolutely anything. They made us feel very comfortable and went out of their way several times to assist us from looking up events around town to driving us where we wanted/needed to go. The breakfast is varied and delicious and if you get a chance to have the omelet, you're in for a real treat! We had a fantastic time visiting Boston but the conversations with Phyllis and Ken were just as delightful and insightful as seeing the city. Definitely recommend this gorgeous home - public transportation is cheap and very close as well. We will definitely be staying again if given the chance."
1815326,19602315,2014-09-15,18789228,Carol,"Would recommend Back Bay Elegance to anyone needing a place to stay in Brighton. Phyllis has an elegant home, and feels like a B&B. Only downside is it is a little far from the Metro. Will definitely stay here again. Thanks so much for sharing your home."
1815326,19708150,2014-09-16,21079118,Avery,Phyllis is a gracious hostess who goes out of her way to provide the full B&B experience.

She also has cute little backyard, the perfect place to enjoy your breakfast. Omg, Phyllis serves an amazing breakfast! Including home made cookies."
The house situated in a very quite neighborhood and it's about 40 min ride to downtown. When we asked Phyllis for directions she immediately offered us a ride. We still took a walk and a bus ride but that was so nice of her to offer.,,,,,

If we were to come back to Boston,which I would very much like to,I would book here without a doubt. It is conveniently located and we were able to get about with our own car and übers although Phyllis did kindly offer to taxi us too.,,,
Of particular note are Phyllis' breakfasts. We were treated to her weekend 'Momlette' and also tucked into fresh fruit salad,"muffins and coffee. Worth the return trip alone! \"",,,,

Her home is situated perfectly in a quiet safe neighbourhood thats still quite accessible by public transportation. The room itself was really spacious including a fantastically comfortable bed, a small fridge, treats, towels, bookshelf, and numerous other things. Everything in the house was really clean and tidy.

First off, she picked me up from the airport (for a very reasonable fee) even though I was arriving late at night. She also transported me to and from my interview and was also very flexible when unexpectedly my hours changed. She is so friendly and kind and really made me feel welcome. The room was exactly as described. Would definitely stay again if I'm back in the area!"

1815326,22793030,2014-11-15,20822727,John,"Phyllis met us at the Bus Station and took us to her home in Brighton.  To two tired travellers this was a blessing.  Her home and our room were elegantly and tastefully furnished with her many antique and period furnishings and pictures.  The house is pre-Civil War and excellently maintained.  She is a very short walk to a '64'bus which leads directly to Central Metro Station.  The home is spotlessly clean with the shared bathroom being the only drawback.  Breakfast was laid out so that selecting a good range of cereals and breads was easy.  Freshly sliced fruits daily - pineapple, apple, mango, melon, berries - were a special treat at breakfast.  During our stay, Phyllis invited us to share a superbly-prepared meal of soup, salad and fishcakes, a great way to demonstrate her welcome not only in word but also in deed.  For a nominal fee Phyllis makes herself available to drive guests to venues.  In our case she took us to Logan Airport, a particularly useful benefit in view of the heavy cases we carried."
1815326,22868929,2014-11-16,9953813,Miriam,"Phyllis was a great host and made my friend and I feel at home. I've never used airbnb to rent a room, rather I've always rented a whole home.

I was in Boston for 1 day to attend an interview and she was kind enough to drive me to my interview. Her home was very elegant and beautifully furnished. Her friend Ken was very nice and had amazing stories about his travels all over the world. Overall it was a great experience

The house is as beautiful as the photos show on the website. Since Phyllis is a collector,everything in the house is attractive. We live on the second floor,and there is a clean,tidy,and large toilets on the same floor.,
Phyllis and her friend Ken are both helpful and friendly. Phyllis has picked us up from the airport,and Ken has sent us to the South Station. Everyday Phyllis has prepared fresh fruit salad in the fridge; water,"juice and milk are all available; breakfast is various as well; \"\"momelet\"\" cooked by Phyllis is the best omelet I have ever eaten.",,,

She greeted us with an amazing welcome of a warm seafood dinner and a bottle of bubbly to help us celebrate as well as the famed cookies! Her mom-lettes were great, both fresh and as leftovers (it was so good, I had to save some for later). She helped us settle right in and we had great conversations! Kenneth and Butch were great additions as well and helped to make us feel welcome. We had stayed for a convention and this provided the perfect space to rest in between the hectic-ness of life!

Even thought her house was constructed many years ago, it was up to date.  Plumbing and electrical worked well and she had WiFi.  Someone renting at Phyllis' place might need to know that the bathroom is not ensuite, and if fact was shared with a person who lives in the house.

1815326,36034923,2015-06-24,34484878,Lisa,"Phyllis was very accommodating to us.  We arrived fairly late and she stayed up to greet us when we came in.  She made us feel at home in her house, and offered to take us places if we needed or wanted her to do so.  She also made great cookies! The neighborhood is an older one with narrow streets...very quiet!  It was a great value."
1815326,36376031,2015-06-28,28207762,Eileen,"This is my first time with airbnb and the experience was great! Phyllis makes us feels so home and I didn't think I was traveling. Instead, I felt I am staying with a close friend. She did BEYOND of being a host. We enjoyed comfortable and fluffy soft bath towels. Each morning the fruit platter was a good kickstart for the day. She had been so helpful that not even a 6 star hotel concierge would be able to match it! Thank you Phyllis !"
1815326,36890548,2015-07-02,7002985,Carmen,"La experiencia en casa de Phyllis fue muy buena, desde la llegada hasta el momento de marcharse. Nos sentimos como en casa, atendidos y cuidados y disfrutando de un espacio comodo, limpio y cuidado, ademas de muy bien decorado."

Los desayunos eran deliciosos y hacian empezar el dia con energia.,,,,,

1815326,37120550,2015-07-04,34938437,Kristof,Phyllis was a perfect host. The house was very beautiful and so was the room. We got all the info we needed. In the morning we got a lovely breakfast with omelette and home made cookies. We would very much recommend a stay here.
1815326,37667199,2015-07-09,13049599,Dee,"I had a lovely experience staying with Phyllis. She made contact ahead of time & will pick you up from the station for $20 which is helpful. The neighbourhood is a nice family one & is only a 10 min drive or so to cambridge where Harvard is. From there you can take the subway a few stops to downtown Boston. Make sure to Uber over taxi as it's half the price. The house was beautiful, peaceful & the bed was so comfortable I could have slept for 1000 years. Phyllis is very friendly and the perfect host. You really do feel like you're staying with a friend. The backyard is very relaxing to have breakfast and read the paper before you head out for the day. Phyllis even makes cookies for your arrival which is a lovely touch, provides very comfortable pillows, towels and has little shampoos etc if you need them. Additionally, there is a small breakfast, tea & coffee available each morning. I would stay there again if I visited Boston. One of my best airbnb experiences to date!"
1815326,39164701,2015-07-21,7206896,Dora,"Phyllis was a wonderful host, we really enjoyed the convenience of her home to the bus and subway.

1815326,39918423,2015-07-27,22515479,Frank,"This was my first experience with airbnb and Phyllis made it a very pleasant one. The home was beautiful, it was tastefully decorated to give that period look for the age of the house. I don't think that the pictures do it justice. Phyllis went out of her way to be of help, everything from picking me up at the airport to taking me down to Plymouth. Breakfast was something again, a lovely fruit salad and if you are fortunate enough to be there on the weekend she cooks a lovely omelete. If you are in Boston and looking for a place to stay, wether for just a day or longer, I thoroughly recommend that you stay with Phyllis."
1815326,40137555,2015-07-28,37701710,Mike,"Our stay with Phyllis could not have been more pleasant.  Her home is warm, comfortable and inviting and her home made cookies were an unexpected treat.  As a hostess, she could not have been more accommodating and we highly recommend her for anyone visiting Beantown.   The only thing she could not do was guarantee a Red Sox win, but we enjoyed the game nonetheless!"
1815326,40588150,2015-08-01,34151919,Philippe,"Phyllis is a lovely host and made us feel welcomed. When we arrived in Boston, I called her from the airport and she came to pick us up right away. She then dropped us off downtown and brought our luggage back to her home. Came to pick us up in the evening and recommended some sites to visit during our stay. Nice to stay in an old Brighton home with lots of character. Breakfast fruit salad was nice."
1815326,40750426,2015-08-02,33277469,Marcella,"Our stay with Phyllis was nothing short of perfect! Although we only stayed for one night, Phyllis was always kind, attentive, and made us feel at home right off the bat. My husband was absolutely addicted to her homemade cookies and we were lucky enough to get a taste of her 'momlettes' the next morning before the long drive home. Absolutely delicious!"
1815326,41797339,2015-08-09,6776243,Sharon,"Our one night accommodation's with Phyllis worked out perfectly!!  Her House is absolutely lovely, and her hospitality matched.  The homemade cookies or an extra special treat. The neighborhood was fantastic and it was really wonderful that she saved her parking space for us to park in.  Our room was exactly as stated, very comfy.  Because it was the weekend, we were treated to homemade omelettes, baked bread and a scrumptious breakfast.   I would not hesitate to recommend her to anyone. OK"

The house has everything you could need in the bathroom, all sorts of soaps, shampoos, lotions, and hygienic products.  (The only thing you need to bring is your toothbrush!)  It was also great chatting with Phyllis and nice to sit outside in the backyard if it isn't too hot.  Breakfast options were great with me- I had an English muffin with some preserves and coffee.  Good public transportation options available from the bus into Cambridge and the green line to downtown."
1815326,43514061,2015-08-20,6710894,Ashley,Phyllis was wonderful! She went above and beyond as a host and I would recommend her to anyone looking for a place to stay outside of Boston.
1815326,43654364,2015-08-21,6180823,Elodie,Thank you to Phyllis for having welcomed us in Boston.
They made a lot of little attentions that we appreciated : available towels,TV,A/C,wifi,fridge and water bottles in the room... without forgetting the georgous breakfast and its delicious hand-made cookies!,

1815326,45403366,2015-09-02,36228224,Barbara,"Phyllis offers WAY more than the usual Airbnb; she offers generous and sincere generosity of breakfast, and tasty cookies for the hit the heart and stomach.   We visited in late August to help my son move from one Boston apartment to another and she was very accommodating in letting us park the SUV doing the hauling in her driveway, and many other ways, not to mention th nearly limitless water bottles we drank as we moved furniture etc in the 90 degree heat.   I also appreciated her light touch of hospitality - she had her own schedule, but was open to a wonderful impromptu chat with another guest the night before I left.  She was responsible and helpful with a number of local practicalities to help the move go smoother.  All in all, I can't say enough to recommend Phyllis's place.  If it is open, take it!!"

She put bottles of water in the bedroom with glasses. A welcome letter with instructions that made you feel at home. Bed was very comfortable.
If you are driving and her driveway is taken you are to park on the street. If you come late you might walk a block. If it is summer that should not be a problem :),,,,,
By the way,you get breakfast on restaurant style plate and table. Additionally,"the cookies ...which I didn't bother with at first and Phyllis asked me to grab a few the day I checked out and regret I didn't try them before. They were delicious.

It is filled with art and objects that you can feast on. She has a wonderful area for breakfast where she provides coffee and fresh fruit and breads every morning. The backyard is splendid as well.
1815326,66865877,2016-03-25,16182991,Jill,"Nice place full of interesting artworks. Phyllis was very accommodating on a moments notice while my daughter and I travelled (college shopping). Room for two was clean and comfy. Continental breakfast was provided. Homemade cookies were a nice touch. The house is older, so it's very squeaky on the stairs and upper floor. Awkward when trying not to disturb others.  Either there are no gutters or improper draining on left side made a noisy night of rain irregularly hitting the window sill. Prior to that, slept very well. Phyllis is a VERY nice lady and runs a good place, but shouldn't accept clients while dealing with a ailing, hospice, old dog in the kitchen leading to urine and feces on the floor for hours. I LOVE & own animals, however, not a good idea to rent when dealing with this issue.  She did mail my daughters swim suit to us for which we are thankful & will compensate her as we just received it. We realize that was an inconvenience to her. Thank you Phyllis!"

The room included a very comfortable bed, a small fridge as well as a cable TV which was very helpful since we both took small portions of our lunch home with us for later. Small snacks and bottled waters as well as Keurig drinks are provided and available for guests at any time.

7954808,65703823,2016-03-16,1303314,Dan + Suzanne,"If this is the experience of corporate Airbnb, then I don't want to participate. Evidently, Flatbook manages/owns a number of units that they rent thru Airbnb. The pictures, particularly the cool, lift-like views were seductive, but the reality was cold, impersonal and cheap. I'd rather stay in a hotel for the same price. I would not recommend it stay in a Flatbook rental again."
7954808,66464244,2016-03-22,25974597,Daniel,Beautiful apartment.  Well appointed.  Hip building.  Close to

The apartment itself was exactly as described and matched the photos perfectly. It was very comfortable and the building was great. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again or in any other Flatbook apartment. Thanks for the great experience!

The apartment looked exactly like the pictures.The beds were very comfortable and having 2 bathrooms and a washer/dryer was great.  The location was very convenient and close enough to walk to Back Bay, Boston Common, Chinatown etc.  It was also easy to catch a taxi.  The Flatbook people were terrific and very professional.  This experience was much better than staying at a hotel.  Hopefully, the place will be available the next time I go to Boston."

7954808,76539488,2016-05-28,953185,Katie,Wonderful apartment/condo on the top floor of the new INK building. We stayed for one night and it was perfect for us.  The pool/grill/grass area was nice for the hour we had to enjoy it.  Location is pretty good.  Right above Whole Foods and close to Backbay/South End.  Would definitely recommend!
7954808,82861376,2016-06-29,63651203,Alexander,The keys to the place were on the counter and thus it was ready to go. It was clean and had the bulk what we needed.  We have 4 in our family and it easily accommodated us.
3528826,17652304,2014-08-15,5817072,Amy,"We really enjoyed our stay!! Jason greeted us when we arrived and gave us the tour of their lovely apartment. I was traveling with my 2 adult children and there was plenty of room for all of us. Nicole put together a comprehensive binder with things to do, places to eat, their numbers and more! She responded immediately to email and text messages. The apartment is in a great location, we walked everywhere. It is so much more fun to stay in a neighborhood versus a hotel and the apartment is an awesome neighborhood! It is right by the park for walking and running. Our flight wasn't until the late afternoon so they let us keep our bags at the apartment while we explored Boston. When we returned for our bags we were greeted by Nicole and Jason, they are both so nice. We would absolutely stay with them again and have already recommended their apartment to several of our friends!"
3528826,17889661,2014-08-18,19564310,Emily,"We loved this apartment and location.  It is both modern and stylish along with a building that is charming and authentic to its era.  The sweet elevator and art deco lobby were very cool.  Nicole and Justin greeted us with smiles, keys, a guidebook and a lot of enthusiasm for us and our stay.  The place had every modern convenience and a really cool nest air/cooling device that was easy to understand and use.  I was able to go for a run every day as the apartment is just a block off the park and commons.  We loved walking Newbury Street and everything is a 5 minute drive or walk.  I would stay again.  Thank you Nicole!"
3528826,18158117,2014-08-22,19478625,Blaise,"Nicole and Jason were great hosts, they left complimentary coffee pods for us to use in their machine. They also have a very concise and neat binder for their guests detailing everything from restaurants to transportation around the apartment. This apartment is in a great location, about ten to fifteen minutes walking or two to five by cab to most everywhere you want to go. We stayed for three days after a wedding that was in New Hampshire and I can say that we had no difficulty once we returned our rental car and did everything by foot, taxi or T. You must go to J.P. Licks which is an ice cream shop about a five minute walk from the apartment."
3528826,18902623,2014-09-02,14570283,Grant,"The apartment was beyond what I expected. Beautiful, modern, with a great view and the most wonderful hosts to go along with it. Would definitely stay here again in a second."

The apartment itself is very cute, well furnished and very comfortable to stay in. We had a great time and would recommend this to anyone visiting Boston."
Nicole and Jason were friendly and very helpful,"but also allowed us plenty of privacy. Nicole's binder full of Boston area recommendations was worth the price of the rental. \"",,,,
3528826,19214993,2014-09-08,314241,Al,"I was met at the house like we agreed and the place was great. Central air in Boston is definitely a blessing. This is literally the best location to be in the whole city. Walking distance to everything, Zipcars nearby and a safe neighborhood makes this place great. Thanks Nicole and Jason!"
3528826,19344745,2014-09-10,2021495,Alex,"\"The last time I used Airbnb was to stay a couple of nights in Boston two years ago.  Truth be told , I was a little disappointed how much better the pictures were than the actual place; something about the camera angles or the lighting made the place seem bigger and brighter than it actually was.  Going into this reservation, I was expecting another let down, but was very pleasantly surprised to see that this place was every bit as charming as the pictures, if not a little better.  Everything here has such a polished, well thought-out feel.  Everything from the Nest thermostat, to the dimmers on the light switches, to the shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispenser, to the \"\"yellow binder of all that you would ever need to know about Boston\"\" really impressed me.  I'm not much of a chef"
I don't really watch TV,but I thought it was a nice touch to have cable television along with the wifi-internet.  One of the things I hate about traveling is that it's hard to bring my guitar along.  So when I walked in and saw one hanging on the wall (only slightly out of tune) I couldn't help but feel at home.  It's not just the guitar that's welcoming.  Apparently Jason and Nikki are professional photographers and the apartment is filled with panoramas and photos of the places that they’ve traveled.  It really feels like this is somebody’s home.  I even got to catch up with a bit of generally accepted accounting principles thanks to their fascinating bookshelf collection.  How could they have known that I would be in the mood to review a bit of Sarbanes-Oxley before bed?  =),,,,
This review is getting a bit out of hand,what I really came on here to talk about were two things.,,,,
1.Jason and Nikki are extremely cool hosts (even quirky you might say).  Jason gave me a personal tour of the place when I arrived and even gave me a few life-hack tips about the local spots in the neighborhood.,,,,,
2.The mattress in this place is just out-of-this-world amazing!  I’m not exaggerating either,I was so curious about the mattress I even lifted up the sheets to see what brand of mattress it was…I forgot what it was either Sealy or Serta,but the point it is that it’s clear that Jason and Nikki aren’t cutting any corners here.  The mattress,like the place,is the real deal.,
I would definitely book here again!,,,,,

Not to mention the kindest hosts! Communication was a breeze - they made themselves totally available to us and responded to our questions right away. I would absolutely stay here again... in fact, I might be on the active hunt for excuses to return to Boston just so I can do so :)"
3528826,19740753,2014-09-17,7918144,David,"Couldn't have asked for a better host, place or location."
Nicole was very easy to communicate with and could tell she wanted us to have a good experience. I didn't get to meet her in person,but did meet Jason who was just as nice and easy to communicate. Since they didn't have anyone coming in right after us,they let us keep our bags in the apartment for most of the day until our flight out in the early evening,which was a huge help and allowed us to keep exploring the city.,,
The apartment was one of the nicest I've been found through AirBnB and had everything you could ask for. It was modern,newly updated,clean and had a super comfy bed.,,,
You can also walk to EVERYTHING,including the historic sites of the Freedom Trail,cheers bar is a block away,in addition to the North End and Fenway Park.,,

From the witty description of their place on here to the detailed and equally witty giant yellow binder with Boston food, drink, and tourist recommendations (all organized by category and neighborhood), Nicole and Jason made sure we were taken care of. The apartment is short walking distance from the T, shopping, and great food/drink spots. We had no problems getting around and felt safe doing so. The condition of the apartment is everything they said it would be: clean, neat, stocked with kitchen utensils, bathroom products, and entertainment (roku, tv, speakers). My Mom and I had never been to Boston and staying here with such organized, prepared hosts made our trip that much easier and more fun. We would definitely stay here again and recommend everyone else to!"
3528826,20285656,2014-09-27,19558599,Lynne,"This apartment was in a great location, and was really well appointed. We were met on arrival, and had an opportunity to find out about all the amenities and the local area. The host left a great folder of information, tips and recommendations which was really helpful. It was just like staying in a good hotel, but with more personal service. My best AirBNB experience to date, and highly recommended."
3528826,20505714,2014-09-30,7966947,Scott,"Close to everything! My father and I stayed at Nicole's while in Boston to see the Sox play. It's a great suite and great value.  The place was clean, quiet and in the heart of the city.  Boston Common's just blocks away, and we walked to Fenway as well. Nicole made it easy for us to arrive and depart on our own schedule (we had a very early flight out).  Both the bed and the sofa bed were really comfortable, there is a great list of Nicole's suggestions for restaurants and things to do, and the chocolates were a nice touch.  I'll stay at Nicole's again for sure, as I am usually in Boston once a year for some baseball games."
3528826,20695278,2014-10-04,15241120,Karen,"Highly recommend this apartment and the hosts!  An ideal location to enjoy Boston, on a fine day you can walk to downtown and if not, public transport is nearby. The apartment is very thoughtfully equipped.  It is a comfortable and friendly environment. If it's your first time to Boston, Nicole's yellow folder will see you right."
3528826,20950592,2014-10-08,7481492,Yael,Staying here was really a 5-star experience. Nicole and Jason were great hosts - welcoming and accomodating and Nicole's book of personal Boston recommendations is wonderful.
The apartment is centrally located,in a great neighborhood,in a beautiful,elegant building. The apt. itself is even more beautiful than in the photos and very clean! It is rather small,but very well planned and organised with tons of storage space,so that even a family of four (like us) can feel comfortable.

We were in town to be married and Nicole and Jason kindly brought us a bottle of champagne and left wedding magazines in the property for us.
We will forever be spoiled with this being our first experience with airbnb; the beautiful property and combined hospitality from the owners sets the bar pretty high for us.

It not only looks as described - it is better. The location also perfect for Boston - close to the downtown and the Hines convention center, and you can walk to Cambridge Kendall Square area, making it an excellent alternative to the expensive hotels there. I was on a short business trip for a meeting in Cambridge and I found it much better than staying there.

3528826,31683244,2015-05-08,4213,Andy,"Beautiful spot, right in back bay. Cozy, clean, well designed... Perfect!"
3528826,31929028,2015-05-12,13812441,Cathy,"The location was perfect and the apartment met all of our needs but one.Very nicely appointed, clean, and spacious for all three of us. The only thing that was very disappointing was no regular coffee maker. It was nice that you have the expresso machine, but most people like to drink a full cup or two in the AM. So each morning my husband walked to Newbury st. To bring  back 3 large coffees. Every hotel has a coffee pot so that you can have it first thing. It really was an inconvenience and not what you expect when renting an apt. The other major hassle was only having one set of keys. My husband went back to the apt. Hours earlier than I did. He would have to be woken up to buzz me in. Not good. This was all three nights we were there.  If we wanted to do something separate it was difficult to coordinate getting back into the apartment. One key is not acceptable!"
3528826,32157398,2015-05-15,2044643,Esabel,"The Elevator!!!!!!!!!!!!  and the apartment was just so beautiful and functional. Clean and cozy. It made us feel at home. The views were also great. Nicole was very prompt to answer any of our questions and overall we had an amazing stay in Boston. This Back Bay unit is right in the vicinity of our daughter's University and is was so close to the shopping areas. Superb restaurants and pretty much everything. She left a very helpful binder showcasing the area and the local favorite eateries and things to do.   We will come back, no doubt!!!"
3528826,32489505,2015-05-19,21547033,Denis,"The listing description was spot on - the apartment is in the heart of the city and really close to the T, with the Boston Common and Copley Square only a short walk away. Nicole personally welcomed us on the first day and shown us the place, how things work etc. The apartment is very cozy, super clean and has everything one would need and more, even a Nespresso coffee machine! The binder listing places nearby to eat/shop/drink is really helpful. We absolutely loved our stay and will definitely consider staying again when we pass by Boston in the future."
3528826,32795588,2015-05-21,31999261,Chenxi,"The apartment was so close to everything we want! My parents and I had a great time in Boston. Nicole and Jason prepared a lovely folder, which includes a lot of helpful tips to go around the city. I love the espresso machine too! I feel grateful because Nicole and Jason contacted me shortly after my application. Sorry we had to catch an early flight, so we missed the opportunity to write something in the guestbook. Thank you so much!"
3528826,33060748,2015-05-25,18110055,Oliver,"What a wonderful experience we had! From the beginning to the end. Nicole is a fantastic host, very accommodating to our needs and her responsiveness is just incredible. The location of the apartment is spectacular, close to everything we wanted to see."
A Hotel would have trouble to keep up with this level of services and the comfort of the apartment is just like home. I must mention the quality of linen and towels,which impressed us to the point that we bought a few sets ourselves. Her folder with all the important things around the apartment was a fantastic library we found ourselves drawn back to. All in all,"we had a spectacular time and would highly recommend it.\"",,,
3528826,33866194,2015-06-01,34112915,Chao,My second time traveling to Boston was wonderful with this cute and cozy apartment! We can find everything we need here and they are all very clean and new. Jason gave us a enthusiastic welcome. He and Nicole are great hosts. The information binder provided by them is also very useful. The restaurants on the list are amazing!

3528826,36147711,2015-06-25,5054464,Aimee,Jason greeted us and showed us around the apartment. He was kind enough to meet us earlier than the normal check in as we accidentally booked an early morning flight. The apartment was beautiful and clean and Jason and Nicole are clearly very organized and care that their tenants have a nice stay! Couldn't have gone smoother!

The building also has clean and efficient washer/dryer facilities in the basement which are extremely useful when travelling out of a suitcase. Nicole and Jason are very easy to liaise with and provided numerous recommendations to assist us explore Boston. I highly recommend this apartment and will definitely try to stay here again. Thank you again Nicole and Jason for allowing my husband and I to stay in your apartment.
"PS Do not be deterred by the two automated postings regarding cancellations in July 2015. These cancellations were immediately following my stay in the apartment and due to an incident in the building that was completely outside of Nicole and Jason's control. They are extremely professional and reliable.\"",,,,,
3528826,40194547,2015-07-29,16969393,Yumi,We were so happy to stay in Nicole and Jason's home. It's wonderful and perfect for lovely summer vacation in spite of noisy sound
3528826,41189236,2015-08-05,27725587,Kevin,"A big thank you to our host, Nicole she went the extra mile.  Our plane was cancelled, rerouted and delayed several times and Nicole was very patient and helpful.  She waited for us to arrive and also lent us a charger for our electronics as our luggage also was lost."
The unit lived up to our expectations and it was great having little extras in the apartment such as moisturiser and sun screen.,,,,,

3528826,42545268,2015-08-14,3470533,Sandeep,Had a perfect stay at Nicole and Jason's place. Amazing location and everything was as described. Highly recommended.
3528826,43020261,2015-08-17,175384,Elizabeth,"Nicole and Jason run a fantastic Airbnb experience with the friendly welcome that sometimes is lacking in larger cities with Airbnb now. Jason met me at the door and gave a thorough tour. He definitely made me feel that he would be there at a moment's notice if anything was wrong or I needed help in any way. I didn't, but it was nice knowing that. The apartment is clean, well-furnished and wonderfully located in the heart of Boston. For those who love old elevators...the one leading to the 5th floor apartment is beyond charming. Thanks for a great stay and three restful nights."
3528826,43368359,2015-08-19,1734556,Peter,Wow! Nicole and Jason were great in communicating ahead of time. Jason was there to greet us as we arrived. The apartment is even nicer than in the photos. And there is an elevator! They have put together an excellent guide to places to eat and see and do by neighborhood in Boston. Thanks to the guide we discovered a cool jazz club and spent a really enjoyable evening there. Thanks Jason.
3528826,44403606,2015-08-26,2203788,Sasha,"Nicole and Jason welcomed us into their home. Contact prior to arrival was warm, friendly and efficient and helped us look forward to our stay.

3528826,45548132,2015-09-04,2254729,Amanda,We absolutely loved our stay in Boston. Nicole couldn't meet us but she had arranged a friend to be there to show us around the apartment and hand over the keys so it was an easy check in process.

The folder that Nicole provided with information and local restaurants/attractions was really helpful too.,,,,,

"The apartment is best for able-bodies as it has some level changes that can be tricky when walking about from room to room.\"",,,,,
3528826,47037579,2015-09-15,12271545,Kevin,"\"Nicole was a super communicative and friendly host!  They were out of town and had another super nice friend coordinate check-in logistics and meet us once we arrived. We absolutely loved the Back Bay neighborhood and the condo was a much-needed respite after a few busy days in Boston. For first time visitors, Nicole and Jason left a comprehensive guide to area eats and TO DOs. The building and condo itself are definitely \"\"city size\"\""
3528826,47642705,2015-09-21,36176901,David,"We spent 4 nights here in late September before taking the train to New York. The apartment location is amazing. Located on a quaint street lined with brownstones. At the end of the block is a walking bridge over to the Charles riverside park and paths. Also at the end of the block is a bike rental station. We ran and walked along the river and went all over the city without hardly ever taking a cab. Boston is vey accessible. Also just a 5 minute walk is Charles street at the bottom of Beacon hill lined with restaurants and a great market, and in the other direction is the famous Newbury street. The apartment was lovely and comfortable. We will definitely be back. Thanks Nicole!"
3528826,47908954,2015-09-21,7635673,Angela,We had an amazing weekend at Nicole and Jason's beautiful apartment. Nicole was very communicative before our stay and Jason personally showed us around the apartment. They were also kind enough to accommodate our request to drop off our bags before the official check in time.
Their apartment was a great place to call home after a day of sightseeing. And the location is perfect for strolling to Copley Square,the Esplanade,"Public Gardens and other great spots around Boston. We were sad to leave and hope to be back again soon!\"",,,
3528826,48371559,2015-09-26,26559764,Mandy,"This is a fantastic apartment in the perfect location. I would recommend to anyone wanting a quiet apartment in a central location.

Nicole's yellow notebook is very helpful and well planned.  They both provided quick communication and we enjoyed our time in Boston.

3528826,52321530,2015-10-28,7157881,Barbara,We were there with our two teens and we had a great time. The apartment is well situated and Nicole's book of recommendations was good help. We drove to Boston and were able to use the street parking all week-end as it is free. We would definitely come back. Thank you.
3528826,53360509,2015-11-08,44139960,Annie,"This was one of our favorite trips of all time and much of it had to do with Nicole & Jason's beautiful condo!  This was our first AirBnB experience and from the moment we booked, Nicole was extremely helpful.  Since we traveled with our 3 month old, we needed a comfortable place from which we could walk everywhere.  This condo is in the PERFECT location.  We literally strolled our son around the entire city of Boston as we took in the fall colors!  It was a trip we will never forget."
When we arrived,we met Nicole's friend,Karen,who introduced us to the condo and gave us great information for our stay in Boston.  Karen was welcoming and very kind.  The condo is just as pictured.  It's charming,cozy,and has everything you could possibly need.  The view over the Charles River is gorgeous.  Nicole's binder full of places to eat as well as things to do & see was also extremely helpful.
"We have already recommended this condo to many family and friends.  We hope to return again once our son is older!\"",,,,,

3528826,55194744,2015-11-29,17716215,Elizabeth,"What a wonderful apartment, perfect for our stay in Boston. The location couldn't have been any better - Back Bay / Beacon Street is everything unique to Boston. Sipping espresso overlooking The Charles, walking into Beacon Hill for dinner - perfect. And Nicole & Jason were awesome hosts, they made us feel right at home. Highly recommend!"
3528826,57049930,2015-12-21,692372,Thierry,"Spent 4 wonderful days in Boston! The apartment is located in a very nice neighborhood, safe and clean and within walking distance of main attractions: Beacon Hill for history and nice coffee shops and restaurants, Boston Commons and Public Garden for green space and jogging, Newbury Street for fancy shopping. It was spacious enough for 3. Very quiet despite overlooking busy street. Also overlooks the river and park. Jason and Nicole were very quick to answer any questions we had or to rescue us when locked out of the apartment. Overall, a great first experience in Boston!"

The only negative we have to mention is that the sofa bed was not at all comfortable. We ended up folding it in and sleeping on the couch as a couch,"even though it was too short for my daughter. \"",,,,
3528826,67891252,2016-04-01,98321,Hein,"I had an amazing experience at Nicole & Jason's apartment. Jason met me and showed me around but really everything was well thought out and simple (elevator, keys, WiFi, thermostat, soaps). The decoration is great; however the dinner table is super high and the chairs too; I'm around 6ft but my feet barely touched the floor and so I hung out more on the super comfy reclining chair and the sofa."
The location is great -- a short stroll both to Newbury St as to Beacon Hill; the subway is a pretty ten-minute walk away; there's also a pedestrian bridge to the Charles River park and a bike-sharing station practically across the street. I did a lot of exploring of the city just by foot; having your temporary home in such a stately building made for a very pleasant home-coming experience.,,,,,
The flat faces back,which means you get awesome views of the river and glimpses of MIT. However,"it also means you're likely to hear some noise from the busy street between the river and the building. Coming from a big city this was no problem for me and it's definitely not at the level of a typical NY apartment where picture frames rattle with every passing subway.\"",,,
3528826,68139872,2016-04-02,60797859,Tara,"Fantastic hosts, gorgeous place!! Nicole was so helpful and responsive--we felt welcomed and warmly received in this absolute gem of a flat. Wonderful details in the place, perfect location. Truly can't be beat!"

The apartment was as pictured and the location was excellent - right next to the garden and park which was great for our whole family.  Both Jason and Nicole were very responsive and accommodating.  It was a very comfortable stay and we felt at home.
3528826,71902265,2016-04-29,33550446,Emily,Nicole and Jason are perfect host.

The space itself is beautiful. Such a clean,well decorated home. Very comfortable and well equipped with everything you'll need for your stay.

Many places such as theaters, shopping (Newbury St.), Coplay Square, Public library, duck tour are just in walking distance.  The train station for green line and red line are within 10 minutes walk so going everywhere is convinient.  Nicole gave recommendation of restaurants and bars in different location and we tried quite a few of them.  And we were not disappointed, even once.  Oh, you should not miss the sunset at the bank of Charles River!  And a playground for kids to enjoy too!"

Extremely load street works outside.  Check-in moved out an hour at last minute making things very difficult for us with a back to back full busy day to check in. Checked-out at 11:17 and received a somewhat curt email at 11:47 telling us to bluntly \"\"check out\"\" and leave.  We had been gone a half hour before.  Not a minute of slack cut despite short notice check-in.  The place is busy and it shows.  Shower door unstable and did not close.  Curtain blinds very necessary as neighbors have clear view into rooms and not fully functional.  Clean and otherwise a nice corner apartment.

Better location than I expected so I was very pleasantly surprised for a non US citizen.  So close to Boston Common and T lines.  Fab pool.  Beautifully clean.  I would certainly recommend this apartment to my friends and I will certainly be staying there again when I visit the beautiful city of Boston.  Communication regarding our booking was 100%.

2187766,22360291,2014-11-04,21085973,Saad,"Everything was first class. The apartment is as advertised, great location, subways on the same block, good customer service, bell man and front desk just as you would have at a hotel. Great way to visit Boston. Thanks!"

2187766,23005197,2014-11-20,20890945,Lucas,"The apartment is located right in the city center of Boston, with the T is just around the corner. The apartment itself was clean and well cared for. At arrival there was a welcome package with coffee, tea, popcorn, cleaning stuff and a toilet package (toothpaste, toilet paper etc.). However, upon arrival we needed to arrange an extra bed. We had booked the apartment for 5 pax (as shown in the ad, max 5 guests). However there was NO pull out sofa bed?!"
Luckily,Churchill suites were able to arrange an extra folding bed pretty quick.,,,,
For 4 pax or less,"prefect place to stay in Boston! \"",,,,
2187766,23490577,2014-12-02,21019159,Denise,"Check in and out was very convenient. Location was perfect for our needs. Building and area felt safe. Apt was basically as described except I wasn't expecting beds that were terribly hard and lumpy and that is the sole reason that we will not stay here again.  For the price and the description as a luxury apartment, the beds definitely do not measure up."
2187766,24982191,2015-01-04,24510924,Matt,"We arrived on Wednesday, December 31 and the doorman at the front desk immediately took us to our room and welcomed us in. The photos in the listing were very accurate to the apartment. During our entire stay the staff was very accommodating and the location was perfect for us. I would definitely recommend staying here if you want to take in the full experience of Downtown Boston."
2187766,27297482,2015-03-01,24840091,Lake,The apartment is great. I had an amazing stay there. I would recommend my friends to stay here.

2187766,72307546,2016-05-01,41464701,Dave,This was one of our best experiences with AirBnB.  There was significant communication prior to arrival and we understood the check in process which worked smoothly.  Upon arrival we found a beautiful apartment in a great building in a great location.  This stay made our couples trip to Boston a fantastic time.
2187766,84536561,2016-07-07,19417107,Greg,"Great location; easy check in/out.  Unit is not assigned until two days before arrival, so it wasn't exactly like the pictures.  But overall a great place to stay."

2187766,90200483,2016-07-31,46391845,Adelyn,"This place was exactly as pictured and we loved it. There was more than enough space to accomodate the 5 of us. The master bedroom had a comfortable king bed with walk in closet and bathroom attached to the room. The 2nd bedroom had a closet and balcony off of it which I did not gather from the pictures. The couch did not pull out but it did have an ottoman type thing that unfolded into a single bed. The place was clean and the check in was very easy. There is a parking garage right next to the building which was convenient. Overall, the location is near the theatre district and chinatown. I thought it was the perfect location in the middle so that the North End, Financial Disctrict and Seaport weren't far and we could also get to Back Bay area pretty easily. I would definitely stay here again!"

The apartment was spotless, located in a quiet area just 3-4 minutes walking distance to the orange-line that can take you downtown."
163941,669008,2011-10-27,1229744,Brian,"Terry was great!  Extremely accommodating, and very friendly.  He was very responsive to all my inquiries.  The place was amazing, with the pictures not doing it justice.  If we're ever in Boston again, I will definitely be calling on Terry."
163941,703581,2011-11-08,1312596,David,"The unit was exactly as described, and perhaps even more.  Everything you'd expect from a hotel was provided and Terry was a pleasure to deal with.  He was quick to answer our questions and responded to our every needs promptly.  This was our first AirBnB experience and we were not disappointed in the least.  The next time we visit Boston I will definitely reach out to Terry again."

163941,921882,2012-02-14,56978,Breigh,"We had a great experience staying at Terry's apartment. The layout was perfect - you enter on the main level, which has a dining room, sitting area, and kitchen. Then you take stairs downstairs, where there's two bedrooms and a bathroom. It was exactly what we needed - better than a hotel and much cheaper. I would highly recommend it and we will definitely stay again next time we are in Boston!"
163941,999831,2012-03-14,1746712,Lev,"Terry was very friendly, place was nice and clean. Enjoyed my stay!"
163941,1006876,2012-03-17,1711772,Bart,"Terry is very friendly host. He even checked in with us after a day or so, just to make sure everything was fine. The apartment is very good and has all amenities you would expect. The kitchen has everything to prepare you own meals and Terry provides you with enough towels, linens, pillows and blankets. Overall a very good experience. Public transport should get you to the city in around 25 minutes, door-to-door."
163941,1055173,2012-03-28,428923,Fiona,"The Apartment was wonderful, very cosy and very clean. Perfect for 4 people. Everything was provided and there were even some board games and books for any rainy/lazy days! Terry was there to greet us when we arrived and was very friendly and helpful. He pointed out lots of places to eat, areas to explore and amenities in the local area (FYI our best meal of the trip was at Citizen Public House and Oyster Bar). We had a really really great time and would definitely stay here on our next visit to Boston."

163941,1653770,2012-07-08,1617206,Cyndi,"We had a wonderful time staying at Terry's place. He has thought of everything. One of the mornings we awoke to a drizzle of rain on a day we had lots of plans laid out for, but low and behold in the closet there were two umbrellas to make even that a bearable event. The rain only lasted a couple of hours but the memories of how much thought Terry has put in to making every person's stay a perfect one will live on. There are pamplets in the apartment for almost anything you desire to explore. And the accommodations could not be more comfortable.. Perfect stay!"
163941,1774395,2012-07-23,1793983,Lorna,"Great place to stay - only a short subway ride from the centre of Boston. We had a car for the two weeks which was useful although we didn't need one as the apartment is so close to the subway -  literally five minute walk. If you do have a car the street parking is good. The apartment had everything we needed for a two week stay in Boston, clean and well equipped. Terry was there when we arrived even though it was late and he was great with information and he was easy to contact regularly and very helpful throughout our stay."
163941,1810108,2012-07-27,1557784,Villiger,"We really enjoyed out stay at the appartment. Terry was very helpful and explained and showed us everthing. The documentation he left in the appartment about Boston etc helped us, too. The aparment itself was cosy and clean. From the apartment to the subway it was only about 10 minutes on foot. Furthermore it was clean and quiet. We really felt comfortable. We can really recommend it."
163941,2088094,2012-08-25,1377941,Anna-Lena,"We stayed here as a family of four and had a great time in Boston. The apartment was wonderful, very clean and cozy and perfect to relax in after a full day visiting the city. Terry was a very welcomimg host and had lots of information, maps and guides ready in the apartment. The location is very convenient, it's a 5 minute walk to Roxbury Crossing subway station and from there it's about 5 stops to downtown Boston. We would definitely recommend this place and come back ourselves if we visit Boston again!"
163941,3133655,2012-12-22,3960326,Lee,"We really enjoyed our stay not only in Boston but also at Terry's place. He was most helpful allowing us to drop our bags early and taking time to make suggestions about what to do and where to go. The apartment was just as it appears in the pictures. It was clean, spacious and very tastefully decorated. Lots of imformation brochures on hand and books to help with daily activities. So convenient to the subway  which was really easy to use after some initial confusion as we were not used to using a subway system. Shops, cafes and a huge supermarket in walking distance. Terry replied quickly to any questions I had and even gave the cab driver instructions for us when we had problems explaining where we needed to go.  Would have loved to have stayed longer. Thanks Terry."
163941,3159097,2012-12-26,2113343,Amir,"The place is fantastic.  It's exactly what the photos described and then some.  You can't beat the location, you're really so close to the nearest T station which helps quite a bit.  It's a nice, comfortable, cozy place.  Highly recommended."
163941,3534431,2013-02-13,4780635,Mark,"Unfortunately, we did not get a chance to meet Terry, as the extra snow delayed our arrival a bit, but the keys were left for us and we found the apartment to be as-advertised, with thoughtful touches, including the extra, already-inflated air mattress for one of our teens. Everything was clean and well-appointed, cosy and bright. The location was really convenient, an easy walk to the subway (even through the mountains of snow!) and there were lots of helpful suggestions in the literature that was provided. We really enjoyed our stay and appreciated Terry's flexibility, given the uncertainty of the weather conditions!"

Terry checked in with us when we checked in which was great and offered great suggestions on where to go on our first night. Furthermore, upon entering the place, there was music playing which was a really nice touch. The apartment was very clean, with small touches like guidebooks and suggestions of where to eat very helpful. The place looked exactly like the photos listed.

It was well stocked with linens, towels and kitchen utensils/pots and pans, etc. The public transportation was amazing and the T was less than a 5 min walk. Our group stayed out late on several nights we were there and we never felt unsafe walking back from the T. The neighborhood was safe and locals at the market down the street were very friendly and helpful. Terry was very professional, he was prompt to answer questions and helpful with requests. We very much enjoyed our stay."

163941,6732320,2013-08-23,7183096,Evan,"Three colleagues from work and I stayed at Terry's apartment in Roxbury and it was the ideal place for us. We were in Boston for a conference and needed an affordable place to stay. Because we are coworkers, it was not really cool for us to shack up in the same rooms together (3 men, 1 woman) so we put one person in each bedroom, one on the sleeper sofa and we brought an air mattress. Plenty of space and great accommodations. Terry is an awesome host. He was helpful with communication before our stay. He greeted us at check in. Oriented us to the neighborhood and the T station. We ended up using a taxi service and found they could easily find us if we gave them two intersections rather than the address. The pictures are accurate. Terry is great. We walked the neighborhood and felt safe always. Enjoy!"

Siamo stati nel suo appartamento per 3 notti e ci siamo trovati bene. La casa è pulita, ben arredata, ha una cucina ben attrezzata e le camere e il bagno si trovano nel piano inferiore. In sala ci sono tanti depliant, libri e cartine turistiche utili per la visita della città. La zona è tranquilla, nelle immediate vicinanze noi abbiamo visto solo un piccolo supermarket e una pizzeria take away. Non abbiamo cercato altro perchè rientravamo la sera dopo aver cenato nel centro di Boston. Non abbiamo mai incontrato Terry ma è stato disponibile ad ogni nostra richiesta contattandolo via mail."

It was plenty big enough for six of us and is very comfortable. Terry is a great and thoughtful host, the house is stocked with basically anything you could want. He even went as far as leaving a hand drawn map of the area with local hotspots! About a 5 minute walk to the subway too, so it's in a very convenient location. I would recommend this place to anyone."

Apartment is a great layout with the large common area on the top floor with a living room, dining room & kitchen, and the 2 bedrooms are downstairs which are very comfortable and quiet so we slept very well. The location is excellent, you can walk right downtown in less than 30 minutes or hop on the subway which is minutes away. Terry was a great host and made the stay very enjoyable. He left us tourist information and maps, and even a hand-drawn map of the area highlighting key amenities in the area!

The apartment is decorated very tastefully and we especially appreciated the fine quality towels in the bathroom, a detail not always found in airbnb properties.  The kitchen was nicely stocked with cutlery, pots and pans, spices and a great coffee maker that kept coffee hot for what seemed like hours."
We found the location to be very quiet at night and slept so soundly. Shopping is nearby and handy with Terry's guidebook and his own personal recommendations for restaurants. He was there to greet us and show us around the place. Tremont street is very near to the suite and it has all you need.  There are a few homeless on the nearby streets looking for handouts but we never felt threatened or unsure of our safety.,,,,,

I met Terry during the stay, as he stopped in to say hello since we missed each other at check-in. The apartment was beautifully decorated, clean, comfortable and convenient to downtown Boston.  Walkable to the Museum of Fine Arts, and Fenway Park, as well as a quick 5 minute walk to the train at Roxbury Crossing.  I didn't use my car at all during the stay.  Quiet neighborhood, with parking.  Kids liked that there was WiFi. I liked that the parking and WiFi were free.  In comparing a stay at a downtown hotel, where parking and WiFi were extra per day, this was an easy decision. Having a whole apartment to relax in was much more comfortable than a hotel room.  I have recommended the place to a friend visiting next year."

We felt like we got a GREAT deal as the space was well organized, well equipped, clean, beautiful, and had everything we needed.  The apartment really felt like home. The layout was nice. The 2 bedrooms were gorgeous and the beds were SUPER comfy!  The kitchen had everything we needed.  We really appreciated being able to ask Terry questions and all the Boston information that was available."

Terry greated us when we arrived and pretty much left us on our own, but was available if we needed any assistance. Apartment is in a great location, close to the T and within walking distance to Fenway, which we took advantage of. Highly recommended for anyone traveling to Boston!!!!"
163941,19508993,2014-09-14,12698749,Melanie,"Thanks a lot for the nice stay. The place was as described, very nice arranged. Terry gave us a detailed information about the appartment and what to visit in Boston. Check in and out was very comfortable/easy."

163941,20599377,2014-10-02,15951072,Diane,"Our family of 4 adults had a wonderful stay recently in Terry's apartment. The apartment is very well decked out with all the comforts of home. As well the information folder, books and basket of travel brochures was extremely helpful in planning our days sightseeing around Boston. We really appreciated the chance to relax in the evenings in a comfortable apartment after a busy day out and about. Even though we never actually met up with Terry his directions on how to collect the keys, get to the apartment from the metro station was great. He was prompt we his communication with us. We would be happy to recommend Terry's apartment to fellow travellers.  Thanks for a great stay in beautiful Boston Terry."
163941,20768537,2014-10-05,17178876,Winnie,The description was very accurate. Terry's reached out several times and answered all of our questions. Especially appreciated that there was plenty of free street parking right in front of the apartment.
163941,21026274,2014-10-10,4946534,Mark,"Terry is a nice cheerful friendly person. Description accurate; pleasant apartment to stay in; excellent heating if needed. Neighbourhood very quiet. 5 minutes walk from subway; 6 stops to Downtown Crossing. Nearest supermarket and good eating place we found is 20 minutes walk, or 4 minutes on the 66 bus, along Tremont Street. Convenience store on a side street about 10 minutes walk."
163941,21332329,2014-10-15,8424444,Deborah,"Terry was very easy to communicate with. He was well organised. The accommodation was very acceptable and delightfully furnished. Handy for the 'T' for transport into Boston City itself. Felt safe in the locality during daylight hours, but not so sure about how I'd feel after dark."

163941,21786310,2014-10-24,12846494,Brittani,"Terry was great, he was there to greet us and walk us through and then we were on our own, which I loved. The place was plenty spacious, and had all the neccesities one could possibly think to need. We were able to walk to the orange line in 5 mins, which was part of why I choose this place. He has a wonderful book put together of dining options a map how to get to the station and any other information you could think of. Overall I was happy with the location of the place. It felt very clean and thought through with what a guest could possibly need. It was raining while we visited and the apartment had two umbrellas we were able to use. Great place!"
163941,22015783,2014-10-28,6170814,Jennifer,Check in was really easy. Terri sent clear directions via the T or Uber and instructions on how to get in the apartment. The apartment was beautiful as advertised. I did have a slight issue getting to the airport for a 0630 flight Monday  morning. The T did not run early enough to get me to the airport on time. I took an Uber so it worked out fine.
163941,22234767,2014-11-02,20318472,Jessica,"First off we really enjoyed our stay here! When you first pull up to the neighborhood it looks like it's a little bit of a rough one but we had no issues and felt safe the entire time! The apartment is spacious and the beds are very comfortable! The heater also works great! The subway is just a few minutes walk. Check in and out was very simple, although we never met Terry he definitely offered his assistance if we needed it. Overall it was a great place to stay in Boston! Highly recommend using Uber while in Boston, most times we paid less than we would have for the subway!"
163941,22694204,2014-11-12,11736809,Kelly,Terry was very helpful. The home was nice and spacious with most everything you might need.  The washer and dryer is actually in the apartments behind the home but they are commercial size and can do a lot at once.  It is a bit hard to get groceries to this home unless you have a car.  There isn't anything very nearby. The T however is quite close. Overall we enjoyed our time at this home.
163941,23175669,2014-11-24,4645,Vita,"Terry's place was amazingly charming. The neighborhood is charming, too, and quiet.  He was a great host even though we never met face to face. He left clear instructions and was available by phone to address our questions and concerns.  We would gladly stay at his place again."

Although we did not get to meet in person, he left everything ready for our arrival and made getting the keys and checking out as easy as possible.  The apartment was as lovely as it appears in the photos and very spacious.  It is located in a great location, close to public transportation and Northeastern University.  We did use Uber quite a bit and found it the easiest way to get around Boston.  I would definitely book with Terry again next time we are in Boston."

nights at this apartment,which is extremely pleasant and inviting.,,,,
The check-in and check-out was very easy,and communication with Terry good.  We had a problem with the signal on one of the downstairs televisions which was rectified promptly by Terry.,,,,
The location of the apartment is great.  The local T station was a few minutes away.  We were able to park our car easily outside the home.   The neighbourhood was quiet.,,,,,
The beds are incredibly comfortable.,,,,,
The kitchen is compact,but was adequate.,,,,

163941,27570648,2015-03-08,20682168,René,"If you want to have a nice stay in Boston and you don't want to be in the Down Town area this is the place to be! It's a very cosy and comfortable apartment with a real 'I'm coming home' atmosphere. Spacious living room with well equipped kitchen (some more glases and plates are welcome). Beds are comfortable and the neighborhood is quit. The apartment is located at a 5 minutes walk from the subway (T) station with good connection to Boston down town and other areas. It is on the top of Fort Hill, so some climbing when walking home from the T-station is required. There was still over 4 feet snow on the side walks but still sufficient parking space in Centre street. We really enjoyed our week at Fort Hill!"
163941,28077586,2015-03-17,7666671,Christopher,"Terry stumbled on us while we were looking for parking. He was very friendly and helpful, told us some cool things to do around town and how to navigate the subway. The apartment was wonderfully furnished and full of helpful things for travelers. I would definitely stay again!"
163941,28583449,2015-03-26,27747141,Gabriel,"Terry was very responsive to all of our request. Easy access -4 min walk to the Roxbury T station. Apartment is in good condition. We were able to accommodate 2 adults and four children with no problem. Only one bathroom to share. Neighborhood of Roxbury is not very nice, but this was a very good deal and the location is close to downtown."

163941,29201154,2015-04-05,21612641,Lisa,"What an utterly fabulous experience! Cannot recommend this beautiful apartment enough. Terry was a fantastic host and clearly takes a real pride in being an Airbnb host. The location is on a quiet street within easy walking distance to the T. Great amenities too - great wifi, comfortable bed, and although I didnt use it, there is a little deck in the back that would have been great for coffee or tea in the morning had it been warmer. I highly recommend this apartment and will definitely stay here or at another of Terry's properties on future trips."
163941,29964490,2015-04-15,25495349,Warren,"The apartment was extremely comfortable and although Terry was not around himself when we arrived, the apartment had low lights left on and looked very welcoming.  No complaints at all."
163941,30918851,2015-04-29,23333290,Gabrielle,"Nous avons passé un excellent séjour à Boston et dans la maison de Terry. Le logement était tout à fait conforme à la description. Très bien équipée pour répondre aux besoins de 5 personnes. Situé dans un quartier calme, intéressant et sympa, l'appartement se trouve à proximité de la station de métro avec accès rapide au centre ville. Pour de bons marcheurs comme nous, le centre ville peut se rejoindre à pied. Terry a toujours répondu à nos attentes et questions avec efficacité et rapidité. Nous avons adoré notre séjour et conseillons vivement cette destination et le logement offert par Terry."

163941,31091204,2015-05-02,22722786,Traci,We had such a great time staying at The Fort Hill Inn just outside of downtown Boston. Check in was a breeze and we loved the location just a short walk to the T stop. (About 5 minutes). The space was very well kept and clean. Would definitely stay here again when we come back! Thanks Terry!
163941,31691461,2015-05-09,24532762,Diane,We had such a great time on our 1st trip to Boston. Terry's apt. was the perfect place to call home when we weren't out and about. The apt was furnished impeccably and incredibly comfortable. The T line was so close and easy to use and we saw and did so much in 5 days. He met us when we checked in and answered all our questions. We saw him periodically and he's super nice and even mailed some items I left behind. There's a great balcony with a grill on it that we used as the weather was perfect. I loved all the beautiful flower boxes he had around the apt and on the balcony. What a great touch! Don't hesitate to stay here. I have already recommended this spot to many friends and family. Thx for everything Terry!!
163941,33060236,2015-05-25,23430334,Nicole,"Terry was an excellent host and his place was fantastic!  He greeted us when we arrived with maps, restaurant recommendations, and things to see.  The location was fantastic and it very easy to get to the T (less than a 5 minute walk).  We had no problem getting to everything we wanted to see and even took Terry up on some of his recommendations.  The pictures, description, and accommodations were exactly as listed.  I would highly recommend staying with Terry and look forward to another trip to Boston."

Everything in the home worked well especially the air conditioning for the hot days. The block was quiet for the most part in a decent area and there was always a parking spot out front for us. I suggest this listing to anyone that plans on spending sometime in Boston. Also Terry was good, he let us be and replied ASAP whenever we had a question."

It was very clean and pleasant, nicely decorated, and really welcoming. The bedrooms, the bath, all nice and clean.  Very comfortable beds with nice linen and pillows. Plenty of fresh clean towels in the bathroom with all the necessary amenities. We had prepared some meals as well. The kitchen is nicely equipped with variety of items."

163941,42173857,2015-08-11,34735730,Maria Grazia,"Il soggiorno presso questa abitazione è stato piacevolissimo. La casa era pulita in maniera impeccabile e dotata di tutti i confort necessari, dagli utensili per cucinare ai libri e lo stereo per rilassarsi dopo le giornate passate in giro per Boston. A pochi passi c'è la linea orange della metropolitana (che, purtroppo, abbiamo trovato chiusa per lavori) e la linea green; nella stessa zona ci sono ristoranti e locali. Il nostro host è stato sempre disponibile, sia durante la trattativa che durante il soggiorno: ha sempre risposto prontamente alle nostre mail e si è dimostrato disponibile di fronte ad ogni nostra esigenza. Un'ottima scelta!"
163941,44405778,2015-08-26,30151949,Andrew,Accommodation was exactly as described and very clean. We used the sofa bed as there were 5 of us and this had been made up ready.  We had a couple of questions when we arrived and when we called Terry he was at the end of the phone and very helpful.  Provided a good information list for guests...where to park etc.  Accommodation was very close to the T which was great.  The area of Roxbury itself lacks character  and the only reason we dropped a star in the overall rating but its convenient for Boston centre and we would stay here again.
163941,44966736,2015-08-30,29765870,Etna,"Terry is very friendly and accomodating with our inquiries. He responds immediately and professionally. The place is wonderful. It is homey, cozy and clean.

The neighborhood seemed safe during the day and night, we mainly used Uber and that was no problem at all and not too expensive either. Terry had a binder with information on Boston, maps, food, tourist attractions, very well organized. Wish we had better weather but we made the most of it. Just gives us another reason to come back."
163941,51276764,2015-10-19,6873945,Nancy,"We arrived late in Boston and Terry had the lights on and the apartment ready for us. It was very comfortable and we enjoyed our 4 night stay. There were 4 of us on this trip and the 2 bedrooms were perfect for us. It was great having the living room to relax and the kitchen to prepare light meals. We used the subway a lot and it was an easy walk back and forth to the station. We felt very safe walking in the neighborhood, even late at night. My brother lives in Cambridge and saw the apartment. He was really impressed and asked for the link to refer it to other visitors."

Definitely recommend!
163941,63023993,2016-02-19,20398705,Lynn,Terry was easily accessible by text and answered questions both before and during our stay.  He allowed us to store bags at an adjacent property both before check in and after check out.  The place is beautiful and very comfortable.  It was a perfect base for us to explore Boston.  The Orange Line is a 5 minute walk and puts you quickly in all the places you might want to visit in Boston.  Easy!  The kitchen is well-equipped.  You can actually cook if you're so inclined.  Thanks for a great stay!

We had enough room for 4 people. Our first night we ordered in and it was a pleasure to sit around our own table,instead of in a noisy restaurant. We were glad to have this for our home base! Our guest from Ireland loved it and was happy to prepare her own breakfast and tea!,,,,
I would say the neighborhood was fine,not fancy. The street was up on a hill and was lined with larger houses. It seemed like the area has been improving lately. Down the hill was commercial,very near Northeastern University,which was our purpose for being there,"and a 5 minute walk to a T stop.\"",
163941,74769108,2016-05-16,6110111,Carol,I was unable to stay in the apartment myself due to illness. However I got  feedback from my friend who did stay there so I could complete this review.  She said the apartment was a exactly as described. Nicely furnished; comfortable and well located. She found it  easy to get around Boston using public transportation from the apartment at night she used Uber to get home. She said she would definitely stay again when she returns to Boston.
163941,75979906,2016-05-23,5034428,Stephanie,Great place to stay while in Boston. We didn't meet Terry personally but he emailed right away when I had any questions and everything was straight forward with entering the apartment and finding free parking was super easy and close. The apartment was in a great location to the subway and area feels safe. The decor is nice and warm and the beds were very comfortable. I would recommend this apartment to a friend.
163941,76790840,2016-05-29,55175012,Cornelia,Terry was a great host! He was very responsive to all my questions even before our actual reservation! The place was super nice and just enough space! We had no issues with parking! Great time!
163941,82885775,2016-06-30,75994833,Jeff,"\"Terry's apartment was a great alternative to a Boston hotel...interesting neighborhood, easy street parking, close to city transit, nice first-floor accommodations, very comfortable beds, reasonable rates.  All four of us were able to \"\"spread out\"\".  The only complaint is the low lighting in the unit making it hard for me to read and for the women to do their makeup.\""
163941,83615267,2016-07-03,6171794,Max,"We had a great time at Terry's place! The apartment had plenty of space for all of us. The station at Roxbury Crossing was only a short walk away, which made getting around Boston to explore easy. Everything we needed and more!"
163941,84370640,2016-07-06,60509274,Nancy,"\"The listing description was very accurate and our family of 5 adults and a 2.5 year old fit very comfortably in the apartment.  Prior to our arrival, Terry was very informative with arrival/checkout/internet info, apartment location/entry and parking/subway & alternatives.  He even had maps, guides, and local information available in the apartment.  As we were planning our Boston vacation, Terry was easy to communicate with (both via the website email and text) and answered additional questions we had.  Terry even met us when we arrived at the apartment and made us feel very welcome!  We spent 3.5 jam-packed days in Boston during the July 4th holiday and were on the go from early AM to late PM.  Having the railway so close made getting to/from Boston attractions very easy!  It was quite refreshing to come \"\"home\"\" after a long day of walking to air-conditioning!  Since we would not be available at checkout time"
163941,85320330,2016-07-11,61680523,Barbara,"Home was as described.  - clean, pleasant.  Terry gave us a few suggestions for local spots. We greatly enjoyed our stay."
163941,85866067,2016-07-13,33479561,Jen,Very helpful host and the property was clean and comfortable. Located fairly close to downtown via the train or about $10 Uber fee.
163941,88028528,2016-07-22,62961473,Philippe,Très beau logement bien situé.
163941,89027012,2016-07-26,7802121,Louis,Terry's apartment was exactly what we where looking for. Convenient location for city centre and lots of space inside. Terry was particularly accommodating and responded to all our questions. Keyless entry made check in and out simple.
163941,89503127,2016-07-28,15187268,Louise,Overall our experience was good. The taxi driver that dropped us off when we arrived said the area wasn't very good and we should be careful but we didn't experience any problems and the proximity to the T train was great and very convenient. I think the lighting could be better but the air conditioning was great.
163941,90418589,2016-08-01,17172287,Carolyn,We enjoyed our 3 days at Terry's apartment. A good place to stay while exploring Boston. A few minutes walk to the Orange Line with easy access to Back Bay and downtown also convenient to Walgreens and coffee/donut shops as well as a couple of restaurants/bars. When directing taxis to the apartment we referenced Walgreens as a nearby landmark. The beds were very inviting and my daughter loved sleeping in. Keyless entry worked well considering the multiple flight delays we had arriving into Boston. Would have enjoyed exploring the neighborhood a bit more - maybe next time. Terry accommodated our departure request which we appreciated and the flag made it easy to locate the apartment. Thank you Terry.
163941,91311654,2016-08-04,9264517,Oscar,"La casa es exactamente cómo se aprecia en las fotos, el checking por código de acceso fue muy cómodo. El barrio no tiene mucho interés pero esta muy bien comunicado y a dos minutos de una parada de metro que te deja en nada en el centro. La única pega es que las habitaciones y el baño están en el típico semisótano americano por lo que son algo oscuras y poco ventiladas."
163941,92969237,2016-08-10,59396028,Beena,"Terry was very welcoming.the apartment was very spacious and had all the amenities listed.  The neighborhood was good, not in a touristy location, but very close to the T stop."

It served our needs pretty well. It's a residential neighborhood and off the beaten path a bit so no coffee shops real close but a 20 min walk or so got us to the Dudley Cafe which was awesome or over to Mission Hill or Northeastern campus. Had no issues getting uber or over to Orange line trains. There is also a Hubway bike share nearby. Easy access to South End restaurants too. There are two queen beds that are very good. The"

10036037,70904007,2016-04-21,60079253,Jason Zi Yue,"The suite  is nice and clean in general. However, this building is located on the busiest street in Boston and it is close to a hospital let alone the construction sites nearby.Also it is close to Fenway Stadium so there are a lot going on. It is SUPER SUPER SUPER noisy! We cannot open the windows during the day becasue of the busy street, and the ambulence sirening by every 5-10 minutes during the entire day. It is not worth what I paid for this place. Also, this property is under a managemnent company. It is hard to communicate with them after the confirmation and payment. It takes at least 24 hours to get a reply. On the first day I arrived, the front desk did not have the key and did not have any information about the reservation. I waited for 30 minutes at the lobby and called their management customer services only to get a cold and rude reply from them. Very Unrecommended!"
13015927,75658131,2016-05-22,24020608,Cope,Another great airbnb experience.  The apartment was exactly as pictured and even had a small fenced in patio.  This is a great deal for anyone wanting to be right in the heart of Back Bay.
13015927,81139663,2016-06-21,70816880,Robert,"This is a very pleasant and private apartment, located just a few steps from Copley Square hotels and offices. The supermarket is a little more than a block away, to. Very convenient, very pleasant."

The service of the reception of the building was not good/helpful at the time I arrived. I arrived at 12pm but the reception told me the check-in time is 3pm (I have no idea about this at all!). Besides,"he was looking kinda \"\"not my business\"\".",,,,
However,there are different shift during a day,and very soon I found that most of the reception assistant there were quite nice and helpful.,,,
For the place itself,this is te best one among all the apartments I stayed in Bangkok and China. However,one is better to make sure the move-in instruction is received well before the trip is started,and confirm the check-in,"check-out time.\"",
9855,103504,2010-09-23,225244,Nami,"This place is perfect. the location is a bit far from the city center, but since there is a subway station nearby (less than 10 min. walking), that wouldn't mind you. There is a store chain just 5 minutes away walking. The staff were nice and cooperative."
As a tip,do not forget to get the move in instruction before check in. Although we reserved the place a week earlier,we got it last minutes.,,,

Getting to and from the apartment is very easy with its location in Beacon Hill (right in the heart of everything). The apartment, room, and restroom were very clean and well kept, his roommates were very welcoming when I arrived, and the listing looks just like it does in the pictures. Philip also provided very clear instructions and great recommendations on places to go and sights to see in the city. Overall, a great experience and I would highly recommend Philip as a host and his place if you're thinking about visiting Boston!"
8428052,70512751,2016-04-18,2254826,Malik,Phil was a great host. The room is very small but the apartment is big enough and very clean. His room mates were there during the weekend and were very friendly and welcoming.

8428052,86712703,2016-07-17,61429699,Andrew,"The location of this room listing can't be beat. Only a few blocks to the Boston Commons made walking everywhere a breeze. The room itself was very clean and air-conditioned (great for those warm and humid Boston summer days). Everything was provided as mentioned.

Steps from the T, downtown, and Charles St. The bed is also super comfortable. While I didn't meet Phil - he was traveling - his roomates are really cool. Phil is a very responsive host. I did experience a hiccup when checking in when I arrived. I called Phil and he solved the issue within a few minutes. I hope to stay there again on a future visit. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!"
7476671,44195908,2015-08-24,6126831,Christopher,"The Eagle’s Nest was mine and my girlfriend’s first venture into Airbnb and my, my was it a good entrance. Deborah greeted us with a big hug, instantly making us feel welcome into her home. She showed us around the house as we got wrapped up in conversation, turning a five minute lesson into a one and a half hour tour. Deborah is an incredibly interesting person."
Every morning and night we would have a long chat with Deborah,although she made it clear that she will be as involved or uninvolved as you want to be (good for less sociable people). We just happen to love chatting! She gave us lots of tips for what to do in the city,but due to a hectic schedule and some bad planning on our behalf,we didn’t get to see much of what she advised.,,
The Eagle’s Nest itself was great,the bed was comfy,the desk was great for working on and the facilities were good. It got pretty warm at night,but there was a huge fan to keep us cool. The only thing i would say about the house is (and it’s pretty obvious if you look at the photographs) is that it’s not for people who are obsessively minimal. Deborah has an extensive collection of interesting stuff,which we really enjoyed - i love having lots of things to check out. The Eagle’s Nest is also stocked full with books; great if you’re planning on staying for a while,unfortunately we didn’t have enough time in our schedule to relax and read.
Overall,"i couldn’t recommend The Eagle’s Nest more - we had a great stay and actually felt like we were at home.\"",,,,
7476671,45967716,2015-09-07,38816902,FIvi,"I had the pleasure and the opportunity to stay at Eagle's next for a couple of weeks. It is a great place, very convenient, clean and cozy. Plus Deborah owes it! Deborah is a unique hostess, friendly and ready to help in any way, very pleasant personality, making you feel like home. I really feel grateful for having met her. My stay in Boston started with the best possible conditions. Indeed, she exceeded the best of my expectations. She even drove me (and my large suitcase) to my next (permanent) home! Deborah, I will never forget that! If it was possible I would rate her place with 6 stars at a maximum of 5! Great experience especially since it was my first in Boston. I do recommend this place!"

We're back school now, everything seems like just happened yesterday. We are so glad to choose staying in your adorable house. Like I said before, there are too much things that could be explored in this little warm and sweet nest. All kind of poster on the wall, stacked book in the stairs, and mix cute tiny things all around the house. The scene changed with every step moved. Most wonderful thing is, there is a kindly lady taking care of everything, not only the house but also the guest. I still remember when we was going to walk out of door, Deborah reminded us wearing enough cloth to keep out of cold. She said, \"\"it's better to be safe than sorry\"\". Sadly"

Although I didn't have much contact with her since I was out and about exploring the city, I was very pleased with my stay at her wonderful apartment. She lives in the Mission Hill area which is littered with college students. Actually, wherever you go, Boston is littered with college students. The room had all the accommodations I needed, comfy bed, clean sheets, informative guest information, towels, quiet building with the occasional squeaky wooden floors. When you walk out, everything is very very accessible. Tons of eateries, bars, and more importantly, the green line metrolightrail/tram system. Honestly, if it's a nice day, you can just walk anywhere. Even in the evening, I found it really safe. Overall, my experience was fantastic and Alexandria is very accommodating."

Alexandra was friendly and helpful. We loved the surrounding area (close to Transit, lots of Restaurants, Supermarket, people walking in the streets) and felt safe even at night. Parking is a real challenge, it is complicated and rather expensive during the week (not on week-ends) and you don't need a car to visit Boston!"

The apartment is terrific for public transportation around Boston. It is quiet and secure. Alex was thoughtful and helpful as she hosted our family of four. There is a Subway sandwich shop below, which is good if you love Subway (we do) and aggravating if the aroma makes you hungry, cause they are baking bread 24/7! There's also a fun ice-cream parlor on the corner."

1471308,12462272,2014-05-03,2388141,Marcus,We stayed for three nights in the double bedroom and frankly found this a mixed experience.
Firstly,the place is good value for money based on other properties on Airbnb and elsewhere. It might be best suited the budget traveller.,,,,
Here were our issues:,,,,,
1) Our room was smelly and stuffy. Especially the subway food smells from the store downstairs. We hate the smell of subway.,,,,,
2) There are rules around cleaning dishes and pans etc after use,but they were not observed by the host when we stayed. Every time we went into the kitchen there were dirty dishes etc filling the sink and used kitchen stuff on the benches. We didn't feel comfortable using the kitchen facilities.,,,,
3) There were filled garbage bins in the living rooms for the first two days we were there. The living room was not really accessible for use by guests as the host was watching TV most of the time we were there and it is kind of set up as her office.,,,,,
4) No space in the bathroom for guest items. The bathroom is small and has a fair amount of clutter in it meaning there is no room for guests to store items in the bathroom. On the last day we stay in the apartment there were a total of 6 people staying in the property therefore things can get a little congested and noisy.,,,,,
5) The room is noisy from people upstairs and the host watching TV at night in the living room,albeit earplugs were provided by the host.,,,,
6) The double bed (fold out sofa) was a little small for us and could be more comfortable.,,,,,
We looked into alternative accommodation on the first night but were not able to find any,which gives you an indication of the expense and availability of accommodation in the area.  If we had found it we would have asked to move.,,,,
Understanding that there have been some great reviews of this place,we just wanted to provide the most balanced view on our experience.,,,,
"The host was helpful letting us store our bags at the apartment on our final day and the communication was good.\"",,,,,
1471308,12748863,2014-05-10,12624806,Nayeong Erica,"I had a great time in Boston thanks to Alexandra's room. A clean and very private room with good location. However, I've lost my way to get to her room due to the wrong direction in the Airbnb information. The transfer station was closed from two months ago. But, I believe that she will correct the information for other people. :) Overall, I am satisfied with the experience in her room."
1471308,13255300,2014-05-23,2293394,Annie,"My mother and I had to be near Longwood Medical and due to graduation season, there were no hotels available! We were so fortunate that Alexandra had an opening.  The place was neat, the room clean, and Alexandra super accommodating."
We honestly saw her for a total of 10 minutes during our two night stay,but she was warm,friendly,"and super helpful.  I highly recommend both Alexandra and her place! \"",,
1471308,13659468,2014-06-02,7951205,Mercedes,"Alexandra was very accommodating. We arrived before the check in time and she invited us to pass by her office (1 minute from the house) to pick up the keys and make ourselves comfortable at home. She also allowed us to leave our luggage at home during the day of departure, although in the end we didn't have to. During our stay, she behaved in a polite and quiet way."
"The \"\"cozy private room\"\" is indeed cozy and the bed is comfortable for two people. There is enough room in the closet to put your belongings. However",the room has no proper ventilation and gets a little stuffy. I found the general hygiene only moderately correct. Linens and towels were freshly washed,but not the cover or the floors. The bathroom and the kitchen were not very clean either: hair in bathtub and sink,dirty dishes,etc. The entrance stairs that lead to the apartment are really smelly and dirty. I don't mean that it was unbearable,but since all reviews claim that the apartment is super clean
Internet worked perfectly,and the T and bus connections are just as Alexandra describes,so no surprises to that effect.,,,
"I thank Alexandra for welcoming us in her home!\"",,,,,
1471308,13822835,2014-06-05,11048451,Allison,"Great location if you're visiting schools in the area. Close to the T (green line) and in a great neighborhood with shopping and restaurants. The room was exactly what is represented in the description and photos. Things are well set up for guest. It is above a Subway so the smell of food is a bit disconcerting in the morning, but you get used to it."
1471308,15957625,2014-07-19,11111396,Miriam,Bed was very uncomfortable and apartment had the waft smell from subway downstairs but it's ok if you are looking for somewhere to stop over
1471308,16614319,2014-07-30,12272928,Ling,"A great landlord, a very convenient location, has left us a wonderful tour of Boston."

Location - The apartment was in a good area as far as transit and walking goes.  I didn't have any trouble finding parking on the street and left my car for 2 nights without issue.,,,,,
Bedroom - The bedroom was tiny.  The picture is just about the entire room.  The apartment is just above a Subway and the smell of bread was extremely strong.  The Subway also plays music starting sometime around 6:00 - 6:30 AM and it woke me up each morning.,,,,,
Bathroom - The bathroom was shared,which is awkward in some instances but overall not terrible.  Problem is the bathroom was gross.  There was hair everything and a huge clump in the drain that swirled around when I turned the shower on.  I was so grossed out from the shower that I did not even shower the last morning.,,,,
"Cleanliness - The bedroom was clean but that is it.  I already mentioned the bathroom but the apartment itself wasn't overly clean either.  In the middle of the living room there was a huge rack where the host was drying her pants.  I wouldn't care too much that the place was a bit messy but the host had a rule about no shoes and asked us to wear these ridiculous \"\"sandals\"\" around the place.",,,,,
Friendliness - I would not classify the host as friendly.  She wasn't rude but definitely wasn't nice.  Every encounter was awkward.  I asked if I could store my bike on her patio and she just flat refused.  Her patio is quite large and empty.  She just wasn't very accommodating.,,,,,
"Sleeping - The room was listed as sleeping three but what we found was one \"\"bed\"\" and one air mattress.  The bed was not comfortable and the air mattress is an air mattress.  I would not recommend staying here with more than two guests.",,,,,
"Overall - I would not recommend that you stay here.  I was looking for alternative places to stay as soon as we \"\"checked in\"\" but on such short notice I wasn't able to find anything.  Next time I travel to Boston I will absolutely not considering staying here again no matter the price.",,,,,
Final Note - I honestly felt that the profile for this place is borderline false advertising.  The room doesn't really sleep three,it's not cozy at all (it's tiny),it smells of Subway (not in a good way),the host isn't friendly,and the host isn't very accommodating.  If you have a choice,"choose to stay elsewhere.\""
1471308,16992435,2014-08-05,17270624,ShiShuen,"Personally the unit itself was very clean, and the bathroom pristine. Yes, the host does leave her dishes out overnight, but it is her home after all. Her dishes did not inconvenience me in anyways. Everything else was good and I really like the smell of her apartment! It has a sweet, fruity smell (: Did not have any problems with the smell of Subway downstairs wafting up."
However,the walls of the place are really thin. The first night I stayed there Subway forgot to turn off their music and I was up all night listening to repeats of Let It Go. The third night the tenants upstairs were probably having a party and I could hear them talking,walking and stomping (what it seemed like to me) about. The earplugs that were provided did not really help. However,my boyfriend slept soundly throughout our entire stay. My advice is if you are sensitive,like me,this may not be the best place.
Again,this is not a hotel so do not expect to receive hotel class service. Alexandra is rather quiet,"but she will gladly answer any questions you have.\"",,,
1471308,18408252,2014-08-26,2267250,Brooke,"Alexandra's apartment is centrally located and very close to the Green Line which makes it convenient. Her apartment is newly renovated. Alexandra was easy to communicate via airbnb messaging (don't email her since she does not check it often). The room has a nice closet, towels and she even left new slippers for guests. The room is very dark at night and in the morning since the window faces another building."
I do wish we would have realized ahead of time that the bed was a modified futon. The pad was thicker than your normal futon,"but the back support was not all that great. My parents were actually supposed to stay here while visiting Boston and after one night we had to switch because my dad had back problems. \"",,,,
1471308,19351771,2014-09-10,6442735,Joel,"A fine experience.  I needed a place to stay in Boston for a few nights, and booked this room at the very last minute.  Alexandra was very accommodating and professional, and I had a comfortable stay.  Area is pretty fun and super convenient if you're visiting from out of town."
1471308,20154546,2014-09-24,20777193,Matthew,"Great location within walking distance to the subway, restaurants, and grocery store. Great stay"
1471308,20336083,2014-09-28,18008585,Jonathan,"The apartment is nice and Alexandra was polite. She left some resources for touristy things in Boston, and very clear instructions related to the rental. We didn't see much of her, but enjoyed meeting a French couple who happened to be renting the second AirBnB bedroom."
Our only real complaint was that the bed is not a real bed,"but a fold-up bed with a futon-type mattress. It didn't provide as good of back support as a real mattress.\"",,,,
1471308,21192861,2014-10-13,14810016,David,"Alexandra was a good host. Our room was clean and there were plenty of towels as well as slippers for night wear (or wear around the house) The apartment was warm and compact. She gave us a quick tour as the place wasn't very big. The kitchen was more than adequate with nice appliances including a dishwasher! We shared the refrigerator, as we chose to eat our breakfasts in instead of going out to a restaurant. Her neighborhood was very nice with church and restaurants and T-stop all within walking distance of her place. We walked around as well and noticed that there was a very nice park close by that had fantastic views of Boston! The Brigham Circle T-stop was only 5-mins walking...a definite plus in my book! Her building was not noisy but rather quite nice too. We went to several places that were close by for meals. And there is a nice grocery store too (Stop and Shop) right at the corner and there is a Subway subs right next door! An excellent (URL HIDDEN) my book! All 'n all, I was very pleased with my choice."
1471308,21525397,2014-10-19,11663145,Lise,"Appartement bien situé et c'est là sa principale qualité. L'appartement est propre mais le lit est peu confortable. Par ailleurs, nous étions 6 personnes dans l'appartement en même temps pour une seule salle de bains et un petit salon donc timing serré. Le vendredi soir beaucoup de bruit dans la rue même si des boule quiès sont à disposition. Nous n'avons pas beaucoup communiqué avec Alexandra et avions plutôt l'impression de déranger. En somme un peu déçue de cette expérience par rapport à ce qu'on a eu à NY."
1471308,22990091,2014-11-19,425600,Sebastian,"Alexandra was a most gracious host, and everything went smoothly. She's working right across from the place, so picking up the keys some time during the day was no problem at all, and inside everything was well-organized and spotless."
1471308,28552497,2015-03-25,29521477,Camila,The reservation was canceled 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1471308,28875374,2015-03-31,3634670,Mikkel,"I stayed for two months for work at Brigham and Womens hospital. Very convenient location, and price similar to what you could find elsewhere for stays of 1-2 months. Alexandra was nice and helpful. I had a pleasant stay!"
1471308,30540830,2015-04-24,20724531,Massimiliano,"La stanza e l'appartamento di Alexandra sono familiari e confortevoli; il quartiere non è centralissimo, ma molto ben collegato con la green line (E)."
Alexandra è una persona molto tranquilla e davvero riservata. Consigliato soprattuttto per chi cerca un luogo discreto dove alloggiare e molta tranquillità in casa,con la possibilità di raggiungere il centro di Boston in 15-20 min.,,,,
"Un soggiorno piacevole.\"",,,,,
1471308,31467216,2015-05-05,29445164,Chris,Alexandra was very good about communicating and the room was clean. Location was close to T.
1471308,33117472,2015-05-25,31368022,Mehdi,"Alexandra was very fast in replying the text messages. We checked in immediately after we got there. The place was clean, nice and located in a good region in Boston. I believe her apartment is totally worth the price."
1471308,35719067,2015-06-21,34888581,Lisa,"Alexandra was nice, quiet and very organised. She's apparently done this quite often and had thought of everything we might need. The location was great!"
However,parts of the apartment  (especially the bathroom) were not as clean as we'd liked them and the wifi couldn't hold up when it was only us and alexandra,"even less so with both rooms filled with airbnb guests...\"",,,
1471308,36267720,2015-06-27,11246547,Vicente,Alexandra was pleasant and helpful. She allowed me to use the kitchen and the fridge. She is also clean and organized. The apartment is close to public transportation and other amenities in Boston.
1471308,39551333,2015-07-24,30375685,Pericles,"This was a great buy in Boston. Really close to Harvard and other colleges, the room is quite, clean and the air conditioning was fantastic."
The bathroom (which is always a question mark in shared places) is neat,with a great shower.,,,,
I am planning in staying again next May,when graduation day of my son will take place.,,,,
"Alexandra is quiet and discrete!\"",,,,,
1471308,43812725,2015-08-22,37728108,Rachel,"We had a great experience at Alexandra's place! Nice room and great hospitality - there was coffee in the kitchen and a nice binder of information about local spots, parking, and details of the place. Room is exactly how it looks and very clean. Only complaint is one bathroom for up to three rooms of guests -- had to wait a couple times, but not a big deal at all! Highly recommend this spot!"
1471308,45654561,2015-09-05,31838367,Dipu,Alexandra was a good host had a pleasant stay with her and she was always ready to help. The location was perfect for me as it was just a walking distance to North Eastern University with lot of transport options around
1471308,46754768,2015-09-13,41148858,Rebecca,"Alexandra made us feel very welcome, and was accomadating despite a long delay in our travel. It is a lovely place to stay, and so close to the transit. Definitely would recommend staying here - great apartment and convenient location. Thank you!"
1471308,47775725,2015-09-21,42037744,Yuta,英語があまり得意でない僕らには、なかなかコミュニケーションをとることは難しかったです。忙しくて使い方の説明ができないということで、洗濯機も使うことができませんでした。宿はとてもきれいで、空調もシャワーもベッドもどれも快適でした。
1471308,48091670,2015-09-23,5126893,Robert,"Very quiet room in a peaceful neighborhood.  Room and bathroom were exceptionally clean, Alexandra is quite friendly, and the location can't be beat!"
1471308,48712484,2015-09-28,40465065,Weiling,"地點好,離地鐵走路只需要不到五分鐘"
自從預定後就從來沒有回過我的訊息,我想詢問哪時候入住房間有甚麼設施都沒有回覆,直到我通知了airbnb才有所回應,這點讓我感覺非常不好!!!,,
房間兩個人住,有點小,地板以及廁所浴室蠻髒的 有許多的頭髮,,,
因為房間位在subway 上面,所以整間都是subway 的味道,住了四天,所有東西都是subway 的味道,想要住的人必須考慮這點。,
另外房東並不如網路上評價來的友善,房間有提供房間須知,但是並沒有提到不能在房間使用吹風機,因此當我們在房間使用吹風機,即產生跳電,我們向房東反應
另外我們第一天抵達後,想說到廚房看看有沒有熱水,那時候房東在客廳看電視,結果就立刻關掉電視,發出不耐煩的聲音,然後走到廚房一直觀察我在做甚麼
最後就是wifi 非常的慢甚至無法連上,就好像沒有提供wifi 一樣!!!,,,,
因此我非常不推薦這間房間除非你能接受以上情形發生,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1471308,49140462,2015-10-01,5521941,Sam,"The room was nice and served our needs. It's well located for getting to a lot of central Boston and we generally felt comfortable using the amenities in Alexandra's flat. Alexandra generally keeps to herself once she's shown you the room and doesn't seem interested in socialising, so this is not the place to stay if you want a friendly chatty host. Other reviews have mentioned to smell from the Subway restaurant on the ground floor. It's weird at first, but you quickly stop noticing it. All in all, a perfectly fine place to stay, but in no way is it a memorable gem that you'll tell other people about."
1471308,55601412,2015-12-03,27223525,Raquel,"La descripción del anuncio fue correcta, ajustándose a la realidad."
El apartamento es relativamente grande y confortable. En mi caso,al ir a Boston a hacer una estancia de dos meses por trabajo en Longwood Medical Area,buscaba una habitación doble cercana a la zona. Este apartamento es ideal y está a menos de 10 minutos andando y bien comunicado con metro (Green Line),con respecto al centro.,,
He estado dos meses hospedada y valoro positivamente mi estancia allí. La habitación es relativamente grande y está bien equipada. Las zonas comunes a usar también (baño,cocina,comedor). En general,me he sentido cómoda y a gusto. La cama es confortable y no he tenido problemas para dormir en absoluto. Cafetera Keurig a usar cuando uno quiera. Quizás lo mejorable es la red WiFi,que tiene bastantes altibajos. Por lo demás,relación calidad-precio muy buena. La zona del barrio de Mission Hill donde está el apartamento está bien comunicada y es segura
Alexandra es amable y atenta y se preocupa por atender las necesidades de sus huéspedes. Recomendable tanto para estancias cortas de fin de semana como para más largas,"como en mi caso.\"",,,,
1471308,56395277,2015-12-13,38029925,Bianca,Place is as described. Very clean and close to transit. Alexandra met me for check in and showed me around.
1471308,59567176,2016-01-12,36893953,Anitha,She did make us feel welcome. Neighborhood is not great but the place is in great location with all the stores including Subway and a Pizza place nearby.
1471308,62106158,2016-02-11,44445333,Dywayne,"Alexandra was a very gracious host. The room was just as described, very clean and was a great location for me. Thanks, Alexandra!"
1471308,66103992,2016-03-19,62171397,Diana,"This is a great place to stay if you are looking to visit Boston. We could easily either walk downtown, or the T (subway) was about a block away. The bedroom is very cozy and the bathroom is updated. We could use the kitchen or living room but spent most of our time outside the apartment. There are bars and restaurants less than a block away."
1471308,68196426,2016-04-02,12137404,Stephanie,The host canceled this reservation 130 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1471308,68873847,2016-04-07,55376399,Seiko,"I stayed for 16 nights. The room, kitchen and bath were clean and comfortable. It's a nice place if you would like to have a quiet and relaxing time."
1471308,69815965,2016-04-13,7511826,Amy,We stayed at Alexandra's on a holiday to see Boston and mainly to see sporting games.
Alexandra's place is very close to two of the big train lines which is excellent for getting around. It is a bit further out from Boston main city which means it's difficult to come in and out,we ended up leaving for the day and staying out all day as it was easier,we came to see lots of sport so the location was a bit far out for us for what we were after but this is not a fault just knowledge for others if you are doing a similar trip. We found Boston to be very accessible by foot if you are spending most of your time in the city.,,,
Room was very clean and tidy with lots of towels,hanging and storage space. The kitchen and bathroom could have been kept a bit more tidy given there was another room rented out at the same time so more people using the space.,,,,
Just a note we hadn't read in prior reviews,"the apartment is above a Subway and unfortunately the smell travels up to the apartment which wasn't too pleasant.\"",,,,
1471308,70172920,2016-04-16,50022823,Tara,"Alexandra was super prompt in checking me into her home and gave me some great recommendations on nearby eateries. We didn't connect all that much, as I was staying at her place for a work trip, but I felt comfortable and cared for. The room was everything I expected -- clean, tidy, cozy; the neighborhood was safe; and overall I felt super comfortable."
1471308,71290275,2016-04-24,24203477,Ong,"A very lovely stay at Alexandra's! Cosy and clean. Her place very close to T station (5mins walk away), and there are many food options close by. Supermarket is just next door too. Would recommend anyone to stay!"
1471308,71579918,2016-04-26,21765031,Helen,"Fabulous location close to Harvard Medical School and public transit.  Very easy to get around!  Alexandra was very welcoming and waited up until after midnight for me to arrive from the airport.  The bed and bedroom were fine, but could have used some dusting.  I was rarely at the house except to sleep and didn't use the kitchen--it was pretty messy with spilled food on the stove and pans in the sink.  I assumed that other guests had left it that way, because the kitchen is open to all guests."
1471308,76271188,2016-05-26,50768036,Maria,"Alexandra has a great place. Very organized, down to having a welcome book for guests to maps/brochures for Boston. We saw her only when we arrived, so this place is good if you're looking for an independent trip. Was a little inconvenient with only having 1 bathroom since Alexandra had other guests in another of her rooms. Thanks Alexandra."
1471308,76906371,2016-05-29,8200774,Lam,"Alexandra's place was nice, cozy, and clean.  Bathroom was clean, and she made sure you had everything you needed for a nice stay.  She was very accommodating."

"Nice person but common spaces were far below the limits in cleaning.\"",,,,,
1471308,80471077,2016-06-18,11278748,Karen,Really enjoyed our stay with Alexandra. Place was as described. We enjoyed the vast array of K-cup coffees in the neat kitchen. The shower water is a bit finicky though and takes a while to heat up if no one showered prior to you. Everything is organized and clean. Highly recommend!
1471308,82572340,2016-06-28,9024661,Graeme,"The apartment was very neat and clean, and quite cozy, with a nice terrace to have coffee on in the morning.  Also the area was nice with a pleasant English feel about it."
1471308,83157876,2016-07-01,18171523,Alessandro,Foi bom! Mas me senti como em um hotel qualquer. Anfitriã fria e indiferente.
1471308,87071964,2016-07-18,83040929,Joe,Alexandra's spot is in such a great location. 20 minute walk to Fenway and surrounded by awesome colleges. Good bars and restaurants around too. The place was perfect. Thanks
1471308,88383959,2016-07-24,70950440,Andrea,"Boston es una ciudad hermosa y el apartamento esta muy bien ubicado. Sin embargo el apartamento no es para nada acogedor, la anfitriona nos respondía de mala manera a nuestras consultas y en general tuvimos una mala relación con ella."
"La estadía tampoco fue cómoda porque el apartamento estaba sucio y desordenado. \"",,,,,
1471308,89230603,2016-07-27,79717100,Brenda,Alexandra was timely in meeting us and gave us a restaurant suggestion including advising us to bring the meal back to her table as the AC there was more suitable for a warm evening.
1471308,90368951,2016-07-31,31454186,Pauline,"Clean room and no pb to access to the kitchen or the bathroom, but we didn't  share anything or spend time with Alexandra..."
1471308,91034419,2016-08-03,2764876,Celine,"We had a very bad experience at Alexandra's apt : dirty dishes in the kitchen making it not usable, hairs on the floor of the bedroom and everywhere in the bathroom : sink, bathtub, hairballs by the cleaning products, overspilling bin in the bathroom. The living room was such a mess it was inaccessible for the 3 days we were there. The balcony wasn't accessible for guests either. The AC was running loudly the whole night. More guests were staying in the other room, making us feel like in a crowded dirty hostel. The window in our room was tiny and looking at a wall a meter away, giving a very claustrophobic feeling to the whole experience."
1471308,91460931,2016-08-05,392610,Nandini,The location was terrific and exactly where I wanted to be for a 2 day conference. Alexandra was great about communicating with me and accommodating my hectic travel schedule.

1471308,95808951,2016-08-21,83156059,Dorian,"If you need just a place to sleep and are not concerned about cleanliness, I would recommend this listing. The apartment had a hostel feel to it and was well stocked, however the bathroom and kitchen could use a good cleaning. Parking is very difficult and I would recommend downloading the park Boston app. You can park and refill your meter on your phone from anywhere in the city (2.65 every two hours, Monday-Saturday from 8am to 6pm). I had asked our host about parking a week before our arrival and she did not get back to us until late the night before we were leaving for Boston. Unfortunately this was not enough time to plan our arrival and parking! Luckily it worked out for us and we found street parking, however parking is very expensive if you decide to park in a garage, and it may be better to take public transit into the city."

1471308,96399138,2016-08-22,67149677,Michael,"There were three people in the other room, and with the host bathroom time was at a premium. Otherwise great."
1471308,97903614,2016-08-28,90135642,Ryan,Visited Boston for the weekend and Alexandra was an excellent host. Great apartment a block from the train and a 20 minute walk to Fenway Park. She let me pick up the keys before official check in time on Friday and communicated that very well. Definitely recommend staying here!

13788865,90191984,2016-07-31,3984625,Jaime,"Larry is such a nice host. Everything I needed to know about the apartment was provided. Great location for staying a night in town for a wedding in the financial district, right in the theater district by the Commons. Larry  gets extra bonus points for being awesome. I accidentally left something important in his place after I checked out, and he was very accommodating and helped coordinate a time for me to retrieve it.  Thanks Larry!  :-)"
13788865,93979772,2016-08-14,24789989,Chris,Larry was a very hospitable host and the location of his studio couldn't have been better! The apartment worked out great for our one night stay in Boston! The only issue we had was the bed situation. It was a little small for two of us and the padding wasn't great so it was a little uncomfortable. Otherwise everything else was exactly what we wanted/needed!
13788865,94903664,2016-08-17,87930947,Amanda,"This apartment was a perfect home base for a couple of days exploring Boston. The location couldn't be better; and Larry was super flexible about the key handoff timing, which I greatly appreciated."
13788865,95326303,2016-08-19,40612707,Sunny,"The place was definitely in a good spot in Boston. Close to Boston Commons and many restaurants/bars. Larry was also very responsive and willing to work with me on some Air BnB mix up. The place is super minimal, no real bed and he did forget to provide towels and other things usually I've have experienced staying at other places. Other than that I would recommend to stay at the air BnB."
13788865,96325561,2016-08-22,89968175,Michele,Larry's place was a wonderful place to get away and explore the city.
13788865,97944097,2016-08-29,5873877,Kara,Larry's place was exactly what I needed! Location was right in the middle of everything and was able to walk anywhere I wanted to go. There's also a metro station right across the street if that's how you plan on getting around. Building was safe and had security personnel at the door. Would definitely stay here if I find myself in Boston again!
13788865,99337472,2016-09-04,59901605,Patrick,Super convenient location next to Boston Commons park. Spacious studio stocked with drinking water and snacks.
12446656,72080883,2016-05-01,30799200,Ryan,Amanda and Jay were extremely hospitable and the location provided us with a central location to explore the best that Boston has to offer.  The apartment was clean and cozy which made for a very comfortable stay!
12446656,73548467,2016-05-08,43295439,Judith,Right there when I called.  Helped me carry bag up to 4th floor and down when I left.  Set up Sofa bed immediately and very comfy as advertised.  Perfect location near park. Helpful with suggestions with Metro. Compromised privacy since bathroom is available to all.
12446656,74797013,2016-05-16,60759172,René,Amanda was really nice.  The time there was great!

12446656,78254527,2016-06-06,5974340,Kiana,Had a great time at Amanda and Jay's! Their apartment was great and had an amazing location. It was a quick walk from Fenway and House of Blues. Amanda and Jay were also very accommodating and communicated well with me.

12446656,97479111,2016-08-27,80829154,Gerardo,"Host John was very friendly and helpful.  Sofa bed was very comfortable and Fenway location cant be beat, with Fenway Park, bars, restaurants within walking distance.  Parking was a little hectic, so taking the T or Uber may be easier to get around."

Our room was prepared like a nice hotel room. He even provided us with towels, shampoo, etc., anything you might have forgotten.  The hole apartment is clean and well equipped. It is located only 2 minutes from the next subway station!  Fortunately Derian helped us to find a free parking for our rental car. If you ask him he will give you useful tips to visit Boston, too."
"Thanks for your hospitality Derian!\"",,,,,
3693850,19349211,2014-09-10,2719721,Laura,"We had a very nice stay in Derian and Brians home. Everything was very clean. It should be mentioned that the two have another roommate in the flat so there could be dificulties using the only bathroom if you are in a hurry. There were some details that we talked about with Derian and he agreed to change (transparent curtains, laundry during the night). Derian is a very open minded person. we had a great chat with him."
3693850,19448551,2014-09-12,21111974,松錦,"Derian and Brian were very friendly! They provided me many stuffs during my stay. I had a nice chat with Derian about things we love! The location was very convenient, literally only two-minute walk from Forest Hill Station. The neighborhood was pretty and safe. I definitely would like to come back again!"
3693850,19714458,2014-09-16,3806162,Marti,"Perfect place to stay! It was easy to reach Derian and arrange times, the room was as advertised and everything was super clean. Derian owns the apartment and clearly invested in it, very tasteful and thoughtful decorating, very complete and inviting! The bed was comfortable and the shower hot and strong. The street is super cute and around the corner from a bar, a restaurant, a coffee place with amazing breakfast sandwiches and a convenience store. The Forest Hill station area is a little dark to walk around at night but cross through the station to walk right onto JP's main artery with a ton of cute shops, restaurants and grocery stores. Wish we could have stayed longer!"

His house is easy to find just near the station, so don't worry about the transportation! Just order it! I am sure if I get the chance to be here again, I will definitely order the room again! Recommend!"
3693850,19900022,2014-09-20,20780187,Abdul,"Derian's place is delightful, as shown in the photos and very comfortable. It is near (10min walk) the subway st. Derian was really kind of receiving us with our 7 month old baby, who was very enternained with a musical bassinet Derian lent us during our stay. Derian also lent us a highchair and a diaper changer. Also, there is hypoallergenic soap and shampoo for the guests, which was great for our baby! Netflix and Hulu is also available!"
3693850,19984169,2014-09-21,21229867,Cyntia,It was perfect! 2 minutes walk from the metro! Total ;-) Quiet charming place and the host are really nice with the little dog!! :-)

Derian, Brian and Dina are super cool and really helpful. They were very patient answering my countless rookie questions about Boston and how to use iron ;)  That being said, I must admmit that they were totally outshined by Chester The Dog. Chester rules!"
3693850,20451149,2014-09-29,7547701,Matthew,"We had a fabulous experience staying here. Darien and Brian are friendly and welcoming (as was their pup) and their home is clean and cozy. The guest bedroom is comfy and gets nice light in the morning. Darien even left out medicine for me when he heard me coughing.  The location is great, just a block or two from the orange line, which gets you pretty much anywhere in the city. There's a nice coffee shop around the corner, as well as a little diner and a pub. As former Boston residents, we would happily stay here again. Thanks guys!"

Derian and Brian were extremely nice and personable hosts and their accommodation was perfect for what I needed.  They are quick to respond before, during, and after the stay and we had great conversation when I arrived."
The bed was comfy,neighborhood quiet,and shower hot ( I don't know where they bought their towels for guests,but they are awesome ). Their home is incredibly close to the orange line T stop to get anywhere and an UBER was able to pick me up in the neighborhood in less than 5 mins to get me where I needed to go.,,

I only spent the night there. The house was extremely clean and the room was exactly as described. However, there was an odor (I suspect) from their Dog Chester whom is being trained to use pads in the only bathroom in the house."

3693850,21352863,2014-10-15,21684993,Simon,"I want to thank Derian and Brian for hosting me during my short stay in Boston. Their place is real comfortable and really near to Forest Hill subway station. This makes it convenient for me to travel out. Room is as per described. Not too small for me and really love the bed and the small candles by the window. They prepared everything such as heater, towels (i did not expect that), extra blanket and even a sleeping aid. My stay there was really nice. The only regret I have was that I did not have much time to really chat with them due to my tight schedule. Recommended place to stay and I would love to stay there again when I am back in Boston."

3693850,21956905,2014-10-27,13271927,Michal,We stayed at Derian and Brian's place for almost 10 days and it was a lovely experience. They were great hosts and responded quickly to every request or need we had. The room is very nice but can get a bit crowded between two people and two suitcases. The neighborhood and the arboretum are both beautiful and it's an easy commute to downtown Boston.
3693850,22202387,2014-11-01,4242987,Francis,"I had a great stay at Derian and Brian's place. I was visiting Boston for a conference, and so was out for large parts of the day for that, but I happy during my time in the apartment. The room was as described in the pictures. The place in general was clean and tidy. Derian was very welcoming and made it known that I was able to use all parts of the house, not just the room I rented. Derian and I also shared some good conversations together. I'd definitely rent again if I was in Boston."

3693850,24516560,2014-12-29,11223544,HyeJae,Charming place with lovely host. One night with this house should be one of the most attractive memory in Boston. Thanks to Derian & Brian.

3693850,30437967,2015-04-22,23025847,Jose,I had a very pleasant experience on my first airbnb. The hosts were friendly and helpful. The room was clean and cozy. The place was conveniently located for the things I wanted to do in Boston. Safe neighborhood. My only complain was the bad weather condition on Boston Marathon day! Lol!
3693850,30643584,2015-04-25,31280192,Joana,Derian was an absolute delight! The place is just as inviting as it looks and very well kept. The space is warm just like its host and its small details like a sound machine for the room. The area itself is charming with lots of character and the quick walk to the T was an extra plus. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay in this oasis!

3693850,31120630,2015-05-02,30597374,Marc,"Derian, Brian, and Chester were all very gracious and warm hosts.    The room and rest of the house was very clean and inviting. I was in town for a conference in the downtown area and this was a great location to explore Jamaica Plain including the incredible Forest Hills Cemetery a short walk away.  The location is ideal given the proximity to the T stop which enabled exploring all parts of the city."
3693850,31231399,2015-05-03,31293851,Juliet,"Derian responded immediately, provided huge amounts of important information, had everything all set for us.  We didn't even need to have one single worry. The shower was incredible, the apartment open and cheerful, great artwork, super close to the T, and the white noise machine!  WOW! That practically saved it all for my boyfriend. We loved the plushness of the bed and bedding.  We were given privacy and treated with respect.  Also, Chester came by to say hello.  All in all, we loved this experience and have the utmost of gratitude for Derian and Brian."
3693850,32124322,2015-05-14,28280887,Paul,"Derian and Brian are very nice, the location was very convenient to me (2-3 blocks from the T), everything was very clean and well-furnished -- and quiet -- and the bed was very comfortable.  I especially appreciated that the apartment was as pleasant up close as it appeared to be in the listing photos."
3693850,32327747,2015-05-17,15312160,Natascha,"The room was clean and had everything we needed. We traveled with two suitcases and there wasn't much room for both, but Derian let us leave one in the dining room.  He was very nice and gave us tips on where to eat."
The place is extremely close to the orange line which goes every 5-10 minutes. In about 25min we were in downtown Boston (downtown crossing or haymarket). Very convenient!!! Oh and Derian even provided us with Charlie cards that we could load and use. Not that we needed them. Tip: the 7 day ticket is worth buying if you stay for two or more days.,,,,,
"We didn't feel like we were in a big city. The street was quiet at night with little to no traffic noise. I couldn't say the same about the birds thou. Noisy as heck. Earplugs recommended ;)\"",,,,,
3693850,32840411,2015-05-22,28308526,Cyril,Derian and Brian were very friendly and attentive. The room as well as the rest of the flat were as nice and clean as in the photos. The house is very close to a metro station and a short walk from many restaurants and coffee shops. I would certainly recommend this place.

3693850,33610688,2015-05-30,33349557,Sam,"What an incredible home!! Not only is the neighborhood the perfect location (across the street from the T, great restaurants, and beautiful attractions like the arboretum), the space itself is gorgeous. Derian and Brian have done a beautiful job of creating a home that is aesthetically lovely, functionally, and made my boyfriend and I feel welcome and at ease. My only regret is that we did not get to spend more time there!"
3693850,33685460,2015-05-31,7103758,Rittu,We had a very short stay at Derian & Brian's but they were wonderful hosts with an adorable dog! Place was nice clean and had everything we needed.  Location is not right in centre but taking the subway is super easy and closeby.
3693850,34135462,2015-06-05,30231179,Jody,"Derian and Brian were wonderful hosts.  They made my first AirBNB experience very easy.  The space was exactly as it appeared.  My son was especially excited about Chester.  The neighborhood was a little noisy at night, but there was a white noise machine that helped drown out the chatter.  The house was a quick walk to the T, which was great as we took that everywhere.  I would definitely recommend this listing and would stay with Derian and Brian on future trips to Boston."
3693850,34627648,2015-06-10,4671442,Kayla,Derian and Brian are terrific hosts - very friendly and helpful. Their home is beautiful and they clearly care about their guests' comfort.  Their dog Chester was so sweet and I never heard him bark once in 5 days!
We arrived really late and I was honestly quite concerned with finding the house,the keys,etc.,but everything was as smooth as could be.  The bed was incredibly comfortable.  The bathroom was very spacious and I loved the super plush towels. We were mostly only at the house to sleep,so we didn't really have the opportunity to enjoy the rest of the house,but everything was very bright/cheery and fully accessible to guests.
I really enjoyed how quiet this house was - there was not a single time that we were disturbed by any kind of noise so that was a huge plus.  I was also concerned about sharing a bathroom just from a convenience perspective,but that wasn't a problem either.  Again,Derian and Brian were great.  We only had the opportunity to hang out a couple of times after we had come in for the day right before going to bed,but they were both friendly and engaging and I wish we had more time to hang out with them!,,
The house is very conveniently located to the T.  It's a 2 or 3 minute walk down a quiet,peaceful residential street and then across one street.  Unfortunately,the T stop was closed on Saturday & Sunday due to some scheduled maintenance.  There were complimentary buses taking passengers 6 stops down to pick up the T there.  The only problem with this is that it took an extra 20 or 30 minutes,but obviously this wasn't the hosts' fault and wouldn't normally be a problem for guests.  Due to the T closure,we ended up taking Uber a lot and that only cost like $12 to get all the way from downtown to JP.  We did use the T to get to the airport and that was super easy and convenient.  We did not get to explore the area much,but it seemed cool with lots of restaurants within an easy walk.
The only negative that I can say is that the room is quite small.  Other reviews have mentioned this and the hosts even have the dimensions listed,so we knew it was going to be small but I don't think we realized how small.  With the bed and furniture,there is like a 3 by 3 space to get ready in and there are two doors in that area so it was sometimes a challenge for us to both get ready at the same time.  We had packed light,"but still trying to get things in and out of the suitcase was a bit of a hassle.  I also feel like the bed was a Full instead of a Queen so we were a bit cramped but other than that everything was great!\"",,
3693850,34746477,2015-06-11,35038423,Alexander,"Derian and Brian have a lovely home, very accommodating. They were super helpful with any question we had. The place is steps away from the orange line that takes you directly into the heart of Boston. This place is perfect for anyone who is intimidated by city driving. Would definitely stay here again :)"
3693850,35000864,2015-06-14,34323564,Kshanti,Beautiful room in one of my favorite suburbs of Boston. Walking distance to some amazing restaurants as well as the T station. Very comfortable bed on a quiet street. The hosts were super friendly. The whole apartment was gorgeous and very clean. Great towels and a huge bathroom.
3693850,35322565,2015-06-17,447454,Hannah,"It was only a short stay but it was most certainly a happy one.  Communication was good and Brian was at the home to greet us when we arrived.  We had a great chat to him about the local area and he shared some of his experiences around America which has helped us with our travels.  The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  The white noise machine worked a charm as there is a bit of building work not too far away but the machine blocked it out completely. After the first day we didn't get to spend too much time with our hosts as we were busy exploring the city but they were lovely when we did. Oats where available for breakfast as well as tea and coffee.  Clean towels where provided and they even gave us Charlie cards to get around with. Great stay, definitely recommend and would go back."

The apartment is walking distance from Centre Street in Jamaica Plain with lots of fun shops, restaurants and cafés, and also close to the Arboretum, a beautiful, large park. The nearby orange line station makes access to most downtown neighbourhoods easy."

( I think I could live in their back patio, so beautiful.) After a long drive we were very tired and ended up staying in on our first day and relaxing, having spent the afternoon at the park not far from the house. We got a taste of the local scene of Boston and it was just what we wanted. The T was right down the block, which made traveling so easy and after a long day of touristing the short walk was exactly what my short legs begged for. There is also a deli and a few other restaurants right down the block as well, Dogwood being our choice for breakfast and later on dinner as well. Our hosts were again great, it felt like we were at home and they didn't bother us at all more so the other way around as we had so many questions that they were more than happy to help with. A truly memorable experience thanks to these two; highly recommend staying here you won't regret it."
3693850,39305485,2015-07-22,36490405,Stephen & Taotao,"Derian and Brian quickly made us feel welcome.  They were fun and friendly with practical advice.  The room was just as advertised.  Amenities were very good.  Shared bathroom was spacious and well-stocked.  Shampoo, conditioner and soap in the tub - with scent-free versions.  Full set of towels.  Ample closet space, with clothes hangers.  Window blinds.  The room was quiet and dark at night.  The A/C unit and overhead fan were capable of keeping the room cool on a very hot & humid day in July."
For us,the greatest challenge was parking.  Derian helped guide us to street parking,but even still the nearest intersection is tricky and Tower Street is a dead-end,tightly packed with cars.,,
The only quibbles we had were breakfast and the bed's comfort.  The bed was a futon mattress.  As mattress and box-spring types,we found it a little lumpy.  Plus we would've like a headboard for propping up pillows at night for reading.  The breakfast was only instant foods,with a hot-water carafe for boiling water.  Instant oatmeal is OK but instant coffee was a mild shocker.  From the Pacific Northwest,we couldn't fathom this.  Luckily,Fazenda's Coffee Roasters is just down the block.  A hipster joint with espresso bar,fresh breakfast sandwiches
3693850,39912214,2015-07-27,14023520,Chal,"We loved staying with Derian & Brian! Everything was extremely clean, tidy, and efficient. The room was cozy and well stocked with anything a vacationer might need. The Charlie cards attached to the keychains were a godsend, and we had plenty to do both in the neighborhood and around Boston. We slept fantastically in the quiet neighborhood, and Chester was adorable. I would definitely recommend staying here.  When I'm in Boston again, I'll likely be back."

The bright color was just so cute. They also provided the metro card which made our trip super easy. Lovely experience and I would definifely recommend this place!
3693850,42178400,2015-08-11,38973450,Chainarong,Awesome room! It's really close to the orange line. Although the room was available at 4 PM but the arrival time was flexible. We arrived before the check in time but we can take a shower before going to anywhere which's really great. The hosts were nice and I recommend this place for people who wanna go to Boston.
3693850,42536754,2015-08-14,9525794,Ellen Jiahui,"Derian and Brian's apartment is so pretty! Just as how it's shown on pictures. I met Derian most of the time, and he gave me lots of valuable recommendations about where to visit. Boston is undoubtedly the best city I visited in this long trip on east coast!"

The neighborhood is quiet and the room is nice especially when the sunlight comes in in the morning. It would be a really great place if someone enjoys tranquility and exploring the city."
3693850,44085835,2015-08-23,41003860,Christin,"We had a wonderful stay at Derain and Brian's place. The room was small, but it was perfect for our needs. They left perfect directions to locate keys and find our room. Everything was clean and the bathroom and shared spaces were also tidy. The location was awesome - 2 minutes from the orange line and plenty of street parking. My only minor complaint was that the international guests who were staying the night after U.S. Burst into our room at 7:30 am. There was some confusion that would have probably been fixed with a lock on our deal. No big deal, but we were motivated to get out of there a bit quicker as the house was packed at that point. I would stay here again based on the location, price, and cleanliness."
3693850,44916810,2015-08-30,16426280,Ralitsa,"It's very close to metro station. The place is exactly as advertised and the living conditions are great. Overall, recommend!"

Great location on a quiet street super convenient to orange line! Towels a toiletries were so nice and they were even generous enough to allow my use of the laundry machines. My husband and I had a great night sleep there and really loved the coffee shop down the street, too."
3693850,45802041,2015-09-06,32334655,Malcolm,My wife and I stayed 5 days in Boston. We were super comfortable and wish we could have stayed longer. Really nice place to relax and close to everything if you want to go out.
3693850,46202517,2015-09-08,1572741,Shideh,"Derian and Brian were great and prompt with their communications with us. The room was as described; it was a small nice and clean room with a very comfortable bed and pillows. We shared a bathroom with others in the apartment. Derian had turned on the AC in our room prior to our arrival which we appreciated a lot. He also greeted us kindly when we arrived and showed us around. We arrived late and left early in the morning to catch our flight, so unfortunately, we did not get a chance to meet Brian or to talk much with Derian."
3693850,46491379,2015-09-11,36061490,Miet,We had a lovely stay within Derian and Brian in Boston.
"Everything was clean and very well organised!\"",,,,,
3693850,47338790,2015-09-17,11521496,Lauren,Derian & Brain have a beautiful home. My boyfriend & I did not get to actually meet them but it was incredibly easy to check in. The room & the rest of the house was exactly as described! The bed was so comfortable. Super super close to transit & the beautiful arboretum. They even include a charlie card with the key! I will defiantly stay there again if the opportunity arises!
3693850,47751258,2015-09-21,42040899,Lauren And Paul,"Before we even arrived, Brian and Derian communicated very well with me, as I am new to air Bnb and was skeptical as to staying in anothers home. But Paul and I went and everything was as described, the directions they gave us to get there, and to get keys were right on point. They even gave us a Charlie card to get around the city on the T, which was conveniently close to the Bnb (orange line) and was also easily accessible to get to other T lines. The room we stood in was a bit smaller than I expected, but it was comfy nonetheless. As we arrived a bit earlier than check-in time, we were able to leave our things in the dining room and go about our day. When we got back to our room however, the air was on ready for us and clean towels in the closet. We unfortunately didn't get to meet Brian or Derian, but we did have the pleasure of meeting their friendly dog Chester and another couple that were also staying with Brian And Derian. We also left them a dessert from our dinner to thank them for the stay. It was an overall great experience in Boston and a great comfy stay @ this bnb. clean, convenient and comfy."
3693850,48093286,2015-09-23,37558697,Helena,We had a really great time in Derians and Brians home. They are wunderful host and helped us to find the free parking space for. They also gave us recommendations for places to visit.

L'auto check - in è comodissimo perché lascia grande libertà. La stanza è piccola ma confortevole, pulita e silenziosa. Buon rapporto qualità/prezzo visti gli standard di Boston. Consigliato."

3693850,49633861,2015-10-05,24621838,Andrew,"The bed was good.  Though a bedside table or two would have made it better (and some in-bed reading light).  Sharing a bathroom was something good to know ahead of time (not the best thing, but doable).  Access to T was great.  Neighborhood is great, though parking would have been impossible if we hadn't had our niece's car who lives in JP (has the resident sticker).  It was quiet and very clean."
3693850,49868114,2015-10-06,25555984,Kilee,The best airnbnb experience I've ever had. Everything was very organized and very clear. Very easy check in as well.

3693850,50294383,2015-10-11,41615936,Katie,"Our stay with Derian and Brian was everything we could hope for and more!  The room and amenities were exactly as described and the apartment was kept neat and cozy.  The hosts were accommodating without being overwhelming and even provided my boyfriend and me with a Charlie card for our visit. Derian and Brian's home is conveniently located to the orange line Forest Hills stop which made coming and going from the city a breeze.  They were even nice enough to allow me to use their washer and dryer which was an amazing convenience to have.  This was our first Airbnb experience so it was hard to anticipate what to expect, therefore we were even more thrilled at how comfortable the hosts made our stay.  The suggestion for free weekly parking on a nearby street kept our car safe and tucked out of the way. A few other things we really liked were:"
The hosts had large maps of Boston available for our use.,,,,,
There were plenty of large,high quality towels available as well as extra blankets,if needed.,,,
The shower,which was stocked with amazing toiletries,had plenty of hot water and great water pressure!,,,
The keys and charlie card were given to us on a lanyard which made it easy to carry and use.,,,,,
The neighborhood felt safe,quiet and quaint while still being close to great restaurants,a coffee shop,and the beautiful arboretum.,,
There was a large mirror and plenty of outlets in the bedroom which made getting ready for the day easy.,,,,,
The hosts gave us plenty of privacy and were always quiet and respectful when leaving the apartment for the day.,,,,,
Their dog Chester was so sweet and friendly,but the hosts were respectful to keep him on their side of the house (Even though we would not have minded seeing more of Chester!),,,,
We really could not think of any suggestions for the hosts to improve the experience (and we are picky!),,,,,
Overall,Derian and Brian are very kind and thoughtful and their approach to hosting Airbnb is the perfect blend of professional and hospitable.  We stayed at a different Airbnb for the later part of our trip,and it became clear immediately that D&B have mastered the art of hosting.  If you have the chance to stay here,you should.  It is affordable and very comfortable.  We will be staying here for our next Boston trip because we can't imagine a much better experience.,,

Parking was pretty awful, but that seems to just be Boston in general. The hosts were friendly and offered suggestions regarding places to see, restaurants, etc. The flat was very inviting, nicely decorated, and very affordable."
3693850,50938696,2015-10-16,14212161,Jason & Justine,"We stayed at Brian and Derian's house for 2 nights on our way back from Canada. The room is 'cosy' and you won;t have a lot of your 'own' space but it overlooks the street full of interesting Bostonian houses. it is very close to Forrest Hill station, which made getting in and out of the city very easy. If you choose to walk into the centre of town, you can follow the Emerald Necklace Gardens, which will take you about an hour. Brian and Derian were friendly and the room is as described."
3693850,51020690,2015-10-17,39111882,Shaz,We stayed overnight and found the space very comfortable. It's super close to public transport so sightseeing wasn't an issue. We didn't get to meet our hosts but everything was laid out for us.
3693850,51774695,2015-10-24,45447232,Dennis,"This being our first Airbnb experience, we were pleasantly surprised.

3693850,51964791,2015-10-25,44792610,Melissa,Derian and Brian were incredible hosts. The apartment was spotless- my mother and I were so impressed with the cleanliness. I also can't thank them enough for how kind they were. My mother was very nervous (having never done AirBNB before) and they made the experience a smooth one. Thanks for everything!

We enjoyed the lovely bathroom and the colorful decor very much.  Room was as described and adequate for our needs.  Derrien was our host and we enjoyed talking to him.   Many nice touches in the bathroom and in our desk, as well as the Charlie card, made our stay very pleasant .  Thanks, guys."

Room and double bed very comfortable. An exceptionally clean house - certainly raises the bar for other AirBNB hosts! Friendly host. Good restaurant options a block away. Suggest Fazenda for a great coffee and Dogwood for upmarket pub type food with good beers on tap. I would not hesitate to stay here again if in Boston for a few days."

The bed and the room were very comfortable as was the rest of the house.  I was pleased with the quality bedding and spa like bathroom.

Derian's response was super quick, and the room was arranged before taking the flight. The place was very easy to reach with subway, it's only about 20 min distance from back bay area using subway, and the instructions to get to the room was clear. Also, you can find several places to eat and dine in the nearby. The room is very cozy and clean, enough spaceous for one person, maybe a little bit small for two people. Since I was busy during my stay, I didn't have much chance to use other facilities in the house other than the bathroom. However, the bathroom was very clean and modern. I got the chance to see Derian several times, and he's a very kind and helpful guy.  In overall, I would definitely recommend this place for those travelers who are looking for an affordable and clean place with easy access to city center."

We had a lot in common and had a great time chatting while we were there. He was very accommodating, so if you're just looking for a place to stay, I got the sense that he would just as easily give you space and privacy.  My boyfriend and I watched a movie on Netflix, cooked dinner, and hung out in the living room, all things that we wouldn't have been able to do at a hotel. Everything was clean and neat, parking was easy, and the house itself is beautiful!"

We had issues and had to change dates and he was more than accommodating.  Very helpful and quickly responded to any questions we had.  My daughter and I enjoyed staying in the beautiful room.  The house is located steps away from the train station making is extremely easy to get around.  Thank you Derian for making our stay so comfortable and enjoyable.

3693850,59103065,2016-01-06,2640233,Michael,"Derian was in very constant communication and made me feel very welcome. His profile had all of the necessary information about getting into the house ahead of time (though I didn't read it!), but he was very helpful in telling me how to get into his home once I arrive. I never stayed in an Air B&B apartment where you could self-check in, and it was very safe, effective and convenient. The house itself was beautiful -- the bed was super comfortable and all of the amenities were new. The apartment is located at the end of one of Boston's subway lines, which isn't a very long subway ride from the center of the city. The subway is close, there are a few nice restaurants in the area (including a wonderful Indian restaurant right across from the subway station), and an incredible historic park/cemetery where you can get lost among beautiful monuments, trees, and lake. Overall a fantastic stay! Another plus was that the bedroom remained very warm in the middle of a few cold winter days. Lastly, Derian is a great guy with lots of entertaining stories to tell about his world travels."

3693850,61622265,2016-02-06,36299795,Gregory,Staying at this wonderful location has made my travel experience that much more enjoyable. Completely clean in every way from the bathroom to the vibrantly colorful bedroom. Each room in this beautiful apartment brings many comfortable vibes and would recommend to anyone. Enjoyed the coffee and the fresh cleaned towels.
3693850,61872696,2016-02-08,36299795,Gregory,"Staying at Derians home was absolutely delightful due to the ambiance and great hospitality offered at his home.  Everything is perfectly described within the guidelines instructed by Derian. The entire place was immaculate in cleanliness from fresh clean beading to a pristine bathroom. The living room was designed with sophistication, the kitchen was completely organized with beautiful matching plates.  Felt as if I walked into a magazine."

The location is the perfect walking distance from the T, so the rest of Boston is just a subway ride away! Would definitely stay again next time I'm in the neighborhood."
3693850,63091288,2016-02-20,51642474,Kangning,Derian is really a great host and very considerate. His house is very clean and well furnished. The house is located near the subway station less than 3 minutes walk with good neighborhood
3693850,63516939,2016-02-23,58404515,Apple,"这里很舒服,有干净的洗浴池,暖和的房间和安静环境。不巧的是我没有和房东相见,但是他一定是个非常亲切的人。(URL HIDDEN) is an comfortable room,a warmhearted host,clean and queit environment.Why did not you  come here?haha."
3693850,63606104,2016-02-24,23036288,Gülin,"Everything was great! Derian is an amazing host. The whole place looks like it came out of a magazine. I really loved the plant in the bathroom. Overall, my favorite airbnb so far!"
3693850,63770668,2016-02-26,10547812,Haley,What a perfect experience! Great host (I guess that's why he earned the title of Superhost). Very accessible and friendly. Loved it!
3693850,63865126,2016-02-27,36724841,Eric,Dorian was welcoming and had a very nice set up. The room was laid out well and had everything I could want in a comfortable night stay.
3693850,64030440,2016-02-28,44767123,Doug,"This was a last minute need and we were very happy with the result, a clean room, solitude, hot water and a superb location. The proximity of the Forrest Hills cemetery made for a great walk. Towels were appreciated, thanks."

3693850,64583684,2016-03-05,59988681,Quela,"Derian made us feel very welcome, directions were clear, the neighborhood was great and the room as well as the interior of the house were also very nice. We had a great stay."
3693850,64986151,2016-03-09,12665172,Ramon,Very nice house. Nice quiet neighborhood.  3 minutes from commuter rail station. 15 minute ride to South Station.
3693850,65655387,2016-03-16,9563399,Maya,"Derain was very responsive, and helpful throughout the whole trip. He was very kind even through we didn't get to meet face to face."
3693850,66000392,2016-03-18,61705662,Nick,"I actually did not see Derian at all, but that was not a problem! The whole space functions pretty much autonomously. Check in and check out is done with a lockbox, which means that it is extremely convenient. The apartment is also fully stocked for your convenience. From shampoo/conditioner/soap in the bathroom to pamphlets on touring Boston in the desk drawer. The whole experience was very well managed; Derian seems like an expert Airbnb hoast."
3693850,66244535,2016-03-20,56762009,Ivone,"A friend and I spent two days at the orange room. We loved our room which was warm and cozy. The same with the rest of the house, clean, quiet and only 4 minutes from the T station. We couldn't meet Derian in person but we sensed that he cares about his guests as he provided everything we needed."
3693850,67275851,2016-03-27,1264315,Phil,Derian e-mailed me with instructions on how to get in. The place itself is great. I think the pictures do not really do it justice. Felt very welcome in the house. As for the area itself it is right by the subway so pretty easy to get to the center town if needed. Really great value.
3693850,67706901,2016-03-30,59755742,Obadiah,I had a great stay with Derian! He was a great host and his home was lovely!
3693850,67989840,2016-04-01,28641970,Xiangshu,"Derian is a very considerate host, when we got to Boston, it was really cold, but he turned on the heater to warm the room before we arrived. The room was very clean and the house had everything we needed. Derian explained everything every clear, we had no problem while staying here."
3693850,70098306,2016-04-16,56250970,Nicolás,"Muy buena la casa, muy limpia y ordenada. Una bella experiencia."

Derian was a great host and provided everything we needed to ensure we had a great stay.  The house was immaculate and the neighborhood was safe and very close to public transportation. We couldn't have had a more positive experience staying at Derian's!
3693850,71662940,2016-04-27,30685450,Lobna,"Me and my sister stayed a night, thr appartment is beautiful and very clean. Every thing was great, the location is very close to the tran 15-20 min from downtown. Derian was very kind, we had a lovely stay, very recommended."
3693850,71872082,2016-04-29,751513,Kim,"I enjoyed my stay at Derian's home very much. Our room was very clean and comfortable, and the bathroom was immaculate. Derian was friendly and welcoming, and his home is located within an easy walk from the Forest Hills MBTA station."
3693850,72517334,2016-05-03,13831724,Alda,It was so pleasant to stay in Derian's home. And it truly is a home. We felt so welcomed and comfortable with our accommodation.  There is nothing that Derian has not thought of. Public transport is easy.   Our room was on the small side for 2 people but very comfy. Derian is a great host and we take away happy memories.
3693850,72958201,2016-05-05,57734756,Ruey-Yu,The location is good and near to the metro station. The room was clean and the host is very kind! We had good experience there!
3693850,73107796,2016-05-06,43380575,Dorothy,This location is perfect for visiting Boston. Parking was easy in lot across from T. Easy ride on Orange Line. Home is charming and clean. I had great night's sleep. Derian makes you feel very welcome.
3693850,73260493,2016-05-07,34662906,Kelly,We only stayed one night in Derian's home but it made us want to stay more ! Derian was very welcoming and explained everything beforehand. His apartment is wonderfully decorated and in a nice neighborhood. It was very easy to get to Boston city center with the T.
3693850,73785146,2016-05-10,29347105,Md,He was very cute and nice. I also make some friends with other guests in another room. The neighbourhood makes you feel safe. There is a very nice cafe nearby. The place is very close to the subway station. The room was a bit too small but it's comfy.
3693850,74185778,2016-05-13,59039484,Moti,We choose the place because of the location - near the last station of the orange line.
The room we stayed in was small but the rest of the space is large and we used the room only to sleep.,,,,,
"There is no parking in the street so we had to park our car at a different street not very far.\"",,,,,
3693850,74520132,2016-05-15,21506799,Virginia,"Derian's home is lovely, and even though we came in late and left early, he made it a point to meet us and make sure we were satisfied with the room. The last day of our stay, our daughter stopped by. On learning that she had just graduated from a local school, Derian gave her a bag of congratulatory chocolates. What a sweet gesture!"
3693850,75519914,2016-05-22,31030622,Adriano,"The place was very clean and prepared to welcome arriving guests. All was previously organized and planned. However, there's no free parking on the same street. It's a resident exclusive parking area, so if you need to park, you'll have to go a bit further from the house, but the host gave me instructions on how to get there. Colorful and bright, the room is nice, a bit smaller than expected, but not a problem if traveling with small luggage. I believe the host does not live in the apartment since we barely saw him. What I really liked is that the host lends some rechargeable cards for the subway, with which we can pay a lower fare to go downtown, which is really less than 20 min away on the orange line. Overall, a great place that I can recommend! Positive experience! Thanks and bravo Derian!"
3693850,76207777,2016-05-25,55373394,Susanne,"The room was as described and the apartment was very nice and clean. You share the apartment with other guests. The neighboorhood is ok, and the metrostation is very close."
3693850,77637773,2016-06-02,60423402,Yicong,"The house is wonderful. It is very comfortable and beautiful! The host, Derian, is wonderful, too. He kindly introduced a Korean restaurant for us, just after he heard we decided to visit Harvard and MIT the nest day. Helped us enjoy the great vacation in Boston."
Plus,the house is very convenient,"since the orange line is 2 min away. I highly recommend this room.\"",,,
3693850,78582731,2016-06-07,69719909,Elizabeth,Todo bien! Derian muy accesible. Y excelente ubicación.
3693850,79435295,2016-06-12,53252036,John,Derian was very welcoming and helpful and helped make our stay very pleasant. The neighbourhood was quiet and very close to Forest Hills station on the Orange line.
3693850,79948648,2016-06-15,39892486,Amanda,Derain was extremely welcoming and accommodating. His apartment is in an ideal location and is a quick walk to city transportation. I highly recommend staying with derian.
3693850,81428769,2016-06-23,12268172,Chris,"As I had prefaced before my visit, I didn't have a lot of time to enjoy the environs at the Earth Sanctuary, as I was mainly working during my time in Boston.  With that being said, Derian's place is lovely - clean, elegantly laid out, with all the necessary details handled aptly for a traveler.  I really liked the touch of the noise machine in the bedroom, which added an extra level of coziness.  The bathroom is super nice.  In fact the whole flat is beautiful with a lot of detail and a nice historic feel to it.  As to the neighborhood, I had never been to Jamaica Plain before this visit, but I learned it is a really beautiful and quite historic neighborhood with fantastic architecture and plenty of bars and restaurants.  If you don't mind a bit of a train ride, I highly recommend staying here."
3693850,81598458,2016-06-24,66619375,Ute,The room was very comfortable and clean. We arrived in the late evening though we didn't met Derian. Everthing was as described. Thank you for your Information where we can park our car for free.
3693850,82713514,2016-06-29,2869939,Angie,"I had a lovely stay at Derian's home. It was clean, quiet, and peaceful. I enjoyed the view of trees and especially appreciated the convenient location near the train station."
3693850,82847248,2016-06-29,66978319,Alissa,The neighborhood was very sweet.
We took public transit to the house from the airport and it was extremely easy!,,,,,

3693850,83703323,2016-07-04,7944070,Alexander,"We had a wonderful stay at Derian's place. The arrival was not complicated at all as the host described everything in a very detailed and easy to understand manner. The whole apartment was clean. The room is small but extremely cosy with a fan that works perfectly fine (so we had no problems on hot Boston summer days). Our personal highlights were the terrasse where we could take our breakfast and the big plant in the shower. Parking in the street is free of charge on weekends. On weekdays you have to look for something else in the neighbourhood not far away. Also the access to public transport is perfect. To the subway it's a 3 minutes walk. To downtown it takes around 20min. Unfortunately, we have not had the pleasure to meet Derian personally."
3693850,85413479,2016-07-11,20916253,Erin,This space was very clean and exactly as described. It was very close to restaurants and forest hills station. Derian was very welcoming and accepting. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks!
3693850,85660407,2016-07-12,25052706,Michael,"Derians lives in a beautiful flat in a nice neighbourhood (near to a metro Station) where we found everything as described.  The flat is clean, and we were allowed to use the kitchen.  Derian is a professional host, and was helpful, when we asked for advices. We also got a metro card with the keys where we could add some value, that was nice, too."
3693850,86431509,2016-07-16,81760157,Łukasz,"Derian was a great host! He was very helpful and provided us useful advices about Boston. Room is not big but very nice, cozy and clean. Everything was perfectly prepared. I'd strongly recommend staying with Derian."

3693850,89223940,2016-07-27,76785126,Mali,"The host was very communicative. All instructions re entrance and departure were very helpful. The place is very beautiful - the colors, the furniture, the art on the walls. The a/c works great! I wish I would have had a chance to meet the host. I arrived late due to flight cancellation problems, but I departed at a reasonable time.  The location - fantastic, one block walk from the subway. The room though was very small. But for one night stop it worked very well."
3693850,90279702,2016-07-31,54498479,Melanie,Hôte discret et disponible.  Tres bien situé pour un séjour à Boston.  Le métro est au coin de la rue.  Les photos sont représentatives. Prévoir une alternative pour le stationnement de jour en semaine.

3693850,91092457,2016-08-03,38898203,Raymon,We arrived after being awake for 25 hours and were exhausted. Derian's house was pretty easy to find and very close to the subway station. The room was smaller than expected and the bed was short but that is not a criticism; it's because I'm pretty tall! We had the entire floor to use as we saw fit which was just amazing. We met Derian on our second day and he was the nicest guy ever. How can you not like this person? All in all we were very content and I surely recommend Derian's AirBnB
3693850,91361679,2016-08-05,65983618,Robert,The experience was great! Everything was clean and Derian was extremely helpful and friendly. Would highly recommend!

8460627,51781529,2015-10-24,45773519,Kristina,Amaan was a fabulous host!!!! He went above and beyond my expectations! I was in Boston for 4 days and had an interview at Northeastern on a Saturday. He knew I had to catch a flight that same day and even got me lunch so I would make my flight on time and not be starving. He was so thoughtful and made sure I was well taken care of!
He also is a FOOD GURU!!!! He knows the best places to eat and visit! He left me a list of places and even taught me how to use different apps to order food and find my way around the city!!!,,,,,
"He was GREAT and I know if I am ever in Boston again I will definitely try and stay with Amaan!\"",,,,,

We did not see him in person but was available for information. We booked the day before we came so he didn't has time for the cleaning service. It was the only negative point but Pete was fair and refund us the cleaning service."

It is right next to the TD Bank Garden, which was perfect to go see the Bruins while I was there.

9680953,57356876,2015-12-24,52015171,Christine,I gave this listing a 5 star so that everyone else can see that this is a SCAM!!! She advertises an apartment that isn't hers. Also she cancels the day of and did not reimburse me my money. This is a scam do not book!!!

9452993,94051399,2016-08-14,49370971,Freyja,"Yair is a awesome host!  He's super friendly and easy to live with. In the time leading up to my stay and whilst I was in Boston he was readily available to answer any questions I had about Boston or Berklee.  Yair and his housemate Noam were beautiful people to live with.  Within days of my 6 week stay I felt right at home - cooking meals, hanging out, talking - It was so easy to live with these guys."
The apartment is super cool - in a great location (within walking distance to pretty much everything you need),is quiet at night,nice and clean and just has a really nice homely feel to it.,,,
I would highly recommend staying here!!!,,,,,

9452993,96600877,2016-08-23,84485120,Maddie,"Although Yair was very nice, we unfortunately did not have the best experience. We encountered countless cockroaches during our stay. We also got moved to a different room than the one listed, which wouldn't have been a problem had there been an AC unit in that room (both of the other rooms each had their own units). Hopefully this was an isolated incident, and we wish Yair the very best!"

He was in touch with me the whole time and went above and beyond the duty of a host. The property manager, Eddie, was very helpful and sincere.

The internet was fast and let me get work done so that we could explore more of downtown. And this was just a short walk from the subway, the symphony and the art museums. Now our stay would have been perfect if only the Red Soxs had been in town!"

It is perfectly located, very close to the city center and the longwood medical area and only 5 min walking distance to the next subway station. The apartment was very clean and is quite spacious and more importantly during summer, it has air conditioning. Alan was very kind and quickly in responding. He was out of town for work, but the apartment was shown to us by his friendly property manager Eddie. Altogether everything was perfect and I would definitely book Alan`s apartment again."

I was there for a week to attend some baseball games and the apartment couldn't have been better positioned! A five minute walk to Fenway, and numerous restaurants and a supermarket only half-a-block away. The apartment was well appointed and in a quiet location, it was also close to the Boston Common for an early morning walk. I had a fantastic time and would definitely look at booking here again if I was ever to return to Boston!"

This is in a nice old brick building. Appartment itself is old,but renovated and well furnished (nice and clean bathroom and kitchen,just one shelf which needed to be fixed). It's one level 1,all windows overlooking the courtyard so this quiet,but no view. Subway is within 10 min walk,you can also walk directly to towncenter.

The apartment is in a quiet neighborhood and only a 5 minute walk to Fenway Park which was awesome.  Alan was out of town so Eddie, his property manager, met us and showed us around.  He was fantastic!  Also gave us some tips on where to eat and what to do.  The apartment was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed including wifi and Apple TV if you need some down time.  Other than Harvard, we walked everywhere, so location is excellent!"

2174711,17093510,2014-08-07,2426986,Nick,The host was very easy to deal with - clear instructions about check-in available etc.  The location of the apartment is great - in a nice neighbourhood and nice apartment block.  Just around the corner are some nice eateries.  There is a common laundry in the block which was very handy too.  It is about a 5 minute walk to Fenway Park.

The apartment was a snug fit for us and our 2 kids, though, so depending on the age and size of folks staying, it may be more suited for 1-2 people, despite there being 2 full size beds."
2174711,18303658,2014-08-25,12881153,Sean,"Our host was traveling, but the property manager was present. He was helpful and friendly. The apartment was in an excellent location, and the neighborhood felt safe. The off-street parking was perfect, and my girlfriend and I were able to walk to Fenway for the games (5 minutes). We also walked to restaurants in back bay in 15 or 20 minutes. The place was less expensive than hotels in the area."

We had to get to the airport....again nice and easy.  I also accidentally left my phone charger and Eddie is helping me get it posted home. Very grateful for that. Lots of towels, left over food from those before us, toiletries that was handy. We were very grateful for the air conditioning as it was hot! Appreciated the 2 keys too."

The flat is relatively compact but more that adequate for either two people sharing the bed or two singles using the bed and the sofa.,,,,,
The kitchen is big enough to cook in if you want to and comes with bonus of table and chairs to use.,,,,,
Neighbourhood is typical stadium area,a number of bars,sports bars and eateries within short walking distance and a Wholefoods nearby is need supplies.,,,
Neighbourhood seemed pleasant enough.....car park nearby if have own car,taxis a short walk away.,,,,

There is also a shaws supermarket two streets away. Very close to Fenway Park if you want to view any redsox game. You can go walking to downtown Boston via Boylston, Newbury or Commonwealth Ave. Or you can pick a T metro in Fenway Station or Museum or Fine Arts, which is only 10 min walking from the apartment."
The apartment is an old apartment,but is good for two people. You can cook in the kitchen,the wifi is fast,and the shower has no problem with the hot water,although the restroom wasn't very clean.,
Alan was very communicative by email,and we have no problem calling Eddie by phone once we arrived in town.,,,,
Alan's manager Eddie settled us up,he was very kind and helpful.,,,,
Great to have two keys,and the apple tv,and a lot of towels to use in the shower.,,,

The studio is ideally located on a quiet street but easily near restaurants, shopping, and museums.  The studio itself had all we needed and was comfortable.  An excellent alternative to pricier hotels in the area."
2174711,21466060,2014-10-18,20491619,Joe,"My wife and I had a great stay at Alan's apartment. Alan was out of town but Eddie, his property manager, met us and showed us the ropes. The apartment is in a great location just a few minutes walk to either Fenway Park or the Museum of Fine Arts. This would be an awesome place to stay when catching a Red Sox game. Since the weather was nice we were also able to easily walk to the Back Bay area. The neighborhood is great. There is a supermarket, liquor store, and plenty of restaurants all just around the corner. The neighborhood felt safe even at night. The bed was comfortable."
"The only negative we found was that the apartment could have been a little bit cleaner. For the most part this pertains to the floors and the bathtub. My wife and I keep a very clean house and we just noticed that the floors could have been a little more well swept and the shower was slow to drain so didn't feel as clean. \"",,,,,
2174711,21819553,2014-10-25,13545373,Phillip,"This was a pleasant and comfortable apartment which suited us perfectly. It is close to the major cultural institutions of Boston ( MFA, I.S. Gardner Museum, Red Sox stadium) and in  a short walking distance  from 2 different Green Line ( Trolley ) lines which will get you all over Boston. There are numerous restaurants  ( Thai, Persian, Japanese, Greek etc) within one block. Awesome Eddy, the owners agent, was very helpful ( the owner was out of town ) in meeting us at the agreed time and telling us about the neighbourhood and getting us familiar with the apartment."

Superb location - we walked to the symphony, the Isabella Stewart Gardner museum, Newbury Street, etc. Parkland surrounds the neighborhood on three sides, so the neighborhood is very quiet."
"A minor flaw was the building front door key. It typically took 15-20 seconds of jiggling the key in the lock. It didn't affect us much but other guests may be more frustrated. A key copied off the lock (rather than another key) would probably help. \"",,,,,
2174711,22588419,2014-11-10,12432312,Bill,Me and my friend enjoyed our stay at Alan's apartment. We were attending a conference at BU and the apartment was a 20-30 minute walk away. The communication about where to meet Eddy (the property manager) before arriving could have been better. This was complicated by the fact that I didn't have a phone. But this was all sorted fairly quickly. Thanks for a good stay in Boston.

2174711,30920431,2015-04-29,22851591,Rick,"Alan made us very welcome. He was out of town and had arranged for his manager Eddie to meet us. This he did, giving us very good local information into the bargain."
The location of the apartment is excellent whether you want to go to Fenway Park to see the Sox or head uptown through trendy Newbury Street or Boylston Street for the Berklee College of Music. The fantastic Museum of Art is 5 minutes walk across the Fens.,,,,,

2174711,31129709,2015-05-02,13031832,Aleyna,"The house manager Eddie met us upon arrival and he was very nice and helpful in getting us settled.  The studio is in a perfect location, we were able to walk to restaurants and coffee shops and Fenway for a Red Sox games.  It was nice to have a kitchen and fridge even though we didn't use it much.  It's a quaint and cozy studio and was perfect for our stay."
2174711,31506717,2015-05-06,19834615,Criss,"No podremos evaluar a Alan ya que no lo conocimos, nos recibió Eddie."
La experiencia inicial fue desagradable ya que la dirección publicada no existe,encontramos a Eddie en una pizzería y ante nuestra sorpresa nos dijo que lo hacían por seguridad????,,,,
Luego nos condujo a un departamento en la misma cuadro que respondía a las características publicadas en dimensiones y fotos aunque más estrechas y menos luminoso. La cocina era lo mejor del departamento,incluso nos agasajaron con un rico vino. Estaba bien provisto de artículos de limpieza y demás. La cama doble era algo estrecha.,,,,
La ubicación es buena aunque alejada del subway,"si pasa por su frente una línea de bus. \"",,,,
2174711,31677843,2015-05-08,19470763,Sabrina,The building manager Eddie met me upon arrival and was very helpful in getting me settled in. The location of the apartment is excellent and minutes away from Fenway Park or uptown through trendy Newbury or Boylston Street. T station is not too far away as well. I had a great experience during my stay in Boston and hope to visit again soon!
2174711,32018577,2015-05-12,15443946,Banun,"Alan was stuck at work so he sent his manager, Eddy to greet us. Our bus was running late, but Eddy was patient, friendly, and extremely helpful! The location itself was perfect for what we needed - it's close to the Museum of Fine Arts, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and just a few blocks away from some bars and restaurants. The apartment building was nice and quiet, and the bed was super comfortable."
"\"",,,,,
2174711,32673863,2015-05-20,26072832,Roger,Unfortunately Alan was away so had a friend meet us to get access. It was not as smooth I I would have liked and there was confusion over what time we would be arriving. The flat was in a good location but general information could be better - transport parking etc although Eddie did give us some information. I think the general cleanliness was also not good as good as I would expect with the bath needing a clean before use and the bedding was not as fresh as I would expect. I would have raised the issues directly had we been staying for a longer period but it was a very brief stay.
2174711,32963362,2015-05-24,26855673,Jason,"My wife and I stayed at Alan's apartment for only 1 out of the 3 nights we reserved because we felt uncomfortable before the second night.  The day after we arrived, we were contacted in the afternoon and informed that maintenance was going to come in to do a non urgent fix that evening.  When we requested that maintenance be rescheduled, we were denied.  My wife and I then went home to put away our valuables and take pictures of how we left our stuff before leaving the apartment for maintenance.  When we arrived back at the apartment, we found our bags had been tampered with.  Mine had been picked up, moved, and turned around before being put back in its place.  I considered that perhaps mine was moved to clear a walkway for the maintenance crew, except that my bag was under a counter where no one would walk, and that my pile of stuff that was in front of the bag and that would have been more of a hazard was untouched and left in the middle of the walkway.  After feeling too uncomfortable to sleep/stay in the apartment, we checked into a hotel that night."
When someone is made uncomfortable in someone else's home,they should not be expected to stay.,,,,
Alan has denied our request for a refund of the last 2 nights and we are currently in contact with him through the resolution center and awaiting airbnb's decision.,,,,,
If you wish,you could give Alan the benefit of the doubt because we have not found anything to be missing,"but we feel that we should not have been put into such an uncomfortable situation and he should have at least rectified the situation by approving a refund of the nights we did not stay there.\"",,,
2174711,33642830,2015-05-31,7341496,Matt,"Our host Eddie met us at the specified location as planned. He then escorted us to our studio and provided an overview to get us situated; he was very personable and addressed concerns / questions. Eddie also provided suggestions of restaurants and sights to squeeze in between our planned itinerary -this was helpful and we took advantage of the info. The skywalk at Prudential bldg was quite a site. (FYI- we were told there is also one at the John Hancock building that is not as fancy as Prudential, but costs less...)"
The neighborhood was very nice - we had no issues whatsoever. The complex was quiet and the neighborhood was very safe for walking around in the evenings. There were nice restaurants,cafes,and a grocery store nearby to accommodate us.,,,
The studio apartment was clean - everything worked just fine and it was nice to have a kitchen if needed. The unit is on the ground floor and has laundry available in the complex,but we found the laundromat down the street (they provide a wash AND fold service) more helpful. Thanks for that tip,Eddie.,,,
There were 3 adults in the studio and we made it work though it was a little crowded at times (one bathroom,"two beds). Being that we were family it didn't matter for us. We mainly just slept in the unit and were out and about during the day and evenings. \"",,,,
2174711,33924036,2015-06-02,6290852,Riaz,"Listing description was accurate, and the neighborhood was great.  The pullout sleeper sofa worked well for my 20 year old son.  Alan and Eddie are great hosts, were attentive and flexible and keep the unit clean.  The building is old and the unit is a little funky (uneven floors, worn bathroom fixtures, etc.) but I imagine that is par for the course in Boston.  Overall, a fabulous experience.  I had to rent a car, and was a bit concerned about the parking situation, but I found it to be manageable - generally I was able to find free street parting (2 hour zones) but had to resort to $15 garage parking right across the street for 1 afternoon."
2174711,34125031,2015-06-05,1736689,Meredith,"Alan (and his property manager Eddie) did great! The property was exactly as described, and the key hand-off worked seamlessly--Eddie met us nearby to let us in and to tell us a bit about the property. He was prompt with communication and very friendly. The property is also QUIET, which was a big plus for me...Fenway Park was a quick walk away, which was a big plus for my boyfriend : )  I'll definitely keep Alan's place in mind for next time I visit Boston!"
2174711,34940700,2015-06-14,11185763,Garnett,We felt at home and the neighborhood and area were pleasant. The location was convenient to our conference at the Joseph Martin Center. The courtyard entrance with roses blooming was inviting. We needed an extra set of keys and Eddie dropped them by right away.
2174711,35215746,2015-06-16,9233701,Andrew,"I took my father to Boston to see a couple of Red Sox games for his 70th birthday. We landed early and wanted to drop off our bags so we could see the city. Next thing we knew, Eddie texted me to say he was able to get an early checkout of the previous guests and make the room up, so we could go drop our bags off. Great! The apartment is literally 2 blocks up the road from Fenway, amazing location. Great little area, with a pizza place, liquor store and convenience store just a few feet away. Tons of cool restaurants in the area, and great to enjoy walking to Fenway. The apartment itself looks just like the pictures. I will say that it is somewhat poorly aged and it feels like a student apartment inside, especially the bathroom. That said, the water was hot, and the fridge was cold. The AC works as well. The best part about the place is Eddie. Just a salt-of-the-earth guy. My father and I really like him. He went out of his way to accommodate us and make us feel welcome. He was so busy that weekend, but he still took the time to be of assistance in any way. Any time I texted him, he was quick to respond. He made great recommendations of restaurants/pubs, bought us extra towels when the cleaner was off sick, and was genuinely interested in making our stay enjoyable. Eddie was by far the best host we've dealt with on Airbnb, and that's saying a lot. We would definitely stay there again, but just don't expect a shiny, clean, new place. I still highly recommend staying there."
2174711,35466919,2015-06-19,16669342,Matthew,Great apartment in a nice and well maintained building. The apartment is on a cute and quiet block close to everything in Fenway and the T to get around the city. Eddie was super helpful and available to help us out with anything we needed. Had a great time!
2174711,36090648,2015-06-25,26450483,Allison,"The studio is nice and clean. The location is great,  close to Fenway, and quiet. Alan was really great at communicating with us!The only issue is parking. We planned on being out pretty much our whole stay so street parking was out of the question (if you could even find a spot). So we had to pay for the parking garage (which is conveniently located) but is pricey. In the end we enjoyed the studio and our stay."
2174711,36592044,2015-06-29,31546794,Emilie,"Alan was extremely prompt and very helpful when our arrival time was muddled. The apartment was absolutely perfect, very neat and clean and had everything we needed. The location was also beyond perfect, situated in a perfect area within walking distance and in a very cute little neighborhood. Thank you for allowing us to stay in this apartment! Will definitely be staying here again!"
2174711,37441691,2015-07-07,24153441,Jakob,"We stayed in the apartment for around 1 week in beginning of July 2015. Overall, the apartment lived up to our expectations. We were possitively surprised about the great location, the nearby parks etc. and the nice building. Our interaction with Alan and his staff worked seemless from start to finish. On a more negative note, the sofabed was - in our opinion - not possible to sleep on (we had to organise a inflatable mattress), also the appartment was rented to 4 persons; however, there were only 3 chairs in the kitchen. Finally, the cleaning done before our arrival could also have been better. In conclusion, we used the apartment for a great week in Boston and we would definately consider the same apartment if we should return at some point."
2174711,37665699,2015-07-09,34649885,Kathleen,"The Area we stayed was great, 2 blocks down from Fenway, plenty of restaurants and stores.  We found our way to the T (rapid transit) to go downtown.  Cab fair was not unreasonable in the area,  we parked our car at central parking about a block and a half away cost was $109 for 2 and 1/2 days.   The studio was nice, it said it could hold 4, but I found that was probably a lot for  the space.  Sofa opened up but sleeps like a sofa bed.   It was very warm the days we were there, the window unit air conditioner had a hard time keeping space cool for 4 people.  Kitchen nice, fully equipped.  Overall were happy with accommodations."
2174711,37891798,2015-07-11,36202858,Eileen,"From start to finish, Alan was a great host. Eddie, the manager, met us with a smile and enthusiasm for our two day trip to Boston."
"The apartment was the perfect location for our main mission...Red Sox game. Neighborhood was lovely and felt extremely safe. Could definitely recommend to others planning a trip to Boston.\"",,,,,
2174711,38828579,2015-07-19,12186721,Audrey,Great appartment in a really nice student neighboorhood. Close proximity with the baseball stadium with lots of bars and restaurants in the area.
2174711,39339304,2015-07-22,6244025,Lara,"Very comfortable little apartment with a very serviceable kitchen (quite large for the size of the place!). We met the property manager at the pizza place down the street and he took us to the apartment building. It was very secure with a locked entry door to the building. We noticed right away how quiet it was for being in the middle of the city. All in all, a great stay and I would recommend this property to anyone!"
2174711,39738681,2015-07-26,25442315,Xiaoyu,"It is unpleasant experience in Boston. The apartment is far away with the description. Old and not hygiene. The bed sheet and quilt cover seems not changed very often. After I complained, the landlord got new beddings for us. But still feel bad. Nobody clean the trash and change the washing towel except you made a special request.  a huge cockroach was fond and made us scared."
2174711,40561262,2015-08-01,28253232,Rose,"Location is great, with T station, Fenway park, all kinds of restaurant and supermarket around. Room is small but clean and cozy for two people stay."
2174711,42108962,2015-08-11,28253232,Rose,"Nice location! The check in/check out procedure is pretty easy. The inside is a little bit old and not as bright as the picture shows (it's on the ground floor), but still clean and cozy for two people's stay."
2174711,43021180,2015-08-17,23490353,Vanessa,"Alan was extremely helpful. He communicated with me before my arrival and he was very accommodating. The studio was perfect for my husband and I. It was down the street from fenway park. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect location. Everything felt like walking distance.  If you're lucky to book a stay in this studio in Boston, consider yourself lucky.. :-)   the location was great and we felt safe."
2174711,43897715,2015-08-23,27892953,Joe,"This was our first experience with Airbnb, and it could not have been any better. The hospitality we received, not only enhanced our Boston experience, but it also made us genuinely feel like family. I can only hope that all of our future experiences with Airbnb are as wonderful as this one. While the room was exactly as it was pictured, clean and welcoming,the building and the neighborhood far exceeded my expectations. Thank you so much!"
2174711,44523596,2015-08-27,8041150,M,"I had a great stay in this comfortable and clean apartment, with a fantastic location. Alan had excellent and fast communication throughout and was very kindly flexible about check in and check out. Would stay here again for sure!"
2174711,44959730,2015-08-30,39290593,Laura,Place was a lot smaller than it looks. Def couldnt sleep 4 people. the 2nd bed was a very uncomfortable pull out couch. Over priced!
Neighbourhood nice.,,,,,
"Close to food/train/fenway stadium\"",,,,,
2174711,45277309,2015-09-01,18652970,Alex,"Stayed here twice and had a great experience both times. The place is clean, super convenient, and Eddie (the landlord who hands off keys) is incredibly friendly and helpful."
2174711,45472569,2015-09-03,34464551,Melissa,"Such an awesome place! It is in a great location and very close to Fenway.  We were very pleased with the house, it is everything you need for a stay in Boston. Eddie was very nice and accommodating.  He told us of things we could do around the city and places he liked to eat and go to. My boyfriend and I went to one of the bars he mentioned and it was an awesome place. We enjoyed our stay and if we ever go to Boston again we will stay there."
2174711,46363130,2015-09-10,4176807,Patricia,"Hosts were very helpful in arranging everything, especially when I needed further assistance. The apartment was clean and tidy and had all the amenities as described. I enjoyed staying at the apartment and would recommend it to anyone requiring accommodation in the area."

2174711,47955090,2015-09-22,24055344,Sarah,"This was a great place to stay in Boston, especially if you're going to see the Red Sox. Eddie was a brilliant host, so friendly and with very helpful tips on getting round the city and good restaurants and bars etc. Whole booking process and checking in couldn't have been easier. The apartment was clean and neighbourhood safe and very quiet. Wifi fast and reliable. Perfect space for two people and rollaway bed pretty comfy. Would definitely recommend!!"

The studio is gorgeous, spacious, and provides a fully furnished kitchen (huge perk for those staying for a long period of time). The apartment building itself is very beautiful and located in a great spot in Fenway - immediate access to good food, shopping, and a gym nearby. For those in medicine, the apartment is within a mile of both Beth Israel Deaconess and Brigham and Women's."
In short,"would definitely stay here again. Awesome place to call your home base while you're in Boston!\"",,,,
2174711,59701256,2016-01-14,23026109,Michele,"I give the apartment an enthusiastic thumbs up. While it's not luxurious, it's cozy and warm (important for a January visit to Boston!), clean and tidy, snug and comfy. Nice big tub and a seemingly endless supply of very hot water. I will echo other reviewers who mentioned it is not as bright as in the picture. In fact, during winter at least, it is quite dark as the windows have a film on them to block them out. I needed to have all the lights on to work during the day. The kitchen is small and lacked a few things-I called Eddie with a  request and he provided them quickly and happily. Alan and Eddie both were great to work with, communicative and helpful. A very nice quiet neighborhood, nice building with friendly people.. I look forward to staying again on my next trip."
2174711,63319562,2016-02-22,51181736,William,"he was very welcoming, made sure we were all set best host by far. Would love to stay here again. thanks so much!"

2174711,66294264,2016-03-20,22689388,Meagan,We had a great stay in this Fenway studio. Perfect location in cute area of Boston. Walking distance from everything downtown including T stations. Eddie met us at our convenience to let us into the place and had great recommendations for all things Boston. We would definitely stay here again!
2174711,67307482,2016-03-28,18832020,Lucrecia,"We felt very welcome even before arriving into Boston, Eddie sent me texts to be sure what time we would be there so he could check us in. Eddie is very friendly, provided us with information we asked and was very personable. It was our first time booking with Airbnb and it was such a great experience from start to finish. The studio is cozy in a very nice building and very safe, quiet neighborhood. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook, the bed is comfortable and the wifi was fast. We came and went at all hours and never felt unsafe. The neighborhood has a couple of convenience stores, pizza place and restaurants within one block. There are two T stations and a commuter rail station within walking distance which makes staying here super convenient to go all over Boston, and outside of Boston.  The next time we are in Boston we will definitely try to stay here again."
2174711,67992638,2016-04-01,36169428,泰航,"The house manager gave us a warm welcome and lead us to the house, introducing all facilities in house.  It's a great experience staying at Alan's house during our visit at Boston."

2174711,70741803,2016-04-20,6752559,Joseph,"Great experience and first time in Boston. We decided on Alan's flat because of the Boston Marathon and it was so centralized. Easy walking to pretty much everything. Alan's property manager Eddie greeted us when we arrived and graciously showed us into the flat and  gave us great tips on the city and places to eat. Theres great food all around, great coffees shops, and Fenway is super close, you can see if from the corner. It was a perfect fit for two. Thank Alan for hosting us."

We found it to be a super safe area, even when we were walking at night :) lovely little place. Would stay again for sure !"
2174711,72781855,2016-05-04,713349,Allison,"Alan's apartment was perfect for my needs. It was very well located. It is in an older building, but that was not a concern for me. I would definitely stay again if my travels take me to Boston."

The property manager was right on time, the studio was very neat and clean, it was close to everything that my friend and I needed to get to in terms of food and the subway.

2174711,80171109,2016-06-16,67105953,Steven,Met us in the neighborhood and walked us to the place talking about the city and what we were interested in. Offered to help us if we needed anything. Made staying in Boston so much fun!

3420221,23717056,2014-12-08,24155059,William,Cindy is delightful as is her home.  I appreciated the ability to come and go as I pleased without feeling as I was bothering or intruding on anyone else in the home.  I enjoyed talking with the other guests that were there and being able to fix my meals and do my laundry.  It was an overall pleasant experience.
Side note that has nothing to do with the house...,,,,,
There was ample parking (on the next street over) and although I had been warned of the strict parking rules that are enforced in Boston,it did not stop me from getting two parking tickets (through no fault of anyone but myself).  I only mention this as it was a huge shock to me.  The street cleaning happens on one side of the street LATE Monday night and on the other side of the street LATE Wednesday night,"and a fine is $40 for being parked there...you have been warned.\"",,,
3420221,23880270,2014-12-13,306481,Matthew,"Cindy was very efficient with communication and provided a seamless check-in process. The bed was very comfortable, the towels were cleaned daily, and the rest of the guests were very pleasant. Overall, a great value!"

3420221,24570343,2014-12-30,25129142,Richard,"\"Cindy communicated well with me throughout my 3-day stay, so it was okay that I never actually saw her in person. She emailed me detailed check-in information that enabled me to access and use her house easily (numbered touch pad entry, Wi-Fi pass codes, linens, food, etc.). There are 3 separate and locking bedrooms in the basement (mine was #3). My room was furnished essentially as depicted in the picture, except the windows were basement casement windows. One of my windows didn't have any shade or curtain on the first day (due to room renovation work), but Cindy put up a temporary covering the next morning after I informed her. As for the neighborhood, the house is located at the end of a dead-end street in what I first thought was a \"\"rough\"\" looking neighborhood. The neatly furnished bedroom picture didn't seem to comport with the neighborhood (or the exterior of the house--in the process of renovation work). For a split second"

3420221,25861357,2015-01-27,22566959,Anneka,Cindy was such an amazing host! I stayed at her space for over 2 months and she made me feel very welcomed. She was always making sure I had everything I needed. The house is located less than 5 minutes from the bus which takes you to the train station. In warmer times you could even walk to the train station which was about 10 minutes away.  The best part about my stay was all the other house-guests who were pretty awesome. Thanks again Cindy!
3420221,26881613,2015-02-21,25128185,Kristin,"Cindy's place was perfect for the night that I stayed there. Although I did not get to say goodbye I did meet Cindy who was more than welcoming when I arrived. The place had a few different airbnb'ers staying there so it was really cool to meet the different people. The house has a very welcoming feel as I was made comfortable to use anything in the house that I needed. The room I had was awesome, clean, and very functional with a  private bathroom, which was great! I would definitely stay here again I should I come back and visit Boston"
3420221,27402886,2015-03-03,26093167,Will,"Cindy made me feel exceptionally welcome, the room feels very homely! It's a nice neighbourhood and good access to the touristy stuff."
3420221,32686393,2015-05-20,5500107,Ingrid,"I stayed at Cindy's place for 3 days. The room is exactly as described, the neighborhood is safe and Cindy is very helpful host. The location is very convenient to visit Harvard and it is 40 minutes far away from downtown. It's a good place to spend a weekend near Boston."
3420221,32940051,2015-05-23,33605327,Rafaela,"Cindy is a great person and has a huge heart. Her house was the first place I went when I arrived at Boston, so I didn't know what should I expect from the city and from the place. The place is very well located with bus stops and restaurants close and the bedroom is very comfortable and clean, so it's was easy to feel well. Cindy also gave me many inductions about the places and this helped a lot. I do recommend her bedrooms."
3420221,33372452,2015-05-27,30623847,Lowell,"We had a great stay at Cindy's place, good location with lots of cool bars about. Bed was comfy and facilities were great and always kept clean and tidy. We did not get to meet Cindy however she always responded quickly to our queries."
Occasionally got woken up in the morning as the kitchen was the floor above us,"otherwise a perfect stay :)\"",,,,
3420221,34095466,2015-06-04,34321415,Jackie,Cindy had a clean and cozy home! She was always willing to answer questions when I had them. I only stayed for 2 days but I was glad to have a quiet place to rest when I needed it.
3420221,35016589,2015-06-14,13229436,Anne Marie,"The listing was not accurate, the room looks nothing like the room that was posted and was located in a basement which was very stuffy with a funny smell. I have to keep the fan on all nights otherwise it becomes hard to breath. In addition the entrance to the house was very unkempt. This was an awful experience."
When I reported the problem,"the woman who communicated with me was apologetic and discounted one night of the two nights that I paid for.  \"",,,,
3420221,35271018,2015-06-16,32879029,Justin,"Cindy was a model host. She is very welcoming, kind, and hospitable. The neighborhood is decent. The location is nice. The listing was accurate, but the pictures look MUCH nicer than it actually is. The facilities were filthy; the wiring of the light switches and wall plugs was totally exposed (they were literally just holes with a stick switching out of it). Roaches and ants everywhere. No liquid soap (just a bar of soap). The basement (where guests stay) smells very funky, like chemicals. There was no a/c—the ceiling fan doesn't even work."
"I would not stay here again.\"",,,,,
3420221,36540245,2015-06-29,32976032,Marina,"Cindy's house was the best choice for me! Feels like I saw her photo and her house by airbnb page and got connected with her! I stayed there during 5 nights, and was perfect, clean, quiet, her sons are lovely as well Cindy is and she has an adorable dog Mini!! Thank you Cindy for all!!"
3420221,37337634,2015-07-06,13214235,Michael,"I came from Denmark to visit my son and he found this place for me located just down the street from his apartment. The room was very comfortable and the house and location was ideal for my purpose. The facilities were generous, i.e. coffee, laundry detergent etc. Everything was clean and meeting Cindy was a delight, it was evident that she wanted people to be comfortable in her place. If I make it back to Boston I'll definitely look this place up again. Thank you."

3420221,56772323,2015-12-18,21778326,Emily,"Cindy was the most wonderful host any could ever ask for. I can't fit all the great things I want to say about her in one page. She was unbelievably accommodating and did anything she could to make our semester stay more enjoyable, including getting a second bed in our room, supplying free coffee and cereal, and being very responsive to every question or request we had. We were there for three months and there was never a bad moment. I highly recommend Cindy and her place to anyone looking to explore Boston in one of my favorite areas of the city."

3420221,61243401,2016-02-01,55838382,Sherry,"Cindy made me feel extremely welcomed! She communicated very effectively prior to my arrival, answering any questions or concerns I had. She also gave me all the necessary check in information. The room was as described. She made me feel at home by providing towels and access to the kitchen. I also really appreciated her labeling things in the kitchen that everyone was welcome to use. Our schedules prevented us from actually meeting but she messaged me after my stay thanking me for staying. It made me feel very comfortable and welcomed! If I come back I won't hesitate to stay again! Experience was wonderful!"

The location was great and very close to the T as mentioned. Cindy's Airbnb was as described. Clean, comfortable bed."
Thank you Cindy! If in Boston in the future,"I will check with you again!\"",,,,

3420221,80235841,2016-06-17,34584299,Christina,"Cindy was very nice, and the bed was comfortable."
I did have a few concerns. Upon arrival to the house,I did not know which door to enter and had not received any instructions. I had messaged Cindy from airport baggage claim to let her know I was on my way and messaged her when I got to the house,but I did not receive responses. I called her and received no answer. After a few minutes of standing on the porch,Cindy came out the door on her way out for the evening. She was very surprised and apologetic that I did not receive the instruction message she usually sends the day before. She was very kind and got me settled into my room.,,
I'm really trying not to be too critical,but the room was a bit of a disappointment. The outlet and light switch plates were taped to the wall,and the curtain on on window was a towel tied in two corners. Other than that,the bed was comfortable and clean,and Cindy had kindly provided luggage stands. The kitchen was well laid out and clearly labeled with who was allowed to use what.,
The shower was a daily frustration. I do not know what was wrong with the downstairs shower,but there was no setting cooler than scalding. Even with the dial turned all the way cold,I could not bear to stand in the stream because it was too hot. I messaged Cindy,and she replied that warm was in the middle. I tried that,and it simply got hotter. The only way I could get it to work was to find the least hot setting and turn the faucet to just above a trickle,so I was able to get clean. As a result of this
Overall,if I go back to Boston,I will be looking elsewhere to stay. If I had to,I could stay there again,"but I would prefer not to. \"",

7880828,77777237,2016-06-03,34314862,Douglas,"Ivan was a gracious host, communicating with me frequently in advance of my coming. The location was perfect--a few minutes walk from the Airport T station--in a colorful neighborhood, yet quiet at night.  Because of my very early flight from Logan the next morning, walking access back to the Airport T station would not be possible, yet Ivan drove me to my terminal for a very reasonable fee compared to taxifare."
7880828,77982424,2016-06-04,12870667,Jeremy,Very clean. Nice and friendly host. Very convenient to the airport. Nice neighborhood.

7880828,78917500,2016-06-10,69582581,程洁,Ivan is a great host.  He is very respectable and kind.  We had a great experience at his home.  It is so convenient to Boston and especially airport(3minutes walk).

"\"",,,,,
7880828,79796965,2016-06-14,2414206,Alex,"Ivan was a lovely host, accepted my request on short notice. The room is small but not claustrophobic and there's certainly enough room for one person, luggage, and a little extra to get dressed/re-pack your bags/ /whatnot. Access to two bathrooms, fast wifi. A clear note was given with a warm welcome from Ivan. Perfect for an overnight layover near Logan."
7880828,80085636,2016-06-16,57407648,Zach,"The place was very clean and close the airport. I had a 17 hour layover, and it was the perfect place to stay because it is close to public transit and the airport bus. I would stay here again."
7880828,80176706,2016-06-16,22537859,Roman,Ivan was such a great host. My plane was delayed and he was kind enough to offer me a ride from the airport. I would have been lost otherwise. His place is great for a solo traveler who is looking for something quiet and close to the subway station.
7880828,80436131,2016-06-18,907685,Carlos,"Staying with Ivan is the best. He is an amazing super host. He opened the doors of his house warmly and treating me like a family member. He tries to make you feel comfortable and like as you are home. The place is excellent located with access to great transportation and close to the airport. Best decision I took. I highly recommend him to anyone, and I would stay in the future with him, with no doubt"

7880828,81404745,2016-06-22,5243392,Larry,"Ivan was a considerate, friendly host.  His room and the private bathroom were spotless.  The location of his place was ideal: a short walk to the T station at Logan Airport.  I also appreciated his personal pick-up at the airport for $25 to his home.  Although the room itself was tiny (just enough space for a bed and a luggage stand), the price and location made his airbnb quite attractive.  I would gladly return."
7880828,82043136,2016-06-26,72808897,Linda,"Very clean place, access to two bathrooms, suitable for one night stay due to the position and small size of the room."

7880828,85136773,2016-07-10,48714856,Nadya,"My stay at Ivan's place was great. From the start, communication with Ivan was easy. He is super helpful and has done everything to make my stay as comfortable as possible. He let me dropped off my bag before the check in time and txt me when the room is ready, let me use the washing machine and dryer. He even put a small water bottle in the room which is a nice touch. The room is small but super clean and very close to the airport shuttle service."
7880828,86051065,2016-07-14,69092052,Rebecca,Ivan was an excellent host. He answered my inquiries promptly and gave very good directions to his house.

7880828,86204392,2016-07-15,66491592,Jenna,"Ivan was willing to pick me up at the airport, and when I arrive at the house he showed me around and showed me to my room.  There was a personalized note with information about the area and transportation, as well as towels, water, and a set of keys.  I appreciate how considerate and welcoming he was.  What I did not realize was the size of the room, there was not much extra space and it was more of a closet than a bedroom, but I was only there for an brief overnight layover so it was manageable."
7880828,87020921,2016-07-18,83916253,Simon,The neighborhood was interesting and the host was welcoming.
7880828,87201897,2016-07-19,61143416,Erina,Ivan was welcoming and kindness. I was very comfortable during staying. Especially the room was very clean. I could go to Logan airport in the early morning by Airport shuttle because the access was easy.
7880828,87569685,2016-07-20,22847176,Kerstin,"My daughter had a stopover in Boston and stayed at Ivan. The accommodation is very easy to reach from the airport.

The apartment is very close to (less than five minutes away from) the blue line Airport stop, which is also great.  I would be happy to stay with Ivan again in the future."

I didn't stay as planned.  Yet, Ivan was gracious and accommodating!  Very convenient to the airport in a vibrant neighborhood!"

7880828,92040367,2016-08-07,41903375,Agnese,"I stayed at Ivan's place for one night as I had a stopover in Boston. The place is very close to the Airport, so it was a very convenient location for me. Ivan is very nice and keen to make sure I had a smooth arrival and a pleasant stay, which I did. The room is very small, just the space for a single bed and the luggage, so I would only recommend it for a short stay. I found it a bit expensive for what you get, but it was still one of the cheapest accommodation I could find in Boston, so I cannot complain. Overall it was a pleasant stay."
7880828,92872153,2016-08-10,81931185,Tobias,Ivan and his family are very nice. His flat is so close to the airport and very easy to find. (Thanks again for the awesome description of the way to your house). The room is small but it is totally ok for one person who needs a space close to the airport for a few days.
7880828,93125899,2016-08-11,28423268,Jiaxing,Ivan was very nice. Place was clean
7880828,93709994,2016-08-13,11312910,Henry,"I posted many notes in the amenities section.  Ivan tried his best to communicate.  There are issues with the AirBnb mobile app and that caused us some problems.  In addition, I arrived quite late and so we never met in person.  Nonetheless, the paper that was left on the bed didn't have complete information.  I was asked to not take a shower late at night.  That's a dealbreaker for me as I had just finished work and was headed for an early flight.  When I did get up early to leave I had to take a shower, but there were no instructions about where the bathroom was for said shower.  There were no instructions about what to do with the keys for the room or for the front door.  I was happy to have a room for the night, but I believe that I will look elsewhere next time."
7880828,94046627,2016-08-14,76828912,Andrew,"Ivan's place is great. Close to the airport, and Ivan is very helpful."

The bathroom was very close and the host was well mannered the room was very clean and I have to say I would definitely stay there again if I'm ever in Boston. I highly recommend this place even if you are wanting a short commute to the airport."
7880828,96322069,2016-08-22,90690885,Veronica,"Ivan was a great host! His place was very close to the airport and was able to guide me in the right direction when looking to explore. He was very accommodating and even picked me up when I needed to get back. The room is small but comfortable and perfect for a quick night in Boston. I had a great time and was able to explore all over and still remain close to my room. If booking with Ivan, I guarantee he will do his best to make you feel as comfortable as possible! Thanks again for the experience."
7880828,96878700,2016-08-24,16048651,Kathy,"Ivan is very nice and helpful. Honestly, the room is too small for me. Not even room for a chair. The bed is comfortable and I slept very well. The stairs are narrow and difficult for an older person to get down but Ivan was helpful in carrying my bags for me. The whole place was very very clean. The shower and full bathroom is upstairs as well as the kitchen. I did not feel comfortable to use the kitchen. The location is excellent. So close to the airport and train station. I would stay there again. It was an adequate place to stay for a couple nights."
7880828,98731147,2016-09-01,90216242,晓朗,The room is clean
7880828,99513133,2016-09-05,34953141,Nathan,I got there and got exactly what I expected. It's a small room but perfect for a single traveler going through the city and needing a place to stay for the night. Ivan constantly kept in contact with me to ensure I have everything I need. I needed a printer for my bus tickets for the next day and Ivan provided one. He was very friendly the whole time I was there and helped me with everything I needed.

1472520,6723750,2013-08-22,5312220,Cheri & Mark,"Our stay was very brief, however long enough for us to realise that the Carneys are the type of hosts that stand out from the crowd. The house and our room was immaculate and well above our expectation - nothing was overlooked to ensure we felt right at home in their home. Barnes coffee is legendary :) We highly recommend you stay with the Carneys. It's only a few stops from South Station and about a ten minute walk to the the house."
1472520,6832136,2013-08-26,3944044,Genevieve,"Barney and Mary were absolutely fabulous hosts! They were so welcoming and warm. Barney gave great recommendations, from places to eat and things to see. He was so much more than we can ask for."
The room and house was so spacious and well-maintained (it's a very large and old house). There was ample space to park our car and it was merely a 10minute walk to the closest T station.,,,,,
This is the place to stay should you want to visit Boston or anywhere nearby!,,,,,
"Thank you Carney family! \"",,,,,
1472520,6923682,2013-08-30,8061243,Marie Antonia,"Mary and Barney were wonderful hosts, very welcoming. There was fresh coffee every morning, and always some food in the fridge. Mary even prepared me a delicious grilled cheese sandwich on the night we arrived. The room was lovely, and I enjoyed sitting on the porch in the evenings. Barney gave us great tips for our sightseeing, and I very much enjoyed chatting with him. The train is only 5 minutes walking distance and will get you into town in no time. Excellent place to stay."
1472520,7225740,2013-09-11,8279276,Malu,"I loved my bed and pillows and I liked having a private bath. Huge room gave me lots of space to sit, read and have my coffee. It was a treat to have greek yoghurt and fruit for breakfast - nice touch! The place was a 7 minute walk to the station and 5 stops away from downtown where our event was."

Less than 10min walk from the train station just down the road. Very easy to access and park if you come with a car. The house itself is just amazing, and Barney & Mary are so nice and welcoming. My friends and I stayed only 2 nights but we wished we had stayed longer coz we felt like home! The neighborhood is really nice too, you can walk around next to the little beach just down the backyard. It was my first experience with Airbnb and this makes me want to try it again and again!"

Endroit idéal en bordure de Boston! Situé à moins de 20 minutes de métro du centre de Boston sur la ligne rouge. Max 10 min à  pieds de la station de métro. Accès facile depuis l'autoroute si vous venez en voiture,et parking facile dans la cours de la maison. La maison en elle même est juste sublime et pleine de charme. Barney & Mary sont très chaleureux et accueillants. Mes amies et moi sommes restées seulement 2 nuits,nous aurions bien aimer rester un plus car nous avions le sentiment d'être à la maison!,,,
Le quartier est très agréable également,"et vous avez un accès quasi direct à la petite plage en bas du jardin. C'était ma première expérience Airbnb et elle m'a donné envie de réitérer l'opération!\"",,,,

We had three wonderful nights in great comfort and with great breakfasts.  We found the area to be entirely safe and friendly with good local restaurants.  The red line train was frequent and quick to get us into Boston.  All in all a great BnB.

1472520,7883022,2013-10-07,8641458,Paul,"We had a beautiful fall experience, 3 days with the Carneys in their lovely home.  Mary greeted us when we arrived, and were joined shortly by Barney and John.  We truly enjoyed the relaxed, comfortable setting of the Carney home with ample parking.  Our interest was sightseeing in downtown Boston and the proximity to the T red line was very accommodating.  At Barney's suggestion, we even took a short, but leisurely walk along the harbor on the way to the T one morning which was especially relaxing.  We appreciated the many suggestions for dining, especially the Savin Scoop (ice cream) next to the T station.    This was our first opportunity to experience airbnb and our stay with the Carneys has reinforced that we will use airbnb in the future and hopefully visit the Carneys when we return to Boston."

We truly enjoyed the relaxed, comfortable setting of the Carney home, and the morning breakfast (with freshly baked muffins) was delicious! We used the bike hub at JFK station (about 1k walk), and cycled to the conference center (BCEC). After the conference, we used the bikes for Boston sightseeing as well! It is very easy to go to the beach for running! We really enjoyed! This was our first opportunity to experience airbnb and our stay with the Carneys has reinforced that we will use airbnb in the future and hopefully visit the Carneys when we return to Boston!

1472520,8996200,2013-12-01,9263657,Frank,The Carney's were excellent hosts over the duration of my stay.  They go above and beyond in welcoming you into their home and are open to any questions or requests you may have.  The room itself is gorgeous and the private bath is an added convenience.  Breakfast in the morning is especially helpful if you enjoy getting up and starting your day early.  I could not have asked for a better place to stay.  Thanks again Barney and Mary!

Barney was helpful on everything we've asked...especially when I mentioned my purpose of visit, he even reached out his networking to help me connect with locals. What a great experience and feel!! Location is very convenient, ten mins walk to T and the neighborhood was quiet, and safe with a lake/park area behind...:-)"

It's a 20-minute walk to UMass/JFK (the actual location, not the station) and only a half-mile from the Savin Hill stop. This worked out very well for me. The house is set up so that visitors have their own kitchen and living room. Everyone kept to themselves, which for me was great. It was sort of like a BNB atmosphere, but without the meddling that sometimes comes with that format (and without a formal breakfast, though Barney was kind enough to have coffee and cake out for guests each morning). I had an unusual need for a refrigerator as I'm a new mom (use your imagination), and the shared kitchen was no problem at all on that front. The only caution I'd give is that there isn't the typical security at this spot as you'd find in most rentals, and while I've no doubt it's a safe area, I'd treat it as a I would a hostel overseas -- as in, don't leave anything behind that is irreplaceable. (I admittedly tend to be a little paranoid about such things.)"
"Thank you all for a lovely stay! I hope to be back. \"",,,,,

The room was large enough for myself and my friend, the room was clean and comfortable. The Carney's were able to accommodate us by putting another fold out bed in the room, which was super nice of them. The neighborhood is very nice and the short walk to and from the subway entrance was pleasant even when returning late at night. Mary and Barney were very friendly and made sure we felt welcome, they went out of their way to make sure we had a great time and we did. I would certainly stay here again next time I'm visiting Boston. Thank you very much for the great stay!"
