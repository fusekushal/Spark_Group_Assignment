The house was clean and everything was as described as in the pictures. Liza made us a good breakfast with toast,jam,fruits,yoghurt,coffee and orange juice before we left the next morning.,
"I can recommend staying here!\"",,,,,
7693354,47287986,2015-09-17,40653609,Łukasz,Liza and her husband hosted us for two nights. The place is well located -5 min walk from subway + 15 min ride to downtown.
Liza and her husband made our stay really nice and comfortable - they even served us breakfest (as well as many tips for exploring city).,,,,,
We arrived in late in midnight and it was not a problem.,,,,,
The room was clean.,,,,,
"Highly recommend.\"",,,,,
7693354,47511786,2015-09-19,42619895,Susan,"Liza and Cliff made us very welcome and bent over backwards to advise and assist us.  The house is pretty, in a quiet street, and the bedroom very spacious.  Comfortable bed and good breakfast, too!"
7693354,47771392,2015-09-21,39214998,Dinh,"One of the best Airbnb hosts I have ever stayed with (out of 10ish total including those on my other account). Liza was at work when I arrived, so her husband, Cliff, greeted me. The place is conveniently located within 2 minutes walk to Savin Hill Avenue station on the Red Line. It is approximately 15 minutes away from Chinatown/Boston Common via Subway. The house has everything you need (Brita water, toiletries, comfortable bed,etc...). The room is on the top floor and REALLY spacious. The A/C in the room works really well. It is GREAT value for the price Liza offers. Stay here!"
7693354,47921884,2015-09-21,13900864,Scott,"The place was very easy to find, and we were greeted by Liza's husband and given a tour of the house.  The room is a cozy upper loft with a comfortable and large bed.  The cross breeze and A/C were nice with the warm Boston weather.  Everything was clean and nicely presented.  The house is very convenient to the train station, and it took an easy 13 minutes to reach downtown Boston."
We only stayed 1 day,"and met Liza the next morning.  Very friendly and we would definitely stay again for a longer period.\"",,,,
7693354,48122365,2015-09-23,5970646,Nessa,"We had a very quick stay with Liza and her family. The bedroom is spacious, clean, and has room to spread out. It's tucked away on the third floor of the house and feels private. The location is great, easy to find, and on a quiet street just around the corner from the T. Communication with Liza as well as check in and out were smooth and easy."
7693354,48309767,2015-09-25,40624203,Pieter,We had a very nice stay at the airbnb of Liza (and her family). The house is beautiful and has a great atmosphere. It was a pleasure to sleep there and the location is perfect for visiting Boston. The metro is near to the house and within minutes you're in the city centre. Liza and her family are very welcoming and helpful. We would definitly recommend a stay at this airbnb when you want to visit Boston!
7693354,48554189,2015-09-27,3079175,Fernando,"It was very easy to get to and the room is nice, big and full of light. Liza was a great host and made everything easy. Thank you Liza!"
7693354,48750524,2015-09-28,15648038,Brad,"Nice place.  Big room and comfortable bed.  Good location and *very* close to subway.  Only real issue (perhaps especially so for older guests) is that bathroom is down a flight of stairs.  I was glad, too, to be able to park for free on street right in front of house."
7693354,49026892,2015-09-30,8612643,Alejandra,La experiencia en la casa de Liza fue fantástica! Una de las casas mas lindas que he visto y una de las familias mas amigables que he conocido.
Tanto Liza como su marido son muy amables.,,,,,
El cuarto es muy espacioso y decir que es comodo es quedarse corto,tiene una cama super comoda!!!,,,,
Todo estaba muy limpio!,,,,,
Hay acceso a toda la casa,la cocina es hermosa y tambien hay acceso a lavarropa y secarropa.,,,,
El tren esta a unas pocas cuadras y te lleva al centro de Boston en 10 minutos.,,,,,
Un lugar totalmente recomendable en un barrio fantástico y con geniales anfitriones!,,,,,
Ademas tuvimos el agrado de compartir una muy buena charla con el marido de Liza durante el desayuno.,,,,,
"Definitivamente volvería!\"",,,,,
7693354,49338735,2015-10-03,33507158,Jimmy,A very sweet room in a nice house. Liza and her husband are good hosts. Located near a subway station. Good experience.
7693354,49481873,2015-10-04,43372074,Xiaowen,"I did not come and visit Liza actually, due to a car accident on the way to her home. However, I can still feel how hospitable and kind Liza is when I contact with her via email or message. It's a pity that I can not meet her in person. Will come and visit next time!"
7693354,49653214,2015-10-05,28230158,Ruthie,"I only stayed for one night. Liza was lovely, and the room quaint, clean, and just as described. The location is super convenient by being so close to the T and to a few local restaurants. I felt very safe walking down to the T even by myself at night because there was always a cop car parked on that street!"
"I appreciated a Brita filled with water in my room and menus to local restaurants :) \"",,,,,
7693354,49899707,2015-10-07,2984704,Heather,"The room was just as described and though I didn't have much time to spend in the rest of the house, but I did notice that the floors and woodwork were beautiful!  The room was nice and quiet and had plenty of room to spread out and be comfy/collapse - perfect after an exhausting day walking around the conference center. Hosts were very accommodating and the wifi, which I needed for work was solid! Loved the cat :)"
7693354,50013175,2015-10-08,35650776,Beverly,Our hosts were great as was the location. We rode the T for free from Logan airport to within a few blocks of their house! In addition we ate a great meal (great beer too) at the neighbor hood grill. We'd love to stay there again. But.....don't drive a car in the (URL HIDDEN) nuts!
7693354,50089195,2015-10-09,37435558,Neal,"Liza was wonderful to stay with. She was flexible with our check-in time, and recommended fun things to do around the city. She also had little chocolates on our pillow which was a nice touch!"
7693354,50213675,2015-10-10,39934874,David,"This was our first time using Airbnb, and it was great! Liza was very welcoming! We loved her house, it was clean and organized! She made sure we had everything we needed and even had coffee out in the morning! There was water in the room, which was perfect! There was literally 24/7 police protection on her street. Which was nice, even though her neighborhood and surrounding area don't seem dangerous. The Red Line is two blocks up which takes you right into the city. It was perfect. We loved it here! We're definitely going to look her up when we come back to Boston!!"
7693354,50478011,2015-10-12,42952282,Darko,"The room we stayed at Liza and her husband's place was just as we expected it to be, clean, comfy and spatious. The house is in nice and quiet part of the town. Just around the corner there is a red line subway station. We can recommend the Savin bar that is a few minutes away, it has a small but selected meal offer and the food tasted great! Liza's husband was very helpful with some information about public transfer and places to see. Also, for everyone that are cat lovers, they have a cute and coudly cat that is not afraid to come and say hello to new guests. We would definately stay in Dorchester if we'd come again."
7693354,50760791,2015-10-14,23109276,Tahlia,We had a great stay at Lisa's house in Dorchester. The room was huge and the bed was very comfortable! She was accommodating and friendly. It was super close to the T train as well which is really convenient
7693354,50933657,2015-10-16,36685455,Jessica,"Liza and her family were great hosts, very friendly and helpful especially when we were trying to navigate our way around Boston!!"
"Thank you for a lovely stay!\"",,,,,

7693354,51296814,2015-10-19,42593460,Amber,My 8 year old daughter and I had a great stay with Liza and her family. The room was clean. She laid out water and towels and the Wi-Fi password for our use. Her husband was also helpful as Liza worked her day job during our stay. On our second night We visited the restaurant where she works. It was delicious and she was welcoming. We also met her son's chinchilla.
7693354,51466363,2015-10-20,42950422,Wenhao,"I enjoyed my stay at Lisa's house. It was quiet at night. The house is elegantly decorated, especially the bathroom."
7693354,51722772,2015-10-24,39272848,Paul,"We arrived earlier than check in time and Liza already had the room ready for us which was great.  Initially I had let her know of our early arrival and had planned on just dropping of our luggage.  The room was just as picture and described, very nice an cozy.  The neighborhood was pretty cool and there is police presence 24/7.  There are some good places to eat close by, the little breakfast place just up the street is great and really busy, so plan ahead.  Liza and her family were great as well, very welcoming.  Being so close to the train was great too, since we relied mostly on public transportation during our stay in Boston."
7693354,52224080,2015-10-27,8606316,Yael,"The house is situated well, very close to the metro station. The room is big and clean.the bed is not super comfortable but it's ok. The rest of the house is big as well. Unfortunately It's not the cleanest place I have ever seen. The kitchen and the bathroom were messy, as the whole family leave in the house. It was heavy to bring upstairs the luggage as the room is on the third floor. The husband helped us in doing that."
7693354,52360107,2015-10-28,46699830,Ines,"Das Zimmer ist schoen! Leider muss das Bad gemeinsam mit der Familie genutztwerden. Die Kinder haben jedes mal geklopft, dadurch hat man absolut keine privatsphaere..."
7693354,52970544,2015-11-03,19654375,Chelsea,"We had a great time in Boston, thanks to Liza and her husband's hospitality. They were both friendly and helpful. The room was clean and huge, just as advertised.  A highlight was the great location.  It is very conveniently located near a station for easy access to the MBTA transportation system, so we never wished we had rented a car. Walking from the station to the house, even at night, felt safe. Would stay here again!"
7693354,53467932,2015-11-09,19169371,Jason,"Liza and her husband Cliff, made us feel very welcome in their home. The room was large and cozy and the home itself was conveniently located a short distance from the Savin Hill station."
7693354,54107360,2015-11-16,44659171,Josh,"I felt very safe and at home here. Everything was just as I keep my home, and there was always a police officer on the street to ensure safety!  Liza provided us with all the comforts of home, and I would gladly stay here o my next trip to Boston!"
7693354,54327209,2015-11-18,35315195,Donna,Liza and Cliff made us feel completely welcome in their home.  Cliff openly shared information on the best local restaurant for dinner upon our quite late arrival.  The room was very clean and exactly as advertised.  The location was wonderful and has very close access to public transportation which made it convenient for exploring the city.
"Wonderful place to stay and I highly recommend it!\"",,,,,

7693354,56455848,2015-12-13,42906463,Gregory,Liza and Cliff were very welcoming. The house was built in the 1800s and is just beautiful. The bedroom was huge and the bed was very comfortable. I would absolutely stay there again. Thanks!
7693354,57841257,2015-12-29,52015451,Qihui,"I love this Victorian house very much! It has a historical feel, and is pretty nice and comfortable. The location is very close to the beach and the train. Liza and her husband are very friendly. They are locals in Boston, and they provided lots of useful information about touring around Boston to me. Staying in this house is definitely an unforgettable experience for me!"
7693354,58141635,2016-01-01,23363614,Jéssica,"Liza and her husband Cliff were very welcoming! My stay was brief and unfortunately I didn't get to know Boston, but they made us feel at home. The room is really cozy, clean and warm. We arrived early for the check in, but Liza let us drop off our luggage in the room. We needed to do laundry and they even let us do it at their home! Their location is close to transportation and to great restaurants! We really enjoyed our stay with them and we'd love to stay there again!"
7693354,58574728,2016-01-03,48859732,Chayenne,Liza was very prepared and very flexible! She has a beautiful house and everything was there! Very nice experience!

7693354,62322688,2016-02-13,52170886,Lauren,Liza was a great host!  She has everything ready for us and she is very laid back with wonderful personality! Our room was on the top floor so it was private. It was also a perfect location.  I would definitely go back to Liza's again!
7693354,62473916,2016-02-14,56781804,Chris,"Liza and family were welcoming and helpful. They anticipated our needs, providing us with towels, the wifi password, and drinking water. They suggested attractions in Boston, which we took advantage of, and these places made our stay more exciting. I'd gladly stay again!"
7693354,62642419,2016-02-15,57683766,Gopika,Liza is a wonderful person! Everything was perfect for our stay there. She made us feel very much at home! I loved my stay there.  She also was very helpful in helping us find a place to get dinner.

7693354,64179741,2016-02-29,58643223,Tammy,"Liza was excellent at getting back to me promptly. She gave clear, concise directions to her beautiful home. She was gracious, accommodating, and friendly. The room was large and beautiful (as the rest of the house)."
Fresh towels and extra blankets were available. Very clean room with plenty of space to unpack. Bathroom was very clean and well stocked. The whole place had character and charm. We felt very safe walking to and from the house. T was very close!,,,,,

7693354,65431665,2016-03-13,21423920,Alison,"I absolutely loved my stay with Liza! The room is the epitome of charming and is part of an 1895 Victorian home in a historical section of Boston. Public transit was a two-minute walk, which made this location central to everything within Boston and the general area. The host and her family made me feel welcome from the beginning and were quite helpful with their recommendations and suggestions. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it to anyone considering a visit to the Boston area."
7693354,65644736,2016-03-16,49943654,Stephanie,"Liza and her husband were very welcoming and informative about the city. They were very accommodating with arrival times, things we needed and giving us our privacy. The Space is a great size but the bathroom could use a face lift.  All in all a great space and perfect location. Just steps away from the subway."
7693354,65773360,2016-03-17,49943654,Stephanie,"Liza and her family made us feel welcome the moment we walked in the door.  The Space was exactly as it was pictured. So spacious perfect for what we needed it for. Liza and her husband were very helpful with anything we needed, from questions about Boston to arrival times."
7693354,65910384,2016-03-17,62781061,Christopher,"Liza was very accommodating with my check-in time, and was available even though traffic caused my arrival to be an hour late. During my time staying here, the hosts were very generous and warm, and provided recommendations to where to get food, as well as the best way to travel around Boston. The room was very clean, and many amenities (soap, shampoo, towels) were all provided. I had a wonderful time, and I would recommend people to stay here wholeheartedly."

7693354,67579644,2016-03-30,12691614,Doris,"Liza, her husband Cliff and the two kids were very hospitable during our visit in Boston. Their house in a typical New England style has got a lot of charm, the room is big, beautiful and clean and the bed is very comfortable. The house is standing in a safe street. If you have any questions, Liza and Cliff are very helpful. The public transit is just around the corner (2 min.) and good located to Downtown. We would absoluteley stay there again. Very recommendable."
7693354,67810265,2016-03-31,7781197,Amanda,"I had a one-day trip and found a place at the last minute. I love that I could book Liza's place instantly. It is truly a find! Liza has a very lovely place. The room was beautiful, clean, comfortable and cozy. Love that the T was super closeby. Wish I had more time. Liza was very friendly and accommodating. She had lots of information about the local area and Boston at hand."
7693354,68326582,2016-04-04,6619126,Chui,"First of all I chose this posting because of its location. I needed to commute everyday to the TD Garden and it was a breeze. Its just 4 stops away from South Station which was convenient if you were taking the bus or the train. The neighborhood was fantastic, safe and everything was convenient. I never felt scared walking home in the wee hours of the night. Liza, her family and the cute cat gave me my privacy but they were very nice as well. The house was clean, quiet and Liza had lots of toiletries to choose from. She had maps, restaurant menus, water and umbrellas that came in very handy. The room was huge and peaceful. I had a wonderful experience staying in their home and would love to come back!"
7693354,68980818,2016-04-08,60228468,Geoff,"Liza was a great hostess from beginning to end! She kept in contact with us while we were  delayed in transit, and she stayed up past midnight to see us in; even then she took the trouble to show us round the house and the shared facilities; she was very relaxed about our coming and going at any time. We met her family and had several really interesting talks, arising from which was a unique experience of visiting her son's elementary school, meeting teachers, classes etc. (we're both schoolteachers in England). The house is full of characterful period  features, as is the neighbourhood. Large, comfortable, quiet room with lovely bed! Just 2 minutes level walk from the T (Boston's 'metro')."
7693354,69222474,2016-04-10,27752501,Abbi,"I had a wonderful, restful stay in Liza's home, and loved making friends with her beautiful Norwegian forest cat! The room was exactly as pictured, with one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in, and Liza was incredibly friendly and accommodating even when I arrived extremely tired and a little early. There was still snow on the ground when I arrived (in early April) but I was perfectly warm and cosy."
The house is very close to the T,as mentioned,and I had both brunch and dinner in the area,"both of which were awesome. Definitely felt safe and all around couldn't be happier with how my trip went (up until my 8 hour delay at Boston Logan!). Anyway: I'd definitely stay here again.\"",,

Liza & her husband were available to help us or give advice on restaurant choices whenever we needed. Her home was located in a quiet neighborhood just a block from the T station.  It was super easy to get downtown or to other destinations. There were several restaurants near by and a rite aid within walking distance. Overall,  we enjoyed our stay and would return to stay at this listing.  Thanks so much Liza!"
7693354,71496148,2016-04-25,49349804,Rachel,"Liza was a super host, she was very accommodating and the rest of her family were lovely too!

7693354,73126955,2016-05-07,53254849,Fleur,"Liza's home is very close to the red line (subway or 'T'), which is very convenient for visiting Boston. She's very kind and helpful, as is her husband.  She had a great suggestion regarding breakfast, just 1 stop on the T and then a 3 minute walk. It's called Homestead. The bedroom that Liza provides is private for sure, as you basically have your own floor. We haven't used the shared spaces much, as we spent as much time downtown as possible, so we can't really say anything about that. Obviously we used the bathroom, which was fine, although it wasn't spic and span. All in all, a great option for people who are looking for a place to sleep and would like some locals to give you some advice on where to go!"
7693354,73809732,2016-05-10,48118040,Debra,"We arrived late in the evening and were shown around the house and to our room. The room was neat and clean and just like the picture showed and the bed was comfortable. The hosts were friendly and told us how to get to the train and into downtown Boston. We inquired about local places to eat and found them all within walking distance. The neighborhood was safe for walking, even at night, and also for leaving the car unattended for a few days."

7693354,75416135,2016-05-21,53575792,Stan,Liza was very welcoming and was a gracious host. She even went to the extent of putting mints on the pillows. The location was ideal within 3 blocks of the subway and two excellent restaurants.
7693354,75675372,2016-05-22,19232123,Kallan,Liza's place was so comfortable and a perfect spot for us to stay our first night in Boston!  She was very accommodating to our schedule and made us feel right at home.   Great location that is easily accessible in a part of Boston you might not otherwise venture to.  Thank you for hosting us!

7693354,76466450,2016-05-27,8114226,John,"Home away from is what we seek when we travel and Liza made her home feel that way for us.  She has spent a lot of time and thought organizing the traveler’s experience such that whatever you need is at your fingertips.  The room is at the top ( 3rd floor) of what is indeed a Grand Victorian residence and is spacious, comfortable and quiet.  The mattress is high quality and very comfortable and there is plenty of room for clothes and luggage as well as a desk and internet access.  Liza was kind and attentive in accepting delivery of flowers we needed before our arrival and thoughtfully found space in her large SubZero fridge so that they would remain fresh.  The AC was in the window of our room and while I turned it off each day when we left, Liza made sure to turn it on in time for our arrival so that the room was already cool.  Fresh filtered water was there every day.  The entire house is immaculately maintained (makes you want to take your shoes off when you arrive, which we did) and presented with just the right balance of professional, hotel like amenities and warm, non-commercial, personalized ambiance.  It was so easy to unwind, relax and rest and feel less like a guest and more like we had our home away from home!  Kudos to Liza and her family!!"

It turned out that Liza wasn’t available during most of the time we stayed but her husband took excellently care of all we needed."
There is a large supermarket only one T-stop from Liza’s place. Even if you have no car available you easily can get all you need for your stay.,,,,,

7693354,77957984,2016-06-04,47762961,Carol,"Lizas home is well located very close to the train station and just a few stops from the center of Boston. Plenty of places to eat nearby. The room is huge, bed firmish but comfortable. Good WiFi. Unfortunately didn't get to meet Liza."
7693354,78298685,2016-06-06,8269310,Debora,"We only stayed one night with Liza but she and her family were great and the room was very comfortable. We arrived late in the evening from Cape Cod and Liza's husband, Cliff, was waiting to let us in. We were a bit tired from traveling and were very relieved to arrive at their home. The room was very spacious and comfortable and private at the top of the house. The bed was very comfortable. The location was super convenient very close to the T. We had a great sleep and a good start the next day from their house. The house is located in a sweet neighborhood and has a lot of charm. We would happily have stayed longer and definitely recommend it."
7693354,78829673,2016-06-09,56009280,Eliška,Liza was very kind and room was beautiful. I really reccomend this accomodation :)
7693354,79365124,2016-06-12,7091042,Krista,"We were welcomed upon our arrival and given a tour of the shared and private space, an overview of neighborhood amenities and the house cat kept us company while we settled in (to my daughter's delight). The room was as described, and very comfortable. We spent the majority of our time downtown so we rarely saw our hosts and didn't explore the neighborhood. We did have several pleasant meals at the local restaurants, in particular, breakfast at McKenna's each day. Very easy access to the T."
7693354,80061505,2016-06-15,6006087,Pip And Tony,"\"The room was lovely unlike the shared (with family) bathroom. The location was handy and we enjoyed breakfast at McKenna's, just up the road, next to the \"\"T\"\". \""
7693354,80811578,2016-06-19,15322641,Paul,I enjoyed my stay. No problems. The location was very convenient as the red line metro station was only one block away.
7693354,81144932,2016-06-21,2122716,Miriam,"We stayed in Boston for weekend, and stayed one night at Liza's place. Everything is exactly like what she puts on Airbnb."

7693354,81955281,2016-06-25,22112677,Anna,Very spacious room and nicely furnished.
The house is very convenient for the T line into Boston (only 5/6 stops).,,,,,
Easy to get breakfast,lunch and evening meals in the vicinity (McKenna's recommended for breakfast and Shanti Indian restaurant for dinner).,,,,

7693354,83868797,2016-07-04,44374916,Alice,"The location is fabulous! Just a short walk (~5min) from the T, and very peaceful neighborhood. Liza and Cliff were wonderful hosts and were willing to work with our schedule, even when we thought we would have to check in very late. We really appreciated the small details --- like having a Brita water pitcher in the room for easy access to water. A wonderful place to stay for anyone visiting Boston!"

Es ist ein Familienhaushalt,mit dem man sich das Bad teilen muss.,,,,

The room was very spacious and comfortable - we also got a stuffed elephant waiting for us on the bed when we arrived too!  The house is in a quiet and a safe neighborhood.  It was a 5min walk from Savin Hill station, so easy to get into the city.   Also the Indian restaurant near their place was amazing."
7693354,86243391,2016-07-15,60807545,Muriel,chambre très spacieuse et agréable tout proche d'une bouche de métro qui donne accès directement au centre ville. Lisa nous a vraiment bien accueillies et maîtrise très bien le français.
7693354,86804741,2016-07-17,67443956,Linda,"Liza welcomed us, but then we never saw her again. The stairs to the 3rd floor were very narrow and steep. I wish I had realized that beforehand. It was a struggle getting our luggage up the front porch steps and then up 2 more flights of stairs. The first night we didn't know where the light was for the stairs so it was a little stressful going down these steep stairs in the dark to use the bathroom. Not the best neighborhood, even the Uber driver waited until we were safely inside. Too far out of the city to come back and change clothes if going out to dinner. Wished it was closer. I don't want to cause any loss for this hostess, but I wished others had mentioned these 2 points as I would not have stayed here."
7693354,87597599,2016-07-21,81552904,대원,매우 좋았습니다 ! 위치 ! 거기다 개인실 엄청 넓고  친절하십니다

7693354,89145331,2016-07-27,5403676,Charles,"This is a nice room in a nice location close to the subway station with easy access to Boston sites. A nice neighborhood too. Liza was friendly and gave good tips about places to eat. However, don't expect to  have any of the usual pluses of an AirBnB place. No coffee in the morning for instance is a bit sad given the price. It's just a detail but one of the things you come to expect."
7693354,89341611,2016-07-28,85970962,Kristen,"The Victorian style home was very charming and located in a good neighborhood. Liza and her family were very helpful with our arrival and also with using the trains to get around Boston.  The home was well kept, and the room we stayed in was air conditioned and comfortable."

We had a very spacious and private room on the top floor of her 3 story house.The bathroom was shared with her family but all was very clean. The neighbourhood was lovely and just 3 minutes from the subway station with easy access to downtown. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting to visit Boston."
7693354,91467515,2016-08-05,50125308,Marcin,Everything was alright. Liza was very helpful and told us about some great places to visit. The room was clean and nice.
7693354,92405713,2016-08-08,43194532,Brittany,"Liza's home was convenient and comfortable, right off the T. The room was private and spacious and we loved having the freedom of no curfew. Bed was comfortable and air conditioning make the room cool and welcoming. We didn't get to see or speak with Liza much as we were out and about but she was kind and cordial each time we met."

7693354,93224367,2016-08-12,4879293,Tonie,Liza went above and beyond the usual hostess courtesy. Our flight was delayed three times from Denver so we didn't arrive at the time we thought. Matter of fact we were over two hours late if I remember correctly.  That's with us taking a taxi rather than the bus or subway. We didn't arrive till after 3am I think. She was available and giving us information to pass on to the taxi driver at that hour!
Thank you Liza,"you are amazing and your house is beautiful! Thanks for being the hostess with the mostest!\"",,,,

7693354,95506650,2016-08-20,85992524,Katie,Quiet neighborhood right near the T. Easy access to the city! Easy walk to the river to sit and enjoy the view at night. We were very comfortable. Went to the bar/restaurant next to the T. Very nice waiters and service. Good food!
7693354,97106376,2016-08-26,87488832,Jaroslav,Liza and her husband were absolutely amazing hosts. They were very communicative and helpful. The room looked exactly as promised. I would definitely love to be in their place again.

13239143,78953514,2016-06-10,70651134,Chukwudi,"My first Airbnb, and what a rewarding experience it was. Huggy was such a wonderful host for my 4-night stay. We started communicating by mail and telephone before my departure from Europe and up till the very moment I rang his door bell in Dorchester. Everything presented about the accommodation - location, cleanliness, neighborhood, etc. were accurate. Huggy went out of his way to fulfill every request that I made and showed great humility when he sought my opinion on possible improvements that he could make to the accommodation. The unpretentious demonstration of great respect for my person endeared him to me.  What a fine gentleman he really is! This is one host and accommodation I would DEFINITELY recommend.  I am sure to be back again! 5 stars to you Huggy!!!"
13239143,80015822,2016-06-15,45751747,Kanishka,"Huggy is a fantastic host; he is exceptionally polite, hospitable, and attentive. He made an effort to make sure I was settled in and had a feel for the surrounding area. The place is very clean, very quiet, and all the essentials were provided. My roommates were friendly, and also worked to keep the shared spaces (bathroom, kitchen) very neat. If I'm ever back in the area, I would love to stay here again!"
1214214,46670506,2015-09-12,22290887,Matt,Very comfortable stay in Boston - was there for 2 nights for work.  The place was as described and would recommend to others.  Harriet was very easy to work with as well.  Thank you.
179245,550395,2011-09-20,963237,Marc,"I very much enjoyed my stay at Hermina's place.  Being next to a police station made me feel a lot safer during my four-stay at Hermina's place.    The proximity of the place to the nearest train station gave me a lot of flexibility as far as getting around, without feeling the need for a private car or using a taxicab.  The place itself is well-kept and clean."
179245,623885,2011-10-12,1208318,Billie,Hermina was a great hostess. Opened up her home and made you feel at home. This is a great location! Short walk to the T..easy access to all that is Boston. Spent 3 nights without any problems. Felt very safe (beside the police station) but I don't scare easy!

179245,647135,2011-10-20,1036199,Gabriele,Our bedroom was big and clean and it was great having a kitchen available.  The location of Hermina's house is also very convenient since it is very close to the subway line into Boston.  We can highly recommend this place.
179245,658735,2011-10-24,279137,Brittany,"I was looking for  a place close to the T and out of Bostons traffic, this place was perfect. After a little confusion as to which room we were staying, mis-communication mostly,  My boyfriend and I stayed in apartment H, which was PERFECT! I would even love to live there if I could!  I was a cute mini apartment that offered privacy, which is all we really wanted.  Very comfortable and once we finally met Hermina, she was lovely as well."

The rooms are clean, and the shared bathroom is not a problem, as there is always enough hot water. There is internet and tv if you need a rest from sightseeing.  The best part of the stay is the shared breakfast with Hermina and the other guests. We made many new friends from around the worl."
Secret tip: Saigon Seafood on Adam St around the corner is seriously excellent,packed with Vietnamese locals,$21 for 2 lobsters,"plus best pepper squid I've ever tasted!\"",,

The apartment itself was homely and clean. Just a heads up- I did not notice air conditioning in the rooms but there were fans. Just something to consider for the middle of the summer. It was comfortable when we stayed. Linens and towels were provided as well as breakfast items. Hermina was very communicative and helpful.  Overall,  a great experience and I would recommend it to future travelers."

The place is great and exactly as described on AirBnB, safe, convenient, recently renovated... I would just say that only one of the two bedrooms has the AC. If you plan to come during summer, I'd recommend you ask to Hermina which room you will have."

My only 2 minor issues were A) being notified that the other room was occupied when I arrived (fortunately they were a very nice couple from San Francisco) and B) No sports channels of any kind in the cable package (not even regular ESPN). I'm sure its a cable company package thing, I just found it very odd. Lucky for me, the bar across the street had good food and reasonable drink prices. Overall my stay was enjoyable and I would stay again."

The appartment was clean and fully equipped. We had our own clean bedroom and shared the livingroom, bathroom and kitchen with another couple, but this we were told before we arrived, so it wasn't a problem for us. Overall the appartment was as advertised, and very good. The only downside we found was the neigbourhood. On our second evening around 7pm there were shots fired down in our street with a big response from the local police. Later on the night we heard several more shots being fired. We believe it is not a great neighbourhood where you want to stay with children."

Other guests were friendly as well. I didnt meet Hermina or Donna personally but they were quick to respond and would call when needed. overall a great experience for first time AirBnb users like us, we would definitely go back to Hermina's again :) i would only suggest to change ligjt fixtures in the bedroom since i think it was too dim for my liking but other than that it was a pleasant experience and would recommend this place to my friends :)"

The host never lived in the house, even don't leave a key to us, not only myself but the guy next door don't have a key either. When I went out room washing hands, the door locked, I can't enter the room, all of money, passport, clothes, belongs all lock. I ask a help from the guy who stay the next room, same book through bnb, even make phone call and message to the host but don't have any response, so I have. sit on the coach the whole night never sleeping, cold, stressed, until the next morning I run out for help from police at 6:00am. More, the whole house, apartment 1 and apartment 2 can be connected through basement, when we go to basement try to find a solution, and found that everywhere is people, two young ladies who even come up from basement told me the house lived even more the twenty people. It means here more like a cheap hotel instead a real air bnb room.  So not safe at all."

And by last minute, I mean that when I arrived at the original location, she gave me advice for where to find parking,  but a few minutes later when I couldn't open the lockbox to get in, she called me to ask me to switch locations. Everything after that was easy - but the reason I am giving her 4 stars instead of 5, is that I wish she had contacted me ahead of time so that I could go to the second location in the first place rather than backtracking. However, she was very nice and professional, refunded me $20 for my trouble, and her spaces were of very high quality."

13863117,98352486,2016-08-30,89754267,Paul,"I had a very pleasant stay at Ellen's place, which is located in a quit area not far from the mbta broadway stop."
"Clean house and cosy little room. \"",,,,,
2672058,12017645,2014-04-21,13732940,HsinHsien,"Very clean and comfortable apartment, and the wall painting is really cute.  Christie is a very nice girl and seems glad to be a good host. We had a great time at her place. The apartment is at a convenient location. The bus stops of route 57 and 66 are right there within 100 meters, and the MBTA green line Harvard Avenue Station is within 7 mins walking distance. For tourists, you could take bus route 66 to Harvard Square to visit the beautiful Harvard University, or take MBTA green line to Park Street Station which is the start of the famous Boston Freedom Trail."
2672058,54762162,2015-11-23,25334866,Simao,I think everything is good.
2672058,57341745,2015-12-24,51164577,David,"Everything was good. Friendly host, nice room, a myriad of Asian restaurants around this area. I enjoyed my time."
2672058,61131948,2016-01-31,55274068,Wenbin,"Christie was a very good host and a friendly person. The apartment was quiet, clean and nicely decorated. It's conveniently located near a lot of stuff for tourists. Totally worth the money."
2672058,66167540,2016-03-20,55310423,Michelle,The neighborhood was wonderful and safe. There were many restaurants nearby. Christie's place was clean and spacious. The bed was very comfortable and the room was at perfect temperature the entire stay. Christie answered all of my questions during the stay. Thank you!
2672058,69252737,2016-04-10,34068032,Naihao,"Christie is a wonderful host you don't want to miss in Boston. Her place is just as she described, clean and well organized. The neighborhood is safe and has a lot choices for Asian food. I am very glad to meet with Christie and be her guest during the stay of Boston."
2672058,72908285,2016-05-05,47189618,Shiran,Christie's place is a homy welcoming apartment and there's plenty to do around. She was really nice and answered every need I had. I could stay and work in the apartment when I didn't go to the university. The place looks just like the pictures and there's plenty of storing facilities in the room. It's not the cleanest place...
I had to get to the MIT and it took about 30-40 minutes (and the bus is not very frequent),"but I know that getting to Harvard is much easier. overall the place and surrounding are good places to be in.\"",,,,
2672058,75399143,2016-05-21,48761872,Liisa,"I stayed at Christie's place for three nights during my work trip to Boston. She had only seven reviews, so I suspect she's a pretty new AirBnB host. However, I was willing to take the risk because the reviews were very good (5 stars)."
Unfortunately,my experience didn't match the good reviews. First,the apartment was dirty: the counters of my room were dusty with sticky marks,the carpet required vacuuming,the bathroom was dirty and full of hair. Also,based on my previous AirBnB experience
The second evening Christie had her boyfriend (?) visiting her,and I ended up accidentally walking to the bathroom when he has there (he didn't lock the door,and I didn't know the bathroom was occupied). Last,I suspect there is at least an occasional pet (dog/cat) in the apartment since there was animal hair in my room and the bathroom,and bowls for water and food on the floor. Luckily I'm not allergic.,
On the positive side,Christie was very flexible with the check-in time (due to work,I arrived at 11pm),the apartment was easy to find,and well located for my purposes. The bed was very comfortable too.,
However,"I will be using some other place next time.\"",,,,
2672058,76877539,2016-05-29,66906167,SooJi,Christie was a very hospitable host. She  provided help in all aspects of our stay. Her place was approx 8 min walk to the T which would take you in to the city. There was much to do around her place in regards to food and drinks. It was our first airbnb still getting used to being in another strangers place. I assume with experience will evolve comfortability. Only downside was that it was approx 90 degrees outside and 80 degrees inside. Turned the air on to only have it turned off.
2672058,82829381,2016-06-29,72974846,Cathy,"I have stayed in Christie's place for 9 days this time. Christie is quite nice and friendly. Her place is modern, new and spaceous. Everything is exactly as shown in the pictures. I may contact her when I visit Boston next time."
2892825,25225848,2015-01-09,19044696,Alexandra,The reservation was canceled 55 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2892825,33703242,2015-05-31,23914559,Lucy,"The neighborhood is unexpected, siren and loud music at night almost every night, though the interior of the house is clean, landlord lives right upstairs, so we can always hear steps early in the morning."
2892825,36189490,2015-06-26,31388453,Freddy,"Great host, accommodation was spot on. Seamless from start to finish."
2892825,38883965,2015-07-19,31458589,Pamela,We were welcomed by our host with a warm smile.  We traveled all day and didn't get there until after 9:00 PM.  She was friendly and walked us through the house and all the functionality.
"The rooms were clean and the beds were so comfortable.  We would highly recommend this listing to anyone coming to the Boston area.  The location was great and only minutes to downtown.  \"",,,,,
2892825,48876793,2015-09-29,36876786,Anthony,Overall the experience was good.  The house was nice.  The surrounding area was not the best.  10 minute uber ride to Fenway park and downtown was convenient.
2892825,63696036,2016-02-26,19872097,Monica,The host canceled this reservation 20 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2892825,90341368,2016-07-31,38288137,Beverly,I would call this a recovering neighborhood. Lots of beautiful old homes. This one has been renovated extensively into 3 sections. We did not feel comfortable dining in the immediate area so a car is a must. The only grocery was hard to find. The house has off street parking which was an asset. Don't stay here if you are planning to take a bus or subway to get around.
Overall this house is wonderful for a large group such as ours,but know you have to climb stairs to the bedrooms which are on the 1st and 3rd floors. One real plus are the amenities that are provided. There are a ton of towels,soap,kitchen supplies,paper supplies,even shampoo. It was nice to have all that there upon arrival. The only thing missing in the kitchen was a spatula (hint) for flipping eggs. The a/c is spotty. Really cold on first floor
13801598,84083817,2016-07-05,81134403,Elvis,"Was an amazing weekend. The apartment was great! And everything was as described. Perfect location for me and the fast wifi and Netflix account access were some add ons really apreciated. Next time, for sure I'll contact this host again."
13801598,84383668,2016-07-07,81190182,Huy,Nice and clean. I love her place.

9894686,57848649,2015-12-29,51021299,Dara,"Rob is a very chill host and flexible with check-in and out times. I stayed for one night, and it's only 10 min walking to the subway station. Nice house with nice bathroom and bedroom!:))"

Many thanks again to Patricia and Robrecht (congratulations for your wedding and best wishes),,,,,
"\"",,,,,
9894686,66819681,2016-03-25,63430652,Christine,Robrecht and his wife were really nice hosts. They have a beautiful house and a very well behaved dog. I can recommend a stay at their house. The train station is very close and takes you into the city in less than 30 minutes.
9894686,70160017,2016-04-16,30093000,Kriszti,"A pleasant stay, the room was big and the bed was very comfortable. Everything was great."
9894686,70636426,2016-04-19,53155768,Adam,"This was the first time I booked a room with Airbnb and it was a very nice and very successful experience. Roberto and his wife were very friendly. The room and the house facilities were as promised. The house location is very good, in a quiet neighbourhood a few minutes walk to subway. I was staying there for 3 nights together with my wife before running the Boston marathon. I slept well and undisturbed before the run. I definitely recommend this place."
9894686,70830165,2016-04-21,63906312,Aline,"O anfitrião foi muito educado e simpático! A casa é excelente! Confesso que fiquei um pouco com medo do bairro, mas correu tudo tranquilo!"

"The bed is comfy and the position is good - close to the T station (subway) and this was really important for us. \"",,,,,
9894686,72044258,2016-04-30,61838352,Lucy,The neighbourhood was very nice and close to a subway station which was convenient. More precise directions would have been helpful.
Loved the dog,but didnt think this was made clear enough on the listing.,,,,
Overall,"an awesome first Airbnb experience. \"",,,,
9894686,72381022,2016-05-02,61720083,Blake,"Rob and Patricia were great hosts, being our first time in Boston they helped me and my girlfriend navigate the city and answered every question we had. We came in late both nights we stayed and they had no problems with it. They were very welcoming and I would highly recommend staying with them."
9894686,73836859,2016-05-10,57048328,Nancy,Rob and Patricia were friendly and helpful. Their home is lovely and only about a 10 minute walk from the Shawmut stop on the red line. The room is comfortable and exactly as advertised.
9894686,73887882,2016-05-11,68080870,Laura,"Super Gastgeber! Rob und Patricia waren beide sehr herzlich und interessiert. Sie haben uns viel erklärt im Hinblick auf die Gegend und U-Bahn. Die Unterkunft war ein Traum! Alles sauber und ein schönes Zimmer. Wie würden dort jederzeit wieder übernachten, zu mal die Unterkunft nicht weit weg vom Zentrum von Boston ist."
9894686,74330650,2016-05-14,52693489,Rachael,"The surrounding neighborhood looks a little sketchy, but we never felt unsafe while staying there.  We did use Uber more in the evening to get back to the room rather than public transportation.  Rob was very welcoming and the room was great for our needs!"
9894686,74760064,2016-05-16,59672595,Danny,"My wife and I arrived there on a Saturday morning, got in touch with Rob and he let us into their awesome home. The pictures you see on their listing is exactly what you'll get. The neighborhood was quite."
Being first timers there in Boston of course we had several questions about touring the city,both Rob and Patricia were more than helpful. They answered all our questions and gave us suggestions. Even though we really did not use the public transportation there in Boston but from their location you can see that they were close to a bunch of stuff including a Metro station.,,,,
We loved it there,they made us feel welcomed. Again,"thank you Rob and Patricia for letting us stay with you. We will absolutely stay here again!!\"",,,
9894686,75036124,2016-05-18,59036081,Victoria,"Robrecht fue muy amable en todo momento y la casa está genial! La cama muy cómoda y la habitación muy amplia, compartíamos el baño con los anfitriones y ningún problema. También usamos su cocina y todo perfecto."

9894686,76491990,2016-05-27,65733401,Kayla,"My boyfriend and I stayed with Rob from May 24-27. We had a great experience. We arrived earlier than check in however Rob left a key for us and we were able to go have a rest. This was awesome due to having drove all night (13 1/2 hrs) to get there! We didn't see much of Rob due to both of our schedules but we knew he was only an email away if we needed anything! We would stay here again and felt very welcome in the home!! We loved how close it was to the subway and bus stations! Very easy to get back and forth from Fenway Park, as well as downtown!!"

9894686,77515778,2016-06-01,9450291,Alyson,"Robrecht and his wife's house was beautiful! The neighbourhood was far from the downtown area but still accessible by metro (The stop was about a fifteen minute walk away.) The house was under renovations while we were there and we didn't see much of either of them, as a result the only downside was that we could not access any wifi connection. Overall though a  beautiful home and very welcoming hosts!"

9894686,81449940,2016-06-23,30324079,Christina,"Well, maybe it is just because all our previous Airbnb experiences were so great that we are spoiled, so this one didn't work out for us. We did not feel welcomed at all, the room was super dirty when we arrived, the hosts were not home maybe that was why. We had to leave so didn't stay even though we booked for 2 days. Hopefully, they will deliver a better experience for the future Airbnb guests :)"

Rob and Patricia were very friendly and arriving when they were not at home was no problem at all. Checkin at 2pm was no problem, but we had to wait for our room to be cleaned until 7pm which is not fully consistent with the description of the room on airbnb but it did not bother us. The house is 10 minutes away from public transport (red line), the room is beautiful and spacious and all in all we would definitely stay there again."

9894686,91267062,2016-08-04,61862307,Roxane,My boyfriend and I stayed at Robrecht's place for 2 nights. We really liked our stay over there. Parking on the street is very easy and the subway (red line) is a 8-10 minute walk and easy to go anywhere in Boston. The neighborhood seems safe but I wouldnt recommend walking on Washington st at night. Rob and his wife are very nice and welcoming. The room and bathroom was very clean and we found the bed really comfortable. Also we liked that we could go drop off our luggage at the house when we arrived at about 1 PM even if Rob wasnt there he gave us the code for the door. And him his wife gave us good recommendations for places to go out at night. I would definitly recommend this place for a visit to Boston!

9894686,97681872,2016-08-28,39550845,Adrienne,"Rob and Patricia were amazing hosts. While we did not have much time to get to know them, the room was exactly as described. This was a super value especially if you have a car with you. Ample street parking was available for free- you just had to mind the street cleaning on certain Wednesdays. They were wonderful at communicating and even though the room was not ready until 6pm we were able to come in early and drop off the bags and take a  quick shower before going out into the city.  The place was also close to a T stop on the red line but I would just make sure you stay in a group in that area at night. It was completely safe but the neighborhood is a little rough around the edges, but I can tell them are doing a lot of improvements."
9894686,98196807,2016-08-29,50934343,Jill,"We were very happy with our stay here! The room, and entire home, was super clean and inviting. Patricia was home when we arrived (we were early, but not a problem to drop our bags and vehicle) and she was friendly and showed us to our room and the bathroom. It was a short walk to the 'T' (subway station) and the neighborhood has great character. It was an easy way to get into the city, and when we used our car, we did  not have any trouble with a parking spot near the home."

5026613,27471145,2015-03-05,4598919,Patrick,"South Boston has a gem!  This place was very clean and exactly as described, beautiful and private.  We came and found exactly what the pictures show, a large second floor room with a private bath and (if there weren't 3 feet of snow on it) a nice outdoor deck.  The space was bright and spacious, and the bed was comfortable. We were busy with a trade show and weren't ever able to cross paths with Peter, but our directions were accurate and access was easy with the lock box for a hidden key.  Even with the horrible winter Boston has been through, we were able to park within one block both nights."

The room is nice,and very comfortable. Clean. We hardly saw him as we were out and about in Boston most of the time we were there,but he just gave us a key and let us do our thing. I don't know if I'll be in Boston any time soon,"but the room really made our experience nice. The only downside is that cabs can't seem to find the place because it's on a weird one way street. We would highly recommend. \"",,
5026613,35220653,2015-06-16,32225269,Wayne,"Peter was a perfect host! He was there to welcome me, tell me about the area and offered tips for using public transit.

The Southie neighborhood is fun, and the house is just a block and a half from the bus stop so it was convenient to get around. I'd stay here again."
5026613,42294804,2015-08-12,12486346,Alex,"My stay at Jessie's place was great. The space is large, quiet and private. The outdoor space is another great added perk. I didn't have a chance to meet Jessie, but he was in contact to make sure I was comfortable and didn't need anything. The location is particularly convenient for anyone that needs to access the convention center, but a 10 minute walk to the Broadway T station makes accessing the rest of Boston easy without a car. I highly recommend the space and would definitely stay there again."

5026613,43115859,2015-08-17,2421607,Philippa,"This was a huge room with a private bathroom and a private terrace, entered via our host's front door. It had central air conditioning which was great. The area is quaint, with houses quite close together, but with a friendly vibe. It was a short taxi ride from the airport, and there were restaurants and diners nearby for dinner and breakfast. It is a reasonable walk to the MBTA Red Line, but via that, you can get to most places easily."

And the lovely room was spatial enough even for 2 persons. Walk distance to Broadway station (red line) made much more easier for me to go downtown. I would recommend this place for sure! :)"
5026613,49001899,2015-09-30,30823577,Michael,Jesse was a wonderful host. He and his family gave us a lovely warm welcome. He offered us a lift when we went to town and also helped us with anything we needed. There a nice and relaxed family so you can chill out in the space provided.
The room is big occupying the whole top floor and has decking on the balcony. Its warm,quiet and comfy with loads of space to hang your clothes or store your luggage. You also get a private toilet,bath,shower.,,
Getting around is easy too as the bus goes from the next street every 10 minutes to the centre of town and theres a metro stop about 10 minutes walk. Boston is really small so you can also just grab an UBER for really cheap.,,,,,
Theres good shops,bars and restaurants all very local too .,,,,

Jesse was a very helpful host and answered all our questions regarding local transport. The location is excellent with a range of local eateries. It is just a bus ride away from Copley Square and a 10 minute walk to the local subway, which is inexpensive and easy to navigate. We thoroughly enjoyed Boston and found this an ideal base from which to explore the city."

The room is lovely--bright,spacious,and clean,with a lovely roofdeck (which would be especially great in warm weather) and a private bathroom. Though it doesn't have a private entrance,the layout of their home allows you to come and go easily and not worry about disturbing anyone,even when you come home late (as we did after our friends' wedding).
The location is quite convenient -- a short cab ride to South Station,a 10-15 minute walk to the red line,and an easy walk to all of the great restaurants and shops that Southie has to offer.,,,
I would definitely recommend Jesse's apartment for a visit to Boston,especially if you need easy access to the Convention Center,South Station,"or Southie!\"",,

The apartment is very comfortable and I can not think of anything we might have required that was not available. The location of the apartment,as described,is close (three minutes walk) to the subway about six stops to Downton Crossing which is the station from where we started our explorations.,,,

9463444,80201535,2016-06-16,34920069,Sara,"The best air bnb experience I have had! Sarah, the appartment and JP as a place were all superb! Sarah left lots of food and drink for us and made us feel so at home. The appartment is beautifully quaint and couldn't be closer to the subway. Perfect for exploring Boston! Could not recommend highly enough!"
9463444,81403542,2016-06-22,41739596,Rimantas,"Sarah gave us very clear instructions for arrival and lots of useful tips for finding our way around Boston and sightseeing. The apartment was exactly as we expected, really comfortable, well stocked up to the last small detail. It is located in a green quiet neighborhood near a beautiful park and pond. Subway station just a couple hundred meters away, very easy to reach the centre. Some restaurants within walking distance. Highly recommended."
9463444,82253319,2016-06-27,65082859,Jackie,"Staying at Sarah's was a great experience. Not only was it incredibly close to the subway, so very convenient, but she was a great host. Sarah was really easy to coordinate with, the apartment was very clean and comfortable, she left visitor information about Boston for us and even had breakfast foods available! She was easy to get a hold of and ready with recommendations and directions on how to get around town. We can't recommend this apartment highly enough. Also, the proximity to transit made it so easy to get around. Being 2 minutes from a subway stop was great."
A few practical things: the internet was good,water pressure great,air conditioning kept the apartment a nice temperature and be prepared for a few flights of stairs.,,,
Overall - it is a lovely,convenient,well equipped unit,"with a top notch host! I would gladly stay again and wholeheartedly recommend anyone who is visiting Boston to stay here too.\"",,

El apartamento está en la parte alta de un edificio de 3 plantas. Es acogedor y tiene todo lo necesario.,,,,,
Tiene wi-fi,tele por cable,cocina con electrodomésticos,aire acondicionado,lectura y música en gran cantidad. Aunque es zona de parking restringido,Sarah nos indicó un par de calles a menos de 10 min. andando
Lo mejor de todo,es que tienes una linea de metro naranja a menos de 5 min. andando que hace que te plantes en el centro de Boston en 20 min.,,,,
También a menos de 10 min. tienes la calle principal de tiendas y restaurantes de la zona.,,,,,
En resumen,volveríamos a repetir sin problema.,,,,

She showed us around the place and made us feel so at home. We had everything we needed - including coffee, snacks, yummy breakfast items like scones and even a bottle of wine! The neighborhood is just beautiful and the apt is only a couple blocks from the subway and to the main road (Centre street) in the area. Sarah had some great food recommendations and fun things to do. She was super helpful and I would recommend her place to anyone. We would definitely stay here again!"

Communication with Sarah was exceptionally easy, and information she provided very accurate.  The unit itself is cozy and comfortable.  The studio feels home-like but is also very clean, so you don't feel like you're intruding on your host's life.  Sarah had great food and (homemade?) muffins available for our use during our stay.  I couldn't recommend this booking enough.  Thanks so much Sarah!"

She is truly a 5-star host... she thought of every little detail... from the breakfast items she left out for us in the morning, to the chocolates on top of our towels, it was truly better than staying at a hotel! Sarah was incredibly responsive leading up to the stay, met us at her apartment upon our arrival, and made sure we were completely comfortable with everything before leaving."
The pictures don't even do this place justice-- it has such character! The apartment is packed with fascinating vintage trinkets that are a joy to look at. Plus,the bed is VERY comfortable. If you have a chance to stay here,"definitely do!!\"",,,

The train is under a five minute walk and maybe 15 mins to the center of Boston. Very easy to navigate and cheap rides. In the home she left us everything we could have possibly needed and more. The bed was very comfy and the home was so cute. I'm so glad I found this place. It was the best value I could have found in Boston. I would definitely book again with Sarah, she was extremely friendly and helpful."

Their place is I believe on prime spot, walking distance to Quincy market, mikes pastry is literally across, Paul revere's house and many more. I enjoyed my stay, tom and Romulo were available if you need anything and tom let me drop my stuff early so I can explore the city. Overall great experience for my first air bnb. I would recommend this place to anyone."
6801288,68147099,2016-04-02,44034909,Jim,What a beautiful section of little Italy to stay!  Right around the back of the building is a lovely area with tables and old cobblestone to sit and pretend your in Italy.
Tom met me at 5:00 there to bring me up to the apartment. he offered to give me the keys earlier if I wanted to stop by his work to meet him (about a mile away I think).  The place had no off smells and was pretty clean. The bed was big enough for two people and he even had silk pillow cases! I am a light sleeper but even though Tom snored a little here and there,I slept very well.,,,,
Here are my only issues; the bathroom is pretty small,and there are no hooks to hang your stuff or even a towel. So I draped my towel over the little sink (that had no stopper- so if I dropped a ring or contact lens it would be gone).   And the other small issue was that there was no toilet paper holder installed- there was one at one time (as there are brackets on the wall) but I was informed that it was before Tom rented the place a year ago. So the roll sits on the back of the toilet tank. I also asked Tom for a washcloth and he had none to offer. So I used a hand towel he gave me to wash myself.,,,,
I spread my stuff out on the window sill at the foot of the bed and dried out my towel by draping it over the bed as there were no rods of hooks anywhere.  Also,I am suspicious that the sheets were not cleaned between guests as there was what felt like dirt or a little sand under the sheets.,,,,
Anyway,"all minor issues and I was glad that I could stay until 4:00 pm the following day before a new guest arrived. \"",,,,

9860,316783,2011-06-15,653194,Rebecca,"The good thing is the location.  It's literally right next to the Commons and close to shops.  The apartment itself needs a serious overhaul.  I was in 4F and it was a LOT of stairs to get there and very tough with heavy luggage.  There's no elevator.  Inside the apartment you realize how misleading the pictures are-it is in SERIOUS need of updating.  It is old and 70's like.  Not warm and homey.  The kitchen has the oldest appliances I have ever seen.  The tv is old and small, there's an air conditioning unit in the living room but not the bedroom-probably hot at night in the summer.  Just didn't like the place."

9860,8731710,2013-11-14,9586179,Rachel,"\"Pros - Beautiful location, right next to Public Garden and Back Bay shopping.   100 times better than staying in the Copley Sq area.  Very quaint, charming and I felt like I was \"\"at home\"\". Easy walking distance to pastry shops and restaurants in Beacon Hill"
Cons - extremely noisy building.  Don't get this place if you are intending a romantic or quiet restful vacation. The first night we had toddlers above us banging on things til 11 pm,"and the second night we had 12 college kids playing \"\"quarters\"\" and smoking cigarettes until 2 am.  We had to finally go up there and ask them to pipe down.  Street noise wasn't a problem",it was simply disrespectful neighbors.   Quiet hours and a mechanism to direct nighttime complaints would solve this problem easily.,,,
I would probably stay here again,but my husband said he probably wouldn't.  If the price were lowered by $50 that would be a little more palatable.,,,,

This picture shown, is not necessarily the apt you will get, as was the case with my rental. No fireplace, not as much space. I was 6R sixth floor but there is a small elevator so no problem and the apt was was cute. Plenty of towels and the bed is ok; if you're picky, 6R is not the bed for you."
Here's the negative and the positive:,,,,,
The negative: strong smell of onions hung over the apt and lamp was broken; after s call quickly solved,not s big deal. But here's the bad:The second I arrived a noticed was handed out that the next day the water would be off from 10 am till at least 2 pm. For my purposes the next day,this sucked and was a real issue. It wasn't an emergency situation,but planned.  To find s new place was going to be s drag. I asked the managment company for 1/2 days rate as compensation. They didn't see the problem,were condescending,unfriendly and refused.
Here's the good news: AirBNB totally has your back. They understood completely,quickly agreed and granted the refund.,,,,
The place and location are terrific. If any issue were to arrive,the realtor,"posting the property and the property manager are most unpleasant; a first in my AirBnb experience. AirBNB is still awesome \"",,,

We met Cory outside and he graciously walked us upstairs to their apartment and showed us around the place. The apartment was very nice inside. They left us snacks, beer and water bottles. Danielle had written up a list of restaurant recommendation's for us around the area. They also left fresh towels and even had extra toothbrush's just incase. The rooftop deck was very nice and had a great view of the surrounding area. The walk to Fenway and the subway was very close. Parking can be tough but considering the close proximity to everything this is just a minor inconvenience. Overall Danielle and Cory's place was a great experience and I would recommend their apartment to my closest friends!"
2915595,16140462,2014-07-22,17672680,Catherine,"Can't say enough good things about Danielle, Cory and their apt.  If you are going to Boston to see a Red Sox game, their place is a must.  Comfortable, classy apartment with a gorgeous view of Boston on their awesome deck.  What's even better is that Danielle and Cory are awesome hosts.  They were easy to reach, super helpful, prompt, and generous.  Renting their place was a wonderful experience."

The location is perfect with an incredible roof-top patio.  The AC was helpful in taming the heat.  The location was perfect with grocery stores, and great restaurants within walking distance.  I will definitely stay here again."
2915595,16641597,2014-07-30,18729913,David,"Going to a Red Sox game?  This is the place to stay!  Just perfect!  The listing is spot-on accurate.  It is exceptionally clean and comfortable.  The neighborhood felt very safe and secure.   We had excellent communication with Danielle - before, during, and after our stay.  She was very flexible and able to accommodate our slightly earlier than expected arrival time, which was appreciated as we were coming from Cape Cod, driving, taking public transportation, and walking.  So it was a little tricky trying to establish an accurate ETA.  But she was more than accommodating and we were in constant communication from the very beginning.  The condo has many fantastic and unique features.  The location cannot be beat.  It is equally between to 2 train stops (both very short walks - maybe a block or two).  Fenway park and the surrounding area is also a quick walk and is a very welcome convenience.   The first thing you see when you enter the building is the original working elevator, which adds so much character and style.  The condo is on the 6th floor and is very nicely furnished, clean, comfortable, and very quiet... It felt like we were the only people in the whole building.  In fact, I don't think we ever saw or heard another person while there.  Large windows offer great views from inside the condo, but the real treat is the roof top deck.  It is fantastic, offering beautiful views of Boston and the surrounding neighborhood.  Look around while up there and you'll quickly notice this is a rare feature and a great spot to sit and relax with a few drinks.  Speaking of drinks, the hosts graciously left a selection of beer, wine, snacks and bottles of water.  Can't say enough good things.  Highly recommend!"
2915595,16676470,2014-07-31,17083636,Kathleen,"Very Nice place! We really enjoyed our stay, the view on the rooftop is amazing, Danielle was very nice and she did her best to help us find parking spots around the condo. I recommand this place!"

The whole rental process and communication went very smoothly.   Both were easy to talk to and answered our many questions .The complimentary beverages and snacks were really thoughtful. Grocery store, coffee shop and wine/beer store just a few blocks away.       Location was ideal for Fenway; close to the T-line for getting around town.  The apartment was quiet and well appointed. Rooftop deck was our absolute favourite - great place to relax and unwind after a day of sightseeing and ballgames.  Absolutely perfect - would highly recommend - 5 out of 5 stars!!"
2915595,17623882,2014-08-15,15027836,Brittany,"Our to trip to Boston was spectacular. The condo was just as described. The view from the roof balcony was amazing. Danielle did a great job communicating. She left us tons of info and recommendations for our stay in Boston as well as snacks a bottle of wine, water bottles and other beverages. We went to a game at Fenway. It took us five minutes to walk there. We also explored the area. Public transport was nearby and convenient. If you are heading for Boston for anything I know you would love this place."
2915595,17676092,2014-08-16,15027836,Brittany,Please see my detailed review on this property. Stayed two days but booked separately. Very flexible and helpful with our travel alterations.
2915595,17952962,2014-08-19,9860739,David,"Cory and Danielle's place was fantastic.  I was in town for a conference at BU, and it was a very easy 10 minute walk.  I even walked over to Cambridge, so you can really stay here and go anywhere you want in Boston.  And the place is really neat.  The old school elevator makes you realize you're in an historic building, but the condo itself doesn't feel dated at all.  Everything was clean and the bed quite comfortable.  Even though Danielle and I weren't able to meet up, she communicated throughout the weekend to make sure I had everything I needed. I'm definitely putting this at the top of my list of places to stay when I come to town."

2915595,19132063,2014-09-07,18432313,Archimidis,"First of all, selecting Daniele and Cory's condo to stay in Boston was a very good choice! The condo is located at a very nice area of the city; Boston is smaller that I anticipated, therefore, I could reach (and did reach) Boston downtown on foot many times. Furthermore, Daniele and Cory were helpful and fast replying to our questions regarding the city and sight-seeings. They had even left us a metro card and notes regarding things to know and to do in Boston. Needless to say that the condo was clean and in a good condition! I shouldn't forget to point out the deck on the roof! It was by far the best place to sit after a long warm day."

Wow, what an amazing experience that was way above our expectations. :-D the condo you'll be staying at is cute, comfy, spacious, clean, and has a full kitchen and gorgeous private roof top deck that has 360 Boston city views. The neighborhood is safe, clean, friendly, and convenient as well. We could hop on a train at multiple close locations or cab it easily. We walked quite a bit too. Whole foods is right down the street plus many other stores & restaurants. BU campus close by which gave the neighborhood a nicely diverse & hip vibe since it borders more traditional Brookline."
Now if that wasn't enough,your hosts bend over backwards for you and do it very matter of fact,with genuine smiles and sincere kindness.,,,
Danielle who is a young,energetic,tiny young lady helped  me unload our stuff into her quaint but small elevator for two runs as she sprinted up 6 flights of stairs!! Then she guided us to a safe street parking space that she saved for us,that allowed us to keep parked our entire stay from Thurs to Tues (today).,,
After that she immediately responded to questions I texted her shortly after she left us in the place.,,,,,
Anyway I could go on forever but it's tough typing all this on a tiny phone,lol. Hope there aren't too many typos? ;-),,,,
Thank you both for such a wonderful and affordable  experience!! Who needs hotels anymore?,,,,,

Danielle and Cory were extremely welcoming hosts, leaving lots of advice, and drinks and snacks. There are cafés, bars and restaurants in the area, and the subway is about 5 mins away. There are also bike hire stands over the road which proved a great way to see the city - head to the river and cycle up to town on the cycle path!"
2915595,20117864,2014-09-23,21257008,Ryan,Danielle and Cory's Fenway condo was an excellent place to stay! They were super communicative and helpful with us the entire time leading up to our stay and throughout as we had questions. They were super flexible with check-in and check-out and the place was very comfy/clean/all-around-awesome. We felt completely at home there and would recommend staying there.
2915595,20657947,2014-10-03,20986168,Aaron,"Danielle and Cory were extremely accommodating! They left an incredibly clean condo for us with food, bath towels, and many other little niceties that really made our stay as comfortable as possible. The condo is in an amazing location, in a beautiful building, with an incredible view from the private roof deck. All around amazing experience!"
2915595,22291692,2014-11-03,8003721,Peter,"Danielle and Cory were very hospitable and the listing was exactly as presented.  My stay was very comfortable and all necessary services were easily available.  Great location near the Green line T.  Overall, a great place to stay in the Fenway area."

2915595,22978716,2014-11-19,9814598,Tad,The place was fantastic and very clean. Two minute walk to Fenway Park. Lots of great restaurants close by. Plenty of taxis driving by the front door. The building is classic older Boston. Inside is comfortable and spacious. The Hosts were very gracious and had some bottled water and a few beers in the fridge as well as other snacks in the kitchen for us. The towels were thick and luxurious. The bed was very comfortable with a nice comforter. Wi-Fi worked perfectly. Big screen TV in the living room and another appropriately sized television in the bedroom. The unit is on the top floor so you have great views of the city six floors up. It also insulates you from a lot of the street noise. There is an elevator so you don't have to march up all of the steps.
2915595,23530727,2014-12-03,4950881,Jessica,"Fantastic apartment in a great location. Extremely close to lots of public transportation, a grocery store, and one of my favorite diners (the Busy Bee, two blocks away)."
We didn't meet Danielle and Cory in person,but they were extremely responsive and accessible. The apartment was very clean with plenty of space and all the amenities (fast Wi-Fi,satellite TV,soft towels,etc).,
"The only \"\"downside\"\" was not being able to find a coffee pot",but we donated a French press to the cause.,,,,
"This is an all-around wonderful apartment. \"",,,,,
2915595,25314797,2015-01-12,8003721,Peter,"This was my second stay with Danielle and Cory and as was the case with my first stay, all was as described and very comfortable and convenient."
2915595,25487754,2015-01-17,20692629,John,"The location and condition of the apartment make this listing a wonderful Boston spot to stay. In addition, Cory and Danielle are wonderful hosts who are helpful, highly organized, and approachable. This is a listing that I will certainly use again, and I would not hesitate to recommend to friends and family."
2915595,26922798,2015-02-22,8003721,Peter,I have stayed with Cory and Danielle multiple times and each time is better than the first.
2915595,28022335,2015-03-16,27812810,Simon,"I flew in for a conference and stayed at Danielle + Cory's condo for the weekend leading up to my conference.  The place is exactly as described - comfortable, clean, and located in a great neighborhood close to restaurants, bars, and several T line stations.  My only regret was not booking the place longer for the remainder of my stay in Boston."
"Danielle + Cory were also extremely responsive and I'd say went above and beyond in providing recommendations on things to see and do to - 10/10 would stay here again!\"",,,,,
2915595,28360647,2015-03-22,5085293,Kevin,"Fantastic place, very comfortable and in the middle of everywhere I needed to go. Close to BU campus, Fenway, and just off the train line. I would stay here again in an instant."
2915595,28712980,2015-03-29,27643101,Brandie,Great location in the city and amazing hosts.
2915595,29040286,2015-04-03,26844153,Pat,"Our stay was broken into two parts, so please see review for the April 3 - 5 section of the stay.  It was wonderful and we had a great time!"
2915595,29167774,2015-04-05,26844153,Pat,"Just finished a stay at Danielle & Cory's condo in Boston.  We had a great time and the place was perfectly suited for us!  Lovely, light-filled space, nice kitchen & bath, comfy bed.  Very clean, well-appointed, comfortable and welcoming home.  Our hosts were very flexible and responsive to our needs, questions about Boston, arranging move in and out, leaving local info brochures and helping us really settle in quickly and enjoy our time there."
"The neighborhood is great.  Very short walk (2 blocks) to the \"\"T\"\" public transportation.  Good variety of neighborhood restaurants",Whole Foods market,wine store ... got everything we needed in just a few blocks.,,,
We went up to the rooftop terrace a couple of times to enjoy the sunset and great views of Boston.  A nice escape in the middle of a big city.,,,,,
"We would absolutely go back to Danielle & Cory's condo on our next trip to Boston.  Such a nice place to \"\"come home to\"\" after a busy day.  Thanks!  \"",,,,,
2915595,29559518,2015-04-09,28713405,Julie,"This condo worked very well for us.  We had our two teenage grandsons with us, and Danielle had kindly prepared an air mattress for one and put sheets on it and the sofa.  The kitchen had everything we needed -  we prepared breakfast each morning, and dinner one night.  Perfect location - easy access to the T and grocery store.  The mattress in the bedroom was a bit soft for our taste - but we managed to sleep very well!  The place was clean and neat.  Many thanks to Danielle and Cory!  Have a happy wedding, and a happy marriage!"
2915595,30120086,2015-04-18,23482124,Dawn,Where do I begin?  From my first interaction with Danielle she was so accomodating and went above and beyond what is expected of a host.  She was always very responsive to my questions and needs.  She even took the time to help me with planning my trip on things to do and see in Boston along with recommendations for eating out.  On top of it all - they allowed us to check in early in the morning prior to their work day.  Definitely a TOP NOTCH host!  The location was fabulous - especially if your trip is based on attending Fenway.  The park is a VERY short walking distance from the home as well as the T.  There are plenty of options for eating out along with a couple of options for groceries.  The condo was amazing - it was such a great experience to stay in an historic brownstone and on the top floor with a private deck.  THANK YOU Danielle!
2915595,32065568,2015-05-13,8003721,Peter,Having stayed with Danielle and Cory many times duirng the last two years I can only highly recommend the apartment to anyone who has a desire to stay in the Fenway area with a convenient location in a spacious and clean environment.
2915595,32489733,2015-05-19,22381695,Bob,"Danielle & Cory made us feel very welcome and answered any & all questions we had about transportation, restaurants, etc.  Their home was so convenient and close to everything and exceeded our expectations!  Would recommend their home to anyone going to Boston!!"
2915595,33220487,2015-05-26,25624395,Debra,From the moment we entered Danielle and Cory's we felt at home. The apartment was spacious and well appointed. We stayed for six nights and cooked all but one night- access to Whole Foods and Star Market were most convenient. Access to two nearby T stations made getting around Boston a breeze. The couch was as described in their description- so comfortable for relaxing and chilling out after a hard day touring. Make sure you visit Wine Press just opposite the St Mary St T stop- excellent wine and beer selection.  If we return to Boston this would be our place of choice to stay again.
2915595,34395498,2015-06-08,7475293,Irene,"Nous avons passé 4 jours très agréables chez Danielle et Cory. L'appartement etait très agréable, lumineux, et chaleureux. Nous avons particulièrement apprécié le roof top, et l'ascenseur qui fonctionnait parfaitement, bien qu'un peu dur à manier. Localisation centrale. Le métro est à moins de 5 minutes et vous pourrez encourager les Red Socks au Fenway Park tout à côté."
Danielle et Cory ont rendu l'arrivée et le départ extrêmement faciles,même si nous ne les avons pas vus. Le mot de bienvenue était présent,il manquait juste un petit book contenant quelques renseignements pratiques sur l'appartement et le voisinage,"qui nous aurait fait gagner un peu de temps à l'arrivée. Mais nous reviendrons avec plaisir.\"",,
2915595,35198280,2015-06-16,27440032,Eric,At the moment we first contacted Danielle and Cory regarding their condo we knew we were making a good decision.  The check in process was a breeze.  Their condo is in great condition and the rooftop deck made me not want to leave.  The location was perfect for my wife and I.  I am a big baseball fan and the condo is about 3 blocks away from Fenway Park.  A couple of the nights we would sit on the rooftop deck and listen to the crowds reaction to know how the game was going.
There are multiple T stops within walking distance so that makes getting around the city relatively easy.  Also,because of their location there are many Uber drivers that hang around that area as well.,,,,
"We had a great time in Boston and would recommend their condo to anyone who was thinking of traveling to Boston as well.\"",,,,,
2915595,41578205,2015-08-08,29185583,Kim,"Absolutely loved the condo! Very comfortable & clean. Roof top deck was amazing. Location was key for us. Five minutes to Fenway, green line station right behind the condo, Target close for necessities & Staples for boarding passes. We would recommend this condo to anyone!"
2915595,47952623,2015-09-22,25905340,Lucy,We really enjoyed our stay in Boston. The apartment is lovely and is in a fantastic location. You can walk into Back Bay easily and there are plenty of grocery shops in the vicinity.
2915595,48503952,2015-09-27,2483316,Davis,"Danielle and Cory's place was just as described, and immaculate. Would definitely stay here again!"
2915595,49871505,2015-10-06,45777116,Cody,The host canceled this reservation 58 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2915595,50268495,2015-10-11,32630455,Shenaed,"Our first Airbnb experience, couldn't of asked for a nicer place to relax after a long flight. Did not meet the hosts in person but the instructions that were emailed to us were very clear and concise. Danielle was very responsive via email answering any questions we had prior to our arrival in Boston. Maps and restaurant menus for the local area were left out for us to use which were extremely helpful. Subway close by for trips into Boston City. Very cosy, tidy, and comfortable place to stay in a hip location. Would highly recommend for anyone thinking of heading to Boston"
2915595,51940589,2015-10-25,44693407,Daniel,"This was our first AirBnB experience and it could not have been a better introduction. Danielle and Cory were kind, responsive, gracious and attentive hosts and their apartment was immaculate, yet homey, warm and welcoming."
2915595,51988653,2015-10-25,43801470,Matthew,The host canceled this reservation 268 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2915595,64694906,2016-03-06,60832254,Patrick,This was an amazing first Airbnb experience! I could not have asked for better hosts. Danielle and Cory were incredibly accommodating and responsive. Check in and check out couldn't have gone more smoothly. The condo itself met and exceeded all expectations and was in pristine condition upon arrival. Easy access to the subway made getting around Boston super convenient. I would very happily stay here again!
2915595,73413623,2016-05-08,19248143,Carol,"Danielle and Cory were very attentive hosts.  They made several inquiries via email and txt before we arrived, to aid in our weekend convenience.  We made one request for two more guests to join us mid weekend.  They were so accommodating to us that they put out extra pillows, blankets and an extra bottle of wine. (The guests unfortunately could not join us at the last minute because of a family emergency).  The access to the secure building was seamless.  The internet was fast and the TV accessed many channels.  The neighborhood of Brookline is delightful with many great restaurants.    The location was so perfect for us, within walking distance to our destination at the BU school of Fine Arts.  The top floor condo with a roof top deck and great view of Fenway, in an old,  but well kept Boston brownstone was very homey.  They apologized in advance for some work being done in the apt next door, but we were never bothered by it.   We were so comfortable that we did not even mind the perpetual rain all weekend.  Danielle and Cory made so many little details to make us feel like we were welcome in our own home.  I wish them all the best and will definitely stay with them in the future when we revisit Boston.  We love your place!"

2915595,74745852,2016-05-16,57743879,Bianca,"Cory and Danielle's place was perfect for the weekend we spent at Fenway park.  I would highly recommend their place for future trips. The apartment was nice and cozy and nicely decorated. Loved the whole Boston feel to it. I appreciated so much the open communication and availability Danielle and Cory accommodated for us. We loved the roof deck so much. Amazing view of the city around. All in all, my 1st Airbnb experience was great!"
2915595,87005425,2016-07-18,52651188,Ryan,Great place.  Roof deck is bitchin! Very clean.  What sets this apart is the owners.  I left my $16k Rolex there and they sent it back.  So honest
2915595,88608005,2016-07-25,27219793,Barbara,"Danielle and Cory were great hosts! Their home is just a block or two from Fenway and near multiple T stops. It's also near some great restaurants. Though we didn't meet in person, they were great communicators (speedy and thorough in their replies). They also went above and beyond by offering free Fenway tour tickets they had acquired, use of anything they had in the fridge, and early checkin. They directed us to great street parking, which saved us a ton! The rooftop is a great bonus! We loved spending our mornings and evenings relaxing there. The whole place is comfortable and cozy, including the couch, which was actually great to sleep on."
14429876,93361292,2016-08-12,13006614,Mustafa,"Nirmal was a great host, friendly, available when needed and was really flexible with arriving time as It was getting pretty late when I checked in. Plus, he took the time to show me some places to visit. I would recommend to anyone traveling solo with the intent to rent a room for a short period of time."
14429876,94858168,2016-08-17,61849527,Lia,"Nirmal's a gentle and helpful host! He responds every message so fast and very accommodated with check-in/out time. The apartment has a great location, next to the beautiful waterfront,  within 10 mins walk to the North Sation and Green/Orange line, and walking distance to the heart downtown area. As for the room, the place is clean and what you see is what it is, nice spot for short time travelers."

13994056,92883728,2016-08-10,20914138,Carah,"Filipe was very good at communication prior our stay.  He let me know that any time was a good time to check in.  My boyfriend and I caught a bus down to Boston because we were in the city for the Red Sox game.  We came in, met Filipe, got the room key and we were gone the rest of the day until after the game.  The bedroom was comfortable, clean and welcoming.  It was warm in the room, but there was a fan that made it very comfortable.  This stay was perfect for what we were looking for (a place to crash after the game close to Fenway).  We were up early and out before anyone woke up, but many thanks to Filipe and his wife for hosting!"
13994056,93626343,2016-08-13,69579643,Justin,Filipe was a great host. Provided towels and soap which was a huge help. He was always nearby if we had any issues. Would book again.
13994056,94648536,2016-08-16,1898356,New,The host is a very nice couple who were very warm and welcoming. This is a one bed room condo on the basement level. You will live in the bedroom and the couple will live in the living room which is not very private. It is better to know this before booking. We only stayed there for one night. Thank you Airbnb for refunding the other two day's rental fee.

54215,2749053,2012-10-29,3659271,April,We had a very enjoyable stay at the Fenway Triangle Trilogy.  The 2 bedroom apartment was much larger than we expected and was very comfortable.  Our apartment (#353) partly faced the inner courtyard and partly faced Kilmarnock Street.  The side that faced Kilmarnock Street was at times a little noisy from the traffic on Bolyston street but overall it was an acceptable noise level.  The location of the apartment was perfect for our purposes being somewhere between the Longwood and the Backbay area (walkable to both).  The service we received from Seamless was professional and very smooth.  We requested a crib to be placed in our apartment which was indeed in our apartment on arrival. We would definitely use Seamless' services again.
54215,4798408,2013-05-27,4113439,Susan,"We actually ended up staying at Landmark Square in Boston and it was great! Clean and very conveniently located. The only thing I would have added to the apartment were more of the basic staples for shared use such as salt and pepper and perhaps a few more cooking supplies such as bowls, etc. Irina was wonderful in answering all questions and helping us transition into the apartment. I would definitely use Airbib again in locating a short term living space....."

Everything was as described and their place was very clean and comfortable. The location was about 3 blocks from the t stop and I would definitely stay here again when I come back to Boston.  The neighborhood had plenty of little convenient stores for the small purchases, but we really didn't spend too much time near the place because there is so much to do in Boston."
3953472,29884629,2015-04-13,1364208,Roland,"Great place. Very spacious, much more than I even needed. The decor of the apartment was very nice and modern. The kitchen has everything you would need as I cooked a few meals during my stay. The location is decent too - only about an 7 mile walk to the nearest train station. Nathan and Kathryn were extremely easy to communicate with and I highly recommend them as AirBnb hosts. Thanks for a great stay. The hedgehog was fun to play with too."
3953472,30441865,2015-04-22,13691338,Kim,"Nathan and Kathryn were super friendly and came back to our questions asap.

Their house was nicely decorated and in a good location for our needs. We were so sad to learn that their adorable hedgehog would be on vacation somewhere else during our stay!! But we did enjoy the cute hedgehog decorations in the home!
3953472,37998233,2015-07-12,32774709,Marita,We stayed with a family of 5 in Nathan and Kathryns place. It was our first reservation with Airbnb and we enjoyed staying at their clean condo.
Nathan and Kathryn were not around when we stayed,but they informed us before we arrived and left us also some information upon arrival so it was all very clear.,,,,
The apartment is on walking distance from a metro station,and within 30 minutes we were from their apartment into Boston central.,,,,

The instructions Nathan and Kathryn left us were spotless and very helpful. We especially enjoyed a wide range of board games to choose from, the piano in the living room and of course our lovely housemate Llizi the hedgehog. I would recommend it to anyone!"

6602217,50743352,2015-10-14,2343293,Christie,"A great apartment!  Very conveniently located, safe area, clean, lots and lots of pillows, blankets and towels.  Full, well equipped kitchen, good sized bath with an excellent shower.  Both beds very comfortable.  Washer and drier right outside the kitchen door.  This is a basement apartment (however, fairly light) so cell phone reception is poor if you have Verizon.  Good internet connection."
Miriam and her husband were responsive and helpful.,,,,,
"Highly recommend this apartment!\"",,,,,
6602217,51698669,2015-10-24,12702406,Brian,Lovely little space with a wonderfully appointed kitchen.  The main bed was great (didn't use the pullout) and having two televisions was quite nice.
The area is super nice and safe and it was great being able to walk to the nearby parks or the orange and green T line stops.,,,,,
"Both Miriam and her husband were absolutely pleasant and very accommodating.\"",,,,,
6602217,52232720,2015-10-27,44177646,Paul,The apartment was clean and pleasant. Exactly what our family needed. Miriam was very pleasant and greeted us when we arrived. Everything we expected and no surprises!

There's a Whole Food close by and a Stop&shop too.It was convenient regarding public transportation,"the closest station being at 10 minutes by walk approximately.  \"",,,,
6602217,54314733,2015-11-18,31322649,Sammy,Miriam was a great host who quickly responded to all our questions and helped out with extra bedding for our daughter so she would be comfortable. The apartment is accurately reflected by the photos and was great for our short stay in Boston.
6602217,54901057,2015-11-25,25262310,Gaon,She was so nice that she provides every information for our stay in Boston. The house was cozy and the bed was comfortable. Bathroom had lots of towles.
6602217,63772296,2016-02-27,30016411,Jimens,"Miriam and her husband were very welcomed. We rented her apartment for three months. In these period they treat us like her own family. My son loved the backyard. The house is very cozy, comfortable, there are a lot of pillows just to feel as in your own home."
Everything you need is near to the apartment: supermarket,bus station,subway,restaurants,etc.,
The street is super safe,even during the dawn.,,,,

6602217,64285380,2016-03-02,50581571,Sharon,We were welcomed by her husband who was very helpful with information about the neighborhood. Gave good direction to get around. Pictures are accurate although I thought it had an upstairs but it was a basement apartment.
6602217,64535588,2016-03-05,43848738,Hasina,"Our host makes us feel great. He showed us all the basment: 1 room with 2 bed, 1 small and 1 qeen size, very confortable and 1 caouch for 2 un thé living room. Big kitchen with all tools you need. All comoditee around the house: sunbway, food, alcool store. It's spanish neighborhood really apriciate!"
6602217,65106883,2016-03-10,61657176,Steve,I was greeted by Miriam's husband who gave me a great mini tour of the apartment. He took the time to highlight the amenities as well as answer any questions I had. The apartment was impeccably clean and while it was located in the basement of the building the windows allowed sunlight to stream in throughout the day making the space warm and inviting. The well equipped kitchen and ample seating made it easy to prepare meals which saved us from eating out each meal while visiting Boston. We were even able to park off street next to the building which came in handy as on street parking can be hit or miss at certain times of the day. As for public transit? Getting to the Orange line of the T is a nice walk through an area filled with small places to eat as well as passing by a Stop 'N Shop grocery store. The Green line is in the other direction but you'll want to make sure you have cash or passes before you go that way as it's an on street trolley stop that lacks a Charlie Card machine. The walk to that station takes you by the VA hospital and is a bit shorter than heading to the Orange line. Overall I highly recommend this listing as it's very nice as are the hosts!
6602217,66152633,2016-03-20,52804873,Megan,"The host was incredibly nice and the listing matched exactly as we hoped. We were even surprised to find they had stocked the fridge with some bagels, water, and cream cheese. The kitchen is fully equipped which was really nice to save us some money not eating out. They even provide basic spices, sugar, coffee, etc."

Almost everything was supplied for breakfast. The apartment was very clean and well heated. Above all, the area was very well connected with downtown Boston with the trolley green line."
6602217,69110168,2016-04-09,43728105,Joseph,The unit was clean and the host was communicative. It was perfect for our stay. I highly recommend you stay here.
6602217,69210188,2016-04-10,18648198,Amanda,"Great place to stay in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood. A friend and I arrived late for a one night stay in Boston before traveling south of Boston. We were very pleased with this cute, clean basement apartment, which surprisingly got great sunlight! The host was even kind enough to have water bottles, bagels and cream cheese, as well as coffee and bathroom products. I'd highly recommend and would stay again in the future."

We only stayed 1 night for a ball game but I highly recommend her, my fiancee is an OCD neat freak, he was skeptical & it totally won him over!  From the cleanliness to the Starbucks coffee, it was a great experience. The place is a bit of a hike to the T but well worth it & not a bad walk."

Kitchen well equipped, as was the bathroom with tons of towels and nice touches like extra toothpaste if you forgot yours. Miriam and her husband were friendly and welcoming, and helpful. Apartment is in a convenient location, within walking distance of grocery stores, good restaurants and on a quiet street. Easy access to Boston, Cambridge etc."
6602217,74169115,2016-05-13,49806930,Michelle,"Miriam was very helpful in communicating and answered my texts very quickly. Check in was at two pm, but I had a commitment at that time so I was able to set it up so my mom would check in with one of my kids (we were four guests; two adults and two young kids)  instead. A plus was that Miriam speaks Spanish, which also made it easier for my mom to arrive in my place. The unit was tidy and half of it was below street level. The kitchen area and bathroom were spacious and there were two beds and a couch that also folded out into another bed. The kitchen had coming utensils and there were enough towels in the bathroom as well. The on-site Landry was also right outside the kitchen and Miriam let my mom use some of her detergent. My mom also told me that Miriam brought down some bagels and orange juice for us. Finally, the area was very nice. There is a market right and the corner and there are also parks nearby. Overall, our stay at Miriam's was enjoyable, affordable and we would stay at this place again if we returned to the Boston area."
6602217,74387227,2016-05-15,51269778,Bill,"We were instructed to find the key in the mailbox, but to get to the mailbox we needed to go through a gate in the fence and then inside the front door, where there was a warning about dogs. I needed to call the host to figure out where it was. The basement apartment was smaller than expected, the floors seemed sticky, and it was just old. The neighborhood was OK - access to mass transit was about a 10 minute walk. The exterior of the house was not inviting. We were hoping that for only a little less than a Hotel room we would have gotten a little more, but that was not the case."

The coffee, bagels and OJ were so nice to have from Miriam. We took the orange and green line trains in to sight see in Boston, nearest stops were a short 9 minute walk from the apt. We had very good Cuban food near the house too in JPlains."

It's in the Latin Quarter and that came with its charm and concerns.  It's close enough to the train to get into the city easily (1/2 mile walk to the station) and a few blocks away from a Whole Foods for groceries.  Great bathroom shower!  The kitchen, though we didn't use it much, was well appointed.  There is also a daycare on-site, which surprised us, but was not particularly disruptive."

It wasn't crazy special but it absolutely was a great place to stay for the price. The tub/shower is awesome!! Unfortunately, I didn't have time to take a bath in the great tub! Kevin was available, except for when he misplaced his phone, understandably.  The room is on the first floor which is nice if you have a bit of luggage. The house is three blocks away from the Stony Brook T stop on the Orange line, which is perfect if you're wanting to visit downtown Boston and is quick to get to from train stations and the airport (taxi isn't necessary)."

9212213,71590232,2016-04-26,16474561,Brian,"I would definitely recommend the Music Box to anyone who wants an awesome, affordable place to stay at while visiting Boston. Kevin spent more than enough time giving us tips on where to go for entertainment, food, and so on. He even documented it all in a (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) drive so that we could refer to it throughout our stay. Sadly, with all his recommendations, there was almost too much to do so we weren't able to jam/hang with Kevin as much we would have liked. He's a very sociable and interesting person with lots to talk about. I learned a LOT of new things on this trip just by chatting with him."
The location (Jamaica Plains) was great. A bit less than a 5 minute walk away from the Stony Brook T station that will take you straight to the heart of Boston. Jamaica Plains itself was a very cool neighborhood; quiet,but there were tons of cool restaurants,bars,etc to hit up,all of which Kevin documented for us!,
"Kevin definitely went out of his way to make our experience enjoyable. \"",,,,,
9212213,72258173,2016-05-01,9018736,Alexandra,Was a short stay but Kevin was very thoughtful and made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.  Nice room in good location.
9212213,73209741,2016-05-07,8128681,Polina,"The house is in a very quiet neighborhood and the room is ideal for good night sleep. The metro station is literally 5 min walking and the orange line goes straight downtown. We didn't say much to Kevin as we were all day in downtown Boston, however, he was very flexible with check in/out and took for a ride with his car the first day (as it was raining) to show us the main Boston monuments. Overall a nice experience."
"\"",,,,,
9212213,74762393,2016-05-16,33251753,Elerine,Kevin was very friendly and helpful as a host! His apartment is also conveniently located near to a metro station and Whole Foods (supermarket).
9212213,75649132,2016-05-22,59376312,Tisa,Cool dude!!  Fancy bathroom.
9212213,76413784,2016-05-27,5960599,Maggie,"Kevin was a great host! We required some last minute changes to our arrival time and Kevin was very accommodating. The house itself was easy to locate and in an ideal location. JP has a lot to offer, in terms of dining and general galavanting, but the house was a little ways off centre street (away from evening noise)."
The Music Box had the listed amenities (bathroom access,kitchen access,towels,etc) and Kevin was quick to offer anything else we needed (such as a fan on one particularly hot evening).,,
As a host and person,"Kevin was a great! I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone looking to explore a new neighborhood in Boston. I look forward to returning to the Music Box at a future date.\"",,,,
9212213,76758124,2016-05-29,60209789,Lily,"Kevin was a great host! My friend and I were in Boston for a music festival, so we didn't have a ton of free time, but he was very friendly and the room was perfect. The location is really incredible and easy to navigate around, and we couldn't believe how easy the parking was for a city. Had an awesome time!"

"\"\"Alejandra was the nicest host I've met on Airbnb. She's communicative",kind and always available. Her pets are adorable and very nice. The place is clean and cute,not too close to the subway but I don't mind a little walking.,,,
"She left me a welcome message and apparently this was her first experience with airbnb. I hope it was as good for her as it was for me.\"\"\"",,,,,
4588530,29362476,2015-04-06,30378736,Chris,"Most perfect location to enjoy romantic streets, parks & townhouses of Boston's historic, diverse, red brick South End - steps away from several of city's best neighborhood restaurants, bakeries & bars - close to BU Medical and Back Bay schools - fabulous!"
Home well pictured & described perfectly - wonderfully clean,neat & relaxed - super pleasant with great old tub! Very homey,quiet & safe,,,
And hostess Alejandra - warm,welcoming,enthusiastic - made it feel like we were staying at a friend's!,,,
Highly recommended,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
4588530,33116756,2015-05-25,31274932,Jen,The hosts made us feel very welcome from the beginning. The communication was perfect and we got into the apartment with no problems.
The apartment is clean,comfortable,and has everything anyone could want for their stay. They also have a very sweet cat who loves to cuddle. The neighborhood is beautiful,safe,and also quiet. I slept on the couch near the street window and had no problems falling asleep at all. The neighborhood is filled with cute places to eat,and is also close to many different transportation options.
"We had a great stay and I highly recommend their apartment to anyone planning a trip to Boston!\"",,,,,
4588530,36570636,2015-06-29,10955027,Bob,"Excellent location in the heart of the South End.  Caring for the cat was a welcome chore, she's very affectionate - a welcoming committee."
4588530,37428487,2015-07-06,34281285,Frank J,"Excellent location in Boston! Alejandra was great! She made herself available the entire trip, and the apartment was just as she described. Couldn't ask for a better host!"
4588530,45485345,2015-09-03,34071739,Marc,"We can't recommend this enough! The location was perfect and the apartment was lovely and felt like home. Lily was an adorable little housemate and was a breeze to look after, it was nice having a cat around. Alejandra was excellent with her communication and made sure we were enjoying ourselves and made herself very available. If ever we come to Boston again we would not hesitate to stay again."
4588530,46161463,2015-09-08,1793195,Elizabeth,We had a lovely time. The apartment is even nicer than the photos show. It's also in an amazing location. Alejandra is a great host and super helpful. Would very much recommend staying here.
4588530,48724898,2015-09-28,8836739,Dustin,"Alejandra's home was absolutely lovely. My friend and I shared the AirBnB - she took the bed, which I hear was quite comfortable, and I crashed on the couch, which was immensely comfortable itself (as was the oversize chair). It's clear that she's put a ton of work into decorating the space and making it feel as comfortable as possible. Bathroom and kitchen are charming and spotless and well-appointed as well. And then there's Lily, the cat, the best roommate you could ask for - if you're a cat person, you'll be very, very glad you chose this apartment. Location was great, The South End was an area I hadn't explored in Boston before and I'm so glad I did - felt like really living in the city as opposed to holing up in a stereotypical  touristy spot. Great restaurants up on Tremont Street, easy access to cabs and public transport via Washington Street, and a cute/friendly neighborhood in between. Honestly, I give it all an unqualified recommendation. Also, Alejandra herself was a great host - friendly and perfectly communicative - it really felt like another person at the end of the texts/emails, which I think is so important."
4588530,51948807,2015-10-25,45368033,Valerie,Alejandra and her place were wonderful!  Everything was exactly as described and her cat Lily was such a lovely house companion!!  I couldn't have asked for a better first time both using this service and staying in Boston.
4588530,55516298,2015-12-01,34404238,Paarth,Had a lot of fun. Very well located. Perfect for 2-3 people. Nicely decorated and furnished. All essentials provided. Will definitely go again when vacationing in Boston.

13414159,83321240,2016-07-02,78342137,Greg,"We could not have asked for a better place to stay while our family explored Boston. It is just a few blocks to the Freedom Trail, USS Constitution, and Bunker Hill monument. This two-story condo is in a good neighborhood and included garage parking. It is clean, neat, and safe. Chorm provided excellent info and answered all our questions about checking in  and out of the unit. We highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a convenient, spacious, and affordable location to stay while in Boston."
13414159,84045563,2016-07-05,61324221,Jian,"We enjoyed our stay at Chorm's place very much.  The condo is located at the beautiful waterfront of Boston.  Both the condo and the environment are very pleasant.  Furnishing at the condo is very home-like and comfortable, matching the description (and thus our expectation) nicely.  The waterfront is very pleasant, with beautiful board walk for adults and new/exciting playgrounds for kids.  The close proximity to Navy Yard, Science museum and Boston downtown makes the excursion time short.  We enjoy having all the excitement at city while a peaceful stay when we come back to the condo to relax."
"Both Chorm and his agent are very easy to access.  They helped prepare our trip so well that we encountered no problem before or during the rental.\"",,,,,
13414159,86148344,2016-07-15,37732978,Lily,Chorm was very responsive via messaging and friendly. The booking process was smooth and my family said they enjoyed the stay. :)

Quiet building and neighborhood close to the water and the navy yard and walking distance to a few restaurants, a convenience store, Dunkin Donuts and playgrounds.

Small pier and park close to behind the building where you can sit and watch planes take off from across the river. $5 Uber ride to busy nightlife area. Hubway (bike rental) is 30 second walk from back of building. Central air, hot water and water pressure were all great. The bed in the master was so comfortable!! Really loved this place. It was truly a home away from home."

L'appartement est extrêmement bien situé (à l'extrêmité de la Freedom trail - A moins de 10 minutes à pied de l'USS Constitution), au calme, dans une résidence agréable et sécurisée qui possède en plus une place de parking intérieure. Nous avons passé un séjour très agréable. L'appartement est bien équipé, confortable et possède une belle décoration. Nous n'avons pas rencontré Chorm, mais Pablo nous a communiqué toutes les informations complémentaires extrêmement rapidement."

Charlestown ist ein sehr gepflegtes und sicheres Viertel. Eine große Küche und ein gemütliches Wohnzimmer sind unten und oben gibt es zwei angenehm große Schlafzimmer (gute Betten) und zwei Badezimmer (guter Duschstrahl).  Netflix und Amazon Prime verfügbar. Die Wohnung ist sehr sauber, modern und stilvoll eingerichtet und verfügt über eine effektive Klimaanlage. Wir hätten sogar in der Tiefgarage parken können. Es war sicherlich die beste Unterkunft, die wir hatten. Des Weiteren ist zu erwähnen, dass die Wohnung sehr nah an dem Ende des Freedom Trails vorbeiführt. Wir sind zu Fuß in die historische Altstadt gelaufen (ca. 25 Minuten). Die Unterkunft liegt in der Nähe des Flughafens, aber wir haben keinen Fluglärm wahrgenommen. Wir fanden es richtig schade, dass wir abreisen mussten!"
Vielen Dank an die hervorragenden Gastgeber! Auf jeden Fall empfehlenswert!,,,,,

3032367,16270415,2014-07-24,17834564,Kyle,This was my first time using airbnb and my experience was far better than I expected it would be. Liz was an incredibly friendly and receptive host and we couldn't have been happier with the room. I would highly recommend her to anyone wanting to visit the historic north end of Boston and look forward to utilizing this site again for future trips.

The apartment was lovely and spacious, very clean, and is in a great location - right in the heart of Little Italy with loads of great restaurants and bakeries right around the corner and walkable to everything we wanted to see in Boston. The room was very nice with both air con and fan which were needed after the sweaty hike up the stairs! (Definitely worth the effort though). The bed was so comfy I have to include it in my review. We had never used airbnb before but will definitely use it more now! Thanks again for everything Elizabeth!"

It was a very comfortable staying there in a wonderful flat with a great look onto the town. The description of the flat is absolut correct. The place, little Italy, is perhabs to be in Boston, we loved. It it is near to Christoph Columbus Park at the waterside. The Quincy Market isn’t so far."

It's a 4th floor walk-up, and we're in our early 70s, but it was no real problem.  It's easy to get from the Blue Line (along Hanover St.) to her place on Fleet St.  We even walked the mile from Elizabeth's place to the Boston Transportation Center, where we got Megabus to Portland, Maine.   Restaurants abound.   Elizabeth also provided us with amenities to make a breakfast."

The apartment was clean and spacious, and located in a great neighborhood (the North End) that was full of restaurants and bars, just off the main street (Hanover). The subway stop was just a short walk, so it was easy to get all around the city. Elizabeth had a helpful list of activities when we arrived, water, and snacks in our room and left us more for our road trip on the day we left. We didn't see each other much since we were out site-seeing all day, but in enjoyed our conversations in passing - she is a very kind and friendly host. Highly recommended!"

The apartment was bigger than I expected, clean, and Liz was an excellent host.

Wish I could have stayed longer. I'll be sure to return if I'm back in Boston."
3032367,23737195,2014-12-08,12569792,Lara,Liz was a very gracious hostess. She was readily available to answer any of our questions about the area and had an incredible resting spot ready for us. The space felt very private and like we could move about the bed and bathrooms without getting in her space. Great views of the Boston/North End skyline. Highly Recommend.

Although I haven't met Liz, I have to say that she is very friendly and thoughtful with her directions, recommendations and advice. As soon as I walked in Liz's house, I felt like home. Her apartment is clean and organized. The location is great - nearby the water, walking distance to downtown and surrounded by many delicious restaurants, pastries and cafes. I recommend Liz and I would definitely stay at her place again the next time I go to Boston. Thanks Liz for everything."

She gave me all sorts of suggestions on things to do in Boston ahead of my trip (I was a little behind in my planning), and even invited me out for dinner on my first night in town so she could share more recommendations (how great is that?)."
Her apartment is also awesome as well! It's in an amazing location,has an amazing view (being on the top floor sure helps),and has everything you'd need (including air conditioning,which,in Boston in the summer,was pretty important).
If you're in Boston and you want to stay with a great host,in a great apartment,in a great part of town,"then you want to stay with Liz!\"",,
3032367,38552795,2015-07-16,37894646,Julia,"Liz was a welcoming and helpful host.  We felt at home in her apartment, which was very clean and in a great location near Mike's Pastry, where we went every morning.  It's a small apartment but perhaps spacious by North End standards.  Expensive for a B&B, but you're paying for the location. Very comfortable bed.  No TV."
3032367,47864253,2015-09-21,16355354,Mina,"Liz's apartment in the north end was spotless and super clean, very neat, included everything that we needed (including maps and Liz's recommendations on what to do and where to dine). We really enjoyed our stay. We were able to walk to everywhere in the city but best of all we WERE in my favorite part of the city, right by the harbor. Location couldn't be beat!! The apartment was on the fifth floor but the stairs weren't too bad. I would definitely return and also recommend this spot to everyone else. Liz was very sweet and friendly! Overall great experience, two thumbs up!"
3032367,48128106,2015-09-23,36425048,Maya,"Staying at Elizabeth was great!  the place was clean ,nice,convinent and in great location! Elizabeth was very nice and welcoming and did above and beyond to help us get around :-) we definitely recommad her place"
3032367,67304935,2016-03-28,43098546,Stéphanie,"L'appartement de Liz est très confortable avec une belle vue et parfaitement situé au milieu de la Petite Italie. Tout est à distance de marche et il y a beaucoup de petits commerces et restaurants autour. Même si nous n'avons pas eu le plaisir de rencontrer Liz, la communication avec elle était très facile et Liz est très sympathique. Je recommande fortement l'appartement de Liz"
3032367,87933832,2016-07-22,8323449,Vina,"I didn't know what an amazing location Elizabeth's place was until I got there! Walkable to everything downtown, but not only so, but the North End/little Italy neighborhood is full of great restaurants, bakeries and coffeeshops (Elizabeth gave me some great recommendations too!). Access to the apartment was easy, her instructions were clear, and the place was exactly as expected.  The 5th floor walkup wasn't as bad as I expected (and I am 7 months pregnant currently), and the view was as shown in the photo. Elizabeth left some snacks, which were welcome, and WIFI instructions were easy to access, although spotty at times if working from the apt. I left my iPhone charger, and she was kind enough to mail it back to me. Thank you for a great stay, I wish I had stayed longer instead of moving to a hotel - it was MUCH better at your place! :)"
3032367,94276375,2016-08-15,53198720,Landon,"Let me start off by saying, Elizabeth is one of, if not the best host we've ever encountered. From the time we booked till the time we left, she gave us so much helpful info and was super responsive. Now, about the apartment, the location is superb! Nestled in the heart of Little Italy, you are so close to everything in the area. It is a very short walk to The Wharf, Faneuil Hall, some of the most amazing restaurants in the city... as well as many more locales of interest! Liz's recommendations for places to eat and things to do were spot on (Monica's Mercato was seriously the best sandwich I've ever had). The apartment had all the amenities that we desired and had a very home like feel. The building we were in always felt safe and was maintained in a clean inviting condition. At times we would just sit at the kitchen table, eat, and look down the block at the throngs of people walking the streets in search of that perfect restaurant (Giacomos is literally across the street). If you're into it, beer, wine, and spirits are available right down stairs at the corner shop and there is a 7/11 right across from that. We didn't stay in the apartment a lot but I can tell you that the bed was very comfortable and the wireless was excellent. All in all, I will tell you that both this apartment and Elizabeth were top notch. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"

Her place is very comfortable and she made it easy to check in and out. She offered change for the laundry, a T card for a discount and even a card to a local restaurant. The apartment was quiet and convenient to public transit. There is lots of light. While we didn't cook meals there, the kitchen was fully equipped. We would definitely come back again!"

Alla was flexible about my arrival and departure times, which I appreciated, and she was very kind and welcoming. I was in town for a conference at Harvard, and my walk in was just under an hour. I think you can get the bus to Harvard quite easily, but I enjoy walking, so I was content with walking the distance. The area is quiet, with charming restaurants within very close walking distance."

10228457,83915228,2016-07-04,64311733,S,"Our stay at Scott's studio/ loft was an all-around great experience. As a former Boston resident, I knew the location would be great, but it proved to be even more convenient than expected. In addition to being walkable to Fenway, the Esplanade, & all of Back Bay/ South End, it was also just around the corner from the Arlington T stop and within a few blocks of several great cafes & bars. Despite the 4th of July crowds, we got lucky with metered street parking (free evenings, Sundays & holidays) on the opposite side of Commonwealth Ave Saturday through Monday morning. It also just happens to be in one of the loveliest parts of town."
The place itself is extremely clean & comfortable with great natural light. It has the kind of character and style that you can only find in old,converted city buildings decorated by people cooler than you are. We never met Scott,but he was warm & accomodating as a host through his various written correspondences. He made lots of extra provisions to ensure it felt extra-homey.,,,
We only really had 2 criticisms,neither which Scott can be blamed for,but that should be kept in mind when choosing this place. First,entry to the front of the building is a little more than 'finicky'. It took a minute or two of patient,persistent key-jiggling to get the main door lock to yield... every time. It never really got any easier (especially after a long day and a few drinks). Hopefully,a re-made key might mitigate that struggle
All that said,we would jump at the opportunity to stay here again. Thanks for everything,"Scott!\"",,,
10228457,88544988,2016-07-24,23521226,Luke,"Scott's place was perfect for a weekend in Boston. The amenities were very nice, comfortable bed, and my wife loved the decor!

She was quick to answer on a very short notice.  Her place is beautiful and very well located.  The T-Station (red line) is only a minute away and will drop you downtown in 15 minutes or less.  Susan is a wonderful host, was very helpful always wanting to offer the best stay possible.  When it is said that the breakfast is included... well it couldn't be more:  we had pancakes, fresh fruits, pastries (homemade!!!)  If you wish to stay for a while... be prepared to gain a few pounds."

From the get go she was very helpful with directions from the airport to her place,,,,,
The neighborhood is historic and beautiful,and it was very easy to get to Susan's from both downtown and the airport,,,,
She was a very gracious host,welcomed us into her home with open arms,but was very respectful of our privacy.,,,
Susan includes breakfast,and when I say breakfast she went all out to prepare an amazing spread (be sure to try her home made blueberry pancakes and home made granola cereal),,,,

She truly treats everyone like honored guests and it felt like a privilege to stay with her.  AND the cherry on top is the amazing food she bakes and shares!"

The location was very convienient to the metro (about 3 minutes easy walk) and the homes in the area wonderful. Susan is a terrific hostess - she even picked us up at the station the first night since our plane got there really late and then gave us a ride to a restaurant! The room and bed were very comforable. We had full  breakfasts served everyday and each time it was something different, and the snacks were out of this world!!! It's a shared bath situation, but we did not mind. We would recommend staying at Susan's to all our friends."
177129,645923,2011-10-19,1187771,Vince,"Everything you ever needed to know about good hospitality you can learn from Susan.  What a treat.  And, the apple crisp, fresh pumpkin bread, heated maple syrup and hot-off-the-griddle waffles... well, you get the idea."
177129,658979,2011-10-24,1231149,Angi,"My daughter and I stayed with Susan for a weekend in Boston.  This was our first trip through Airbnb, so we were not sure what to expect.  That said, our experience far exceeded any thoughts we may have had.  Susan started out by asking questions of us by email in order to make our stay more comfortable!  That was just the beginning of the many ways that Susan made us feel pampered!"
"Susan is a naturally born hostess!  It is evident that she loves to create a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere for her guests.  She made us feel right at home from the moment we stepped through the door....except nobody at \"\"home' spoils us the way she did!  Her home is beautiful and the location is perfect...just a very quick walk to the T on the Red Line",in a neighborhood we felt very comfortable in.,,,,
Besides all that,she loves to cook!  So if you go stay with Susan,and you definitely should,make sure you're not on a diet!  My daughter and I would definitely reccomend Susan's place!  We hope to stay there again sometime!   Thanks so much for a wonderful weekend,Susan!,

All throughout my stay, Susan was the ultimate host; always ensuring I was comfortable, had everything I needed, was well fed (she is an amazing cook!!!!) and had my privacy whenever I wanted it."
At Susan's you get the service of a 5 star hotel with a personal touch. Just a couple of examples:,,,,,
1. I get very cold at night,so Susan provided me with 2 comforters,2 warm blankets,and a neat trick on how to warm up your bed using a hair blow dryer!!!,,
2. I cannot have white flour,Susan looked up flourless and wheat flour recipes to make me desserts and breakfast everyday.,,,,
And there are many more examples of how she tries to accommodate your needs and make you feel at home.,,,,,

177129,722418,2011-11-15,1358188,Diane,Susan's home is super easy to get to from Logan and a very quick ride on the Red Line to wherever you want to go.  The bed was comfy and she had a cozy fire for us in the evening while we ate a scrumptious homemade chocolate cake.
Susan is a wonderfully gracious hostess who is easy to talk to and always makes you feel loved and cared for.  We very much enjoyed our Boston stay,"and it had a lot to do with Susan's hospitality.\"",,,,
177129,869607,2012-01-17,588514,Andrés,Susan was a wonderful host!
My friend and I had to book a place at the last minute,so I had narrowed my search down to her place and two others. The more we looked at the pictures,the more my friend and I felt “at home.” Susan was quick to respond to my many questions,which helped put my mind at ease! Susan was always a phone call or text away. Upon arriving to her place,it was just as described! She made us breakfast each morning,which was very impressive! It felt really good to sit down and eat breakfast rather than to just “eat on the go.”
Her place is very close to the subway station,and since my friend and I didn’t rent a car while we were there,this helped out tremendously!,,,
If you are “on the fence” about which place to stay at while you are in Boston,I would highly recommend Susan!,,,,

177129,1009921,2012-03-17,1760983,Alex,"Susan went above and beyond what I was expecting. Her hospitality and her generosity was unlike anything I have experienced. We had our prior reservation cancel on us and so we found Susan when she contacted us on the standby list... She picked us up for south station and made us feel so welcome it was the best way we could have started our trip. All the reviews below are true. If you're looking for a place to stay we highly recommend Susan, not just for the banana/cranberry/ pumpkin bread but also for the convenience when heading into central Boston."

"I would definitely go back and stay with Susan again. \"",,,,,
177129,1109911,2012-04-11,1957284,Brian,"On my way to Susan's place, Susan was running a little late and she called me to let me know and to apologize. My girlfriend and I simply waited on the patio in her backyard for 10-15 minutes for Susan's arrival. It was not an ideal situation, but Susan made it clear that it was her priority to be there when we arrived - and after staying 3 nights in her place, I truly believe it was. Some things just happen."
As for the actual stay,my girlfriend and I could not have been happier with Susan and her hospitality. From the moment we were there,it felt like a home away from home. Her wholehearted approach to satisfying the needs of her guests is evident from the moment we met her.,,,
Her politeness and professionalism is only matched by her cooking and thoughtfulness. Before visiting Susan,I read several reviews about her cooking,but nothing is like the real thing. I will just say this: come with an empty stomach! Her breakfast and evening snacks will impress you. Towards the end of our stay,my girlfriend mentioned to Susan how much she liked a certain tea that Susan had,so what did Susan do? She gave my girlfriend a 1/2 bag of her tea leaves! How awesome is that?,
We spent much time just sitting down and conversing with her about Boston and about life. She was incredibly down to earth. She provided insights into the city and her neighborhood that aided us immensely during our stay in Beantown.,,,,,
I have stayed in several bed & breakfasts,and this ranks up there with the best of them. From the quality of the bed and linens,cleanliness of the bathroom,deliciousness of the food,and the awesomeness of the host - all combined to make this a 5-star BnB experience.,
If you're thinking about choosing Susan and her BnB,"stop thinking. Book it. You won't regret it. \"",,,,
177129,1146742,2012-04-18,1316516,Carsten,My wife and I have spent four wonderful days with Susan. The house is very pretty and our room was perfect. Our hostess Susan received us very warm received and we have felt comfortable with her. The highlight is the breakfast. We already were a few times in the USA and it is the best breakfast which we ever have had.
You must absolutly try the Granola! ;-)),,,,,
We can recommend this accommodation without restrctions and thanking Susan for her hospitality.,,,,,

177129,1165436,2012-04-22,579044,Pam,This review is long overdue!  We stayed at Susan's place on a last minute request for an accomodation in Boston.  Not only did Sussn accommodate our request bUt she far surpassed our expectations.  she truly is a gratious host with an incredible talent for making scrumptious breakfasts.  We highly recommend a stay at Susan's!!! I know I will:)
177129,1259487,2012-05-10,1980750,Soledad,"We stayed at Susan's for four nights and really enjoyed it. The location is very convenient as it is close to a red line tube station which takes to to Boston center. The house is clean, the bedroom spacious and Susan will try to accommodate to your needs as much as her busy schedule allows.  Her breakfast is super (so are her home made sweets, which she shares generously), so make sure not to miss it. For southern european standards, breakfast time ends rather early, but it is certainly worth it. We have already recommended Susan's place to friends who will be in Boston this week, and we will go back to hers if we have the luck enough to be able to visit the city again."
177129,1295865,2012-05-17,2251246,Cathy,Susan was a wonderful host and breakfast was delicious.   She lives in a lovely area and we loved hearing the birds each morning.

177129,1335465,2012-05-23,2148116,Naomi,This B&B is in a wonderful location to visit Boston and the surrounding areas.  The subway stop is only a short walk away.  Susan is great hostess.  We enjoyed the wonderful breakfasts and treats she prepared and the time we spent visiting with her.
177129,1373921,2012-05-29,2229122,Mascha,We loved our stay at historic Melville. Susan was a great host. She was very forthcoming with information about Boston and spoilt us with a great breakfast and afternoon treat. We would definitely recommend staying at this lovely place.
177129,1402650,2012-06-02,588412,Shawn,"My experience was wonderful!  Susan's home is beautiful and only 1 block from the MBTA Red Line, so it was extremely convenient for my daily commute to Cambridge."
Susan provided wonderful advice while I was searching for an apartment -- advice which eventually lead to my summer apartment.  Susan did everything in her power to ensure that Darwin,my dog,and I had a comfortable stay with her.,,,
"Ps. Don't forget to try her famous granola.  It's famous for a reason!\"",,,,,
177129,1891819,2012-08-05,2234643,Alessandro,"I love everything about this place. The house is historical and in a quiet, conveniently-located neighborhood. Susan was incredibly warm and welcoming, and she clearly knows how to be a perfect host. The cookies and breakfasts she made for me were absolutely over the top; she even drove me to South Station when I left, although she didn't have to, but apparently she goes to great lengths to make sure that every guest has a perfect experience. I would warmly recommend this place (and host!) to everyone."
177129,2176978,2012-09-03,2572051,Andreia,"I spent four weeks at Susan's place and I had a great time. It was my first time in Boston and she helped me a lot. She is an amazing cook. So, the breakfast is delicious. The house is beautiful, clean and located very close to the red line T. I strongly recommend this place. Thanks Susan!"
177129,2271120,2012-09-12,2756066,Rachel,"It was our first airbnb expirience and we were pleasantly surprised. We were welcomed as strangers and left as friends. Once you find the path to her heart you will discover a warm caring hostess. If you are there on a weekend expect a chef's breakfast, a real treat."
177129,2369117,2012-09-22,3021079,Gwyne,"This B & B is very convenient to the red line--only about 2 blocks, so we were able to enjoy Boston with the 7 day subway pass.  We were only there on weekdays, but even so Susan prepared lovely fruit plates for us and baked personal coffee cakes several of the days.  Susan's home is very clean."
177129,2457201,2012-09-30,1232653,Mathias,"We did have a great time in Boston. Susan was a very accommodating host: She is courteous, friendly and told us a lot about Boston and its surroundings -- as professional and well organized as a hotel manager, but far more personal. She even prepared a delicious dessert for us one day and breakfast was always healthy and tasty."
The room was simple,but well equipped with a bed,a small desk and a hanger for the clothes. We slept very well. Even if the house is located in a residential area quite far from downtown Boston,it is easy to get there using the metro. It is worth to take these extra miles -- because of the price and of course: because of Susan,"the queen of charm.\"",
177129,2569982,2012-10-10,2088332,Sabrina,"Susan was a wonderful host, and in addition she is a fantastic cook baker (my personal favourite was the apple tarte). Her house is very clean and located just one block away from the red MBTA line. I would definitely recommend to stay at Susan's comfort B&B."
177129,2584429,2012-10-11,1934376,Imogen,"Susan is a gracious and welcoming host who puts considerable effort into making sure everything is set up well for her guests, including offering breakfast during the week, cooking an incredible breakfast on weekends, and setting clear house rules so everyone knows what's what. And if you're lucky, you might get a freshly baked treat and an interesting chat over a cup of tea. The historic house is lovely, clean and comfortable, and right near the subway heading straight downtown. The room I had was very comfortable and quiet, with lovely furnishings and excellent wifi. I found Susan's house such a good option that I extended my stay and then came back when I returned to Boston."
177129,2610938,2012-10-15,2234636,Tess,"We absolutely loved our stay at Susan's place. Susan is warm and welcoming, great to talk to and makes a fantastic breakfast, we loved the freshly baked pumpkin loaf in the morning YUM. The bed was comfy, the bathroom and house spotless, and the neighborhood is beautiful. Really short walk to the red line train which gets you straight to the middle of Boston or harvard. Would definitely recommend."

177129,3776478,2013-03-13,333491,Amber,"Susan was such a gracious hostess!  Her baking is divine (seriously, and I'm a trained chef!) and the room was equipped with everything I needed to be comfortable and feel at home."
The charming house is very,very close to the T station,and getting to the city is a short hop.  I didn't venture out in the area surrounding the house so can't speak to the neighborhood,but if travelling to the area to visit the city,this is the PERFECT location,and perfect hostess.
Thanks so much for  your hospitality,Susan,and I can't wait to try your new granola line (BEST GRANOLA I've EVER had!),,,

177129,4025454,2013-04-03,105051,Barbara,"To better appreciate Susan's hospitality, I need to briefly describe the situation during which I came across her BnB. My family had planned to come from Europe around the birth of my first child. I was looking for a clean, safe and well connected place by public transport and Susan's place fit all the needs. Susan took wonderful, almost personal care of my family making them feeling home. She went as far as sending me tarts and flowers while we were all waiting for the baby. I definitely recommend her , and will for sure send family/friends to stay with her again!"
177129,5247722,2013-06-20,6609521,Jon,"We had a great time staying with Susan.  She was extremely friendly and professional, and really went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable.  The accommodations were clean, cozy and very well-maintained.  Highly recommended!"
177129,6363003,2013-08-10,5869739,Annie,I've been in Boston and Cambridge for almost two months as I was studying at Harvard for the summer and I still had things to visit and discover when I left !
The B&B is located in a calm residential area,2 minutes away from a subway station leading to downtown Boston in about 20 minutes and in Cambridge and Harvard in approximately 40 minutes. The house is lovely,as is the hostess. The breakfasts she prepares are the best way to start a good day of tourism or to gain energy to study. Susan always has places and itineraries to propose you to help you make the most of Boston. If you have questions about anything,feel free to ask her.,,
My room was well furnished and the house is clean. I felt very conformable and welcomed and I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this B&B again.,,,,,
"Thank you for everything Susan !\"",,,,,
177129,6547435,2013-08-16,7899832,Maria,"Susan was a great host. We enjoyed our stay immensely.  The house is beautiful, comfortable and private. Close to trains into boston. The breakfast is great as well."
177129,6720858,2013-08-22,7118322,Eric,"I stayed 5 nights in Susan's B&B and felt like home, with my privacy, in my very comfortable top floor large room. Susan was very concerned about my trip and gave me nice suggestions for places to visit. The metro is a short walk far and it takes you in the city in less than 20 minutes, operating till 12:30 pm."
177129,6846706,2013-08-27,2344896,Marielle,"We had a wonderful time at Susan's. The house was a neatly-kept, charming haven situated just a block away from the T Red line station. Susan took great care of us and prepared us delicious breakfasts."
In other words,très bonne adresse et super rencontre!,,,,
Merci Susan,,,,,

177129,8576464,2013-11-05,3694854,Jean,"\"Susan's house was a real find and Susan was a great hostess. The house is a charming single family Victorian home in the historic district and only 3 minutes from the Red Line on the \"\"T\"\". On the weekend there is on-street free parking. Susan was great to talk to and a wealth of good advice about getting around town. The breakfasts were gorgeous and delicious. I only wish I had more time to stay and savor them.\""
177129,9849023,2014-01-14,9620120,Katrina,"I stayed here with a few other friends for a wedding that was in a house around the corner, so needless to say, the location was a huge convenience for us. It's a charming home, the rooms are plenty spacious and well furnished, and Susan is a wonderful hostess. She gave a thorough tour of the house when we first arrived, consistently made sure we were comfortable, and as others have mentioned, really outdid herself with Sunday morning breakfast. This is a great place for anyone who wants to experience what it's really like to live in Boston."
177129,10842424,2014-03-10,3373283,Tonya,"Susan is a wonderful host. Her house is charming and beautiful and she serves great breakfasts. Our favourite was the Sunday brunch of fresh fruit, waffles, scrambled eggs and bacon. She gave great advice about where to go when we were in town, telling us which touristy restaurants to avoid and which ones we definitely had to experience. The bedroom was spacious, with four windows -- just as depicted in the pictures."
177129,10933638,2014-03-13,5235973,Naomi,"My stay was perfect.  Susan is a generous and accommodating host.  Her communications prior and after booking were always prompt, clear and helpful. This was particularly notable as I found myself making a reservation last minute on a weekend around a complicated work travel schedule. Susan graciously offered me best times to communicate with her, allowed a late check in and after arrival was invaluable in helping me sort out how to get to my various meetings efficiently.  This was further enhanced by the convenience of her location, fast efficient public transport into the heart of Boston is literally around the corner. Access to the highways for travel to my meetings outside of Boston was also easy by car. The room was simple but comfortable.  The entire space is very clean (note shoes off policy bring your slippers), comfortable, quiet and private.  The ability to come and go and be pretty much left to my own devices was of great value to me.  As it turned out I found Susan so interesting and engaging I’m afraid I ended up seeking out her company more then was fair.  She also provided the most delicious baked cranberry bread and fruit salad at breakfast – which she kindly sent me home with for the long drive the last day.  I would also recommend trying to plan a 10-15 minute walk up and down Melville Ave and some of the side streets to gawk at the beautiful Victorians – really a spectacular collection of Victorian homes."
177129,12018714,2014-04-21,13873598,Frank,"As our first Airbnd experience, we were a little apprehensive.   About 10 seconds after meeting Susan, the apprehension went out the window.  We had the most wonderful experience with Susan.   Her home is just like the pictures, nice.  And Susan's hospitality is phenomenal.  From suggesting great restaurants to eat prior to check in to a parting gift of her homemade granola, we found her to be very engaging and gracious host where our comfort was her main concern.  We were fortunate to stay til Sunday morning when Susan prepared a breakfast that was beyond all expectation!  Fresh homemade zucchini bread, fresh fruit, fresh homemade blueberry pancakes, eggs, potatoes, sausages.  Don't know how we ate it all, but we found a way!  Location had us concerned a bit, since we were new to Boston on a college tour trip.  Super convenient location, with the T stop so close, just a short walk.  We're now experts on the T.   We were concerned with safety on the walk to Susan's bnb, but it was not an issue, just a two block walk and neighborhood was quiet when we arrived back after dinner.    Suggest you give it a try!  Thanks Susan!"
177129,12380801,2014-04-30,440858,Estela,"I stayed at Susan´s house during April 24th-29 this year and I was very happy to have decided to stay there. Susan is a wonderful host, a very interesting woman and has a beautiful house, everything exactly as on her description.  She was very kind to provide me all information I requested and was also available on the phone in case I need to call her.  Her house is beautiful, quiet and very charming. She is very respectul and cultivated, and I really regret i couldn´t spend more time there and had more time to chat with her.  The house is very clean and everything is very well organized. The rooms are big and very comfortable, and with all amenities.  A plus point is that it is very close to the Subway Station with a direct train to the city in 10 minutes. I highly recommend Susan as a host."
177129,12516825,2014-05-04,13890575,Saleh,"Susan was very nice, welcoming and cheerable host. She made me feel very comfortable in her place. The place it'self was clean, tidy, and quiet. Towls, soap, shampoo are there for gusts. I liked the location as it's not far from downtown, about 10 mins driving meanwhile it wasn't noisy and the surrounding area not conjusted. I think for the price I paid/nt,  it's very good place to stay."
177129,15028686,2014-07-01,12757182,Aldis,"Susan made sure that my stay in Boston was a pleasant one.  She was very respectful,polite, courteous and helpful."
177129,15411694,2014-07-08,16502440,Daniel,"This was the first stop on our 10-day East Coast journey, so it was a great way to start: considering I made these arrangements sort of last-minute, I'm really glad I found Susan on Airbnb. She was attentive to every detail, and everything was as advertised. I chose her place because my father grew up in Dorchester, and while this is certainly not my father's Dorchester any more, the neighborhood was safe--I never felt uneasy walking around the area. Susan was especially great to my 12-year old son--she even baked cookies for us!"
177129,15580108,2014-07-12,5405040,Isabelle,"We spent five days in Boston this past week and could not have asked for a more gracious host. The room and house were exactly as described and Susan made sure we had everything we need. The location of the subway and the free parking were an extra bonus! Thanks so much, Susan!!"
177129,15773858,2014-07-15,11965519,Sasha-Nicole,"This was a beautiful house to use as a base for exploring Boston. There was three of us staying and Susan provided an airbed for the third guest. She was extremely polite and helpful, suggested many activities for us to do and found every opportunity to treat us to her wonderful cooking and baking. On arrival, there were delicious warm brownies waiting for us (despite it being midnight when we arrived!!), she provided breakfast every morning, including a cooked breakfast on Sunday which we enjoyed so much. The house itself is spotless and a lovely place to unwind after a long day of sightseeing. Susan's etiquette and hospitality were always outstanding and we felt truly looked after. The location is great, just 2 minutes to the T subway stop and then 15 minutes straight into Boston. Thanks, we'd definitely stay again!"
177129,15870892,2014-07-17,16160390,Mary,"Susan是个很严谨的人,每天早晨都亲自烘烤蛋糕,房子也很干净,就是门的密封不是很好,我们居住的第二天,其他住客竟然把房间里的收音机开了一夜,不知为何严谨的房东对这样的住客不提出异议?房子所在的街区很安静,但房子离路边很近,晚上有车过的时候还是有点声音,离地铁红线车站很近,交通非常方便,里火车站只有大概五站路,波士顿的地铁很发达,住在Susan的房子中正好可以充分利用地铁线路。"
177129,16586028,2014-07-29,18356831,Emily,"Susan goes above and beyond the expectations of an Air BnB host. She gave us a true bed and breakfast experience - providing us with towels, bath robes, shampoo & conditioner, breakfast every morning (pancakes and bacon, banana bread, blueberry bread, fresh fruit), and an amazingly clean (beautiful victorian style) house. Susan is so sweet and full of advice on touring around Boston. I stayed with my boyfriend and neither of us felt judged for staying out late or staying together for that matter.  Oh and the train into the city is a block and a half away - but you wouldn't even know it looking at the beautiful neighborhood! P.S. she has a sweet (beautiful) puppy who likes to lick your feet and have her belly scratched - she's very obedient and playful!"
Also,Susan has more then one room for visitors - 3 total I believe. But it never felt crowded or awkward.,,,,
"Susan is an excellent host!\"",,,,,
177129,16829268,2014-08-03,3098108,Niamh,"I stayed with Susan for five nights and found her to be a great host and very welcoming, and an excellent cook."
Her house is in a handy location as it is only five minutes walk to the subway station. The room was spacious and we never had any issues with sharing the shared bathroom with other guests as Susan had made provision for a reservation system for shower/bath use etc.,,,,,
All in all,"this was a great way to see a Boston neighbourhood. \"",,,,

If you decide to stay with Susan (which I definitely recommend), try to be there on a Sunday morning when Susan prepares a hot breakfast. Delicious!"
Yes,"I highly recommend this spot which is only a block away from a red line stop and creates easy access to the rest of Boston. \"",,,,
177129,17220081,2014-08-09,17527959,Robin,"We  had a great stay with Susan! Dorchester is a cute neighborhood  and very simple to get to from downtown. A three  minute walk to the metro station, safe with historic houses. Susan made us feel very welcome and gave us a thorough tour right away so we know  how everything worked and how to get what we needed. She was friendly and  professional, offering delicious breakfast, homemade  cookies, and advice  when asked  for sightseeing, transportation etc. Queen of Charm is the perfect description for this hostess!"
177129,17422738,2014-08-11,19627830,Nick,This a great find in a surprisingly wonderful neighborhood. Susan was incredibly accommodating on short notice and was a fantastic host from start to finish. Rules were clearly laid out and the breakfast provided was wonderful. I must specifically note the breakfast she made on Sunday was hearty and delicious. We had a wonderful time.
177129,17792254,2014-08-17,10653199,Martin,Thank you Susan for all the perfect recommodations in Boston. It was a pleasure to meet you and I absolutely enjoyed the stay at your home! The warm and freah midnight cookies just were awesome! Thank you so much for everything! Best greetings from Vienna
177129,18166254,2014-08-23,15296490,Laury-Anne,"Susan is a great host. I really enjoyed my stay at her home. The location is perfect, in a residential neigbourhood at 20mn from Boston Common (the subway is at 2mn from the house - if you walk slowly). The room and bathroom are very clean. Susan is really nice and a great cook (you have to try her cake!!). I also appreciated our discussions. Thanks for all Susan."
177129,18888560,2014-09-02,4220772,Bruno,"Un très chaleureux accueil. J'ai beaucoup aimé tout ce que Susan a fait pour nous. Nous sommes arrivés très tard et elle a tout de même été très accueillante. Le déjeuner, spécialement celui du dimanche matin, était très bien. Susan nous a toujours fait sentir qu'elle était présente pour nous aider."
"Le quartier est très sympathique. Le logement se trouve à cinq minutes de marche du métro. Nous avons laissé notre voiture stationnée dans la rue et tout s'est bien passé!\"",,,,,
177129,19055982,2014-09-05,20645651,Christopher,"I arrived late (after 8pm), Susan greeted me at the door, and gave me a tour of the house, we had a pleasant chat for a few minutes, and she explained the house rules, all were very straightforward and understandable."
She provided information about breakfast,and the next morning I met the other two house guests and they were very nice.  Susan's house has the classic charm of a turn of the century New England home mixed with Modern day furnishings.,,,,
"5/5 Was very pleased with my first experience here with AirBnB.  Would stay here again!\"",,,,,
177129,19131456,2014-09-07,4943314,Phil,"Susan and her very cute puppy welcomed us immediately and gave us a walk through tour of the home and ground rules.  It was the most thorough instruction I'd ever received, but was evident of her experience with AirBnB.  Everything was as described.  The location was almost perfect for our needs with easy access to the MBTA.  This is a busy neighborhood and at times there was loud traffic during the night something that is out of her control, but just a warning if you are needing a deep sleep.  It was delightful meeting her other guests and I can't imagine staying with a nicer person."
177129,19334198,2014-09-10,548758,Michael,"We greatly enjoyed our stay with Susan. Her home was lovingly restored and comfortable. Susan is a masterful cook, and great to talk to while her co-host, her puppy, Zoey, was fun to be around. Susan provided helpful information for sightseeing and getting around Boston. Not to missed is her Sunday breakfast. To accommodate the number of guests staying with her at any one time, she will provide structure and guidelines to assure the BNB runs smoothly. Thanks Susan!"
177129,19739785,2014-09-17,3010577,Colin,Susan was the best hostess (hostess with the mostest) we have ever met.  I stayed with my friend and Susan sweetest and nicest person.  If we come back to Boston we will definitely stay with her....

177129,20156726,2014-09-24,3217535,Federica,The room is very spacious and Susan's house is located in a very quiet area. Our bed was extremely confortable and we really liked the possibility to have in-house breakfast every morning.
Susan's home is very close to the subway. It's a five minutes walk away from the station if you are a slow walker. South Station is 20 minutes away so this accomodation is ideal if you want to go home to a quiet place yet want to be close to the city center.,,,,,
"Our stay at Susan's was only two day long but very pleasant.\"",,,,,
177129,20267287,2014-09-26,21029845,Markus,"Susan is an amazing host, it doesn't get any better. She made us superdelicious cookies, provided us great breakfasts, and made us feel so welcome that we decided to come back to her beautiful house a second time on our trip through New England.

177129,21461919,2014-10-18,18541198,Ronald,It was fantastic to stay at Susan in Dorchester near to Boston. All was taken care for every day. Nice was the house the surrounding and short the way to the subway. We look back to a marvelous holliday thanks to Susan.
177129,21608764,2014-10-20,21706065,Christian,Susan was just an awesome host and the room was as described. We also got a really good breakfast. All in all we enjoyed our stay and will come back once we are in Boston again.
177129,21971730,2014-10-27,22017359,Summer,We had a lovely time in Boston.  The decription on the page was accurate.  Susan was quick to respond to any questions we had and helpful with directions and ideas.  The location to the public transportation was awesome and we were able to leave our car parked for most of our time in Boston.  She made amazing breakfast in the mornings and went out of her way to make things to each of our liking.  The beautiful house was quiet and the other guests were very respectful.  Susan gave a thorough walk through of the house and the expectations so that all guests were on the same page.
There is a friendly dog who greets you when you enter,so make sure you are a dog person.  Also,the house was full when we were there (8 of us),so the full bathroom with the shower did become congested in the mornings especially.  Susan has a system set up to help everyone get to the shower,"although I still felt a little rushed.\"",
177129,22261937,2014-11-02,22662099,Adélaïde,"Susan est une hôte très agréable et chaleureuse , qui nous a permis de découvrir Boston à travers ses conseils judicieux. Les chambres sont grandes et spacieuses et le petit-déjeuner très apprécié. La maison est située sur la ligne rouge, proche du centre ville (à 15min en métro)"
"Nous vous la recommandons vivement pour visiter Boston.\"",,,,,
177129,22741000,2014-11-13,9994853,Jeanette,"I had a brief but pleasant stay at Susan's home.  She has a range of detailed rules and guidelines to help her run her busy home efficiently.  The continental-style breakfast with cereals and breads included a delicious homemade one each day I was there. Her homemade granola is quite tasty as well. In terms of sleep and quiet time, there was some helicopter and street noise at night due to it being an urban area.  It is close to the T which is a real plus.  (Transportation took longer than expected for me but it would depend on where you need to go and be. I was meeting friends from out of state who got lost for over an hour and we only had 30 minutes to visit instead of several hours. The T took 50 minutes  one way instead of 20-25  that day due to mechanical issues but I am told that doesn't happen often). Taxi prices were higher than I expected but I needed to transport luggage as well and found a combination of the T and taxi helped save money or to be safety-conscious if returning after dark. For those with light luggage, you may be able to manage just fine on the T during non-rush hours perhaps even to and from the airport. Susan has a busy schedule and life with her other business and activities as well but she did check in with me to inquire what my plans were for my stay and was available for questions too. She has a very sweet and high-energy young dog for those that like dogs (I do). Susan is certainly a lovely person who wants her guests to have a nice stay in her home and in the Boston area."
177129,22888764,2014-11-17,15728808,Massimiliano,"Susan is the perfect host: welcoming and always charming. She simply makes her home your home! Great historic house, comfy bedroom, and excellent shared spaces. Hot breakfast on Sunday is a treat!"

177129,28246149,2015-03-21,16121861,Saskia,"Wir waren 5 Nächte in Boston. Die Unterkunft von Susan war sehr sauber und gemütlich eingerichtet. In unserem Zimmer hatten wir alles, was wir brauchten. Es war ruhig und angenehm warm, sodass wir wirklich gut entspannen konnten, nach unseren langen Erkundungstouren durch Boston. Susan war eine sehr nette und hilfsbereite Gastgeberin, die sich mit ganzem Herzen um uns gekümmert hat und uns somit einen unvergesslichen Aufenthalt beschert hat. Das Haus liegt nah an der T-Station (Red Line) sodass man sehr schnell in der Innenstadt von Boston aber auch in Cambridge sein kann."
177129,28964765,2015-04-01,45395,Loredana,Wow! I have 3 words; homemade apple cake.
We spent 5 nights at Susan's home while exhibiting at a Boston trade show and we really needed good and relaxing sleep. Bedroom was comfy and very quiet arranged with flowers and chocolate. Multi choice breakfast with homemade granola or cake was from outer space. Zoe,the chocolate ball of fur,was very cute and affectionate and Susan was charming and very helpful with tons of caring suggestions. Even thought the train stop was only around the corner we wound up using the car for the drive into the city and took several different routes each time so we had a chance to see some spectacular views of old homes,"beaches and neighborhoods. Time flew by fast leaving us with good memory.\"",,
177129,29254270,2015-04-06,25157554,Dominik,Susan welcomed us warm although it was late in the evening. She is very nice and lovely and we enjoyed the time very much. Susan has a very cute dog called Zoe. The rooms are clean. You will be in about 20 minutes in the centre of Boston if you take the metro.
177129,29697744,2015-04-11,27017925,Niraj,"Susan is a wonderful host and she went over and way above my expectations in making me feel welcome. In fact, she made me feel like part of her family. The location of her place is literally two minutes from the T station and as such extremely convenient for commuting to any part of Boston. The room was large, comfortable, well-appointed and the entire house bore the signs of a very high level of cleanliness. I am sure I am missing out many wonderful things Susan did to make my stay pleasant, like asking me my breakfast habits, offering me tea at the end of the day....and the list goes on. She even carried my suitcase up the stairs to the third floor  where my room was knowing that I had to be careful with my back. Honestly, cannot wait till the the next opportunity to stay at hers. Thank You, Susan for the incredibly sweet experience!"
177129,29869656,2015-04-13,30194618,Tiana,"Susan was a superb host.  It is clear from the presentation of the home and her welcoming nature that she aims to provide a comfortable and hospitable environment. She is very knowledgeable about Boston, and can offer great recommendations for both dining and entertainment. Her breakfast selection is delicious and filling...if you like granola, you will appreciate (URL HIDDEN) homemade. She also has an adorable puppy, who brings a unique charm to the B&B. Lastly, Susan is a quick and astute problem-solver who will try her best to make your stay as comfortable as possible."
177129,30437547,2015-04-22,21880230,Clare,I stayed in Susan's lovely home whilst I was in Boston to run the marathon. The house is very comfortable and clean and Susan really goes the extra mile to ensure you have everything you need.
My room was a good size lots of space to move about. There was ample drawers and hanging for clothes. On my arrival there were chocolates and fresh flowers in my room which I thought was a lovely touch. There was even shower gels and body lotions available to use.,,,,,
Breakfast was delicious. There was lots of choice,and many homemade items. Including delicious granola and cranberry bread. Susan even made granola and cookies for me to take home :),,,,
Susan has a gorgeous dog called Zoe. She was really cute and friendly.,,,,,
The house is located just a few subway stations from the centre of Boston and the subway is very near the house. It was very easy to get into town and home again.,,,,,
Susan is a very informative host,I had never been to Boston before so this was very useful. She is also very easy to get along with and I felt at ease in her home. She was really lovely when I returned from running the marathon,and ran me a bath,with relaxing salts in and even made me tea.,,
"I wouldn't hesitate to stay with Susan again.  \"",,,,,
177129,30650819,2015-04-25,30866518,Marissa,"The description of Susan's home was mostly accurate.  However, there was not on premises parking.  We were instructed to park a block away on the street.  After the 30 minute indoctrination of rules upon arrival, we quickly saw that this home was lovely and immaculately clean!  You will probably never stay anywhere cleaner.  Also, even though Susan has as many rules as the military (my husband and I are both veterans), the rules are mostly common courtesy rules.  The bedroom was spacious and the breakfasts were very lovely.  She had fresh fruit for us and even her home made granola!  Susan is the type of person to pay attention to the smallest details that would make people happy.  For instance, she had fresh flowers and water in our room, and one night she baked us cookies.  She is a great conversationalist, and wants people to be happy and to enjoy them selves as well as Boston."
Bottom line: if you are clean and respectful,you will probably love Susan's home.  She is clean,respectful,"and loving.  Her dog Zoe is a little doll too.  She is sweet and was great with our 1 year old daughter.\"",,
177129,31602485,2015-05-07,3715589,Timothy,"I booked Susan's place to attend an event at the nearby JFK Library. Susan will followed up with details on directions and a brief questionnaire to be clear on your needs, if any.  This was timely because I was booking a bit last minute and it reminded me to share some dietary preferences which she went out of her way to accomodate.  She is very helpful with area information and always a text away if you have a question.  There were flower and chocolates in the room and the place was spotless.  Most importantly, the bed was very comfortable and beds can sometimes be hit and miss with Airbnb.  Breakfast was excellent and she seemed always ready to customize or supplement with some other breakfast items on the spot if she was around.  She even packed fresh fruit and yoghurt and her homemade granola for my painfully early flight back to the west coast - much appreciated.   It was a great choice and I would recommend the place to anyone."
177129,32388552,2015-05-17,32164992,Philip,"Susan is a great host! Very welcoming. We didn't spend much time at the house as we were only in town a short time and had lots to do there. Her place is a charming, comfortable old new england house in a quiet neighbohood a very short walk away from the red line stop. Downtown and Cambridge are a short ride away. Overall a great deal in a nice area very convenient to all that Boston has to offer."
177129,32516140,2015-05-19,30361263,Laurie,"Susan is a wonderful host. She welcomed us into her home and explained to us how the bed and breakfast worked; keys, shared bathroom, common spaces, etc. The room was clean and comfortable. She provided a lovely breakfast in the morning and has a sweet and gracious personality. Bonus: Her dog is adorable!! We only stayed two nights and traveled around by car. Street parking was not a problem at all. Thank you, Susan!"
177129,32764071,2015-05-21,31513345,Ronald,"With great pleasure, we think back to our visit to the Airbnb from Susan. The kindness and hospitality we get was for us a very positive experience. Our room was more than fine, slept with 3 people and the shower facilities were very clean and with care. The location was just outside the center, the metro was perfectly located 300 meters away and took us directly to the center. The breakfast was very responsible with fresh fruit and delicious banana cake. In short, it is definitely a must and worth for a repeating stay in Boston, Susan ones again many thanks."
177129,33090634,2015-05-25,7261578,Alex,This was by far one of the most comfortable and well-appointed airbnb spots that I have ever stayed in. Susan is an extremely attentive host. Everything was very clean and there was even a bathrobe in the bedroom.
As some of the other commenters have noted,there do seem to be a lot of house rules. I was in town on business and might have given up some of the higher end amenities in favor of a more relaxed atmosphere.,,,,
That minor thing aside,"I would say that this is a great place if you are in town on vacation and are looking for something that approximates a traditional bed & breakfast. Susan seems to know a ton about Boston and seems very passionate about offering people a wonderful experience.\"",,,,
177129,33566362,2015-05-30,26831296,Anne-Marie,"Nous avons passé une excellente semaine à Boston grâce à l'accueil et au professionnalisme de Susan.  La maison est située dans un quartier calme et agréable, très bien desservi par les transports publics, à 20 mn de la South station et du quartier historique."
177129,33861046,2015-06-01,10783562,Steven,Susan was very helpful and welcoming and took the time to get me settled in. She gave great tips and noticed I needed coffee badly after a long day of work. The b&b is very near to the subway which takes you right into the center in just 15 minutes. The house is clean and comfortable.
177129,34527542,2015-06-09,29801060,Andreas,So everything was great. Easy way to the city and no problems at all.
"Would do it again.\"",,,,,

We truly enjoyed Susan's hospitality, sweet little dog Zoe, complete breakfast each morning and special blueberry pancakes on our last day.   Perfect location for our four days in town.  Recommend highly!"
177129,37691059,2015-07-09,19403050,Ellie,Susan was a very welcoming host and was very attentive. The breakfast each morning was delicious! Zoe the dog was much fun to be around too.

Definitely a great place.,,,,,
"Thank you Susan!!\"",,,,,
177129,39179848,2015-07-21,767099,Akemy,"Susan was an excellent host; my fiancé and I enjoyed our stay and felt welcome in her home.  She greeted us when we arrived and showed us around her home. Initially I was skeptical about booking in a B-N-B with a shared restroom, however this was never an issue during our stay. I never had to wait to utilize the restroom and it was extremely clean. Her entire home is spotless and my room had ample space. Susan is very knowledgeable about the area and will make great suggestions for your visit. Communication with Susan was excellent, and she was only a text away if you had any questions while exploring Boston. The neighborhood is safe and the red-line train is a couple of blocks (very short walk) away. The proximity to the train was very convenient. Her breakfast was a perfect way to start my day with an assortment of fresh fruits, yogurt, homemade granola and breads, which were delicious. Susan even surprised us with chocolate covered strawberries when we arrived on one of the nights! Just one note, if you tend to be a light sleeper I would recommend staying in the rooms further from the front of the home in order to avoid any street noise. Overall we had a great stay."
177129,39979961,2015-07-27,6815019,Michael,"Susan was a wonderful host. Friendly, helpful and an exquisite attention to detail. Susan's home was comfortable, clean and very convenient to the red line.  I felt very welcome and would highly recommend her home."
177129,41124142,2015-08-04,36407136,Hsia,"Though a few days have passed, I still remember Susan's smile, her hospitality, the strawberry covered with chocolate she has made specially for our family and her thoughtfulness of either moving the electric fan away in case we may knock on it or leaving the lovely Zoe with us when we mentioned we liked her but couldn't  see her when we came back. There is a lot to say.... The room is very clean, the house is only 3 minutes' walk to the subway, and Susan is so helpful. She is really a very very great host. Next time we will surely stay at her house. I"
177129,42016303,2015-08-10,15252284,Kirsty,"Susan was the perfect host! The listing was exactly as described - comfortable and seconds from T train into downtown Boston. We had a wonderful stay in your home Susan, thanks again for everything, including your helpful tips for things to do, and not forgetting breakfast every morning!"
177129,44465348,2015-08-26,40617224,Jenna,Susan was a wonderful and warm host! We were not able to see her during our stay due to her busy personal schedule and our busy vacation but our encounters were just great! She was very accommodating.
177129,45397016,2015-09-02,11941943,Jeanne,"What a great place to stay!  Susan was warm and welcoming, and her top priority was the comfort of her guests."
177129,46016498,2015-09-07,10491747,Beatrice,Susan was a wonderful host. She made us feel at home and provided us with many tips on where to eat and what to visit. Our room and shared bathroom were very clean and the subway is a 3 min walk. The breakfast was delicious (home made coffee cake and fresh fruit!) we had an amazing stay!
177129,46760821,2015-09-13,11267405,Giorgio,"Susan was the perfect host, so warm and kind. I had a wonderful stay in her apartment: I felt really at home. She is wonderful and dedicate all efforts to fulfill all the guest's needs. The apartment is perfectly clean, very well located, just 3 min from the subway in a nice residential neighborhood. The room was spacious, clean and the bed very comfortable. I think it's definitely the best place where to stay visiting Boston, a wonderful city I had the chance to appreciate in deep thanks to the great tips Susan gave me: amazing hotspots, restaurants and coffee bars."
177129,47951242,2015-09-22,22575223,Jeanette,Thank you Susan.   We have appreciated the effort you went to to make us feel welcome.
We were well fed,and your granola,pumpkin and banana breads were to die for!,,,
Our room and all facilities were clean and comfortable.   We loved the historic surroundings of your area and the convenience to the subway and quick access to downtown Biston was a bonus.,,,,,
We thank you too for your patience in answering the many questions we fired at you both before our arrival and during our stay,"with patience and at length.   An excellent hostess.\"",,,,
177129,48899648,2015-09-29,35037257,Maria,Susan was such a wonderful host. Her place was clean and comfortable. She was very welcoming and responsive to any need we might have had. The home was very close and convenient to the T. Highly recommend for anyone visiting Boston.

177129,50491111,2015-10-12,43859539,Veronica,"Our stay with Susan was absolutely amazing! She personalized our stay as much as she could. She even went out of her way to make iced coffee for me! She's an incredible host, very attentive. You can tell that she takes great care of her home and she asks that you do the same. Which is great because that makes for a pleasant stay for all of her guests. She's genuinely interested to know how you spent your day and what you think about Boston. She gives you advice about where to go/how to get there. Getting to/from downtown to her house is super easy. Public transportation as a whole is super easy. Her dog Zoe is super sweet and playful. We had the room on the third floor and it was so cozy! With a window on two sides of the room, we would open the curtains in the morning and the sunlight would flood in. Just gorgeous! Both my best friend and I highly recommend staying with Susan. Even if we don't go together, we will both try to stay with her on our next trip to Boston!"
177129,50973791,2015-10-16,40255151,Oleksandr,"Susan were welcome host and interesting collocutor. Home was nice and clean. Breakfast was home made and tasty. Dog is pretty. Location was good. But I feel, that the rules at home a bit strict. On the opposite, it allows me to trust to leave my things there and do not worry about my safety at all."
177129,51309985,2015-10-19,9252057,Joan,"\"We enjoyed our stay at Susan's immensely! Susan was there to greet and introduce us to her beautiful historic home in Dorchester. Her house is warm and inviting, and a comfortable retreat,--particularly after trapping around Boston all day. YES, Boston is a very easy commute away by car or subway (the \"\"T\"\")...although Dorchester itself has some very fine restaurants only a walk away (10-15 minutes) from Susan's house. We opted for Italian at Tavolo"
177129,52650373,2015-10-31,11643104,Thomas,"We booked Susan's fancy room just a day earlier, and then booked the air ticket and rushed to the airport, didn't reply her questionnaire, but she went back home before our taxi arrived, gave us a warm welcome with her friendly dog - Zoe,  explained every thing about the house. The house is pretty clean and quiet, less than 5 minutes walk to subway, the red line took us to every where we want to visit in Boston. Our room is spacious, and our baby boy Mantou really love the room, the house,  Zoe and the Susan's homemade banana cakes. We really enjoy the stay in Susan's Victoria style house."

177129,65902810,2016-03-17,62013693,Toan,She was very receiving. One of us got lost on the way and she helped direct us home. She takes her job as a host very seriously and makes sure that everything is spick and span around the house. She even took the time to prepare fruit and muffins for our breakfast. Susan was very clear about the house rules and hence there was no misunderstanding about what we could and could not do in the house. We were also given useful recommendations for different areas in the city.
The rooms look the same as in the pictures,if not better! The neighborhood is quiet,and is very convenient because it is so close to the subway. Though it's not in the centre of Boston,if you don't mind a half-an-hour train ride every day,"the location is ideal. \"",

You are like a sister to me and you treated us like we were your own family. You took such great care of me and my 3-year-old daughter. You made us feel like we were at home.
We will never forget your great breakfasts with the nutritious fruit trays. You gave great travel recommendations and the perfect route to get there. us a recommended.,,,,,
Thanks for being so kind end playing with Celine. We were so surprised by the chocolate you put on the door when we got back home. After having trouble with uber  you helped us get a car and to sent us to south station. We loved the cakes you prepared for us to eat on the way to New York. I'll remember your kindness for ever.,,,,,

I went to Boston with my 2 teenagers for a college visit, during marathon weekend no less!  Susan was so helpful with suggestions on what to do, how to get there, and took  a genuine interest in our lives while we were with her.  Her home is 3 minutes from the T stop and we had no trouble with public transformation."

177129,73260058,2016-05-07,23948502,Chenying,"Located in a sweet neighborhood, Susan's house is clean and well-maintained. 0.2 mile away from red line, Shawnut Station; Susan is an accommodating host; she welcomed us with hot tea, biscuits, and her cute dog, Zoey. She introduced a lot of rules and reminders that we should know when living there. She also sent me warm farewell texts:). As a reference for future residents, the following information might be helpful."
1. Don't park your car at Allston St,as there is a 2-hour limit. Feel free to park at nearby streets.,,,,
2. You need to share restroom with other guests in the house. (The restroom is clean. My mum ran into another guest when she used restroom at 3am in the morning.),,,,,
3. Kitchen is available for breakfast prepared by Susan. However,it is generally reserved for long-term guests,which means you need to dine outside for lunch and dinner,Just in case you want to cook,Susan must be present to get any needed equipment. Besides,guests are responsible for purchasing all the ingredients
4. Air mattress: you pay a flat rate of $20. Let Susan know in advance and she will prepare it for you. The air mattress sounded noisy when I turned over at night.,,,,,
5. I saw Zoey play with my parents' shoes. While Susan stopped Zoey from doing so,"I suggest Susan buy a shoe cabinet to make sure guests' shoes are clean and safe at the door. \"",,,,

We really liked her lovely home,and felt totally comfortable and welcome there. It's in a really neat,historic area,and is only a few minutes from the T stop on the Red Line,which gave us easy access to all the best places in Boston.,
Breakfast was a treat every morning,we loved everything,"especially her granola. Her experience in the hospitality industry makes her a true professional. \"",,,

177129,80108446,2016-06-16,1984955,Steve,My son oscar stayed with Susan who was a very generous host. Oscar thoroughly enjoyed his stay and Provided much reassurance to a slightly anxious parent whose young son was far from home. Thanks again Susan and if you R ever in London we would love to host you. Steve
177129,82671655,2016-06-28,37741451,Jenny,"Susan is a meticulous host. She goes out of her way to ensure that her guests have the best possible experience, from clear and respectful guidelines to delicious and comprehensive breakfasts. Her home is very convenient, being so close to the Red train line into the city. The room was airy and spacious, very clean and comfortable. Having stayed at many Airbnb homes, this is one of the best."
177129,84047040,2016-07-05,31534653,Stacy,"Susan is a great host! Her house is really nice. If you are driving to Boston, this will be a really convenient place for you to park your car and take subway to the city."
The only thing I had to adjust is that there's only one bathroom in the house,sometimes you need to wait for a little bit to take a shower. Other than that,I think this will be a great place to stay when you come to Boston.,,,
"\"",,,,,
177129,89985165,2016-07-30,14387406,Frederik,"I believe the pictures depicts the house wrongly. The rooms are very dark because the curtains and windows are closed at any time. Furthermore you are not allowed to go outside into the backyard and get some fresh air. That was really weird, when the host said that it was because the terrace was broken, but she used it herself. The bedrooms were fine and the breakfast was really nice with a lot of fruit. Susan helped us with barberque and that was so helpful of her. The main problem about this stay is that you dont feel like home at all. There is a lot of house rules, which is fine. But she turned very angry and kick the kitchen door when we took a piece of plastic for our food. That felt really unpleasant and you didn't want to be in the kitchen/dinning room. It was like walking in a mine field, you never knew when you were going to hit the mine. This is my very first try with AirBnB and way from succesfull. I believe that it is miss-guiding saying that the neighborhood is historic. It was nice that the metro was close, but you didn't want to go out at night in the area."
177129,90590890,2016-08-01,3147532,Peggy,Susan was there to greet us when we arrived. We travelled a long distance and she she kept in touch about our arrival time as we progressed. The house is immaculately clean. She made us feel immediately at home and like honored guests! She clearly communicated expectations and hopes for our stay. This will be our home away from home when we visit Boston again!
177129,92410800,2016-08-08,87096089,Owlina,"Susan is a fantastic host, the perfect mix of formality and personal warmth! We adored her calm & peaceful ways and above all, her constant smiling face. She welcomed us with drinks & snacks on our arrival, which was absolutely unexpected. She was ALWAYS there making sure that every need was covered & provided us with plenty of tips and advice about the city & the neighbourhood. It was great to be experiencing a real part of the city rather than staying in an informal & impersonal hotel anywhere else. We especially loved our daily baked cakes & fresh fruit for breakfast, plus you couldn't really starve in terms of quantity. The room and the bathroom we shared with another guest were absolutely enough according to our needs."
I wouldn't recommend Susan's place to non-dog lovers as they might not enjoy the animal presence around the house,"but we loved Zoe's company and the fact that she welcomed us every time we came back home & spent some time with us at breakfast time! She's such a cute and sweet little girl!\"",,,,

Every morning breakfast was prepared which was especially awesome being the foodie that I am. To top it off, Susan is a great host. She went out of her way to make sure things were going smoothly within the house and in regards to our Boston visit as well. She is so friendly and nice! If you don't know what to do in the area, she will surely give you plenty of ideas, and ways to get to your destination. Also, Zoe, her dog was an absolute pleasure!! I would definetely stay at this location again if I was in the area."

12593869,81438672,2016-06-23,73563805,Aaditya,Marie is an amazing host. You can tell she really cares about making her guests feel at home. There was food and water waiting for me after a long trip and she was flexible with short-term changes. I can't wait to stay with Marie again. The T was a 10-15 minute walk but even closer if you take the bus. The bus stop is around the corner and overall I was happy with the apartment.
12593869,87925260,2016-07-22,81023997,Christine,Marie was great. She went out of her way to ensure I had transit from the airport to the room. She checked on me every now and then. Made sure we had all of the utilities we need.

Previous to our stay, my wife and I booked a room at a hotel in the center of the city for about $300 a night, and comparatively, the experience and amenities were far nicer at Rain's condo — and for less than half the price. Five stars all the way."

Looking at the top of the Hyatt Regency from the bedroom window reminded me of when I stayed there on another trip and I was struck with how much higher quality Rain's accommodations are than the Hyatt's.

8733896,61098361,2016-01-31,48926792,Elizabeth,Rain was just amazing.   She communicated with us clearly - even sending photos of what the apartment building looked liked from the outside so that we could locate it more easily.
She also arranged for us to gain access in case she would not be at home when we arrived.  She thought of everything.  Rain is very busy and isn't around all the time so you may not see much of her.,,,,,
The apartment is spotlessly,utterly pristine in all respects. Being from the UK we really appreciated that there was a kettle in the kitchen.,,,,
Rain herself is a multi-talented,super-smart individual and is a joy to talk to.  3 minutes walk to South Station,the flat is very conveniently located.  Literally around the corner - less than 2 minutes walk -  is a lovely winebar/restaurant that calls itself the best wine bar in Boston.,,,
If you want to be close to South Station this is an ideal place to stay and Rain is a superb host.,,,,,

She always responds quickly whenever I have any questions. Checking in and out were easy and smooth. The apartment is spacious, new and super clean. I particularly like the interior design and decoration of the apartment. It has a unique style that is really fascinating. Even some of the paintings on the wall were painted by Rain herself.

The bed was very comfortable and the private bath was very nice. We didn't get a chance to interact much with Rain, but she was available via other communications so we were able to coordinate our arrival and departure easily.

The beds were comfortable, and all the common areas worked out well for our family. The house has all the comforts of a home rather than feeling like a sterile rental. Very convenient to Main Street with shops and restaurants, including Whole Foods. Our communication with the host leading up to and during the stay was easy and there were no issues. Highly recommended."

She was kind enough to wait up until I arrived then provided my friend and I with both a CharlieCard and maps of the city to help us. The location was incredibly convenient as well as being in a charming neighborhood.
7708436,48891600,2015-09-29,41136824,Udo,"Ann war sehr hilfsbereit, hat uns Kaffee, Tee, Brot und die U-Bahnkarte aufs Zimmer gelegt und uns angeboten, uns von den Tomaten im kleinen Garten hinter dem Haus zu bedienen. Die Wohnung ist gut ausgestattet, ein abgetrenntes kleines Schlafzimmer mit Queen-Bett, ein Wohnbereich mit Esstisch, zwei bequeme Sessel, Kühlschrank, Microwelle, Toaster, Wasserkocher und Spüle, sodass wir uns das Frühstück hier sehr gut selbst machen konnten. Das Bad ist geräumig, wenn auch, wie die ganze Wohneinheit, etwas älter und abgenutzt. Sehr vorteilhaft ist die Nähe der U-Bahn-Station der Orange Line, mit der man in 10 Minuten in Boston ist. Natürlich hört man die Züge, ist aber eigentlich nicht schlimm, weil nachts keine mehr fahren."

Private parking which is a good plus in Boston.  It is in a nice,quiet neighborhood,but close to the Green Line with the ability to get to downtown Boston.  Jamaica Plain is a wonderful place to visit.  Lots of multicultural restaurants,walks around Jamaica Pond,and shopping at the local stores.,

Ann welcomed us with a bowl of fruit and other snacks and had tea and coffee available; even offering a bowl of soup if we were hungry. The location is quiet with a very comfy bed, great for a good night' s sleep after being out all day.

Lovely apartment is tucked away in a quiet green area of JP, yet an easy flat walk to the shops and cafes of Centre Street, plus excellent walking & biking paths close by.  A walk around Jamaica Pond is a nice way to unwind at the end of the day and only 20 minutes walk from her home and the T line one street away.  My husband and I really appreciated  the basket of fruit & other goodies for us in the fridge, after a long day of traveling.  Thank you, Ann, for your kind and warm hospitality!"

The apartment is cozy and quiet and just right for a peaceful night's rest after a busy day in the city. We had everything we needed and felt like we were coming home every time we entered after being out for the day. Ann was a delight to talk with providing us with information and history about JP. It turned out to be our favorite neighborhood. We arrived very late after multiple delays in our efforts to get to the apartment, but Ann responded very graciously and stayed awake to show us our room and orient us to the neighborhood. She provided great coffee and breakfast items to get us started on our visit the next morning. We plan to stay with Ann at the end of our trip on our way out and will seek her rental again if we ever come back to the Boston area."

The pictures show the apartment accurately and it was spotless upon arrival. It was a very comfortable stay for the 2 of us.

Additionally, when I arrived she took time to talk with me about the neighborhood and some provided a list of restaurants, stores and sites in the neighborhood.

Ann had some snacks, coffee and tea for us. She is so welcoming and provides great information about local places to eat, shop and walk. Such a great value compared to the hotels in Boston."
7708436,96369525,2016-08-22,14469028,Sigurgestur,"Staying at Ann´s place was just perfect. Only a few steps to the Green st T, and your downtown in a matter of minutes. Ann was extremely welcoming but still gave us all the privacy we needed."
House is old and creaky but has a rustic charm.,,,,,
If you end up staying here we recommend a couple of things close by:,,,,,
Samuel Adams brewery has a tasting party every third Thursday,definitely a must.,,,,
Chilacates is a cute little mexican place next to the brewery (couple of steps from Stony Brook T station) and we loved it.,,,,,
For Brunch we urge you to try out The Dogwood,in front of Forest Hills station. Lovely place,good food and great athmo.,,,
All in all,"we loved our stay in Jamaica Plain!\"",,,,
7708436,99166497,2016-09-03,6452808,Elizabeth,"We had a wonderful stay at Ann’s place in JP. On arrival, she guided us from the T station which is one block from her nice and quiet house. Our upstairs rooms were just as anticipated from the photographs on her listing and had everything we needed. Ann was helpful and thoughtful during our time there. We look forward to another trip to Boston!"
4331214,21635635,2014-10-20,22370756,Joe,"I had a wonderful stay here! The location is very convenient and close to subway station. Lisa and John provide every little thing that I didn't expect like tooth brush & paste, snack, breakfast etc.  All they do is to make guests comfortable in their house. I love 2 cute cats very much especially talkative Butter. I will definitely stay here for my next visit to Boston."
4331214,21915275,2014-10-26,22586833,Ben,Great place to stay. Very easy to come and go as I needed. The room was as described and very quiet. A great place to stay and see Boston.
4331214,22123697,2014-10-30,22644595,Geola,"Another great stay at the serene, green oasis.  I feel very welcome here and the room is great.  Lisa thinks of everything you could possibly need.  And the location is perfect - great transportation to the heart of Boston."
4331214,22624961,2014-11-10,23255248,Danqi,"Lisa and John are very nice people! They prepared even chocolate and snacks to welcome me even I arrived late. The location is extremely convenient, and it is such a sweet place. I feel myself at home."
4331214,22744952,2014-11-13,22644595,Geola,"Another wonderful stay at the serene, green oasis.  Lisa thinks of everything to make her home welcoming for everyone."
4331214,23632792,2014-12-07,2045189,Nicoline,"The Oasis turned out to be the perfect base for me when I came to Boston for an interview:  friendly, yet unintrusive hosts, nice cats, great location.  Be sure to read the instructions about the winter temperature in the house; I found it a little chilly in the upstairs bedroom, but the rest of the house was comfortable enough for me.  I look forward to coming again!"
4331214,30362862,2015-04-20,18644153,John,My stay with Lisa was great. I was in town for work and arrived pretty late and she was very accomodating of my schedule. The place was great; I'm not very familiar with Boston but at least for my needs it was very convenient to get around (w/o a car).  This is my first experience with AirBnb and I'm not quite sure what else might be pertinent to add but it really was a great experience and I imagine that I will see them again soon and I couldn't recommend her place highly enough.
4331214,30553448,2015-04-24,5743947,Barry,"I did feel warmly welcomed.  There was water and treats in the room, a thoughtful heater tho I didn't need it.  The place was exactly as described.  The only downside for me was the room was on a different floor than the bathroom, but that was fully disclosed in advance.  The shared bathroom was fine.  Lisa was available for questions, but we didn't socialize, which was fine given my schedule.  The location was perfect, quiet enough for sleep.  The room was clean."
4331214,31134073,2015-05-02,22644595,Geola,"Another fabulous stay at the serene, green oasis.  I'm always so glad when I get my confirmation because I love staying with Lisa."
4331214,34737486,2015-06-11,32911088,Anna,Staying with Lisa was great. Felt very comfortable and welcome. Especially liked that I was able to cook and keep some groceries in a mini fridge in the kitchen. Would definitely go back!
4331214,35011029,2015-06-14,18357771,Holly,I had a great stay in JP! Lisa was as lovely as her quaint home. I didn't spend much time there but it was a great home base while in town.
There was coffee available in the morning and I was greeted with Pellegrino and chocolate! The third floor room was as described and quite warm in June,but the fan helped. Sharing a bathroom one floor below was not an issue.,,,,
The home is very close to the T and quiet...a nice respite from the hustle of downtown Boston but easy to get to for exploring.,,,,,
"After running in the Arboretum one morning I enjoyed coffee in the garden in the Adirondack chair...highly recommended. Thank you again!\"",,,,,
4331214,36125936,2015-06-25,5292200,Angela,Lisa was great! And the location was perfect since we had friends in JP and Roslindale that needed to coordinate transportation. Strongly recommended! Cool cats too.
4331214,37912549,2015-07-11,22026733,Brenda,Thank you so much Lisa and John the best accommodations very homey very caring giving I will see you again
4331214,38355245,2015-07-14,1105800,Shelley,"Such a great visit! Lisa's home has a fantastic, funky aesthetic - from the eclectic furniture in the bedroom (and these amazing orange curtains that make the room glow this beautiful orange as the sun rises to her fab appointed kitchen and beautifully tiled bathroom. Lisa was super friendly and just a really wonderful conversationalist - I was really grateful to have interesting and stimulating conversations about journalism, baking homemade bread and her lovely garden."
My only tip is READ THE DIRECTIONS TO GET TO THE HOUSE,because Lisa wrote out detailed directions and then was very gracious with me when I showed up lost not having read them! :/ Don't be like me!,,,,
But,yes! Awesome stay and would hope to be staying here again on another visit! Totally recommended.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
4331214,39661944,2015-07-25,7389211,Anika,Lisa was really friendly and very welcoming. This was my first air bnb experience and it was great! The garden is a lovely place to sit in the evening. The room was very clean. Thank you!
4331214,40388386,2015-07-30,22026733,Brenda,Lisa I can't thank you enough for your great home!!  I am a repeat visitor here and feel so at home while I am here!
4331214,41669238,2015-08-08,51538,Jeremy,"Terrific place!  Easy access from the T, clean, and with warm and friendly hosts.  Highly recommended."
4331214,42767136,2015-08-15,13935663,Dave,"I really enjoyed staying with Lisa and John. They opened their home to me, and especially the use of the kitchen, which I unfortunately did not take advantage of. Their home is in a very nice, quiet neighborhood with free street parking and that was close to the bus line, which I used all 5 days during my stay. They are also within walking distance to a nice area in Jamaica Plain with shops, restaurants and coffee shops, etc. Their home is a charming old farm house tucked away from the street with vegetable and flower gardens out front, very much an oasis! I had a very intense workshop and coming back to their place in the evening felt like my sanctuary for the week. I also appreciated connecting with John, and we always seemed to have an evening conversation about life in Boston.  The room I stayed in was modest but the bed was very, very  comfortable and I slept well. The price was very reasonable maybe because of a shared bathroom. My experience with Lisa and John was very pleasant. I would recommend staying with them to anyone. Thank you Lisa and John for hosting me!"
4331214,43442458,2015-08-19,41174629,Rachel,"Lisa and John are incredible people! They are so warm and welcoming I felt like I had been visiting them my whole life! I really enjoyed chatting with them both :) Her beautiful home was very easy to get to from the T. I super appreciate the exact directions she sent me. It made my trip from the airport completely stress free. The room and very cozy, comfortable and clean. Absolutely everything about my stay was fantastic!"
4331214,43875384,2015-08-22,17658818,Jeff,"Lisa and John are super nice. Lisa did a great job of communicating with me. The location is great. When all the rooms are let, there might be a short wait for the bathroom. I would stay there again."
4331214,44812188,2015-08-29,40456302,Robert,"Just spent a lovely week in Boston, US, in the B&B of Lisa Vaas, indeed a serence, green oasis in funky Jamaica Plain, a hip neighborghood in this great city."
The location was very convenient,close to the Green street station on the Orange Line. Boston public transportation system is lovingly old-fashioned,but very efficient,with frequent trains bringing me in 20 minutes to any hall mark in the city,for 20 US$ per week,including the trip from and to the airport.
Lisa's house is a lovely New England wooden construction,with ingenious windows,open but closed to insects,letting the cool marine breeze go trought the house.,,
My room was  just what I needed with a good bed.,,,,,
The badroom is common  with the owners,as is the kitchen,with enough ustensiles to feed an army. I made my morning omelette with tomatoes and herbs from the garden. Staying in this house was also a gentle course in environmental protection,nutritional health,and waste management. We had lovely conversations with Lisa and her husband,on the history of the PC
In short my stay was cosy,convenient,"and cool (in both meanings of the word). \"",,,
4331214,47502450,2015-09-19,33897278,Cecilia,"The apartment is super cute and comfortable. I was working a ton while I was staying with Lisa so didn't get to interact very much with her, but when I did she was lovely.  Perfect hosts!"
4331214,48110961,2015-09-23,43066869,Woo,Perfect!
4331214,48765405,2015-09-28,15269789,Noa,"Lisa is warm and friendly and gave me detailed information when I arrived about little things like how to adjust the water in the shower. She also left me one of the best chocolate bars I have ever tasted, which I really appreciated. We had a little snafu with room directions--she has two different rooms that she rents out and had sent me directions to the wrong one--but it was no big deal and sorted out quickly. This room--3rd floor--has a SUPER comfortable bed, as advertised, which was the most important thing for me. Don't stay with her if high water pressure in the shower is important to you, but if it's not, then definitely do stay here."
4331214,50493301,2015-10-12,33292147,Laura,"I was in town visiting a bunch of friends and running a race and needed a quite, conveniently located place to stay.  This room fit the bill!  It's a quick walk from the T, was really close to the race and in a very quiet neighborhood (though close to center street restaurants!)."
Lisa did everything possible to make me feel at home,"even though I wasn't around much.  Definitely a spot I'd stay at again!\"",,,,
4331214,51374977,2015-10-19,9171086,Mariah,"The directions were excellent. The cat welcomed me which was fine because the written directions were so good! The room was as described, clean and comfortable. I had an enjoyable stay."
4331214,52283544,2015-10-27,3440901,Josh,"Lisa was great, very welcoming, very generous. The place was exactly as described. The neighborhood was very nice, quiet, felt very safe to me. I felt like my room was perfect for the price. Bed was very comfortable, plenty of extra blankets, and towels, and I'm sure if I had needed anything Lisa would have provided it."
4331214,53019466,2015-11-03,46710292,Taylor,"The host was generous, kind and fun."
4331214,53539377,2015-11-09,43699714,Barry,Lisa lives in a safe and very pleasant neighbourhood which gives you an insight to American life. The room was exactly as described and Lisa's home is beautiful. Lisa made me feel very welcome giving me easy to follow directions and a sincere welcome upon my arrival where where I gained a insight into current affairs over a glass of wine.
4331214,56517927,2015-12-14,16756608,Helen,"Lisa is a fantastic host! I stayed for 10 days when I moved to Boston and was looking for a place to live, and couldn't have chosen a better spot to land. She and her partner John (and their two cats) were very welcoming, and were very free with good information about Boston and JP. Their house is very comfortable and laid back, and I felt right at home immediately. Plus, it's right on the Orange line into the city, so very convenient for any sightseeing you might do, and was great for me getting to work. I almost wish I wasn't living in Boston so I could go stay there again! Highly recommended to anyone coming to Boston."
4331214,58746360,2016-01-04,48484486,Katie,"It was such a pleasure staying with Lisa and John. I stayed for 10 days which included Christmas and New Years. They provided a home, friendship, flexibility, professionalism and a perfect Airb&b experience. I'd recommend staying with them to anyone and cannot thank them enough for a wonderful experience."
4331214,61311788,2016-02-02,53959736,Stephen,"I had a great stay with Lisa and her husband John.  The room was exactly as described - it looks like the pictures, is very close to public transportation, and is definitely serene in a funky neighborhood.  Lisa and John were very welcoming hosts, happy to answer questions or chat, and very interesting to talk to given their varied experiences.  At the same time, they were very easygoing, and not needing to talk during the periods of time when I was writing.  They had very helpful recommendations, and there are a number of cool coffee shops and places to eat very close to where they live.  Overall, it was very comfortable and enjoyable, and I'd definitely recommend it to others."
4331214,64217582,2016-03-01,14562424,Suria,I stayed with Lisa for a month while I looked for more permanent accommodations after moving to Boston for work.  She and John were great! I was able to come and go as I pleased and had full access to the kitchen (and cleaned up after myself) for all of my cooking and refrigeration needs.  They also provided information about different Boston neighborhoods which helped in my apartment search.  The room looks as advertised and the closet has plenty of hangers.  I do recommend this as a place to stay while in Boston.
4331214,88150795,2016-07-23,1515405,Sky,"Friendly hosts! In town on business, the proximity to the orange line was great."
8371203,48946961,2015-09-29,16969486,Scott,"Wow, this was my first Airbnb, and it was just exceptional.  Judith and Albert were so sweet.  The room was very comfortable and the location was a nice middle class, Boston neighborhood.  The home was a $10 uber ride into Boston.  Judith and Albert invited me down to breakfast each morning were Judith and I had very pleasant conversations."
8371203,49744378,2015-10-05,44296983,Markus,Edith and her husband were very nice during my stay. I delayed my arrival and check-in from the morning to later in the evening and they were very accomodating and flexible.
They offered breakfast and a ride on the next morning.,,,,,
Room was clean,bed comfortable,"fruits were provided - overall very nice.\"",,,
8371203,51396570,2015-10-19,23256694,Helen,Truly lovely stay in a beautiful home.  Edith and her family are super helpful and friendly!  The rooms are lovely and clean and the house full of character!
8371203,70379558,2016-04-17,64477125,Christiann,"My experience with Edith and her husband Albert was one I'll never forget, the 360° veiw in room C was great, especially at night when Boston lit up and during the morning sunrise, the bed was comfy, the house is quiet and easy to find, they served breakfast which was unexpected but phenomenal, the best thing about the experience though was Edith and Albert, talk about 2 of the most inviting and kind people you'll ever meet, for ANYONE staying in the Boston area this is the place to be, and if you're Caribbean/west Indian or of that parentage this place will feel like HOME"
8371203,70606800,2016-04-18,1448498,Remo,My stay was absolutely amazing. Edith and Albert (her husband) are potential ''superhosts''. They made me feel welcomed as soon as i entered their house. They offered something to drink and Albert helped me to take my luggage to the room which is located on top of the house. Albert was so kind that he even took me to a restaurant nearby because i was so hungry.
The next day he texted me that breakfast is ready,which i didn't know was included. What a lovely surprise!,,,,
The room has a 360 view (downtown Boston!). The bed is super comfy and you definitely won't get cold because of the heating.,,,,,
"I absolutely recommend to stay at Edith's and Albert's room. You get treated like you're family!\"",,,,,
8371203,78897656,2016-06-10,21537376,Rose,"Albert gave me the warmest welcome when I arrived and I immediately felt at home.

You won't regret staying here."
8371203,80956233,2016-06-20,243471,VacaHomes,"Edith Place was great, clean, comfortable  and prepared to receive guest at any time. Edith and her husband were not only accommodating but also a true charm. They even offered to drive me to the train station and to cook me breakfast.  The best host I have ever met."
The neighborhood,might be find by some a little sketchy,but it was actually ok,I never felt unsafe. A short distance in bus,"train or uber to Downtown Boston. I absolutely recommend Edith's place.\"",

180914,2642091,2012-10-17,3564566,Barbara,"It was difficult finding a 1 bedroom apartment in Boston in a reasonable location in mid October over a month ahead of time.  We paid over $300 a night.  The apartment was fine although the pull-out couch very very uncomfortable.  The most difficult part was communication with the managing company.  Traffic was backed up and we couldn't get to the apartment until just after the concierge left, and finding someone to help was difficult.  I encountered the RUDEST MOST SARCASTIC female on the phone I have ever imagined.  So stressful."
180914,3501597,2013-02-09,4482029,Margaret,"The apartment was nice, the location was great...lots of places to eat, shopping, things to do.  Close to train stop.  Very nice experience.  Will stay again.  Thank you."

9731479,68306716,2016-04-04,1600930,Katrina,This apartment was in a great location for us ... 6 - 8 minute walk to the closest T stop and 1 or 2 minutes to two bus lines.  The directions Viktoria provided from the airport were bang on.
The beds were very comfortable,the pressure of the shower great,and the kitchen fairly well equipped.  I did mention to Viktoria on our last day that the kitchen could use more (small) drinking glasses as we ended up using coffee mugs for most beverages ... she seemed quite receptive to the idea.,,,
Checking in and out was a breeze.  Viktoria was prompt in her responses to any inquiries.,,,,,
The wifi was screaming fast (clocked at 70 Mbps download and 12 Mbps for upload speeds) ... at least compared to what I'm used to at home,and in other rentals or hotels.,,,,
"Highly recommended.\"",,,,,
9731479,69149673,2016-04-09,568628,Jim,I would definitely stay here again.  The apartment is very clean and well organized.

I'd definitely book here again the next time I'm in town!"
9731479,70673614,2016-04-19,22623950,Paul,"Perfect location! We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Great apartment, and close to everything. Very nice."
9731479,71490865,2016-04-25,8634263,Bri,Easy to get in and out with those box keys so you don't have to coordinate meeting for keys! Viktoria was quick to respond and easy to get ahold of if we needed anything. Was a treat to stay here! Close to a lot. Bed was super comfy =)
9731479,72021226,2016-04-30,16658275,Carolyn,"Viktoria's place was wonderful! Incredible location, very clean, and had a great rooftop deck. Everything was as she said it would be."
9731479,72841190,2016-05-04,1367652,Monique And Danny,"Danny and his work colleague had a lovely time in this beautiful, comfortable, and well-located penthouse. Viktoria was great responding to their questions and even allowed them to send mail to the flat. When they were out of the flat and the mail was locked in the mailbox, Viktoria's assistant came by to leave the mail in a more accessible place for pickup. Great host and flat. Thank you!"
9731479,74260202,2016-05-14,27475773,Tim,Viktoria's property was great - quiet street with great light.  I rented for work and had ample indoor space for a desk using the dining room high table but the roof deck was also great for evening emails looking out over the Back Bay skyline
9731479,76319667,2016-05-26,55293117,Megan,Viktoria was a great hostess. The apartment was absolutely incredible and convenient to so many places. This was our first trip to Boston and the book she provided with tips about the city was so helpful. We will definitely go back and would love to stay here again. Thanks Viktoria for opening your home and making our trip incredible!
9731479,76665793,2016-05-28,11834876,Ashley,"Very enjoyable. The place was beautiful, and inviting. The balconies were incredible and absolutely the highlight of our stay."
9731479,77821074,2016-06-03,6002628,Clare,"Viktoria was very communicative prior to our booking and arrival, and was able to offer tips on how to get to Boston from New York, which was very kind. She also asked a bit about us so as to check we were appropriate guests for her apartment and area, which was beneficial for both host and guest arrival at the apartment was easy, though we did not meet Victoria. It was unfortunate that the outside seating was wet and dirty on arrival, but overall the apartment was really nice and in good condition, in an excellent part of town. It was great to have a booklet of local recommendations. It was a shame however, that I had a problem with my bed on two nights of the three night stay. I was awoken in the night by one of the three slats of the bed (bedroom two) breaking, and as such was unable to sleep on the bed for the rest of the night. Although someone came to make sure it held up for the second night, the same thing happened again, as the bed was not in the best condition with two mattresses on top of one another, springs visible and only a few slats underneath to support the weight and I am only an average sized girl. I would recommend the location and general state of the apartment but would advise checking on the second bedroom situation. furthermore I thought this could have been dealt with a lot better. Although Victoria/her PA (I was never quite sure who was responding to my emails) was generally polite, there was no real acknowledgement of the gravity of the situation, particularly having paid a substantial amount of money for what was supposed to be a luxury apartment. All I wanted was two decent beds for the night and this was ultimately not provided. It did not really feel that we with the priority here but just part of their business and I spent a significant amount of my time having to deal with emails et cetera and eventually having to ask if there would be a financial refund of sorts of fed. I found the initial gesture of $50 quite insulting considering the bed broke two nights on the run and it was a shame we had to wait longer in order to agree on a fairer amount. I am sure other people will enjoy staying here and have the bed been fine, this would have been a really good place to stay. Unfortunate I think is the best way to describe or stay here."
9731479,78132168,2016-06-05,5599628,Matt,"Beautiful place!  The views from the roof deck were awesome and it was great place to relax.  Parking is very close and inexpensive at 505 Tremont.  Plenty of great food options nearby and easy access to any part of the city is just a few blocks away.  The SoWa Oopen Market is just a couple blocks away for great crafts and food trucks.  We had a group of 4, so dishes were limited and could have used a couple other things for cooking at the apartment.  Similarly, towels were limited for us.  But, overall, it was a great place and one I would go back to in a heartbeat.  Viktoria provided some great information on the surrounding area prior to the visit and there is a great guide in the apartment that highlights everything.  Couldn't have asked for much more!"
9731479,78781367,2016-06-09,6559267,Bekkie,"Really easy check in, beautiful apartment with an AMAZING rooftop - my stay was really enjoyable, easy and I LOVED the apartment - thank you!"
9731479,79351790,2016-06-12,68586775,Sharon,"The Unit was in a very nice neighborhood.  There are couple sets of steep stairs to get to the unit, but once there the beds were very comfortable.  The shower pressure was good but not enough hot water for the second person depending on timing.   Place was adequately stocked except It could  use another set of towels.  The host was very efficient in replies to email."

9731479,85743148,2016-07-13,29768511,Ernest,An absolutely fantastic stay and hosting experience. The place itself is beautiful and exactly as described. The rooftop deck is really peaceful with a beautiful view of downtown Boston. Viktoria was so helpful and responsive to our many questions and really went above and beyond to accommodate us. This was a wonderful experience and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend staying with Viktoria to my friends and family.
9731479,87521231,2016-07-20,30167251,Tori,"Viktoria was helpful in letting us drop our bags off early, the place was very open and the roof was great."
9731479,88240623,2016-07-23,2819195,Sarah,"The apartment was in a great location and was very clean. Roof deck is lovely and has views of all of Boston. The only complaint I have is that the apartment had a faint smell of cigarette smoke. I am not sure if someone had smoked in the apartment previously or if someone in the building smokes. Otherwise, I would highly recommend this place - can't beat the location and the outdoor space!! The host was responsive when I had any questions."
9731479,89482046,2016-07-28,17894481,Michelle,"Great location in the South End with great food options. We loved the roof top deck in the evenings and the T was about 10min walk away. We had difficulty getting the AC to work in the beginning but we spoke with Viktoria's assistant who helped. The host is not super close to the loft for in-person needs. There was 1 washcloth and no extra blankets or extra towels for 4 people. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend this location!"
9731479,90274153,2016-07-31,68405342,Jean-Marc,"The apartment is really well located, in a nice and quiet street. It is exactly as shown on the pictures with a great terrace on the roof from which you have a great city view. Viktoria is really easy to contact and do her best to help you."
"It is a place that I recommend.\"",,,,,
9731479,91089745,2016-08-03,51126976,Melissa,Viktoria was responsive and we appreciated the information left in the condo about the local area. The condo was excellently situated with a great roof terrace and good nearby restaurants. It was very clean and well decorated with one huge bed and a double. As there were 4 of us we would have liked a few more glasses - one tumbler each and only one wine glass between us all seemed stingy! Apart from that everything was excellent. we would recommend staying here.
9731479,92221676,2016-08-08,21042774,Joel,Great weekend with friends in Boston.  Great location at the heart of the South End.  I would recommend condo to anyone!
9731479,93074935,2016-08-11,13242836,Judith,"We really enjoyed our stay at Viktoria's place. The place was as described, in a lovely neighbourhood. The beds were comfortable and the rooftop patio was simply amazing. The only downfall were the lack of dishes/wine glasses. We were 4 adults and there was only one glass of wine. We also ran out of hot water ... Overall, an amazing stay. Thanks Viktoria."

Her place is spacious with a beautiful roof deck and patio, and is in a great location in the South End. Walk to cute shops, amazing restaurants, and close to the T.  Perfect way to experience Boston!!"
9731479,95456398,2016-08-19,18197139,Richard,"This is a very nice apartment in a picturesque row of brownstones in a great neighborhood.  It's a short walk from the center of Boston.  The decks are superb for relaxing in summer, with good views over the city.  Nearby there are some lovely bars and restaurants.  Viktoria was a good host, answering all our queries promptly.  Be warned that it is a walk up penthouse, so you have to climb some stairs.  Parking is tricky in the area too (as it is in the whole of Boston), although there is a slightly pricey deck at the end of the street.  Overall we had a great time and would highly recommend the apartment."
9731479,97013879,2016-08-25,36772120,Joe,We had a great stay at Viktoria's place. A large living room and kitchen as well as the rooftop terrace was more than enough room for the 4 of us.
The location was also perfect. We could walk to some great restaurants nearby- Giacomo's a favourite for the pasta- which we found in a handy guide Viktoria left. We could also walk to Boston Common and do the freedom trail.,,,,,
Viktoria was very helpful throughout,and recommended 505 Tremont for parking which worked very well.,,,,
"Would definitely recommend! \"",,,,,
8753913,51383024,2015-10-19,1547546,Sonja,"My friends and I had an amazing stay at Patrick's place in Boston! The apartment was just as described and was extremely comfortable. The place is spacious with comfortable beds and a nice living space. Having access to a full kitchen with utensils, cookware, etc is also really nice if you want to eat in.The location also couldn't be better! It is very close to restaurants, bars and main sites in Boston (and close to the orange line T and bus stop). We had 2 cars and were easily able to find free street parking (which can be very challenging in other parts of Boston). Patrick was also very responsive and gave us great suggestions on places to eat and things to do. I would stay here again in a second and highly recommend it!"

The transportation options from this place are great! Patrick is being modest about how wonderfully well situated his apartment is. In addition  to the bus,train and Zipcar options withing one block,Hubway,Boston's bike share program,"has at least three stations within a five minute walk. I love urban biking!\"",
8753913,52525923,2015-10-30,3611129,Jayaram,"Really enjoyed our stay at Patrick's apartment in the South End. The apartment is very spacious, well equipped and lovely. Even better than the photos. Keys in lock boxes make it very easy to get in. Great neighborhood and very central. I can't really say enough about how much we enjoyed staying there. One of my best experiences by using AirBnB! Thanks Patrick!"
8753913,53409083,2015-11-08,8121433,Corey,This was my second time staying at Patrick's place and it was just as wonderful as the first time. I highly recommend to anyone interested in a great apartment with access to all the city has to offer

8753913,72239901,2016-05-01,382173,Casey,"Patrick was really flexible with check in--our conference trip was easy, smooth, and comfortable. The accommodations were extremely clean and roomy. I would absolutely rent this place again if I came with a similar sized group. There are also a lot of great convenient spots around the condo for an authentic Boston visit :)"
8753913,73540318,2016-05-08,38286900,Krystal,"Would 100% recommend staying at this amazing apartment in Boston. Stayed here with three friends during a reunion trip. The apartment was large, clean, and upscale. We felt safe and comfortable in the building. Patrick was a great host and very responsive to all our questions. Also a great location for exploring the city."
8753913,74634129,2016-05-16,29527037,Myles,"I had a fantastic week at Patrick's South End Condo. The apartment is great, a big lounge/kitchen and 2 very good sized bedrooms. It's really near lots of  transport options, I wouldn't recommend bringing in a car into Boston, just use the T and walk. The place was spotless when we arrived, and even little touch like ice cubes in the freezer. It was easy to find, Patrick gave good instructions on how to get the keys. The kitchen was well equipped, but with all the dining options available in Boston we hardly used it! It's on a main road, but the bedrooms are at the back of the property so we had no complaints in that regard. There is a dunkin donuts just 1 block down, it was a life saver most mornings, there is also a pizza place if you need a late night snack. All in all fantastic location, easy to get into central Boston and the Back Bay and a great apartment."

8753913,76860969,2016-05-29,8916882,Ryan,"This was a great spot and we really enjoyed our time.  It was really nice having the two bedrooms and the place was really conveniently located.  We were able to check in early, which was nice as we had taken an early flight in and that let us get a quick nap in before evening festivities.  Would highly recommend for a couples trip to Boston."
8753913,77952044,2016-06-04,4399065,Jakob,"Arrival was pretty easy, Patrick gave us really detailed instructions on everything. The place is great, plenty of space and a nicely equipped kitchen. Everything was spotless and ready to use. We were leaving the apartment a few min after we were supposed to (I was mistaken on the check out time) but the people who were cleaning very exceptionally nice and even reminded me about a few things we were forgetting. Overall an amazing experience."
8753913,78460238,2016-06-06,8464197,Eric,"Not much that hasn't been already covered by previous reviewers.  Patrick made it easy to enter the apartment with lock boxes at necessary spots.  Place was clean and fit our four people pretty comfortably.  Easy access to everywhere we needed to go and overall pretty convenient spot.  Street parking was fairly easy (for us, at least) on Mass Ave or on the street behind the place, near the gas station.  All in all, pretty good stay.  Hot water takes a bit to kick in for a shower, but just a quirk of an old building."
8753913,79686037,2016-06-13,67663178,Tsz,The apartment is very spacious and clean. I enjoy the stay in this apartment.

Very clean place. Thank you for sharing your lovely apartment!"
8753913,92483865,2016-08-08,56047345,Jimmy,Thanks you for the extremely smooth process. Patrick responded to all requests within an hour and the check-in / check-out was extremely smooth. Listing was just as described. We came during one of the hottest weekends of the year so it was a bit warm. Overall very satisfied with our stay.
8753913,92886421,2016-08-10,3404313,Andrew,"Place is great! Booked last minute to catch a Red Sox game and it was perfect. Will definitely stay again if I'm back in the area. Also, make sure to check out Wally's."

Upon one very minor issue ( a drain that wasn't draining) he had a handy man arrive that day to fix it!  His condo is exactly what you see in pictures, clean and plenty spacious.  The place is very clean and located near everything we needed!"

7728508,55198525,2015-11-29,22013599,Sooin,"The location is perfect for being close to shopping, restaurants, Equinox gym, the river, and within walking distance of MIT. I had asked ahead of time if there was a hot water kettle and a bath and they replied right away and seemed to be very responsive. The room is indeed spacious and the kitchen is new and very convenient. The bathroom however hasn't been updated since the 60's or 70's - which isn't a problem- but it is dingy and needs re-grouting or updating."
7728508,56369914,2015-12-13,44822194,William,the host was in contact with me as I got settled which was reassuring.  Thankfully nothing was out of order. The apt was comfortable and bright.

7728508,60798953,2016-01-27,55487057,Janet,"Clean, well-furnished, very nice kitchen. Very nice location on Newbury St. Only objection: I didn't receive the code for the lock box out front that was supposed to contain the key. Had to call FlatBook to get the code. The lock was almost impossible to turn; a man helped me by pouring hot water on it. When it finally opened, it didn't contain the key. The man let us inside the building's hall because it was cold out, and I went up to the apartment and found that it was unlocked and the keys were on the table. I couldn't have gotten into the apartment in the first place if someone hadn't let us into the building."
7728508,61707103,2016-02-07,9317909,Raphael,Staying at this place is one of my highlight of being in Boston. Small yet spacious cozy space. It smells good and you almost feel like you are in a hotel. Amazing service and top location.

7527677,43877332,2015-08-22,11126083,Livia,"Unfortunately not such a nice stay - I planned to stay 10 days but cancelled my booking after the first night. I was given a different room than I booked, which was clearly less nice than the room I had booked (and according to their own profile also 40 USD per night cheaper, so it would have been a 400 USD difference for the 10 nights). I told Grace that this was not ok for me, but she insisted on charging me the original (more expensive) room, although she offered to repay the cleaning fee (80 USD). Her explanation for this was that in the meantime they had raised their prices and the profile was not up to date. I went to sleep because I was just arriving after a 10 hours flight, but the next day I tried to talk to Charles and Grace again. However, it seemed that they did not understand what my problem was and in the end I cancelled the stay. Maybe it was a misunderstanding after all, but I think that if you give someone a less nice room than they booked, you should at least adjust the price. The fact that they did not seem to understand this was very weird for me and I did not feel comfortable there."
7527677,47372538,2015-09-18,40278466,Moniem,Positives: Charles and Grace did everything they could to make me feel welcome. They were pleasant right through my trip. My room was more spacious than I expected.
Negatives: The apartment was completely fine and clean to live in but quite old and,after seeing it in person,"was way overpriced. After getting to know Boston I realised there are nicer more modern places for similar price. (I prefer modern but depends on the individual I guess.) You have also have to pay to use washer and dryer every time. (minor but wasn't in description).\"",,,

Upon arrival we were kindly offered a box of delicious marzipan. The apartment itself is top notch: vast, stylish, as clean as can be. Overall a very positive experience that i'd recommend to anyone."
13714934,88421156,2016-07-24,31053532,Erik,"Very convenient place to stay. Too short to have the full impression, but worth visiting again if Boston is on our path next time."

13927765,86011873,2016-07-14,30732884,Jeffery,"I had a great stay at Cynthia’s place. It was very clean and had everything I needed.  It is set up similarly to her other apartment, which I stayed at in January.  The place is in a great location and is just a few minutes walk to the train station. I was able to get to downtown Boston in less than 20 minutes.  Cynthia made herself available before and during my stay to answer any questions I had to make my stay comfortable.  I highly recommend this place and I look forward to a future stay the next time I am in Boston."

Silent, safe, clean and in a very calm neighbourhood, we (a family of 4) felt very comfortable at Cynthia's place. Free parking on the street just in front of the apartment was a plus. Subway station two blocks away from the apartment was great since we didn't have to worry about being stuck in Boston traffic. Grocery stores and gas station are in a few blocks. Cynthia was very attentive since the beginning and made all possible to make us feel comfortable at her place. We definitely recommend!"

The 3rd floor apartment was very clean, and she provided nice towels for our showers.  The steps up to the apartment are not steep, so it would not be a problem for most people.  The apartment is located close to the \"\"T\"\""
13927765,94205255,2016-08-15,72128721,Mike,Cynthia was a great host who was incredibly responsive to any questions and took quick care of some special requests we had for our stay.
The location is a very good staging area for trips into downtown Boston.  The area was safe,"and I wish I had more time to hang out in the park across the street.   All of the facilities were clean and in great condition.\"",,,,

13927765,96843574,2016-08-24,30605639,Thomas,Cynthia was very easy to work with and made us feel very welcome. The apartment appeared as everything was brand new and was spotlessly clean.  Really enjoyed the 55-inch TV. The apartment was conveniently located just 3 blocks from the Shawmut subway stop on the red-line.  Would definitely recommend.

Une belle place que je conseille fortement."

The location is in a safe area one block off of Dorchester Avenue, which has some great restaurants and bars (including some incredible and cheap Vietnamese food). The red line (JFK/UMass) is less than a 10 minute walk. Paul is a fantastic host and I felt immediately at home with him and his friends. The apartment is clean, nicely furnished and decorated. The rented bedroom has a desk, a chair, and a bed - which is all I really needed. There is a fully stocked kitchen and a grocery store about 20 minutes walking (there's also a bus that gets there in less than 5 minutes). As far as other activities, I highly recommend running down towards the bay - there's a wonderful bayfront walk that makes for a fantastic morning run. Overall, highly recommended."

766700,4992930,2013-06-06,5413427,Danny,"Nice apartment, with nice view of the church. Sean replied us very promptly at all times and helped us when we had to move out."
766700,5013867,2013-06-07,6626535,Wendie,"As others have noted, this is a perfect location for exploring this wonderful North End neighborhood (and beyond) It was remarkably quiet given the tight buildings..and as it's top floor, no footsteps overhead. We are actually from another Boston 'hood', and we're having a ball exploring our own city (highly recommend, wherever you live, getting to know your own back yard in this quirky way)"
For folks with physical limitations,yes,it's up 4 narrow,not super clean,flights of stairs...and the building itself is at the end of an  alley. We scrounged a bit for sheets  and covers...and while sufficiently clean,the place felt a little tired...but truly the location makes up for any short comings. Great cafes
766700,5021868,2013-06-08,6116118,Federica & Matteo,Super great and cheap location right on the Freedom Trail in the North End for our one night stay in Boston!!!
The apartment was very big for the two of us,confortable and really charming with its brick wall in the living room and parquet floor. Perfectly working WiFi,useful Boston plans and quick tourist brochures available there.,,,
Sean,"thank you for the 2 FREE vintage bikes: Biking in Boston was an unforgettable experience... we enjoyed it sooooo much!! We could see the town under a beautiful light!\"",,,,

766700,5194033,2013-06-17,6745696,Maria,"I had a very pleasant stay at the apartment which is indeed in a great location! The place was clean and in good condition. Internet was not available. There was a little misunderstanding on the flexible check out time but not intentional ad the communication was really good. Overall, this is a recommended accommodation and Jose is a nice guy."
766700,5280564,2013-06-22,5777872,Josh,"Excellent place. As other reviewers said, there are a lot of narrow steps. Great location. It was clean and very nice. If I had one complaint, it would be that there wasn't a lot of cooking utensils (pots/pans/cutlery/etc). Absolutely enough to get by, but very little. Overall, amazing place! The North End is amazing."
766700,5297876,2013-06-23,6615425,Kelly,Great location in the North End. Convenient walk to lots of restaurants and the subway. Jose was easy to get a hold of when we had a question.
766700,5376512,2013-06-27,5319493,Carly,"Amazing location, clean, and true to photos.  If you're not a big fan of steep stairs, I would not recommend this apartment, however, I was very happy to stay here and call the North End home for our trip to Boston.  We were literally steps from the Old North Church and were able to soak in a neighborhood full of great food and smells that other tourists typically only spend a few hours in.  We were also about a ten minute walk to two different T stops and blocks from the water and historical sites."
The apartment was quiet and equipped with an air conditioning unit that kept the bedroom cool at night.  My one gripe is that both the faucet in the kitchen and bathroom shower needed to be dipped in CLR or something as both kind of sprayed in the wrong directions (the kitchen faucet sprayed out onto the counter and the bathroom shower head seemed to spray in all directions except for on your head).  These were really minimal issues though,just feedback for the future.,,,,
"Check in/check out was easy as was communication with the hosts.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat!\"",,,,,
766700,5429673,2013-06-30,2405761,Francine,Un bel appartement très bien situé pour visiter la ville.  Nous y avons passé un agréable séjour et y retournerions sans hésiter.  Le numéro de l'appartement (appartement 4)  devrait être indiqué dans la description afin d'éviter de la confusion.
766700,5575172,2013-07-07,2583272,Scott,The location of the apartment is top notch. In the heart of the north end and easily accessible to transportation to all parts of the Boston. The neighborhood felt safe and was very quiet. The restaurants were excellent and very affordable. My partner and I spent the week of Fourth of July (our first trip to Boston) and our first trip using Airbnb. Our host Jose was very responsive to our needs-the shower head was not very functional-Jose replaced the shower head the next day after notifying him and brought an iron that we had requested-even though I had not expected it. We experienced record hot temps the last part of our visit so I would say the air conditioner was up to the task other than those days where it was over 95 degrees. The only other thing we would have liked was a dresser to store clothes but the closet was good for the hanging stuff.
766700,5673243,2013-07-11,4678124,Adrian,"Comfortable bed under strong air-conditioning was terrific, but the sofa is awfully lumpy and not comfortable at all. Location is great but if you have heavy luggage, keep in mind that this apartment is on the fourth floor with very narrow staircases.  The apartment was clean for arrival."
766700,5709440,2013-07-13,6134783,Sunny,"The apartment is very spacious and the location in the North End is excellent. We were able to walk around and enjoy the sights.  The only hard part was carrying our luggage up 4 flights of steps. Otherwise, we give top marks!"
766700,5757836,2013-07-15,6746149,Kathleen,Jose was very accommodating to adjusting my check-in/out time.  The apartment was clean and very welcoming.  It is also it the best location a Boston tourist could ask for! I would love to stay again if I get a chance to return to Boston.
766700,6045339,2013-07-28,6071846,Suradech,"Jose was very easy to contact and always reachable when you need help. I didn't have a chance to meet him in person, but the arrangement for check-in and check-out ran smoothly."
The apartment is in the perfect area,close to the famous Old North Church and you can easily reach Haymarket T-station to get to the city,or if you want you can also walk. The bed was perfect,nicely firm as I like. Air-conditioning was also a plus for summer. The only thing that you should be aware of,the stairs up to the room is quite narrow. So leave your huge suitcase at home :),

Soweit ich mich erinnern konnte fehlten sämtliche Bilder, Teppiche und die Kaffeemaschine. Dadurch wirkte das Appartement sehr kahl. Das Appartement könnte zudem ein wenig sauberer sein. Das Treppenhaus war zudem auch sehr heruntergekommen (Geländer war an mehreren Stellen lose + Unangenehmer Geruch)."
Ansonsten war aber alles in Ordnung. Das Appartement ist definitiv grösser als jedes Hotelzimmer.- Die Übergabe hat einwandfrei geklappt,"die Lage ist super um Boston zu erkunden. Zur U-Bahn muss man dennoch ca. 10 Minuten laufen. Das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis stimmt somit. \"",,,,

30 second walk to the Old North Church,2 minute walk to Paul Revere's house,3 minutes to loads of Italian eateries in the city's Italian neighborhood,3 minutes from several pickup locations for the tourist hop-on/hop-off bus tours,less than 10 minutes walking to the Union Oyster House and loads of other great restaurants.,
The only caveat would be for anyone who has trouble with stairs,"as the four flights to reach the unit are narrow and steeper than commonly found due to the age of the building (to be expected for the privilege of staying literally across the street from \"\"The Old North Church\"\").",,,,

766700,6230062,2013-08-04,3526594,Stephanie,This is a well located apartment in Little Italy. Appears to be outfitted for short-stays like airbnb folks and is bare bones but has what you need for a very short stay. Can't beat it for the price.

I was traveling with one other, and it was certainly more than roomy enough for the two of us. Clean and in a great location for the North End! I was only there for two nights, so I was happy to stay around the North end/Freedom Trail. If you wanted to venture further afield, I'm not sure how convenient the location is for that but it's close to Haymarket station so I'm sure it's fine. We had a fantastic time and would definitely recommend this place to friends."

766700,6889804,2013-08-29,6252411,Lisa,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this apartment from August 24th to 28th.  The main purpose of our visit to Boston was the annual St. Anthony's Feast in the North End so this apartment was in the perfect location, close enough to the festivities but far enough from all the noise and craziness!  It was a clean apartment with all the necessary amenities one would need for a short stay.  The only thing we thought we wouldn't like is that there was no TV but we ended up not needing one because of all the time we spent out enjoying and seeing Boston.  And when we needed a movie or something to fall asleep to at night, we used our laptop and the very efficient free wifi that is provided in the apartment.  Jose was definitely very helpful and easy to get in contact with whenever I had questions about the apartment.  For us, this apartment was in walking distance to everything we wanted to see, and the T was easily accessible for across town trips.  We mainly used the Haymarket Station.  For first-time Airbnb users, we definitely had a great experience and have Jose and this apartment to thank for that."

766700,7409393,2013-09-19,4676208,Bj,This location is great for visiting Boston! Near lots of restaurants and historical sites and an easy walk to the subway. The apartment is comfortable and plenty of room for two people. We didn't have much interaction with Jose because everything went without a hitch.
766700,7502185,2013-09-23,5603431,Norman,We really enjoyed our stay at Jason's apartment. It was clean and well equipped. We stayed in apartment 4 which is on the 4th floor (no lift) which was a tough journey for two seniors with bags! The location is excellent and a short walk to the Freedon Trail and cafe's and restaurants. We would recommend the apartment and stay again (with only hand bags!)
766700,7583673,2013-09-25,8421598,Thorsten,"Die Wohnung ist super und ruhig direkt am Freedom Trail gelegen. Wir haben uns wohlgefühlt in dem Appartment, leider sind die Einrichtungsgegenstände, die auf den Fotos zu sehen sind (u.a. Kaffeemaschine) nicht mehr in der Wohnung vorhanden. Die Wohnung war sauber und auch frische Handtücher standen zur Verfügung."
766700,7766473,2013-10-02,5347215,Philip,"Positives first: brilliant location just yards from Old North Church with loads of eateries round the corner and great Italian quarter ambiance. Flat was spacious enough for us 2 with kitchen, sitting area and bedroom all the more so since all is sparsely furnished. Being on top floor it is light with windows looking out on a courtyard and on to Hull Court. We returned to it after a day's visit with pleasure."
However,we were very anxious re. Fire risk. The flat is at the top of a narrow staircase and there is no fire escape. There was one operative smoke alarm in the sitting area but the one in the bedroom was open with no visible battery.,,,,
The toilet blocked twice during our stay,overflowing on the first occasion,"but was sorted at once on both occasions.\"",,,

Jose was accessible and we were able to reach him as soon as we arrived in town, and he helped us with directions when we got lost! The bed was comfortable (soft sheets!), water pressure was good/hot, towels were clean and the apartment was sufficient for our stay - which did not revolve around spending much time in the apartment. The only thing I will say, is that the apt. decor was a bit more scarce than pictured - no rugs, no curtains on some of the windows. Not the end of the world - but I was expecting it to look as pictured."
766700,8165660,2013-10-19,6595313,Adeline,"As per previous reviews,the position of the apartment was perfect and we loved being in the midst of Boston's Little Italy."
You do have to go up three flights of stairs and it is narrow so don't have too much luggage and it may not be suitable for more mature travellers with knee or back problems.,,,,,
It was unfortunate that on our first and last nights at this apartment,we had problems with the bathroom (toilet) and had to go down the street to the local cafes to use their facilities. This was very inconvenient and frustrating.,,,,
As it had been reported previously by a prior traveller,we were disappointed that it wasn't fixed.,,,,
Jose did attend to it first thing in the morning but the problem re-occurred. Thank goodness we were leaving anyway and he assured us that it would be fixed.,,,,,
Hopefully,it has been sorted out by now.,,,,
I have to say that the support of Airbnb was great,though,at 2.30am in the morning,wishing us to have a great day was not the best way to show empathy! This was after we'd been up for an hour cleaning up the mess and trying to get in touch with Jose (to no avail) and considering looking for alternate accommodation.,,
Thanks to Airbnb for helping us out in a difficult situation and Jose did respond as quick as he could. For it to happen once during our stay is unfortunate. Twice is unacceptabe.,,,,,

We were very close to the grocery store 'Going Bananas' on Salem Street to buy all our groceries. The stereo system provided ambiance as we listened to the excellent Boston station WUMB. The location of this apartment, in the very old Italian Quarter, enabled us to walk down cobblestone streets experiencing 'life in Boston', gaze in the many cozy Italian restaurants, trek the Freedom Trail, do some great sketching and painting in the corner coffee shop and visit the huge market place all within walking distance. Having Old North Church as a landmark was also very helpful…never got lost. Thank you so much and we look forward to a return visit."

766700,9824641,2014-01-13,3714343,Rachel,"The location is absolutely wonderful, and the apartment is nice, clean, and comfortable. While it's true that the staircase is steep and narrow (and winding), that only really was a pain when we were moving our luggage. Other than that it wasn't so bad. The bed was very comfortable and we had no problems checking in. Our only issue was that the bedroom has no door, which we weren't expecting, and which makes it more like a large studio than a one-bedroom because the noise travels. But we still enjoyed ourselves and would definitely stay there again. You can't beat the value for the location, size, and comfort of this apartment!"
766700,10037990,2014-01-27,10475805,Rémy,"The apartment is very well located, very clean, spacious, and very convenient, with all you need for a pleasant stay. You just have to know that it is on the 3rd floor with no elevator, it is not really a problem except if you have big suitcases like we did ;)"
Also the hosts were very helpful and the instructions/information were very clear.,,,,,

766700,10912856,2014-03-12,8039517,J-Coby (And Kain),"This is a very convenient spot for people who are visiting Boston as tourists. Its location almost literally at the base of the Old North Church can't be beaten, with all of the North End and its great food and culture, as well as public transportation, a close overnight parking lot, the West End, the Financial District and the Haymarket area, all within easy walking distance. The space itself is basic, but serviceable for young 20-something tourists who don't need to spend much time in it. It is relatively clean, though the bathroom sported some not very pleasant hair from a previous guest. It is not as well-suited to business needs [the wifi signal was not strong enough for a (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Hangout meeting we were supposed to have with a business client, and we had to cancel the meeting] or family needs [the floor is very thin and several very loud partying girls in the unit below us sounded like they were literally in bed with us late into the night, which made getting up at 5 am to make a flight at Logan after very little sleep difficult; outlets without covers in the bedroom under the desk that could shock small, exploring hands; a missing tile in the shower partially covered by plastic and falling-off duct tape that would also be irresistible but not very safe for small exploring hands]. Our host was very nice and responsive, so maybe he will finish off the unfinished bits of this space to make it a better value for the money and more suitable for different kinds of travelers."
766700,10951324,2014-03-14,12992898,Pedr,"This apartment, in the North End of Boston, is clean and in a great location. The photos speak for themselves. It's modernly furnished and has a very comfortable bed. There are many great restaurants within a 3 minute walk. The neighborhood is safe and well-occupied. The Museum of Science and North Station are 10 minutes away. Quincy Market and the New England Aquarium are less than 15 minutes. The hosts were honest and easily reached. We will definitely return to this location within the next 2 months."

"I would definitely stay again\"",,,,,
766700,11881172,2014-04-18,8406922,David,the main asset of this apartment is its location. Located in the heart of The Italian district surrounded by restaurants and shops. 5 min walk from the metro it is perfect to visit the city.
The apartment is spacious and clean but several things are to improve: it lacks the curtains in the room,the seat of the toilet is broken,no TV,wifi very slow...,,
"Point non-negligible: the apartment is located on the 3rd floor without elevator so not obvious with large luggage.\"",,,,,
766700,11958127,2014-04-20,9645153,Alina,"The place is in a great location! Lots of Italian restaurants a block away.  Also, it is a walking distance to Irish bars and restaurants. The apartment in general is  mostly clean: there was some black hair in the  bath tub. The toilet seat was broken. The bed was comfortable though. I think the walls are pretty thin cause we were listening to Adele and using indoor voice, sorry not 'library' voice, and received a complaint of noise (we were on the top floor)."
766700,12107927,2014-04-23,1482373,Emma,"Jose and Jason's apartment is located in a great neighborhood--the North End--that really feels like old Boston, with narrow winding streets and lots of Italian restaurants for dinner, coffee, and cannoli.  The bed is comfortable, the towels are fluffy, the water pressure is decent, and the apartment is pretty clean and well-stocked with plates, a french press, hair dryer, etc.  My only complaint: you can hear EVERYTHING in the downstairs apartment (like full conversations, sneezes).  Other than that, Jose and Jason were easy to communicate with and the apartment was easy to locate and access."
766700,12231537,2014-04-27,8776112,Danielle,This place is in a great location right by the Old North Church. There is a ton of restaurants and things to see nearby and is within walking distance of downtown. Jose was very easy to communicate with and accommodating when we asked for an early check in and late check out. Overall it was a great experience staying here.
766700,12311736,2014-04-28,6176338,Anne,Another great airbnb experience.  We did not meet the hosts cos we were early - but were able to leave our bags while we ran to the TD Garden.  Bruins won!!!
Charming location. Clean and neat.  And such a comfortable bed!   After exploring the city on foot....you almost don't want to get up from a quick nap - but the italian restaurants are calling!,,,,,
As mentionned - there is a narrow walk-up (part of the charm) and the walls are pretty  hear-thru (might want to bring a pair of earplugs)!,,,,,
Would stay there again!!,,,,,

The apartment was just what we needed. It was nice and clean with lots of character. I will say that the apartment is on the 4th floor and the stairway is very narrow and steep. Luckily we only had carry on sized bags so it wasn't an issue for us. The apartment is literally steps away from the Old North Church, the Freedom Train and tons of great restaurants. The subway is about a 5 minute walk away and there is a parking garage about a 3 minute walk away. The check-in/out process was very easy. We had a wonderful stay at \"\"Under the Light of Old North Church\"\" and I would highly recommend staying here!\""
766700,13596580,2014-06-01,2415775,Joe,"Great location, great Italian food, apt is right on the freedom trail.  The apt is a walk-up so don't take too much luggage.  The room a/c was not needed because the weather was cool, but was needed to mask out noises from other apartments.  The bed was very comfortable.  The kitchen looked well equipped but we always ate out.  The bathroom was functional but the final renovations need to be completed in that space..  Excellent value."
766700,13727541,2014-06-02,5702077,Julie,"I stayed here at short notice because I had booked to stay in another place and the lady whose place it was cancelled the stay at the last minute. The Airbnb customer service team swung into action (thanks Laura!)  to find a replacement room for me and Jose offered me his place. His communication was excellent, he sent really clear details about how to find the place and get in and made it very clear that he was available for any questions."
The apartment itself is lovely. The bed was very comfortable indeed and there was a nice living area and a kitchen,which I didn't use because I was only there one day and I ate out.,,,,
The apartment is in a fantastic location. It's within walking distance of the T station and the area feels very safe. There are lots of great restaurants nearby,a grocery store and a fabulous bakery that is open 24 hours. It's a wonderful area to walk around and explore.,,,,
"It's just steps away from the Old North Church and if you go to the service on Sundays they play the old organ. (Well the inside parts of the organ have been replaced but it's inside the old case from 1759 so it looks lovely!)\"",,,,,

We fell in love with the surrounding area and all of the nearby restaurants. The only downside to the neighborhood is that all of the parking is resident permit only so you have to park in a garage. Everything was so close by that we parked the car and didn't see it again until 4 days later when we left. Jose was incredibly accomodating and flexible the enitre stay, he was easily accessible by phone. Would definitely stay again!"

We walked to everything we did in the two days we spent in the North End of Boston.  Great food and pastries close by.  You have to be hearty enough to heft your suitcases up 3 flights but if that's not an issue then this is a great place to stay for couples.
766700,15999959,2014-07-20,12412845,Steven,"Great stay in Boston in Jason and Jose's place -  the apartment is big and spacious with great AC in the bedroom. The apartment needs a little work in the bathroom to freshen things up, but the real winner with this place is the location in the heart of the north end - amazing! Jose was very easy to deal with and was very accommodating when we asked to make an early bag drop on arrival."
766700,16212337,2014-07-23,16832922,Michele,The location was perfect.  It was within walking distance of everything we wanted to do.  I don't think they should advertise it as sleeping 3 because the futon was the most uncomfortable thing I've ever slept on and they only left one flat sheet (no fitted sheet or blanket) for it.

The apartment is well designed, spacious and filled with light from all directions. The bedroom is large and the bed very comfortable. We just had an issue with the bathroom, which would benefit from some refurbishment. There is a tile missing near the shower and this seemed to cause a damp smell that was off putting. Some basic utensils eg. Plates and coffee cups were not provided, which was an inconvenience. If these two issues were sorted out, we would recommend staying there in future."

Staying in the North End of Boston is a perfect place because it seems like you're right in middle of the historic Freedom Trail. Little Italy is a casual walk away from this location. Jose and Jason were able to let us use their pass to a near-by parking garage for a reasonable fee. Word of advice for future travelers to Boston: You don't need a car to get around. The T Line (subway) could get us anywhere in the city, especially to Fenway Park to watch the Red Sox:)"
Jose and Jason's place was clean and simple. The bathroom's shower may need a renovation soon,but other then that,it was quite comfortable.

The neighborhood is wonderful, so close to so many great restaurants, and only a 10 minute walk from Faneuil Hall!  I also appreciated that I didn't feel like a tourist living here: since many students and locals live in this area, I felt like I fit in more with the city."
I was a little disappointed that there wasn't a TV at the apartment.  There also weren't any clocks,so if you need to wake up early some days,make sure to bring a travel alarm clock.   The kitchen was well-stocked with supplies,and all in all it was a very comfortable stay.  And for the money,"it really can't be beat! \"",
766700,19933735,2014-09-21,8282596,Gabriela,"We stayed in Jose's apartment for 2 nights only. The apartment location is  great, in front of the Old North Church, in neighborhood full of very good restaurants. Jose is friendly, helpful in giving directions and fast in replying. His apartment though reasonably priced (for Boston's standards) and relatively clean, could use some refurbishment. Especially a bathroom would require a make over.   Despite the flaws our overall experience was positive."
766700,20082111,2014-09-23,16079108,Deborah,"Jose/Jason welcomed us well in advance of our arrival via email, with full entry instructions & directions to the apartment, so we were prepared for the climb up the stairs."
Comfortable apartment in a great location - really suited us for our short stay in Boston,and we would definitely use the apartment again on a return visit.,,,,
"Jose/Jason was also very flexible in allowing us to leave our luggage a little later than check out time to suit our flight times.\"",,,,,
766700,20230137,2014-09-26,13791142,Ian,The apartment was excellent and in a convenient area just on the freedom trail and in the heart of the north end. The room was clean and tidy and has everything you'd need for a trip to Boston. We didn't see Jose and Jason but they gave all the instructions you'd need to find the apartment. We'd happily stay there again if we visit Boston in the future.
766700,20544621,2014-10-01,12396212,Marina,"Apartment is in excellent central yet quiet location,  great base for sightseeing. Jose/Jason very prompt on sending instructions for access: everything worked perfectly.  All in all an excellent stay, thank you!"
766700,21018918,2014-10-09,22129981,Claudia,Jose always answered always within less than an hour and was super helpful! The appartment is right on the freedom trail and surrounded by tons of (italian) restaurants. It has everything you need! The fridge and something outside the window is a little noisy but we slept perfectly. :)
"We would stay here again when we come back to Boston! \"",,,,,
766700,21130813,2014-10-12,3766695,Andrea,"Thank you very much for hosting us in your wonderful apartment! We spent a really great time in Boston and enjoyed your apartment, that is definitely ideally located for exploring Boston. The neighbourhood offers everything tourists need above all the excellent restaurants. Last but not least the super weather, that you offered us made our stay an unforgettable event! On top of that, thank you also for giving us all the neccesary and helpful tips even if we asked stupid and confusing questions. We are sure we will come back!"
766700,21460875,2014-10-18,18170627,Katherine,"And friend and I recently stayed in this apartment for 3 nights. We absolutely loved it! You cannot beat the location...right in Little Italy, literally on the Freedom Trail, and close to the metro. Just a mile or so from the downtown area. The hosts were fantastic. The apartment was easy to find and easy to get into. Even when we had questions, they were quick to answer the phone or respond to a message. Highly recommended!"
766700,21651190,2014-10-21,12416567,Emmanuelle,Je suis arrivée à l'appartement le soir assez tard. Le taxi nous a aidés à trouver la ruelle mal éclairée. Je n'arrivais pas à ouvrir la boîte qui contenait les clés et j'ai dû appeler José qui a répondu tout-de-suite malgré l'heure tardive. L'appartement était confortable mais très bruyant à cause du frigo et des climatiseurs extérieurs. Le quartier par contre était très agréable.
766700,21820601,2014-10-25,11160642,Paul,The apartment is in a perfect location (unless you hate good food). In the North End you are right in the heart of Boston's Italian community. As soon as you leave you are immediately met by the sight of the old North Church.
"There are loads of great restaurants on Salem St & Hannover St wishing minutes of your door. I'd also recommend Theo's around the corner from the apartment for breakfast.\"",,,,,
766700,21903502,2014-10-26,22253644,Brandon,Great efficiency in a perfect area!  It had everything we needed for our one night stay in a great city..   Thanks!!!
766700,21962536,2014-10-27,21543432,Loren,"This was my first time using airbnb.  Jose did an excellent job communicating before my arrival, and was helpful during the stay with helping to store bags before checkin and after check out."
The apt was nice and clean.  Big!  The other reviews about bathroom,no tv,etc are accurate but the location is fantastic!  I also rented their other apt for a few days and found it to be much more updated - really beautiful.,,,
Overall a great experience.  Highly recommended.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
766700,22134016,2014-10-31,3867647,Dominique,We stayed four nights in this apartment. The area is perfect if you are keen to do lots of the touristy activities Boston has to offer and there are plenty of places to eat nearby. It is also very close to the North Station T which is one of the main subway stations in Boston
The apartment itself was a good size for two people spending some time in Boston. It could do with a little TLC and unfortunately on arrival we noticed the duvet was dirty. We did notify Jose about this and he was very quick to get back to us. There was also a lack of kitchen facilities which made it difficult to cook meals and dine in.,,,,,
"The apartment wasn't what we had expected from the photos but with a little spruce up this would be a nice place to spend some time visiting Boston. \"",,,,,
766700,22295721,2014-11-03,19666880,María,"El apartamento de José está muy bien. Se adaptó a nuestra hora de llegada perfectamente y estaba muy limpio. La situación es ideal, no necesitas coger transporte público en Boston. Además, tuvimos un pequeño percance en el apartamento y no tardó nada en solucionarlo. En definitiva, buen apartamento y buen casero. Gracias José"
766700,22792254,2014-11-15,2567578,Tamsin,"The apartment was lovely, and very convenient right in the old quarter of Boston. It had everything we needed for a comfortable holiday stay, the location especially was exceptional - a 1 minute walk throughout the area, close to many places to eat and the Freedom Trail. It was a 5 minute easy walk to the train station, a great way to get around Boston. The only mention - you do have to carry your bags up quite a few stairs. This was fine for us, but might not suit older people. We'd recommend this to others travelling to Boston - a great place to stay."
766700,22905835,2014-11-17,22862591,Charles,"We had a great time. The weather was cold and bleak. The apartment was warm, bright and clean. A terrific location for exploring the North End and for the wedding we went to and there were great cafés and restaurants within easy walking distance."
766700,23040980,2014-11-21,22459733,Fred,This is my first experience with Airbnb... it was a delightful time...  Jose was very responsive and accommodating and answering our questioning emails prior to our arrival...  he answered in such detail we had no need to see him when we arrived...  the apartment was very very nice spacious clean bed was comfortable pillows were excellent only downside and it's probably because we're in our seventies where it was on the 4th floor with 39 stairs...  Location was excellant...  could not have picked a better place...
766700,23272407,2014-11-27,22423057,Kent,"This was our first experience with airbnb. Jose was easy to contact upon arrival and allowed us to go into the apartment an hour ahead of schedule. The apartment is located about 4 floors up from street level and the staircase is steep and narrow, so forewarned is best especially if you have a few heavy suitcases to haul up stairs. There were concerns about security of the place, which is too lengthy to go into here. However, Jose was amenable and allowed us to cancel our two remaining nights accommodation when we found the apartment didn't meet our requirements on the first night. In the end we found accommodation in middle of downtown in a very good hotel which turned out to cost less than this airbnb accommodation."
766700,23566676,2014-12-05,17651827,Antoinette,"We had a wonderful experience in Boston.  We arrived very early and Jose let us check in without hesitation.  Jose is very clear about keeping the lines of communication open, which I very much appreciate.  If he does not know he can't fix it, and he will help and make your stay very comfortable.  The apartment itself is clean and while small still very spacey.  I was there with my two children and I still had room to move around, I loved the ambience of the apartment.  The area itself is in Little Italy and perfectly situated for sightseeing but still quiet.  A great coffee shop across the street.  Jose is very accommodating and really wants your stay in Boston to be a positive one.  Thank you Jose we loved it."
766700,24614983,2014-12-31,24634509,Pablo,"Me and 2 friends stayed two nights in this apartment, it is very well situated (at a walking distance of most of the stuff we wanted to see) and in a very nice neighborhood. Everything was clean and quiet. I would definitely recommend this place if you plan to stay in Boston for a few days!"
766700,25035711,2015-01-05,20445086,Mike,We stayed 4 nights over the New Year holiday. The location was perfect -- within walking distance of trains and plenty of great restaurants. There is a coin-op laundromat next door.
766700,26221161,2015-02-07,25473588,Holly,It was so great we had a one night stay as my daughter was acceptors to Emerson College.
Check in was a piece of cake the apartment was very clean,bright and the bed was so comfortable.,,,,
"It was a VERY cold night in Boston but looking forward to the times ahead to come. Love the north end and will stay again for sure\"",,,,,
766700,27260530,2015-03-01,24613717,Lan,"The location is good with many attractions within walking distance, as well as the T station. It was warm, even in the depth of winter and the big bed very comfortable. The kitchen is fully equipped and there is plenty of space. Definitely a home from home."
766700,27465886,2015-03-05,27069477,Noah,"Jose made everything super easy! Apartment was beautiful and very well stocked with linens, soap, and dishware, and keys were easy to obtain and drop off. He was very responsive to any concerns I had, and I would 100% recommend this apartment to anyone visiting the Boston area!"
766700,27646566,2015-03-09,16113346,Marshall,"After a reservation I held for a long time canceled on me out-of-the-blue, I was worried I wouldn't find another decent place."
Not only did Jose & Jason have a better price,but the layout of the apartment itself was very nice,and it even had a number of nice appliances in the kitchen.,,,
One thing I would mention,however,is that the walls are thin. From my understanding,that's just how things are in this part of town/these buildings. Still,if you are a light sleeper and are visiting town during a busy time,plan accordingly.
I would definitely recommend this place,"though!\"",,,,
766700,27798926,2015-03-12,5281288,Leah,"Apartment was great.  Nice, clean, good price in an awesome area.  Very easy to work out getting there and getting in and out of the place.  5-10 min walk to the T and the North end is awesome for wandering/eating."
"We parked at the \"\"Government Center Garage\"\" at 50 New Sudbury St which was a great deal (45$ for 3 days).  You have to buy the ticket online and you have no in-and-out privleges but it's all good because the apartment is so central and the T is great.",,,,,
"Great neighborhood to stay in to explore Boston!\"",,,,,
766700,27896287,2015-03-14,28651406,Jessica,"Great place, very cosy and charming. We really enjoyed our stay, and will recommand you."

766700,28119524,2015-03-18,24096081,Louise,"Fantastic location and the flat itself is very cute, plenty of space and free wifi. Easy check-in & out, we didn't see Jose but he was very helpful and accommodating over the Airbnb app.  The walls/floor are a little thin and sound does travel quite easily from the floor below- we didn't have too many problems though."
766700,28211081,2015-03-20,19479510,Meg,"The apartment was great. Roomy and perfect place to stay. We really would love to stay again in the summer, but it's all booked up already! We stayed on the 4th floor, so it was a bit of a hike to get up there but it was fine overall. The lockbox came in handy and the instructions were described really clearly. Jose was very helpful and responded very quickly to our texts. Awesome location in North End. Really is right under the North End Church!"
766700,28776951,2015-03-30,24786535,Caroline,"Nous avons passé un agréable séjour et Jose est arrangeant. L’appartement est très bien situé dans little italy tout en étant très calme.  Nous étions 3. Le bruit du frigo et l'absence de porte entre la cuisine, le salon et la chambre nous à un peu gêné."
Le logement est spacieux,la cuisine équipée,la salle de bain impeccable. Le lit est très confortable et les pièces sont lumineuses (la lumière naturelle nous réveillait le matin).,,,
"Un excellent séjour ! \"",,,,,
766700,28932390,2015-04-01,26728099,Kevin,"Jose was an excellent host who responded to all questions from this AirBnB first timer in a timely manner. The place was accurately described and was perfect for our needs. The neighborhood was amazing, you are literally on the Freedom Trail and are so close to many amazing restaurants."
766700,29417168,2015-04-07,28246712,Ioannis,Jose was a great host. He provided accurate instructions and helped us find the place without any issues.
The flat was good,in a very beautiful area and had all the necessary bedsheets,towels,"shampoo. I'd consider staying there again\"",,
766700,29963929,2015-04-15,12126334,Susan,Jose touched base with the required check-in information shortly before our trip as promised.  He also allowed us a little flexibility with our bags upon checkout which was nice since we had a later flight.
The location was perfect,the apartment was clean and Jose remedied a couple of minor issues very promptly (lights burn out in the kitchen,t-paper).,,,
As someone else had mentioned,the walls/floors are very thin.  We could tell what the people were watching on TV downstairs on the first night,so we kept that in mind.,,,
I have heard that the North side can be a bit noisy in the Summer,but I think this apartment is imbedded into the neighborhood enough that it wouldn't be a problem.,,,,
I would stay here again.,,,,,

766700,30199418,2015-04-19,21696174,Therese,"Homely and comfy, this was a great place to stay for my 4-day trip to Boston. As others have mentioned, the location is (URL HIDDEN) the heart of the historical freedom trail and full of good restaurants and coffee shops. Jose was very helpful with all my queries and left a plentiful supply of cleaning materials, tea, coffee etc. I would advise having a torch at the ready if you arrive at nighttime as, initially, the alley is a bit daunting. Apart from that, no complaints!"
766700,30489559,2015-04-23,2402860,Deborah,Jose was very accomadating.  I was able to leave my bag in the building before check in and after checkout.  When I called him  he answered on the first try.
The apt. Had a very nice set up with the bedroom  on one side,and private.  The bed was very comfortable. The other side was the living area,kitchen and bathroom.  The couch even folds down and could probably be used for a second bed if needed.,,,
I loved the neighborhood and felt very safe.  Everyone I talked to was extremely nice.  There is a little coffee shop right across the street and a couple blocks away is a place that sells freshly ground coffe to make in the coffee press in the apt. (It made very good coffee). I bought the Italian blend.,,,,,
It is very easy and convenient to get to the T about a 8-10 minute walk.  From there you can get anywhere in the city.  Great transportation!,,,,,
There are also a few little stores that sell a little produce and beer,wine,milk...,,,
In the North End Italian area is the best food ever.  I don't think you could go wrong with any of the restaurants,but my favorite was Paglinca's.  They have flower boxes on their windows.  There food was wonderful and the staff are very friendly and welcoming.,,,,

The apartment couldn't be in a better location. It was extremely easy and convenient to walk to all the touristy attractions and awesome italian & seafood restaurants Boston has to offer. The apartment was neat and clean, and everything worked well. The apartment was exactly as described, and it was easy to find. Jose was a wonderful host and I would totally recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a convenient, comfortable, and affordable stay in Boston. Thanks, Jose!"
766700,34117228,2015-06-05,8070354,Jenn,We loved staying in the North End! The apartment was as advertised and Jose was responsive to our needs.
766700,34409914,2015-06-08,25195323,Benjamin,We loved staying next to the old north church. Boston has so much to offer and this is my favorite neighborhood to enjoy there.  This place is right in the middle of it all.
766700,35446551,2015-06-19,11311453,Lawrence,"The property was very good overall. The price was quite reasonable considering the location, the popular North End of Boston."
Jose runs the property in a very professional manner. He communicated regularly before my arrival and responded quickly when I had a question. Good wifi too.,,,,,
His directions were spot on for locating the apartment,keys were where he said they would be,and they worked too. Bed was comfortable and the kitchen meant I didn't have to eat out for every meal.,,,

766700,48670120,2015-09-28,26309291,Thomas,"Stayed in Boston for three months. The flat was as expected, well situated in the historical part of Boston. The neighborhood with all the italian restaurants is great. José was very reliable and it was easy to contact him."
766700,49207256,2015-10-02,35517139,Tim,Great neighborhood and great description of place. Jason was very accommodating to our schedule and the place was very clean.

766700,50177117,2015-10-10,24639701,Gaudenz,Location of unit is excellent; very close to everything. The apartment was clean and everything worked. The building is rather tired and so is the apartment but that is to be expected in this part of Boston. It works well for someone who wants a place to stay and will be out and about to enjoy everything that Boston has to offer. Jose was very responsive to phone calls and immediately returned a call when I left a message. Unit is at the top of three steep and narrow flights of stairs; that didn't bother us but may be an issue for others.
766700,50426513,2015-10-12,16110321,Eleanor,This apartment was about exactly what I expected from the listing. Simple and clean. There isn't much decoration. Nothing fancy. Note that it's a fourth floor walkup.
We did not meet the host,but the email with entry instructions was very clear. The bed was VERY comfortable even with my sudden bad back and a chronic hip problem,and the sheets and towels were nice and soft. There were extra pillows in the closet (that we didn't think to look for the first night),but pillowcases for those were... who knows where.,,
The neighborhood is great,and really central for all North End explorations. Two excellent breakfast cafes are less than a block away. Don't miss Theo's!,,,,
We listened to the bells of the Old North Church -- not at all loud,when inside. And we did get to listen to one side of an argument at 4am one night  (though not so loud that we could hear the words),from someone sharing the same central courtyards I assume,and could hear the neighbors sometimes. But that's life in the city. Fell back asleep with no problem.,,
As we live nearby,we took commuter rail into North Station and the walk over couldn't be easier. 5 minutes,"tops.\"",,,
766700,50831250,2015-10-15,35438925,Tanisha,"Absolutely recommend! It is even better than described. And the location honestly could not be better. It's steps away from some of the best restaurants! We absolutely fell in love with this spot. Jose went above and beyond for us, and it never felt like we were bugging him. We were a bit of a mess with plane rides, and keys and extremely busy, and jose dealt with us smoothly and professionally. I honestly couldn't recommend this spot enough."
766700,51015483,2015-10-17,39720328,Iryna,"Definitely perfect location in Italian district near famous city sight. Everything is very close to thus location. The apartment is spacious and clean, it has everything needed. Also, It is very convenient to use lock box for key exchange. Above all, It is a great place to spend your holiday in Boston."
766700,51432768,2015-10-20,39362918,Jenna,Jason was very welcoming and responsive! The listing was accurate and the location of the apartment was PERFECT! I would definitely stay here again.
766700,51608816,2015-10-22,37922627,Maggie,"Absolutely loved the location.  The apartment was great, very old, so you get the feel of being in the North End with all those great old buildings.  And oh, the restaurants! the food!  I'd stay there again, if it weren't for those stairs.  We dropped our stuff off here before we dropped off our rental car, so we had to park illegally and race up the stairs with the suitcases.  Also maybe a bit pricey, but it looks like the price is now lower than what we paid.  Anyway, we loved being there."
766700,52044771,2015-10-26,10326891,Vivi,The only good thing about this apartment is its location - very very central. I was disappointed 6 weeks before we arrived when having booked a parking space through Jose he then told me it was not available any longer and did nothing to help me figure out an alternative - I felt left in the lurch. The apartment is dark and certainly the walls are paper thin as a previous reviewer stated - we had to listen to our neighbours' lovemaking for hours in the night. The kitchen was not equipped at all to be able to cook. The apartment needs some love and attention. It was clear that this is simply a  money making venture. Once it has been renovated it would be ideal but until then I would not recommend this apartment. Shame as we have had very good experiences until now.
766700,52397464,2015-10-29,40222052,Sara,I stayed at Jose's apartment for 4 days in October while visiting Boston. The apartment was in an amazing location in the North End of Boston. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. There were wonderful Italian restaurants all around the apartment. It was plenty of space for two people. Jose was a fantastic host. He gave us clear instructions on how to find the apartment and the key. He responded to requests promptly and handled everything for us on our vacation. I would recommend this listing to anyone who is looking to visit Boston!
766700,52672885,2015-11-01,33711606,Erin,"Such a great place to stay. The apartment was a great size for 2 people - very roomy, clean and the perfect location."

766700,52977830,2015-11-03,7961083,Lisa,Easy communication with host and apartment is as described. Bedroom is very large. The neighborhood is fantastic. This is a 4th floor walk up with narrow stairs. You can definitely hear your neighbors but they were polite.

766700,53967501,2015-11-15,4699357,Sophie,"We stayed in the apartment 'under the light of old North church'. Had a good stay. The apartment is bigger than we expected. We came to Boston to see Bruins and Celtics at TD Garden and this apartment was in the perfect location, 10min walk from there. As previous reviewers have mentioned, there were some dirty dishes in the dishwasher when we arrived, and we could also hear the neighbours, thin walls - just bring earplugs. Seems to be good value, compared to most places in Boston. Jason is a good host."
766700,54611877,2015-11-22,5491985,Brianna,Jose was fantastic. The place was perfectly situated in the North End surrounded by tons of excellent restaurants. We felt like locals right away!
We accidentally locked our keys inside the apartment and Jose helped us out right away.,,,,,
"We highly recommend staying here. \"",,,,,
766700,54699947,2015-11-23,35429598,James,We loved our stay in Boston. The area is amazing with so much good Italian food and deli's! Apartment is clean and comfortable and Jose was great. Responsive and allowed us to leave our bags while we waited for our late flight. Wish we had more time in Boston now!
766700,56632261,2015-12-15,23814044,Kyle,"Absolutely perfect!  Location was amazing!  Easy to get to from public transit, right off the Freedom Trail, great little 24 hour bakery right down the street, and tons of great restaurants!  The apartment was clean and comfortable.  Jose was VERY responsive to inquiries and even with late notice acommodated us to make our trip stress/trouble free!  Would definitely stay here again!"
766700,61269533,2016-02-01,25403927,Steve,"Very comfortable place, and completely problem-free!  Jose made it easy to find the place, get the keys, and access the WiFi.  Communication was not a problem, and every effort was made to make it easy for me."

"Thank you Jose\"",,,,,
766700,62464626,2016-02-14,715773,Amy,Great place! Very easy place to stay and great communication.
766700,63485735,2016-02-23,2812223,Salil,The place is very conveniently located in the heart of the Italian neighborhood in the North End. It is walking distance from all the cool places. The place itself is modest but worth the price. Jose was very easy to work with and it was easy to get in/out of the place.
766700,63679106,2016-02-25,16014744,Joshua,"Great place, location and price. Enjoyed our stay here would stay again! Host was helpful and clear"
766700,64165252,2016-02-29,34992393,Arif,Really really really happy with our experience at this BnB in Boston. Location could not be better. It was clean and had all the amenities we could need.
766700,64910849,2016-03-09,5270102,Alexis,Jose was very responsive to all of my e-mails before my trip. When I arrived the wrong key was in the front door lock box (I was checking in early to leave my things before the guests in my room left) and Jose immediately answered when I told him and was on his way to come let me in when another guest left and I was able to get in.
The  neighborhood is wonderful. I was there for a conference so hardly got to explore,but it was great to feel like I could get a real taste of Boston even with very limited free time.,,,,
The apartment was lovely and a great value. Extremely comfortable bed. Shower was great. Didn't need to use the kitchen but it looked very well equipped. Only issue is that it was easy to hear the downstairs neighbors,"but they were very quiet so I just noticed when they coughed that I could hear it in the bedroom.\"",,,,
766700,65252727,2016-03-12,8266693,Samantha,The rental was perfect! Lovely place on the edge of the North End but close to everything. The apartment itself had everything we needed and it was huge as far as North End standards. Easy to get the keys and check in. Cute little court entrance to the building. Lots of shops and restaurants near by. I am sure we will rent this on our next trip up to Boston.
766700,65745563,2016-03-16,42116782,David,"Was a really nice place, very comfortable. He was helpful and flexible with the check in hours. Overall a very good experience."

766700,67016897,2016-03-26,12807905,C. Elizabeth,"My stay was totally fine. I had a little trouble with the lock box, but Jose was understanding. The walls are thin, per previous reviews. But it was everything that I needed for my stay and VERY convenient."
766700,67867318,2016-04-01,55435785,Julie,"We had a wonderful stay at Jose's place! It was basic in amenities but had everything we needed. Located right in the heart of North End (Boston's Little Italy), as well as being right on the Freedom Trail, meant the location couldn't be beat! The only downsides were how thin the walls were. Our neighbor had a cold and it sounded like she was in the same room with is every time she coughed. We would definitely stay here again if we can back to Beantown."
766700,68043503,2016-04-01,39183264,Ismael,Cozy apartment at an unbeatable location!
766700,68292944,2016-04-04,50140699,Roxana,I really like staying at this place. It was conveniently close to everything and Jose was very accomodating from beginning to end. I will definitely book here again if i ever go back to Boston for a visit.

766700,69524185,2016-04-11,52536498,Josie,We loved staying here. It was comfortable and the location was perfect! Close to many great restaurants and ideal for our first trip to Boston. Accessing the keys was easily and Jason provided all the information we needed up front. We would certainly stay there again!
766700,69580374,2016-04-11,34982365,Erin,Jose's place was perfect for our 1 night stay in Boston! The place was spacious and clean and has a great comfy bed. We loved how close it was to so many restaurants in Little Italy and the church nearby is quite stunning. We wish we could have stayed longer! Thanks Jose.

766700,72058121,2016-04-30,56356769,Michael,"Great location. Safe neighborhood with a little convenient store and several restaurants nearby. Walls of the apartment are thin and sometimes it sounded like people were right there with you. Comfortable apartment. Great shower with plenty of hot water. This apartment is on the 4th floor with no elevator. It was not a problem for me but be aware. The only TV is in the bedroom and ridiculously small.  The room has an inflatable mattress which was needed. However, we had to ask for a second set of sheets. Overall it was a good experience and I would stay here again."
766700,72142163,2016-05-01,9244022,Jean-Nicolas,"Jose's flat is very nice, perfectly clean, in a  quiet and charming neighbourhood."

766700,72787050,2016-05-04,14781636,Tiziana,"Great location, north end is perfect to start discovering boston. The apartment  is Bigger than in the pictures. The apartment is very basic, internet is a little slow and the fridge is very noisy  (also in the night). Jason was very kind with us. If you travel by car consider that the parking is around fifty dollars per day in the area."
766700,72939004,2016-05-05,67116800,Matthew,Jose's place was great. A fantastic location and a very comfy bed. Everything I needed was there and the communication from Jose was perfect.

766700,75346525,2016-05-20,46447915,Mary,"Amazing location. The North End is definitely the place to stay in Boston. There are an unlimited amount of restaurants, bakeries, and coffee shops in a few block area. Everything worth seeing is within walking distance. Subway stop is close for going to the airport or Fenway. The apartment had everything we needed except a coffee pot as we are early risers. There was a French press with no glass container. This is a fourth floor walk up. Didn't bother us and we were glad to be on the top floor as floors are creaky. Would love to stay here again."
766700,75998264,2016-05-24,17818722,Petur,Great communication and prime location
766700,76296583,2016-05-26,46582597,Jane,Jose was great! He was accommodating by allowing us to drop off our bags in the morning as well as check in 2 hours early. He was prompt with all my messages. The apartment itself was exactly as described. Was clean and in an awesome location. Would definitely come back.
766700,76504774,2016-05-27,35437576,Malaika,"Great spot! Location is awesome, everything went smoothly."
766700,77692689,2016-06-02,32272839,Susanne,"This location is great. We would have enjoyed it more if we hadn't arrived with bronchitis following a month long trip in Europe. The fourth floor walk up was hard on us. The stairs are very narrow and steep. We did not meet the owner. But again, being positive, the location is wonderful."
766700,78276210,2016-06-06,1495050,Janet,"This was my first trip to Boston. The apartment was in a great neighborhood. A lot of shops, restaurants and in the heart of the Freedom trail.

Jose was very responsive whenever I contacted him.,,,,,

The apartment was clean, the pictures were accurate and the check in/out process was a snap.  I'll be staying here again soon when I come to Boston for work."

766700,81472234,2016-06-23,76292016,James,"A really great location and a nice apartment. The landlord was really helpful, I would recommend this place to anyone and would stay again when in Boston."
766700,82451058,2016-06-27,540125,James,Cute flat in a historic area that definitely had a lot of charm.
766700,82779722,2016-06-29,78736908,Ashley,Jose was quick to help us get into the apartment. The location is prime and the unit is spacious. We were able to access so much and really enjoyed our stay!

766700,85100001,2016-07-10,10075851,Elena,Our experience staying at Jose's place was great one and we would recommend this place to anyone looking to go to Boston. Good location to explore the city. The apartment was clean and comfortable. Clear communication from Jose to welcome and provide information before getting to the apartment and prompt respond on questions.
766700,87530712,2016-07-20,27334706,Guy,Excellent location in the North End. It's 77 steps from the Old North Church (we counted) and a block or two from the funnest and most historic neighborhoods in Boston. The apartment is comfortable and has lots of natural light. Jose did a great job communicating with us and always followed thought. We'll stay there again for sure!
766700,88414280,2016-07-24,84113990,Blake,"This is the best value in Boston! A fantastic apartment located in the historic and charming North End neighborhood. The space was clean and supplied with everything we needed (towels, glasses, soap, A/C, pillows, etc). I will definitely look to Jose the next time I'm in Boston as his apartment is an exceptional space for relaxing after running around the city."
766700,89096064,2016-07-26,3940798,Erika,Great location!
766700,89591256,2016-07-29,76612697,Kevin,"The entire process was incredibly easy. Lockbox was easy to figure out, directions to the apartment were on point, and all amenities were provided."
This is an excellent location for a Boston stay. It's literally right underneath the Old North Church,and you can walk pretty much anywhere in the North End and the downtown area with no issues. You could probably also walk across the bridge to Charlestown with no problems.,,,,
Everything you need is in the apartment,"and we didn't have any issues it all. \"",,,,
766700,89647465,2016-07-29,18003584,Dan,"Jason's place was great! Very clean and well-kept, and exactly as described. The location in the North End is pretty much perfect. Parking is not too far off (about a 3 minute walk to the nearest garage), and the building was very quiet. The window AC unit provided some much needed cooling-off for us. The bed was comfy, the bathroom and kitchen very clean. Would highly recommend this place for anyone willing to navigate the few flights of stairs with their luggage."
766700,90422444,2016-08-01,76017331,Ysabelle,"The place was a perfect location for our vacation. It was amongst the cutest brick buildings and central to Little Italy. The building is a little old - we had to carry our luggages up 4 flights of narrow stairs. But other than that the apartment was pretty spacious for a couple. The host was nice and reported to any troubles right away. Overall, enjoyed our stay!"
766700,91699968,2016-08-06,37626200,Paul,"The location is right in the heart of the North End. It is spacious and Jose is very responsive and a pleasure to speak with. The lockbox is a bit finicky so make sure the first number pushes in completely or it will drive you mental. There are many keys but you only need two and they are not marked so a bit annoying but please, minor. If you enjoy tv or are bringing a gaming system with you, until the tv is upgraded and Jose shared he is in the process of putting in a larger game accessible TV, this is a no go. Instead go with the mindset that you will bring a book and enjoy all Boston has to offer. The bed is very comfortable. The shower has decent pressure and keeps a steady temp. Overall a tremendous place and I have full faith Jose will continue to make this place an oasis."
766700,91813165,2016-08-06,17503154,Rebecca,"Jose was easy to communicate with and book with. He provided his information multiple times in case any issues came up. The place is great- it is so close to everything you want to do in North End Boston! A lot of great restaurants, bars, cafe's and right next to the 'Old North Church.' The apartment is simple, but had everything we needed for a good night's stay. The building was also very quiet."
766700,93549079,2016-08-13,35907870,Tom,"Easy instructions, Jason sent me instructions  to get there but had no other contact and did not need to every thing was great.  The area was great , whats not to like about the north end.   This was a true Boston experience."
766700,93966239,2016-08-14,31178549,Mark,Jose was very prompt in his reply.  The directions from the airport to the apartment were great.  The location in the North End is perfect.  Close to everything but quiet.

8556025,48661939,2015-09-27,44697394,Russell,"I stayed at the North End apartment only one night on my arrival in Boston, and everything was as described. Stephen was a gracious host  who unexpectedly picked me up at the airport and when he found out I am an architect, he quickly showed me around the North End to some fantastic buildings and streets. I'll look for this place again when planning a trip to Boston."
8556025,48856574,2015-09-28,27220084,Hanan,The apartment was perfect and located in a quiet and safe neighborhood. It was also in close proximity to major tourist attractions in Boston. Stephen himself was very nice and accommodating even though we arrived late at night. He was also very friendly and answered all our questions.
8556025,49280143,2015-10-02,15358426,Nick,"The apartment was great! Awesome location, and it was stocked with wine, beer,  coffee pods, & creamer!  The apartment seems very new, with a massive TV and new furniture.  A lot of great things were within  a 10 minute walk of the apartment!"

8556025,50024860,2015-10-08,791054,Kelly,"Stephen's place was great.  I was in town for a seminar and it was perfect.  If you love pizza, pastries, and pasta - this is the place for you.  As a host, Stephen was very helpful.  There was no problem finding the place and he checked in to see if I needed anything.  And he was kind enough to have snacks and drinks available."
8556025,50221502,2015-10-10,24265841,Simon,We loved the great location in the heart of the North End. It is very close to The Old North Church and near Mikes and great Italian Restaurants. Stephen was very responsive to our needs and easily reachable despite being out of the nation during our stay.
8556025,51176477,2015-10-18,43591155,Songwei,wonderful
8556025,52242291,2015-10-27,44388065,Matthew,"If you want to explore Boston and take in an awesomely historic neighborhood full of amazing food and scenery, look no further. We couldn't have asked for a better location to nearly everything we wanted to see while in town. Hanover St is only blocks away and both the TD Garden and Quincy Market were about a 10 minute walk. You're also just steps off the Freedom Trail with the Old North Church just up the hill and the bridge to Charles Town a block down the street."
As for the apartment itself,it was very clean and comfortable. The living area has a great TV and fast internet available. Stephen left us a variety of beers and dropped off some Halloween treats for our stay. Our schedules didn't mesh to meet,but Stephen was responsive to all texts and calls and worked with us for our arrival and departure flights.,,,
"I couldn't have been happier with the space and would highly recommend it to anyone looking to spend a few days in the historic North End. \"",,,,,
8556025,52421147,2015-10-29,34235702,Evelyn,"This was a perfect place to stay - clean, modern, and well-stocked. I stayed here with two girlfriends for a conference at the Convention Center (Seaport) which was an easy 10 minute Uber ride, usually between $7-10. Parking is also easy with an overnight garage right around the corner for $16/night, $35 if it's an event night."
We sadly didn't get to explore the neighborhood too much,but from prior experience I highly recommend the North End. We did stumble upon Ducali Pizza which we ordered from twice since it was so delicious!,,,,
"Stephen was easy to reach via text and a gracious host. Thank you!\"",,,,,
8556025,52728630,2015-11-01,42525338,Jack,"Stephen's apartment is nice, was clean, and has a good location. The neighborhood is quiet. The 2 bedrooms was terrific, and there are 2 couches (as shown in the photo). We liked the first floor location. There is an indoor parking garage ($34 per day) a half block away on Causeway and a surface lot on the other side of it."
Amenities are within 2 blocks,and there's a bar/pizza place less than a block away.,,,,
Stephen was very responsive,even when travelling and out of the country.,,,,
I would stay here again,and have already recommended Stephen's place to other friends. If you want 2 affordable bedrooms,"this is the place.\"",,,
8556025,53233715,2015-11-06,38399007,Oliver,As we arrived at the accommodation there was already somebody else in the room. The room was double booked for some reason. Stephen took care about us having another room for this night and he paid for it. It was a little bit annoying to move our luggage again but it also was very friendly that he took care about that. The wifi and tv somehow didn't work. A few towels would also be good. Overall its a nice place to stay!
8556025,53505243,2015-11-09,10805385,Kelly,"We loved Stephen's apartment! It was clean, in a great location, and perfect for our long weekend.

It was perfect for 3 people! Thank you!"
8556025,54012910,2015-11-15,13899781,Lucie,"Thanks Stephen, we had a very good time in your appartment. Great neighbourhood with lots of restaurants and nice shops, just like the ad says. The appartment had everything we needed. The beds were very comfortable, it was clean and you're very generous with your supplies in water, soda's and wine! Lots of nice places within walking distance. But other means of transportations were close by also. Traveling within Boston is very easy. We loved the (very close by) open air market on friday and saturday with lots of cheap fruits and vegetables (food shopping in Boston is fun, but rather expensive, except for the open air market, especially when you do it at the end of the day). The kitchen is equiped well enough to do some cooking yourself. Great bakeries around the corner. Thanks for responding so quickly whenever we had a question. Would definitely recommend your place!"
8556025,54458577,2015-11-20,32619029,Alan,Incredible location. The place was perfect. Steph n even had a stocked fridge that he offered up. Look forward to staying there again

The host was easily accessible and answered all questions right away and made us feel like we were at our own home. Everything in the description of the property was exact.

I have been looking for something more permanent in Boston, and were this apartment available, I would snatch it up in a heartbeat.  It is the perfect North End location.  It's quiet and residential, but within a few blocks of restaurants, etc.  There are a few coveted non-resident parking spaces available, and if not available there are closely pay parking options.  And Stephen does this apartment thing right; fridge stocked, wine/beer available, cable TV on big screen, everything clean and pristine.  Best Airbnb experience I've had yet, and I've done a bunch."

Stephen was readily available with directions and suggestions.,,,,,
Not a complaint but if you're noise sensitive as I am living on an island,"half the apt is next to what maybe the building furnace so if that's an issue take the bedroom on the other side. But not a big deal and otherwise a fun place.\"",,,,

You can't beat the location, within walking distance of plenty of bars, restaurants and the TD Garden.  Stephen responded to any of my questions almost immediately and checked in afterwards to make sure our weekend was good.  The neighborhood has a ton of character, with the apartment being tucked away in an alley which is quite low traffic.  There were a few items in the fridge such as beer and wine which was appreciated.  Overall excellent trip, will definitely look Stephen up again when I am back in Boston."

Offered us towels, wine, anything else we might need, etc. The location was safe, clean, in walking distance of a 24 hour Italian bakery, Bova's, & other nice restaurants on the North End.

Excellent space, good spot to get all over Boston from with top pizza nearby, couple of convenient coffee options, and of course the Celtics if that's your thing (North Station just around the corner). Totally great to walk around the old street system in North End, hit the classic little food spots tucked into neighborhood corners, etc., or head right to the main arteries nearby and take the straight routes. Perfect Boston visit."

It's in the heart of Boston's north end downtown culture and within walking distance to practically everything (transportation, markets, TD Garden, local pubs/eateries). Stephen was also a great host and we appreciated his flexability. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and I would definetely stay here  again. Thanks for making my birthday a memorable one!"

We hit the freedom trail the next day which was only a few blocks away. We rented a car for the day to explore Rockport, Salem, and Cape Cod, enterprise rentals also only a few blocks away. We had yummy treats at the Boston Public Market a few blocks away then took the nearby rail to visit Harvard and MIT. It rained our last night so we walked around the corner and picked up the best pizza from the oldest shop in New England. This place is in the best part of town for sight seeing!! Everything is literally a few blocks away!! The apartment was a haven after each busy day, great living room hang out space, and two private bedrooms to relax in.

We were traveling with two young kids and the apartment was perfect - our bigger boy stretched out on a queen bed and there was plenty of room to put up a portacot in the room with him. Exceeded our expectations - a very comfortable base to explore Boston. The neighborhood is wonderful - we would recommend the 'Regina Pizza' and 'Mike's Pastry' dinner double if eating out or getting takeout.

The only drawback is that the apartment complex is quite old and therefore not very soundproof. You can literally hear everything going on in the building.

The kitchen is well equipped, except for absence of a microwave and clock.  The towels and bedding were excellent, and we had no problem with the WiFi.  The BIG attraction of the apartment is its location and that was very true.  We had no difficulty walking to the Aquarium, Quincy Market, Boston Common, ant it is on Freedom Trail. Both Haymarket and North Stations are accessable and no problem using MBTA to travel to Harvard museums or light rail (from North Station) to Salem.  Probably best recommendation is our 12 year old had a wonderful and amazing time.  A vacation she will remember and cherish."

4573238,38826066,2015-07-19,28379667,Ell,"这次美国之旅我通过airbnb定了7家住宿,这是唯一一家不能做饭的!似乎没有煤气。因为该住宿是由中介统一管理的,所以当出现问题联系中介时,就会很不给力。幸亏只住2天"
4573238,39375310,2015-07-23,31022006,Noel,Perfect location for Boston! Everything was wonderful! The air conditioning saved us!
4573238,39546536,2015-07-24,7380549,Anthony,"The location of this unit was perfect, right in the heart of the North End.  It's on the small side, but it was more than big enough for my needs.  This was also expected -- as a previous resident of the North End, it's very typical for the neighborhood."
"The whole process of obtaining keys and checking out were as simple as could be!  Great place!\"",,,,,
4573238,40280597,2015-07-29,5656011,Aaron,Good location if you like Italian food.  Apartment is quaint.  Air conditioning in the rooms would be nice
4573238,43781979,2015-08-22,18694276,Jonathan,The apartment was in a great location next to everything in Boston. The check in was a bit confusing there was some mix up but it was all handled. This place is next to all the best restaurants in town.
4573238,45057410,2015-08-31,29931869,Amanda,"This apartment is in the best location.  You're right in the heart of the north end, you're a short walk to the subway line, less than a ten minute walk to the harbor/wharfs, and right next to the Paul Revere house (which is on the freedom trail if you're into doing the touristy things)."
The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed. The AC worked VERY well. The beds were comfortable,even the futon in the living room.,,,,
Communication before checking in was very thorough and made the whole process easy.,,,,,
This apartment is a good size,we never felt cramped. The bathroom was tiny,but honestly it never posed an issue and we had three of us staying during our trip.,,,
When we make future trips back to Boston,"we are absolutely going to try and book this location again.. I can't stress enough how perfect the location is! We all had a very good experience :)\"",,,,

4573238,49865242,2015-10-06,35055554,Lucy,We just stay one day.  good location but weird smelly when we arrived. The night we feel exhausted and very bad.
At first,we thought it was gas leak because the old gas stove automatically heat and even put off button. So we called the agency  to check not smoothly because late in night. We called the host but was voice box.  Then 4th stairs'guest called it was full of weird smelly in the stair and lobby too. The agency called the FD to check,It was the new electric heaters just put on. Bad plastic smelly like gas.,,,
And agency'24h telephone we made sure how to get back key,"they said don't Know and i should call back next morning… not smoothly .\"",,,,
4573238,50424711,2015-10-12,28398818,Joshua,"The apartment was just as advertised, Best Boston Location. We couldn't have asked for a better spot. We were walking distance to everything we wanted to see and the best part is that you are surrounded with authentic Italian restaurants and coffee shops.  We can't wait to stay here again."
4573238,50914228,2015-10-16,31875177,Sandra,"Excelente ubicación, el dpto muy cómodo pero no tan limpio. Tenía lo indispensable en utensilios de cocina, faltaban copas, sacacorchos"

4573238,54236055,2015-11-17,17415605,Claudiane,The apartment is well located. We parked the car for the week-end and did not use it as we walked to anywhere we wanted to go. We had an issue with the heating system but Dror was understanding and we resolved the situation in a timely manner. Although can easily host 6 persons (2 in each bed) the apartment is not adapted for a baby as there is no bath nor a microwave.
4573238,54858693,2015-11-25,2132749,Matt,"The location of this apartment is in a great part of Boston, a lot of restaurants and bars nearby. The apartment is small but perfect size for a couple people. There is a lot to do in the neighborhood, one of the best cities I've ever visited."

Good: looks as advertised; great location next to the main street in the North End and Downtown Boston,,,,,
Bad: No microwave,"bathroom was as big as 3 people standing side-by-side. A bit cold in the bathroom and by one of the windows in the kitchen.\"",,,,
4573238,55567650,2015-12-02,46686120,Chua,Place is along freedom trail and near quincy market. Bathroom a bit small though and door was faulty.

The area of Boston is Little Italy and is full of great Italian restaurants,lounges,coffee shops and bistros.  The area has a ton of personality and is very safe.  The area is also fairly central to downtown Boston.,,,

4978467,33174219,2015-05-25,33401635,Denise,"Lovely and comfortable place in a truly beautiful historical neighborhood. About an 8-minute walk to Boston Commons. Just know that the neighborhood has some steep streets, in case there's any medical issue that would prevent you from making that walk."
My host was very accommodating and very patient with the ways of this Airbnb newbie! For that I am more than thankful. Our communication was swift and everything moved along very efficiently. Everything in the place was as pictured. Overall,"a great experience.\"",,,,
4978467,42010006,2015-08-10,1421152,Flip,Kevin was really accommodating and his flat was clean and spacious in a really lovely area. Walking distance to everything that we needed and only a 15minute drive from the airport. Would definitely recommend!
1092093,4878761,2013-05-30,6224255,Bill,"Loved this place. Has a real lived-in feel which I personally liked a lot. The bed's comfortable, the shower is reasonably powerful and the kitchen is replete with everything you need to enjoy the stay. Being on the top floor means no noise from above and plenty of light in both the living room and bedroom. Nice spot, too - seconds from a decent pub and a top pizza place."
1092093,6959363,2013-09-01,6519617,Rayane,Perfect stay in Anne's apartment. Nice large kitchen/dining room and living room. Anne was always nice and available to us through the whole stay.
1092093,18560989,2014-08-28,17947306,Boris,"I enjoyed staying in Anne's apartment.  It is spacious, clean, on a quiet street and in short walking distance from the Longwood medical area where I need to be.  Anne is very friendly and accommodating host and I would certainly stay in her apartment again.  Thank you."
1092093,21963981,2014-10-27,4724253,Lawrence,Anne was quite helpful upon move-in. Nice to have the building manager living on the floor below in case something isn't working.  The space is well lit and nicely appointed with all kinds of nice art and furniture. Deck off of the bedroom is a great addition for nice weather.
1092093,22485978,2014-11-08,1983654,Suzanne,The apartment is accurately shown in photos. Ann was good to work with. A friend and I shared the place for a week.
Pros:,,,,,
***Great location (5-10 minute walk to LMA; two T lines within 4 blocks; 2 T stops from MFA; supermarket,drugstore,and many places to get food nearby.,,,
—Resides on a lovely,quiet street.,,,,
—Good amount of space,with separate dining area,and even a porch if you're there in the right weather.,,,
—Two full baths (one quite large),one with bathtub.,,,,
—Great water pressure; hot water plentiful.,,,,,
—Nice linens.,,,,,
—Good internet connection.,,,,,
—Quiet.,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
—Place needs updating. Master bed is small and sags in middle,many of the chairs sag,place is dusty and needs thorough cleaning and new paint job,as well as weeding out of kitchen drawers and cupboards. (It's not that the place is dirty,it's just that there is too much stuff in it,much of it old and not in the best condition. It's a bit like living in a used furniture shop; just the far side of eclectic.)
—Located up a steep Amsterdamesque staircase with no landing outside door. Not a good option for anyone with mobility or vertigo issues.,,,,,
—If you plan to use sofa bed,ask Ann to bring an air mattress. She provided that for us,which was much appreciated.,,,
—Cost a bit high for condition.,,,,,
Having said that,"I would probably stay there again as I found it overall comfortable and very convenient.\"",,,,
1092093,28870033,2015-03-31,26571992,Yasemin,"I absolutely loved this apartment! It had so much charm, comfort, nice space, and character. The pictures are all accurate and the experience of living in it was better than I could hope for. I stayed for a full month and was calling it home after a week. The deck is heavenly and is facing a lovely church where Ted Kennedy's memorial was held back in the day. As for the exteriors, it is located on a lovely little street called Worthington, lined up with brown stone 2-3 floor homes with families and young people together, absolutely wonderful. It is literally a 1-2 min walk to the Green line metro stops Brigham Circle and Longwood, as well as the Stop & Shop Market where you can buy groceries. I also enjoyed dining at the Mission Sushi & Thai restaurant and the Penguin cafe in that same area. Anne was wonderful, very professional and made me feel safe and secure. Another bonus is the 2nd floor neighbor who works at the company that takes care of the maintenance of this apt so if there were any problems with heating etc, which there were none when I stayed, he would be there to immediately take care of it. Wonderful experience overall, thank you Anne. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
1092093,53258921,2015-11-07,5860041,Celine,"Anne hat mich sehr freundlich empfangen und war eine wunderbare Gastgeberin. Das Appartment ist sehr schön und gut gelegen, um schnell in die Innenstadt zu kommen."
1092093,66535557,2016-03-23,22376800,Zaharadeen,"We had a very good experience at Anne's place. Good sized Duplex Penthouse, fully stocked with everything you need for that homely feeling. Great location with accessibility to stores and public transportation. Anne was fantastic, an absolute professional, who put in a lot of effort to ensure we were comfortable during our stay. Great experience and highly recommended for anyone visiting the city looking for accommodation."
1092093,71754961,2016-04-28,36674933,Amanda,"The location was extremely convenient for our stay and the duplex itself was delightful, interesting, and let in good amount of sunshine.  It was a wonderful place to stay.  The water pressure was fantastic.  Anne was frank and prompt with her responses.  She was very flexible to our changing schedule."
14092430,87832656,2016-07-22,10859300,Darren,"Brett and Lily, did a great job of communicating arrival procedures and were warm and friendly. Location was great with easy access to shopping, dining, and transportation."

14092430,89456209,2016-07-28,62699242,Ioana,Very convenient location but the building was loud. I could not fall asleep until after one of the two nights I spent at your place.

14092430,94671857,2016-08-16,42618132,Ryan,"If you want an inexpensive spot to explore Boston this is a great choice. You're within blocks from neighborhood coffee shops, pizza and craft beer bars as well as the Museum of Fine Art and the Isabella Stewart Gardner. The Brigham Circle Green Line stop and Roxbury Orange Line are walkable to reach other parts of the city. It is a 2nd floor apartment and it is on a hill so be aware if you have mobility issues or don't travel light. It isn't posh but well worth it for the price - looks like the photos. If we had any questions Brett was very responsive and friendly."
14092430,95388605,2016-08-19,14962139,Paul Et Valérie,"Endroit lumineux, climatisé. Brett très sympathique. Salle de bain et cuisine pas très propres."

The room was clean, comfortable and had its own privacy being somewhat separate from main living area. A clean bathroom just down the hall and a comfortable common area also separate from main living area. Very nice."
The location is also great. Many restaurants etc to chose from within walking distance. Small ma and pop convenience store a minute walk away which was nice for grabbing coffe before an early departure. A park nearby and on the waterfront which was helpful as I was catching a barge early to a nearby island.,,,,,
Highly reccomend Tyler and his place to any respectful visitor.,,,,,

Tyler was very efficient in communicating via email before my trip and promptly answered all my questions. The room is very spacious, has air condition, good internet. Also, it is a very short walk (about 5 minutes) from the subway station. Not much around the neighborhood (restaurants or shops), although it is perfectly safe. The house was very quiet.

I am looking forward to my next trip."
14308511,95997792,2016-08-21,45090994,Megan,"Brendan was the best host I've ever had!!! I moved to Boston for work and I stayed with him while I was looking for an apartment. He was so welcoming and gave me a perfect first impression of the city. My room was super comfy and complete with a queen size mattress. His dog Yaffa is also THE sweetest dog you will ever meet! She is very calm and won't bother you in the slightest. His place is a 5 minute walk from the T stop making trips downtown super convenient and quick. Within 15 minutes you can reach Northeastern's Campus, Back Bay/South End, or Downtown Crossing. I bought a T pass and just hopped on and hopped off it all the time. He also lives just two blocks off the main street (Centre St.)  in Jamaica Plain. There you can easily pick up drinks, or have fantastic local eats! I had ice cream from J.P. Licks (Brownie Batter and Coffee Cookies n' Cream :P) and amazing Lebanese food from Cafe Beirut. There are tons of other places to eat including Thai, American, and Latin restaurants. Brendan and I also visited the Arnold Arboretum which is also just a few blocks away. It is truly the best location and its an awesome price!"

Jamaica Plain is a great area just outside of Boston, with easy access to restaurants and shops.  The apartment was a quick walk to the Orange Line (subway) that leads directly into the heart of Boston.  Brendan was very accommodating.  He was required to attend a last-minute business trip that would have interfered with check-in, so he immediately notified us and made arrangements for a friend to be there to check us in and get us situated.  As a result, the check-in/check-out process was very smooth.  As Brendan's listing advises, he does have a dog;  she was very sweet, calm, and well-behaved.  Overall, we had a great stay, and I would gladly stay again!"
14308511,98287967,2016-08-30,19094434,Karl,"Brendan wasn't there when we arrived, but we were greeted by a friend who was house sitting. The room is an easy short walk to transit and fine for sleeping. Only one available outlet made charging two phone overnight difficult. If there was coffee or breakfast available, we weren't told. But the room is convenient to local shops and restaurants. Overall, we had a pleasant stay."

Charlestown and Fenway Park are about a 15 minute Uber ride as well. A small local beach, L Street Beach, is about a 30 minute walk, or about a mile or so down the way. The bathroom was spacious, and though we didn't use it, it was definitely a bonus to have the washer/dryer on hand.

The room was great. With the loft set up,it feels like two different spaces. Also,it was very quiet inside the room which made working very easy. Another note I liked was the sky light right above the bed. That was a really cool way to wake up.,,,

3629014,22822392,2014-11-15,16109708,Alexandria,Andrea was such a welcoming host. She meets you in the driveway and from the start to end of your stay everything she does is in such great detail. It was amazing sleeping in the loft on a cold night with the heat in and skylight open sleeping in the stars. It is in the city but it is so quiet. I heard nothing all night. I must say I had the most amazing hot shower!
3629014,22879481,2014-11-16,23188428,Justin,"Relaxed and insightful! Andrea was an incredible host and beyond interesting of a person. We got lost in conversation before I even got my boots off. She was social but also very respectful of my travel plans and knew when to give me my space (a hard balance to find with airbnb hosts). After changed travel plans I was grateful enough to have a place to sleep on short notice, let alone such a great room/house. If you are interested in urban design this house is another Boston sight in itself. Will definitely recommend and hopefully get the chance to repeat."
3629014,22937196,2014-11-17,3096766,Kay,"Andrea is SO incredibly welcoming! The room is cozy and the house itself is beautiful. Common areas are also quite welcoming, as are the cat and dog (so adorable!). The bed is firm, which I found excellent, and the skylight made me feel like I was sleeping in a treehouse. Bathroom is soothing and spa-like. I'm so glad I stayed here instead of booking an impersonal hotel. Really can't say enough good things about Andrea and this incredible space."

Our room was clean, nicely decorated, and was supplied with everything we could possibly need. Andrea shared her house and family with us making us feel right at home. She met us with a warm greeting and showed us the property and answered any questions both professionally and politely. She is a perfect host. The property is in a most convenient location, near the train, for our trips to the city, and she supplied off street parking so traveling around the city was as easy as possible and worry-free. It's a great place to stay."
3629014,23307661,2014-11-28,2045231,Kathy,Andrea was a wonderful host. I had a special request due to a last minute move to Boston on Thanksgiving day. She got back to me right away even though it was very very late at night. She helped me with the booking process.
Upon arrival,she greeted us and helped us in every way possible. Even offered us home cooked meals because all the restaurants were closed on Thanksgiving night.,,,,
The place was super cozy. The queen bed was very comfortable (we got the best night of sleep in the PINK Room in all of that weeks time). The bed is right under a skylight that opens and we were able to see the snow falling as we look up from the bed. We were a little worried about being cold at night at first,but the blanket is extremely warm and fluffy. Temperature was never a problem. The house was immaculate and clean,especially the bathroom. The bathrobes are of great quality and very thick and same goes for the towels. The room is small so space can get tight with luggage etc.,,,

You can tell that she's put a lot of thought into every small detail of your stay. She met us out in the driveway and greeted us even though we arrived a bit late. She made sure that we had everything we needed, recommended some great local spots and was very respectful of our privacy. We only stayed one night but I would have loved to stay longer. Highly recommended!"

3629014,24675451,2015-01-01,24841549,Elizabeth,"My stay at the Pink Room was delightful in every way. Andrea's home is uniquely beautiful, so if you're like me and a warm yet quirky (and spotlessly clean!) interior design makes you feel instantly at home, you will love your stay here. The room itself was cozy and lovely; I slept well on the luxuriously comfortable pull-out sofa. Andrea had even put up little holiday decorations to make us feel welcome. As a host, Andrea was helpful and thoughtful--she made delicious muffins for us one morning!--and she balanced friendly chatting with giving us our space when we wanted it. I would not hesitate to stay in the Pink Room again."
3629014,25298179,2015-01-11,7402744,John,"Even though i don't have time to write this, this is a review i want to write -- simply to let Andrea and her future guests know how much we enjoyed her, her house, her accommodations, her intelligence, her conversation, and how much we appreciated her attention to our comfort, her attention to detail, her easy greetings/easy goodbyes, not to mention the respectful way she treats people, how welcome she made us feel, how clear her instructions were, how clean everything was, and what a joy it was to live in and share the artistic creation that is her house."
3629014,25780149,2015-01-25,2670088,Cindy,"Andrea is such a welcoming host that I happily moved upstairs to the Pink Room due to a previous reservation in her Urban Oasis. The room is warm, comfortable, and supplied with beautiful linens and towels.  An added bonus was that I shared the common  art-inspired spaces with Andrea, her delightful daughter, and sweet pets.  I felt very welcome and relaxed.  (And Andrea makes the best home-made scones ever, and I live in Ireland.) The neighborhood has great, diverse restaurants and markets within easy walking distance.  Can't recommend highly enough."

Starting from booking to check out, Andrea was readily accessible to answer any questions and always willing to help. When we arrived, she was there to personally greet us. She gave us a tour of the place and showed us all the details about the room.  And speaking of the room... So Awesome!  The lofted bed stole the show.  The shower is amazing. The entire house was great."
Andrea is on my top 'favorite persons list' in the entire world. She is so amazing and spending time with her and in her home was an experience we will never forget.,,,,,
I strongly suggest The Pink Room to anyone traveling to Boston. It's a 5 minute walk to the T (Boston's subway),and you can get basically anywhere from that. If you are going to be there a few days,buy a week pass - it's like 19 bucks - definitely worth it. And if you have any questions about what to do,see,or go,Andrea knows!  Just ask her and she will tell you.

Her place is so close to the Orange line T stop which is extremely convenient to get anywhere in the city. We wished we had more time to explore Jamaica Plains, as wit is a beautiful area with amazing architecture that is unique compared to other parts of Boston and full of charming shops and restaurants that we mostly missed out on in our rushing around. Andrea is incredibly warm, friendly and accommodating and made sure we were well informed and comfortable throughout our stay. She offered us great advice on getting around and even on how to navigate on marathon day."

The listing is a good representation of The Pink Room, but  my actual experience exceeded all expectations and it is not easy to sum up the real warmth and subtle charm of the room, Andrea, and the whole stay."
Andrea is an artist in the creation of a wonderful experience and a beautiful environment,both tangible and intangible. Such a lovely space with attention to many special details. Andrea herself is also a very special person and a delight as a host. From my first request to the last good-byes,she was wonderful. She was always very quick to respond and very resourceful in providing amenities. Her daughter,cat,and great Dane are also great company. Just as she describes,she was happy to engage in conversation or leave us with our privacy. I very much appreciated her clear communication about details and her warmth in conversation.
I stayed for three days in The Pink Room with my dad. I slept in the loft bed,which was dreamy. We came to Boston to visit my niece,who lives in Jamaica Plain,and see a Red Sox game. The location was great,very near the Orange Line,and there are lots of good restaurants in the area. I thought we would be out a lot
I slept like a baby every night- the mattress and linens were wonderful. I was a little nervous about the ladder,not being a spring chicken exactly,but it was well designed,solid,and the wood was firm,not slippery under my feet. The coffee was very good
The entire experience was restful and refreshing.,,,,,
Needless to say,I would happily return and look forwarding to my next chance to come to Boston and stay in The Pink Room.,,,,

3629014,37218271,2015-07-05,20846021,Shelby,The Pink Room was everything I could have hoped. My roommate and I joined Andrea at her home in the Pink Room for the 4th of July weekend and our stay was absolutely perfect.
The Pink Room is located in a stunning part of Boston,and it is easily accessible to the city center within minutes by public transportation or car. Andrea gave us a warm welcome tour making us immediately feel right at home. The Pink Room comes with everything you may possibly need during your stay such as towels,a welcome basket with goodies,wash clothes,a TV,fast WiFi
She gave us great insight on the city and was available for any questions and concerns that we had regarding the city and sightseeing.,,,,,
"I HIGHLY  recommend staying with Andrea if you are planning a trip to Boston. Andrea and the Pink Room will make your trip worth while!  \"",,,,,
3629014,38334430,2015-07-14,3377337,Kristian Bay,The pink room is just great. We loved staying at Andreas place. Everything was clean and perfect. Jamaica Plain is a brilliant neighbourhood and Boston center is just a few stops away. Our recommendation is: just book it!
3629014,38936833,2015-07-19,38199189,Kevin,"It was a delightful experience at Andrea's. I could tell that Andrea cares a great deal about her clients and tries her best to accommodate them. She will take her time and effort to make you feel welcomed- no matter how tired and busy she is. She offered us coffee and fruits in the morning, and made sure we know how to get around in Boston."
The house feels and smells homey. Room is exactly as described- roomy for one person,perfect for two. The loft bed is comfy and spacious. The couch can be turned into a bed- which is comfortable and long enough for a 5'11 guy like me. Andrea is very particular with details- the welcoming basket in our room (mint chocolate,biscuit,ear plugs and blinders,shampoo/conditioner and shower gels),fresh linen and high quality towels etc. I love how she decorated the place with artwork. It's not hard to tell this is a house of an artist!
The neighbourhood is quiet and safe. It's easy to get downtown- the train stop is 5-minutes walk away. There's also a liquor/convenience store that opens late.,,,,,
Andrea has a great dan and a kitty who is very friendly and cuddly :),,,,,
I'm sure your stay with Andrea will be as delightful as ours! If I visit Boston in the future,"I'm sure I'll stay with Andrea again- no need to look further.\"",,,,
3629014,40159628,2015-07-28,38798231,Cassandra,"My friend and I experienced a short, 3 night stay in the pink room on our recent trip to Boston. This was my first time with airbnb and, let me say, it was wonderful. The pink room is all it is described as and more. The loft bed is comfortable, as is the living space, and everything is clean but very homey. Everything is decorated with a very eclectic style, which we loved."
What made this trip even more special was Andrea. She was welcoming from the get go,making us feel very comfortable and right at home. Beyond that,her recommendations for what to do around the city took our trip to a whole new level. We came to the city with very little specific ideas of what we were going to do and Andrea was able to point us in the right direction every day. She was so informative and welcoming without being overbearing.,,,
Jamaica Plains is an adorable neighborhood with quite a few little gems. We visited several restaurants in the area that were all wonderful. If you're looking for something to do outside JP Andrea keeps a wonderful little journal of activities to do and restaurants to visit all around the city. It is also conveniently located and  we were able to explore other areas of the city with ease.,,,,,
The consensus of the trip:  we would highly recommend a stay in the pink room. If you're going to Boston,"look no further! \"",,,,
3629014,40417900,2015-07-31,14964664,Claire,"Andreas house was beautiful, in a great location, and we felt very welcome there- Andrea and her family went out of the way to make us feel at home and we loved every second of our stay! The room is beautiful, clean and comfortable and very interesting! We would definitely come again."
3629014,41142301,2015-08-04,39187235,Loren,"We enjoyed a three night stay at the PINK ROOM.  As first-time Airbnb guests we were not quite sure what to expect; Andrea was a attentive and gracious host and we found the accommodations to be just as advertised. She worked hard to made us very comfortable with how we share the very pleasant spaces in her charming house. The room was clean and comfortable, the coffee and tea service was much appreciated, as was the loan of her iron and ironing board. She shared a lot of information about the neighborhood and we enjoyed walking from her place to a couple of Jamaica Plan restaurants."
3629014,42999351,2015-08-16,41009911,Bruce,Andrea is really a good host. She made everything comfortable during my stay and she helped me a lot for my travel in Boston and Rhode Island. The most amazing thing about Andrea's house is the artistic decorations made by herself.  I would highly recommend Andrea for anyone looking for a host.
3629014,43335113,2015-08-18,35345206,Xiaoran,"Very safe place,near the subway station. You can have your own space, it is important.you will get a letter with all the details you should pay attention to.Andrea lives with her daughter. Both of them are kind people.i have a good experience living here."
3629014,45312827,2015-09-01,41539651,松扬,"the review for English language guest:The pink room is really a brilliant house. Beautiful decoration, clean environment, comfortable bed and fast WIFI connecting, all of these things you can enjoy in this wonderful house. And the most important thing is that Adrea, the landlord of the housr is really a friendly and kind person! I really thank for the all helps she gives."
Because of her,I have a great time in Boston!:) Thanks very much!,,,,

3629014,46089099,2015-09-07,36226761,Breanna,"\"We spent three fantastic days at Andrea's PINK ROOM and had a wonderful time. The home is warm, inviting, and very clean.  We were welcomed by Andrea and her daughter, along with a cuddly cat and a playful Great Dane. There are beautiful pieces of art created by Andrea and her family all over.  It is obvious that Andrea cares a lot about her guests. The PINK ROOM has everything that one could possibly need during a stay. There is a window a/c, fans, toiletries, a flat screen, super wi-fi, snacks, robes, newspapers, and more.  There are restaurant reviews from local publications, flyers, directions, and maps of the city. There is even a card to use for the train (the \"\"T\"\")"
3629014,49726645,2015-10-05,45305832,Debbie,"This was an excellent experience. Our first time with airbnb. Our host was friendly, engaging and super accommodating. She was conscientious and paid attention to the details and made our visit as if we were staying with good friends. There were four of us-two in loft and two on fold out couch which was surprisingly comfortable with the high quality pillow top. Home is close to subway-easy assess, great neighborhood, close to restaurants. Definitely recommend"
3629014,50388661,2015-10-11,8789661,Hina,"Andrea was very friendly and hospitable. Because my husband and I arrived in the middle of the night, she made sure we knew where the keys were and were able to get into the room. The room was clean, organized and met all our needs. She was a great host. We would recommend the Pink Room to anyone!"
"\"",,,,,
3629014,51042830,2015-10-17,2871282,Malte,"Great experience at the Pink Room. I came to Boston for a work visit by car, and Andrea's place was very convenient with a parking space right next to her house and only a 2-minute walk to the subway station. Very well organized and very accommodating, given my delayed and late arrival. Thank you!"
3629014,51993536,2015-10-25,45609104,Thao,"Everything has been said in existing comments on Andrea and her Pink room and I confirm: very hospitable, very convenient for public train (5 min walk), very clean and calm. I would only add that if you look for ideas of home decoration, you should go there."
3629014,54292825,2015-11-17,6206488,Ned,"Great Space. Great Host. Everything is as described and more, in a very good way. Very artistic and inspiring environment.  Had to cut the trip short unfortunately, but had a great stay!"
3629014,61046272,2016-01-31,21013013,Sara,"My experience is a unique one. Andrea took, what could have been, a harrowing move from Cincinnati to Boston and made it a complete breeze. She went completely out of her way to provide a long-term solution when I was without even a decent short-term solution. The Pink Room is cozy, yet open. It is functional and private and, above all, clean as a whistle. I can say with certainty that Andrea takes great pride in her home, as she has built so much of it with her own two hands, and it shows. She puts a lot of work into curating an inviting space that one can navigate with efficient ease. She is an incredibly active and admirable woman. Her daughter, Shayna, is delightful and has adopted her mother's open and intelligent charm. I still have another month left in their home and I'm already sad it's halfway over."
The house itself is in a beautiful and convenient location. It is a quiet and safe neighborhood that is mere steps from the Orange Line T station,which runs like clockwork. There is a wonderful coffee shop/grocery/cafe right around the corner. Jamaica Plain is a fantastic neighborhood with excellent food and great accessibility. The Jamaica Pond is very close and is a beautiful and peaceful place to take a walk when the weather is nice. Otherwise,the Pink Room is the coziest place you can imagine to laze the day away.,,,
"Stay here. It's wonderful.\"",,,,,
3629014,64061804,2016-02-29,21013013,Sara,"At the end of two months with Andrea in her home, I'm just as pleased, if not more so than I was before. Not a single complaint from me!"
3629014,69097707,2016-04-09,53332497,Eugene,"Nice, comfortable room. Everything is convenient, high quality and cute. Interesting, sociable, and kind hostess. Nearby (5 minutes) from the house to the underground line. Up the street center with restaurants and shops just 5 min walk. Excellent accommodation and location."
3629014,69901998,2016-04-14,58489344,Deborah,"Andrea's house and the Pink Room feel like a little cabin nestled in the woods, even though it is a mere few blocks walk to the orange line and grocery stores. Staying in the pink room is like going on retreat. Andrea is so kind and generous, she baked these incredible blueberry muffins for me for breakfast. Even though she was always available for conversation when I was interested, she was also very conscious of when I wanted to just putter in solitude. Her house and the room are pristine and comforting. At first I was a little worried about the long list of rules she sent me, thinking that I was going to feel encumbered, but the truth is, they made me feel at home, like I fit in, because I knew exactly what to expect and what was expected of me. Plus, the rules are really all just little ways she keeps her space homey and hospitable. I LOVED sleeping in the loft bed, it probably wouldn’t be the best if you have mobility issues, but Andrea is so accommodating that she’d probably help you find an alternative. I hesitate to share such a glowing review only because I want to make sure the Pink Room is available when I go back!"
3629014,70822126,2016-04-21,47569509,Bruno,"For our first Airbnb experience, we had a great chance to be hosted by Andrea. Her warm welcome was really appreciated and we felt really comfortable in her house. The “Pink room” is great, nicely decorated, ultra clean and with all the necessary furniture. Special mention to her home-made muffins ! Andrea’s house is perfectly located for someone who wants to explore downtown Boston (5 min walking distance from Stony Brook subway station; i.e. 15min from city center with metro, running from 5am to 12pm); very calm neighborhood, with some shops and decent restaurants at walking distances. Altogether, we will definitely recommend Andrea's Pink room !"
3629014,79431917,2016-06-12,72351106,Liang,"我和我的朋友两个人住了8天。这间房子设计精巧,也非常舒适。房子离地铁站很近,但却是一个闹中取静的好地方。在boston这个地方,房间的性价比非常高。房东的各项规则对保持家中的环境非常重要。疲劳一天后回到家中的淋浴也让人感觉很舒服。配有停车位,这非常重要;因为我们是开车到波士顿的,而波士顿市中心的停车费用太高了。我和房东交谈了一次,非常非常喜欢她的style,她真的非常nice;可惜没有时间多和她交流。希望以后还会有机会!最后,Andrea的猫和狗都非常可爱。我尤其喜欢那条大狗,太酷了。"

3629014,86716702,2016-07-17,81720358,Tecle,"For our first Airbnb, my daughter and I chose Andrea's place. Have to say it was such a pleasant experience that for futur travel I will have to consider Airbnb options before hotels. The place was as described - safe, clean, comfortable - and centrally located for our purposes."
Andrea was a great host- very thorough,engaging,and helpful with restaurants and other local info. For my teenage daughter,the dog and the loft may have been the highlight of her stay.  For me,it was the delicious yellow cherry tomoates that Andrea  graciously shared from her lone tomato plant!,
Also,as a runner,I always look for convenient routes to run during my travels. On three mornings,I was able to enjoy some good miles around the Jamaica pond trails which is less than a mile from Andrea's place.,,
Overall,"It was a good experience. \"",,,,
3629014,87311341,2016-07-19,46978517,Eduardo,"We (Wife, son and myself) spend a couple of nights at Andrea's and we were happy with our experience.  It was convenient to be able to keep our car safely parked by the Pink Room  and use the nearby subway station (5-10 min walk) for our visits to Boston. It was also a great opportunity to enjoy the vibe of the Jamaica Plain's neighbourhood. Andrea was very attentive to details and provided all needed information for us to feel comfortable (and safe) at her place.  The room is small but it was just enough for the three of us, specially because our plan was to spend most of the time out of the house anyways.  There was a bathroom across our room, which was pretty much exclusive for us - the shower was great.  It was nice to talk to Andrea and enjoy her patio. Andrea also gave us two great recommendations for dinner, 3 gatos (a tapas bar) and Bella Luna."
3629014,87915766,2016-07-22,7189176,Bhagyesh,"The Pink Room is a wonderful relaxing place convenient to many Boston locations. Andrea is a lovely host and makes your stay very convenient for you. She has a welcome basket with comforting goodies and shows you around her beautiful kitchen and shared spaces herself. She has lovely  pets too, but will also take extra care to keep them away from any guests in your party who might not be comfortable around pets. Her pre check in instructions are thorough and she stays in contact to make it easy for you to find the place and check in. I'd definitely recommend checking out her place on your next Boston visit."
3629014,89824926,2016-07-30,3025153,Luke,Wow. This place is fantastic. Great host. Great home. Great neighbourhood.

Andrea is an absolutely wonderful host and I would say that she incorporates everything that makes Airbnb special. During booking my stay, Andrea helped so much with difficulties I was experiencing with the registration process and she was always immediately responded to my questions and problems in a kind and helpful way. That way, coming to Boston from overseas, I felt as if I was coming to visit a place and person I already knew. Andrea was very welcoming and has everything so well organized for her guests that I felt very much at home at her house. Sitting on her sofa talking to Andrea was as if we had seen each other multiple times before, as if visiting a family friend and that made my stay with Andrea absolutely pleasant!!"

1936861,10271279,2014-02-10,818759,Juliane,Doug was a great host. Everything was as described and worth it for the price. Very accessible by public transportation to Downtown Boston by bus with connection on the subway or bus 39. Friendly neighbourhood. He was very engaging and I really enjoyed chatting with him and his girl friend who passed by while I was at his house. Internet-high speed. I enjoyed the breakfast on the first day but later made my own. His dog Clem was adorable and friendly. I enjoyed watching movies on Netflix on his TV fro free.

1936861,11194234,2014-03-24,8116763,David,"From the bedroom to the bathroom and kitchen, the supreme level of cleanliness of Doug's residence rivals that of a number of hotels I have stayed at in the past. The commute to and from his location is a little bit tricky since you generally will need to transfer to a bus to get there, but that is more than made up for by the fact that it is a brilliantly quiet neighbourhood and one that gives you a look into a side of residential Boston altogether skipped by tourists. Being the thorough individual that he is, Doug gave me a compete orientation upon arrival about the amenities at his place and everything I needed to know to get in and out of the area. His instructions for catching the bus to the subway and vice versa were clear and concise, and even coming back all the way from Allston to his place at 11:45pm was a breeze. I regret that I only was in town for one evening and did not get a chance to know Doug better, but he was truly friendly and very accommodating throughout my brief stay."

Doug and Clem (his dog) are very welcoming. The place is nice and clean,and as shown in the pictures.,,,,
Rozindale is a bit out of the way,but the area is very beautiful with the Harvard Arboretum just around the corner for walks and a great view of downtown. Since I was not planning to spend time in downtown Boston or Cambridge this was the perfect place to stay for a first two nights.,,,,

He was flexible in my arrival time that night and had everything ready for me.  The room was nicely decorated and he had a fan for me to use and also gave me permission to turn on the AC if I felt I needed to (which I didn't).  He laid out variety of breakfast food and everything to make coffee or tea. His dog, Clem, is an incredibly sweet and polite little guy who hung out with me on the couch while I streamed Netflix before going to bed.  Douglas made sure I had everything I needed. I actually know the neighborhood well as I used to live a block away. It's a lovely, safe neighborhood with busses to the T as well as a commuter train all within walking distance. My only complaint (and it's a very small one) is that the bed sheets were a little bit scratchy, but the bed itself (twin) was very comfy and Douglas didn't mind when I slept until noon (I'm a night owl).  This was my first experience with Airbnb and I thought it was really great!"

He said it would be very (URL HIDDEN) 11:00pm I asked them to please be quiet since I needed to get up at 5am to work a 14 hour shift at the hospital.

1936861,52760857,2015-11-01,18834449,Nathan,"This was a clean, comfortable place to stay with convenient laundry.  I had an interesting conversation with the host about teaching and history.  And I liked the art in the room!"

1936861,53166549,2015-11-05,33591227,Eli,Accurate description. Host waited up to welcome me and show me around.
1936861,53418553,2015-11-08,20057846,Betty,Douglas was a totally nice and kind Host. He offers a lot of help and i felt more to live with a friend then with a stranger. I felt very welcome from the first Moment we met. His dog is such a cutie and a very happy and nice dog. The area is pretty and not that far away. The Bus connection and trains are very convinient in my oppinion.  There is a  huge park close to the appartment  as well and a lot of shops.
"I really can recommend to stay over at Dougla's place. :)\"",,,,,
1936861,53687590,2015-11-11,4835015,Jana,"Rozzie is a charming residential area less than half an hour away from Boston downtown. Douglas and Clem (dog) welcomed me in their home with a smile and friendly tail wagging! Room is beautiful, very clean,  spacious, warm and sunny. All essentials provided you might need on your travels. Douglas treats you with a nice morning coffee and it´s easy to stricke up a conversation with him."
Douglas is a wonderful host,I was very well taken care of and absolutely loved my stay there! Thank you,"Douglas!\"",,,
1936861,54176114,2015-11-16,21986356,Yuge,"Wonderful Airbnb experience! Nice but inexpensive accommodation with hospitable landlord. Doug is thoughtful, he arranged everything cozily and neatly."
1936861,54648997,2015-11-22,32093664,Marcus,"I really enjoyed my stay with Doug. He was very nice and friendly, and I appreciated his flexibility with my busy schedule. He was also very  knowledgeable of the area and had many great suggestions. His place is not in downtown as the listing states, but catching the bus or commuter line to reach Boston is not difficult. I definitely recommend his place!"
Thanks again,"Doug!\"",,,,
1936861,55704839,2015-12-04,31184205,Denise,Great host. Awesome place. Can't think of 1 negative thing to say. Highly recommended!!
1936861,55870735,2015-12-06,22915896,Joseph,Great place to stay. Clean and neat and Doug is a wealth of knowledge. Bed was comfortable and he made me feel very welcome. I recommend this highly. I had my own car in town which for me made it easier than staying in town with parking hassle.
1936861,55961259,2015-12-07,44303911,Sarah,"Douglas was kind and hospitable as ever, with welcoming dog and cozy private room."

1936861,56883115,2015-12-19,38007952,Karla,Douglas was super nice! I was running a bit late and it wasn't an issue. Plenty of street parking available. The room was clean and comfortable. His dog was adorable! Very hospitable!
1936861,60375732,2016-01-22,46024609,Joseph,"Doug was a very gracious host. He responded to my late request. The room looked great, the bed was comfortable, and his dog was very nice. I definitely enjoyed my stay, and would recommend staying."
1936861,60872189,2016-01-28,46024609,Joseph,This is my second time staying at Doug's place. Everything was great.
1936861,61006030,2016-01-30,50576464,Jose,Everything was good
1936861,61593477,2016-02-06,2597176,Layla,J'ai passé un bon séjour chez Douglas ! Lui et son chien Clément sont très accueillant ! L'appartement est propre et situé dans un quartier très sympa où il y a tout à proximité... Supermarchés et très bons restaurants !! Au niveau de la localisation c'est à 10 minutes à pied d'une ligne de métro mais un peu plus chère que les autres. Sinon tous les bus qui emmènent à la gare sont à 2 minutes à pied. On rejoint  le centre ville en 45 minutes environ mais le quartier est très sympa aussi il y a des parcs... Donc pour le prix de la chambre c'est pas mal !  Je recommande !
1936861,62215017,2016-02-12,46024609,Joseph,As always a very comfortable stay. Douglas is one of the nicest hosts. I recommend to all.
1936861,62773162,2016-02-16,56887224,Suzy,"The place was exactly as represented and even better: clean, comfortable, with small little touches like tea, maps, towels set out, and wifi code! The bed was a little soft and sunken in in the middle but I still slept well which is saying a lot because I usually do not sleep well when I'm not at home."
Neighborhood felt safe and street parking was tight but I was able to find a space pretty close to the place each of the 4 nights I had to park. And,well,free parking in Boston is always appreciated.,,,
Doug did everything he could to make us feel comfortable and at the last minute was willing to make accommodations above and beyond what was agreed to. He set up an extra bed in the room for no extra cost which makes this an even more amazing value! For the cost,I really did not expect the extra attention and small touches so it was a nice surprise.,,,,
"Doug is very hospitable and kind and easy-going. I'm not a big dog person but Clement was sweet and my niece loved him and looked forward to seeing him each night. I was concerned about dog hair and my allergies but I did fine-a little sniffly by the last night but that showed that Doug does a good job keeping things clean.\"",,,,,
1936861,63048207,2016-02-19,46024609,Joseph,"As usual, Doug is a great host. I stay here often when I am in town. Highly recommended."

1936861,64941806,2016-03-09,53652978,Hans,"The Wi-Fi is not stable, but the room is perfect and quiet! Doug is a kind guy with an adorable dog. The area has its own tone, make sure to go a little further for much more buses heading Forest Hill station, instead of waiting close to the house."
1936861,65932725,2016-03-18,46024609,Joseph,Douglas is a great host. He's easygoing and gracious. My stay was extremely comfortable. I recommend to all.
1936861,66295289,2016-03-20,57254377,Andrew,"This space was a perfect place to stay as I visited a potential graduate program.  The apartment/private room was clean and comfortable with lots of natural light.  Douglas was a great host with lots of helpful tips and recommendations for public transit and local restaurants.  He also has a friendly dog named Clement who made my stay all the more enjoyable.  The bathroom was clean and Douglas even provided me with soap, a washcloth, and a towel.  I would definitely recommend this space for anyone looking for an easy, comfortable, and affordable place to stay on a trip to Boston."
1936861,66851532,2016-03-25,3382647,M. Robert,Doug was a great host. I made plans last minute and he was still able to accommodate me. He was friendly and very relaxed. The room and house were clean welcoming. Doug told me  about some good restaurants in the area some places to see in Boston.
1936861,66860391,2016-03-25,61000714,Saurabh,Very well kept house and Doug is extremely hospitable and friendly. I would highly recommend this place.

My stay there was what I needed - good night's sleep before running the Boston Marathon and a nice place to recuperate afterwards. I didn't get to explore Rozzie too much, but from what I saw it's a cute area! The bus system is super easy to use to get to and from the T station. Clem (his dog) was the best! 3"
1936861,71285692,2016-04-24,16958873,Emi,Doug and his dog were two great hosts! His place very nice especially the bathroom is super clean! He was so kind and helpful that he helped me to look up train and bus schedule. The neighborhood is also very nice and calm.

1936861,73182745,2016-05-07,34743573,Jean-Francois,Communication was very easy with Douglas. He allowed me to come early to drop some items which made it easy for me to continue with my plans. The apartment was very clean and the room was perfect for my stay. Douglas is a very nice person and makes you feel very comfortable right from the start. I enjoyed my stay. Thank you.
1936861,73531544,2016-05-08,69134031,Luan,"Doug went the extra mile to accommodate my late request and changes in my check-in time. His place was very warm and homey. My stay was short, but that was enough for me to notice the books on the shelve and the cartoons on the hallway. And of course, it was really nice to be greeted by his friendly and well-behaved dogs. I also realized how nice the neighborhood was on my drive to and from. I would love to come back the next time."

1936861,80777171,2016-06-19,8875477,Janet,"Douglas was a great host. He responded to my questions almost immediately. The apartment is very clean, you can't even tell he has a dog. The bathroom is immaculate, the bed was comfortable and the room had a fan with a nice breeze. I was hanging out in Jamaica Plain and it's literally a 5 min drive ($6 uber ride) to Jamaica Plain. I would defenitely stay there again."

1936861,89428534,2016-07-28,2325688,Anum,I stayed at Douglas' place for a few days while I was preparing to move out of Boston. It worked out perfectly for me. I was able to come and leave according to my schedule and had a comfortable stay. The apartment is super clean and Douglas is a great host - he checked in with me several times about whether I had everything I needed and he was also accommodating when my plans changed and I had to check out earlier than expected.
1936861,91245173,2016-08-04,61000714,Saurabh,Doug is a fabulous host. I completely feel at home.

He gives great recommendations on what to do while in town. I ended up walking The Freedom Trail, which was really cool, and attending a game at Fenway Park! Doug is a great host and I would definitely stay here again. Highly recommended!!"
1936861,98116043,2016-08-29,26328497,Audrey,Great value for a short stay in a quiet neighborhood. Doug was responsive and very patient even though I was late. His dog is very friendly. Clean towels were provided and there were snacks in the room.

The instructions and amenities via the Stay Alfred app that was recommended was easy and super helpful. This apartment is in close walking distance to tons of restaurants bars shopping and parks including Fenway. The apartment itself was beautiful and clean and large enough to sleep our group of 6 comfortably. I hope to come back and stay again soon. We'll be recommending this place for sure. Thank you!
5454513,33573306,2015-05-30,8880030,Luis,really nice place in one of the best locations in Boston.
5454513,37462671,2015-07-07,752897,Sai,"The house decor was perfect and complies with the listing. We were traveling with 2 kids and 2 senior citizens. The location is perfect for restaurants within 5 min walk. Even though the apartment is little small it had all amenities very well arranged. Could do duck tours, town trolley tours and prudential tower observatory within walking distance. All the furniture is in great condition."
5454513,40205075,2015-07-29,30120972,Po,The property was very beautiful and bright. It is close to some really good restaurants and located in a nice and quite neighbourhood.

Spacious and to our needs,"properly furnished we experienced this much better then a stay in one of the hotels\"",,,,
5454513,55659512,2015-12-04,33136287,Ana Laura,"The apartment was great, exactly as it looks in the pictures. My host left a basket with some snacks and water in the fridge, which was a very nice gesture. The neighborhood was perfect, as we had business in the Hynes Convention Center, which is really close by. I would definitely try to go back in the future. Maintenance was also good, there was a problem with the washing machine that was fixed within 24 hours. The only problem I found is that I tried to park and the parking spot was occupied. That was right before leaving, so I parked outside momentarily, just to load the luggage."
5454513,64678393,2016-03-06,21609039,Susan,"Jordan is a very responsive host even though he is out of state. Excellent location near all that Boston has to offer with remote instructions for check in and check out. Everything went very smoothly, the unit is well appointed and parking is a huge plus!"
5454513,66976206,2016-03-26,18273740,Lazaro,The location was great. Great access to public transportation and anything needed is nearby. Apt is exactly as shown. No problems in check in/out. Have just one suggestion for the second bedroom: a curtain to reduce the street light at night. Highly recommend this property!
5454513,68731305,2016-04-06,56246918,Megan,The apartment was in a great location in Boston. It was large and nicely decorated and for the most part pretty clean...

12051674,68602127,2016-04-05,60994423,Daphne,"Although I did not have a chance to meet them, Alan and Eddie were great hosts. Gaining access to the apartment was very straightforward. I received a nice phone call to welcome me and ensure that I had everything that I needed. They were very responsive when I had questions throughout the weekend. I would definitely book with them again."
12051674,70685697,2016-04-19,21759893,Chantal,"We spent two nights at Alan's apartment. The place is nice and the view is outsanding from the balcony. We felt the apartment was probably new on the market, given that a few things were not available (dish towel, cutting knives, etc.). However, Alan brought anything we requested right away (thanks for the ironing board!). We felt safe in the neiberhood and parking was easy. All in all, an enjoyable experience."
12051674,72776168,2016-05-04,66135116,Songlin,thanks for try to povide me more convenient place. thanks
12051674,74953841,2016-05-17,49153368,Jean-Baptiste,Alan is nice and answers quickly to your questions. I booked the appartement the same day. Great view of the Boston skyline from the balcony. Nice district. Well equipped.
12051674,81535276,2016-06-23,79118164,Nick,I spent two nights at the place.Alan and Eddie were a great hosts. I love the view from the balcony.The only thing that I complaint that the blanket was dirty. Overall I really enjoy the place.
12051674,85437818,2016-07-11,50861330,Maddie,"Alan always responded quickly when I had questions, and the self-check in was super easy. When we had some kitchen issues, Kevin (Alan's associate) was responsive and solved the issue the same night. The location was good - close to downtown, close to the water, and I felt relatively safe in the neighborhood. It's about a 10-15 minute walk from the t stop, which was convenient. The apartment needs some work (it's an old house, so keep your expectations in check), but it didn't bother us so much because we stayed for a short weekend. It's a very simple place - it worked for us because we weren't home for much of the weekend. Be mindful of the funky steps - it is a third floor apartment, stair access only, and the steps are pretty steep and twisty. Would not recommend if you have lots of luggage or small children. The view of the city was delightful. Overall, I'd return for the view and the host."
12051674,86706543,2016-07-17,81167680,Michele,"This was our first AirBNB experience and likely our last.  While Kevin who greeted us was warm and helpful, the property was really awful from the moment we approached the front door.  The small landscape area was covered in garbage and the front door was covered in bird poop.  Once inside the hallway walls were filthy and the smell was overpowering.  The apartment was on the 3rd floor, which we expected, but the climb up the dilapidated stairs was an adventure.  The door into the apartment was flimsy with a large gap under it.  The air conditioning unit was the size of a large shoebox and placed in a front window, it was completely useless and wasn't powerful enough to cool a closet.  We specifically chose a place with a kitchen to save a bit on meals.  I wouldn't have eaten anything prepared in that kitchen much less have fed it to my family.  The stove was disgusting, the counters were sticky, the floor was missing large sections and the cabinets were falling off. There were words painted across the wall in the kitchen graffiti style.  The floor throughout the apartment was hardwood. While I understand that floors crack and separate over time, it was clear that no cleaning had been done in quite some time.  Nails, coins, buttons and much more was down in the very large cracks.  The inner shower curtain was covered in mildew and there was an actual plant growing out of one of the mildewed cracks in the wall around the tub enclosure. The cable and the internet did not function most of the weekend.  We did enjoy the view from the deck but, had to use extreme caution with the very dangerous railing, the broken glass door, the holes on the deck and the 2 bee colonies in the eaves of the roof. The futon in the living room fell apart when we went to use it and we left the pieces on the counter with a note.  I am unclear how this apartment is supposed to be for 5 people, there are accommodations for 4 people max. There were no working fire/smoke alarms in the place.  Finally, on our final night there I sustained 7 spider bites while sleeping, all on my arms and legs.  We were really excited about joining the airbnb community and this has left a terrible taste in our mouths.  We travel 5 or 6 times a year and I guess we will return to hotels."
12051674,89166228,2016-07-27,64842552,Matt,"This was a lovely stay.  Hosts were easily reached by text and answered any questions quickly, even later at night.  The view is incredible, and it's a pretty short walk to the nearest train station."
12051674,90739214,2016-08-02,79287311,Nicole,"Wonderful first trip to Boston and part was made by the attentiveness of Eddie and Alan. All questions and accommodations I had were taken care of right away. The home is located half a mile from the T train so getting into the city was easy. Everything about the apartment was just like in the pictures, except for the view, it only got better when you actually see it. If I ever travel back to Boston, I would definitely try to book this home again. Thank you for everything guys :)"

Cependant, nous trouvions que le logement aurait pu être plus propre et pour le prix, un peu mieux situé: aucun restaurant de qualité autour, pas de \"\"coffee shop\"\" digne de ce nom"
12051674,93022955,2016-08-11,68579894,Lauren,Alan's property was exactly as described. It was a quick walk to the T which made it centrally located to all that was offered in the area.

The apartment's a bit old to be sure, but I thought in a charming way. We made use of the fridge and microwave and had plenty of towels, so A+ on the ameneties."

708802,2598585,2012-10-13,3716339,Romain,"We stayed (4 persons) at Gerard's and Marie's for 3 days and had a great time there. Gerard and Marie were very kind and very helpful. They showed us where to park, told us about the best places to see and go around Boston and Charlestown, received us with local cakes and pastries for our first breakfast and so on: just perfect hosts! And I forgot the dvds of movies shot in the area! The place was just great: a really nice, clean and cozy apartment with a single room, kitchen, bathroom and living room (with a comfortable sofa bed). Even if we were 4, it fitted perfectly, very comfortable and restful place. I repeat myself: great place, just go there!"
708802,2621456,2012-10-15,1176862,Jana,We had a great time in Boston and this home was the key to our enjoyment of Historic Charlestown.  Marie and Gerald were very helpful in suggesting restaurants and sightseeing.  The morning of our departure they listed several awesome attractions that we absolutely loved as we toured Vermont.  Marie met us at the home and then showed us a parking area close to the house which is a rarity in Boston neighborhoods. The home is beautiful.  It's in a perfect historic setting.  Be prepared to walk most places you go which made this a great place to have as a home base as it is safe and located close to everything. The place is spacious and very comfortable. There was a washer and dryer for guest use. There are maps that were provided so it and the iPhone GPS made navigating Boston easy. We highly recommend this place and hope to stay here again when visiting Boston again.

The place is beautiful. It's in a gorgeous neighborhood that is really safe and conveniently located close to everything. The place is spacious and comfortable.

Now, I am a bit biased because my daughter lives up the block, but this apartment is very clean, comfortable and well-appointed with anything you might need for visit to Boston.  It's within walking distance to a variety of good food options, and just over the bridge from the North End.

We used the place as a launching pad for our foot tour of Boston.  It's located just 2 blocks from the Bunker Hill Monument (one of the last stops on the Freedom Trail).  After two days of absorbing Boston from a pedestrian viewpoint, this was the ideal place to retire for the evening.  Clean, spacious, and great hosts.  Highly Recommend!!!"
708802,4761681,2013-05-24,565212,Jerry,Gerard and Marie were lovely and accommodating.   We actually arrived a day late and we were exhausted and they were kind enough to let us park in front of the house (they moved their own vehicle) so that we would not have to look for a place to park and then walk back to the house.  It was so sweet of them to do that!

It wouldn't be a lie to say it was the best place we stayed at during our entire trip on America's east coast. It was close to everything, super comfortable and far better than a hotel room. Just to provide some perspective, we were traveling with my parents and my mum - a notoriously fussy individual - couldn't stop raving about this place. If we go back to Boston again, we'll definitely be booking with Gerard and Marie."

We truly hope to be able to stay there when we visit Boston again."

The apartment was just as before- clean, bright and relaxing.  This time (at Marie's suggestion) we took the ferry to Boston each day.  At only $3 per person each way it was an inexpensive yet beautiful way to reach the city.  The ferry stop was only about a 12 minute walk from the apartment through quaint Charlestown.  We also had dinner at Tangierino on Saturday night- what an experience!  Belly dancers and great food all within a short walk to the apartment!  If you're thinking about a trip to Boston, I highly recommend Gerard and Marie's apartment."

Everything was as close to perfect as possible: the apartment, the hosts, the area and even the weather.  It is located in a convenient, safe and historic neighborhood, which is easy to navigate and is close enough to the sites yet far enough away to make you feel like you are not in the city.  We enjoyed the well equipped kitchen that provided us with a respite after long days of sightseeing and eating out and the comfortable layout of the apartment which easily accommodated the three of us.

Marie's communication was timely and responsive while Gerard took time to explain all the details and nuances of the neighborhood and the city to make sure we made the most of our time in Boston. Though we shared the house with Gerard and Marie (the guests stay on the first floor while Gerard and Marie's family live on the second floor), we had the entire space to ourselves and the family were very respectful of our privacy. And the beautiful garden next to the living room and dining table really seals the deal. Above all, Gerard and Marie's place is truly a HOME away from home - highly recommended!"
708802,8147261,2013-10-18,2010232,Claudio,"They was very kind with us, nice apartment in a good position. Very welcome host. Thanks for this positive experience Marie and Gerard."
708802,8183531,2013-10-19,9444289,Karen,"Marie was an excellent and welcoming host, and the apartment was beautiful and very clean."
We were only there for one night,but having your own bedroom,bathroom,kitchen,living room and little patio would have made this a great place for a longer stay. So much better than staying in a hotel.,
"It was just a short walk from the apartment to the end of the Freedom Trail and our taxi to the airport was ~ $20. \"",,,,,
708802,8291456,2013-10-24,7544478,Levi,"What a fantastic first Airbnb experience! The apartment was easy to find and Marie personally welcomed us when we arrived. She had all sorts of information ready for us and answered any questions we had about getting around town. The apartment itself is in a beautiful, safe, quiet neighborhood within a mile or two from the north end and downtown (about a 25 minute walk). It's also only a few blocks from the Bunker Hill Monument, one of the coolest landmarks in Boston."
The apartment was also incredibly clean and well-decorated. Needless to say,we felt very well taken care of.,,,,
If you're on the fence at all about staying at this place,"just go for it. You won't be disappointed.\"",,,,
708802,8345694,2013-10-27,7500599,Karen,"This attractive apartment in Charlestown, Boston was perfectly located for 2 days exploring the City.  It is a short walk from the Bunker Hill Monument and a few minutes further on to the pick up for the tour bus routes, although this is not essential as much of the main parts are within walking distance."
Gerard met us on our first night to check everything was ok and was extremely nice giving us some excellent advice about what to see in Boston.  He recommended the commuter ferry which was well worth the $3 per head to travel to Downtown Boston where there was lots to see.  We would highly recommend Quincy food Market near Faneuil Hall but do be prepared to come out a few lbs heavier!,,,,,
"We had a lovely stay in a very comfortable apartment which was only 10 minutes taxi ride to the airport.  We would definitely look to stay here again if returning to Boston. \"",,,,,
708802,8413500,2013-10-29,4018323,John,Gerard was very helpful and personable.  Beautiful apartment in a great location!  Thanks.

Ample linens, very comfortable bed, storage space, lovely kitchen even if we only made coffee… The size made these new yorkers a little jealous ;) Gerard met us downstairs when we arrived, showed us the place, and we were set."
708802,9227928,2013-12-15,3780167,Jennifer,"We enjoyed staying in this wonderful, quiet and convenient apartment near the Bunker Hill monument and the Navy Yard. Since we needed to be close to MGH and the Spaulding Rehab Hospital, this Charlestown apartment was an excellent alternative to hotels in the area.  Marie was a wonderful host and took the time to introduce us to her neighborhood. This was a fabulous introduction to airbnb. We look forward to returning the next time we need a Boston home base"
708802,10175219,2014-02-04,10492443,Cheryl,"We were thrilled to find this gem of a place in Charlestown! Marie met us and gave us all the information we needed. The apartment was comfortably furnished, and even had a full size washer and dryer. We appreciated the convenient location-just 2 blocks from our daughter and son-in-law's condo. We will most definitely be taking advantage of this find next time we visit our grandson!"
708802,10218675,2014-02-07,11187347,Nancy,"Marie & Girard were very nice to deal with and very welcoming!  The apartment was clean, roomy, nicely decorated, had all needed linen, kitchen was fully supplied and even some food left in the refrigerator. It is located close to almost everything, with Bunker Hill a few blocks away, the Naval Yards and downtown Boston a short walk away and all of historic Charlestown right here.  We will certainly stay with Marie & Girard again on the next trip."

We were looking for a 'home away from home' for just a night, and found everything we needed here in Charlestown. The city is a short walk away, and there are loads of good places to eat within a few blocks. Gerard helped us with a great day tour of the city on the Freedom Trail, and there was plenty of additional tourist information available for reference. The place was immaculate, but of course cozy and inviting. We cooked a fantastic dinner in; there is absolutely everything you could ask for in a kitchen. Will definitely be staying there anytime we're in Boston!"
708802,10550097,2014-02-24,12142234,John,"Gerard and Marie have a wonderful little one bed apartment in a great location, Charlestown. Even with them out of town for part of our trip, the process of getting.into and out of the apartment was seamless. The apartment is convenient to all major sights in Boston, either via walking or the T."
For two former residents of Charlestown,"this apartment let us feel like we never moved away.\"",,,,
708802,10686534,2014-03-03,10036295,Soraya,My stay at Gerard and Marie's place was everything that was promised and everything I needed.  The place was comfy and inviting and Gerard and Marie were so understanding when a flight delay brought me in later than anticipated.  I will definitely return!
708802,11467402,2014-04-04,12271929,Renee,"We loved the location of this apartment and although we are not mass transit savvy, we were able to navigate our way around Boston and surrounding areas.  We were so appreciative of all of the amenities in the apartment and felt the size was great for the three of us.  Although Gerard and Marie were not there when we came in, they made arrangements with us so that we were able to check in when we arrived.  We would like to visit again and hope the apartment will be available when we do!"
708802,11788589,2014-04-15,10025390,Helen,"Thank you for a wonderful stay. We were travelling with our 13 month old son and Gerard and Marie's house was like a home from home for him. The hosts were very welcoming and provided us with great tips on things to do. The house is clean, beautifully decorated and the bed is very comfortable.  Great location too, friendly neighbourhood and shops, takeaway and restaurants nearby. It's also convenient to get into Boston. We chose an early morning stroll doing the freedom trail in reverse and got the T ferry back. Would definitely recommend."
708802,11938328,2014-04-19,1430378,Neil,"Staying here was the perfect way for us to feel right at home in Boston. We really enjoyed the accommodations and appreciated Marie's cheerful welcome and willingness to help us. The full kitchen and comfortable living room allowed us to relax in the mornings and evenings when we were here. The apartment is located in charming residential Charlestown. It was a very comfortable walk to the North End, but is also easily accessible by public transportation."
708802,12115356,2014-04-23,3932378,Serge,"It was our second visit to Marie's and Gerard's home in Charlestown, very satisfied with the Apt., quiet, and great location, 10min walk to the T, orange line."
708802,12234083,2014-04-27,11368167,Hanna,"Never stay in a hotel again!  Our experience in Charlestown with Marie and Gerard was a game changer for us.  We will forevermore seek out lodging through airbnb and try to avoid hotels altogether. The apartment was exactly as advertised and our hosts were helpful, friendly and gracious without being intrusive.  The neighborhood was beautiful and close to everything (that is if your not from Boston, as we found locals do not go anywhere further than ten minutes from home!).  We walked the Freedom Trail and used the T to get around town without a problem.  There's plenty to enjoy right in Charlestown too, including the Bunker Hill Monument, the USS Constitution Museum and great restaurants.  We used Uber to bring us to the apartment and grabbed a cab on Main St to get back.  We will definitely stay here on our next trip to Boston."
708802,12374182,2014-04-30,12837737,Fabrice,"le quartier est calme, les hôtes sont très accueillants et sympathiques, l'appartement est sympa et propre"
708802,12491562,2014-05-04,9441202,Natalie,"This was such a great little place. Comfortable digs, easy to get around town. Marie was super accomodating of our little last-minute stowaway (our 4 year old, who wasn't originally going to come with us), by offering up a twin-sized inflatable mattress in case we needed it, but didn't end up because the queen-sized pull out was big enough for our 3 boys. Just wonderful and would definitely recommend :)"
708802,13128321,2014-05-20,10824061,Ricky,"As a first time airbnb user I must say I was a little nervous about using the system.  Thanks to Marie and Gerard, the process couldn't have worked any better.  From the initial booking to checkout, our hosts were quick to respond with any questions or concerns we had.  I always felt safe and at ease in the neighborhood.   Your directions from the airport and the info in the welcome letter were very helpful.  What else can I say,  Gerard and Marie are just super nice people.  If I ever travel to Boston in the future,  I would definitely stay there again.  Thanks,  Rick"
708802,13270568,2014-05-24,12846172,Marti,Our hosts were very friendly and helpful.  They provided everything we needed and met with us when we arrived to help acclimate us to the area.  Gerard even suggested some things we might want to do and gave us good directions.
The apartment is cozy and the Charlestown neighborhood felt very safe.  We used public transportation and walked back often at night with no worries.  We would stay here again,"for sure!\"",,,,
708802,13561266,2014-05-31,661797,Tom,"Gerard and Marie's apartment is lovely - in a nice spot, not too far from the T, and very cosy.  There's a bit of light coming into the bedroom, but not anything that can't be handled.  They are great hosts, would happily stay again."
708802,13734607,2014-06-03,8791781,Estelle,"we spent an amazing journey in Boston. Mary was reallly nice with us. The appartment is lovely, practical and well located! All was perfect, great experience!"

708802,14075656,2014-06-11,12512401,James,Very tasteful and pleasant apartment in a nice part of town. Very welcoming and friendly hosts. The apartment was very well equipped and very clean. I would be happy to stay there again.
708802,14227439,2014-06-15,762629,Jeannine,"We very much enjoyed the hospitality and friendliness of our host's and their comfortable apartment. All correspondence was answered promptly and cheerfully. Gerard met us at the apartment to give us the keys and instructions with just the right amount of information and then let us go about our day. The apartment was very comfortable for a family of four, with working appliances including a washer and dryer. Amenities such as good coffee, tea, cream, and sugar were abundantly available. Extras such as the flower boxes outside the windows were appreciated."
708802,14339414,2014-06-17,11326425,Jefferson,"This place was better than I could have expected, even after reading a lot of the previous reviews. The neighborhood was fantastic and an easy walk to downtown Boston. We didn't spend much time in the apartment since we were out and about the majority of the time, but our time spent there it did feel like home. Gerard and Marie were extremely accommodating considering our flight arrived well before check in time and departed well after check out time. When we arrived at the place Gerard greeted us and gave a quick rundown on restaurants and activities to try around town. Follow their advice! We tried numerous things he suggested and were not disappointed; the highlights being eating a meal at the Warren Tavern in Charlestown and renting bikes to ride along the Charles River from downtown Boston to Harvard. The apartment is only a couple blocks from the Bunker Hill Monument and it was really cool to be staying in an area where there is so much history. Our intentions prior to arrival were to take public transportation everywhere, but we discovered Charlestown was only a 15 to 20 min walk to the North End in downtown Boston and ended up walking everywhere. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. It was a fantastic experience and if we ever find ourselves in Boston again this will be the top of our list for a place to stay!"
708802,15387453,2014-07-08,4180300,Susan,This was a wonderful place for our stay in Boston.  We loved the neighborhood and the instructions with where to do our grocery shopping was very helpful.  Thanks for the umbrellas in the closet since we got a wonderful summer thunderstorm while we were there.    The apartment was just as described and the owners were very accomodating and helpful.
708802,15569572,2014-07-12,11051769,Jared,"Host was very nice.  We saw them at the beginning of our stay and when we checked out.  The neighborhood was perfect, right in Charleston.  We were able to walk every where we wanted (we were fairly active and probably walked 15 miles over 4 days).  The apartment was clean and perfect for a couple.  When we stayed, it was very hot and the only air condition was in the bedroom, but we were out in the city during the day.  The kitchen had all needed furnishings.  Overall, a great experience and will look to go back next time I am in Boston."
708802,15668789,2014-07-14,1690589,Allison,We stayed at Gerard and Marie's apartment for 2 nights as we were in town for a wedding.  We had our 2 month old infant son with us.
The apartment is just as if not nicer than it looks in the photos,and Marie and Gerard couldn't be nicer (they live upstairs).  It was spacious,clean,and welcoming.  For a longer stay it would be very helpful to have the full fridge and washer/dryer.  The location is perfect for a visit to the Charlestown area,walkable to the Navy Yard and very close to cute restaurants and coffee shops.  Also less than a five minute walk to Whole Foods.  The area is very quiet and residential.,
Marie was also very accommodating as we arrived a little earlier than expected,"and it was helpful for us to check in early and feed the baby.  We will definitely recommend to our friends who live in the Charlestown area that they suggest this apartment for any friends or family visiting!\"",,,,
708802,16821806,2014-08-03,12637685,Fay,Gerard and Marie were great hosts who were easily contactable and friendly. The apartment is located in a beautiful part of town and has the convenience of getting to most places in Boston easily. The apartment itself was extremely clean and tidy and the both the sofa bed and double bed comfortable. The outside space was an extra bonus for the good summer evenings!

There were plenty of towels and the accommodations were new, comfortable, and very up to date. The kitchen was equipped with all the amenities to cook whatever you would like."
"The apartment is in a charming part of Charlestown right near the Bunker Hill Monument. Marie was very forthcoming with local information and made us feel like old friends or family. The unit is also a very manageable walk to downtown Boston. All in all we had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay here again on a return trip. Thanks Gerard and Marie.\"",,,,,

Marie and Gerard were great hosts and their apartment was awesome for the three us. While we didn't get to meet Marie in person, both she and Gerard were extremely responsive and helpful. Gerard checked us in and gave us great recommendations for our first time visit. We would stay with them again without hesitation if ever visiting Boston again. Thank you Marie and Gerard. Maybe we'll see you next year!"
708802,17563612,2014-08-14,10583785,Soo Hyun,the home was very lovely and well kept.

708802,17900225,2014-08-18,2026654,Veronica,"My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Marie and Gerard. They were very accommodating and even allowed us to drop off our luggage early before check-in time. Once we checked in, a few more of my relatives stopped by the condo to wait until their hotel was ready that afternoon. Marie and Gerard met my relatives and made them feel welcomed.  The condo was very clean and comfortable.  I would highly recommend this location for anyone visiting the area.  I would also love to come back again to get to see more of the city when I'd have more time.  this was a weekend family wedding trip, so I didn't have much time to see much of the city.  Marie and Gerard were really great hosts.  They thought of everything that we might possibly need. The neighborhood was really nice and easy to navigate around."

Mary m'a trouvé une place de parking et la voiture n'a pas bougé pendant 3 jours .En dehors des congés scolaires, je pense que ce doit être plus difficile. L'appartement est très confortable ,très bien équipé,  bien situé, quartier très calme et charmant à 15 minutes au plus des transports."
708802,18739699,2014-08-31,19459462,Heidi,We had a wonderful experience! Gerard and Marie were flexible with both check in and out times which we appreciated. Marie even helped me find free (and hassle-free) parking for the entire stay. Awesome!
The apartment was lovely. It had everything we needed. My daughter usually dreads sleeping on pull out couches. She declared this one to be the most comfortable one ever.,,,,,

The apartment was bright spacious and very comfortable . The kitchen and laundry facilities were excellent. The apartment is in a quiet neighbourhood but is conveniently located within a 10 min walk to the T line, Bus and water taxi for quick travel into Boston . The Wholefood market is nearby for great  easy meals options. Gerard could not have been more helpful with advice about everything from baseball games to driving out of Boston . Gerard also drove us into the city to so we could pick up our hire car , despite having a busy schedule of his own ."

The apartment is on a very quiet street,and two mins walk to main bus route to city. We also walked to City,yo do the tourist walk.,,,

The bedroom, bathroom, and living area are all updated and comfortable.  Due to plans we had on our check-in day, we requested to check-in early and Gerard was able to accommodate us."

708802,20409799,2014-09-29,5161401,Ashton,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Charlestown this past weekend. Gerard and Marie's home is welcoming and spacious; absolutely perfect for the four of us during our trip. I especially enjoyed the architectural details of the home. In addition to providing coffee, juice and creamer, Marie gave us very helpful advice on parking and attractions upon arrival. We found everything we needed just steps away: grocery store, the Freedom Trail, subway, etc. Wish we could've stayed longer and hope to return again someday!"
708802,20687266,2014-10-04,7773157,John,"Shelly and I had a great visit in Boston and this lovely apartment provided a perfect base for all our outings.  Marie met us upon arrival and provided us with great neighborhood info.  Short and beautiful walks to the 'T' (subway), Whole Foods, and a variety of restaurants. We will definitely try and book the apartment again on our next trip to Boston."
708802,20943705,2014-10-08,13915928,Rob,"Charlestown is a great starting point for anyone wanting to do the Freedom Trail as this accommodation is just a few minutes walk from the Bunker Hill Monument. Public transport by bus was less than 5 minutes away, and by train/metro into Boston less than 10 minutes away - making it an ideal location."
The apartment was very neat and clean and really wanted for nothing from an amenity perspective. While the kitchen is not modern,it was completely functional so you won't be let down by what the apartment offers.,,,,
Our bedroom was huge and the bed exceptionally comfortable so when we did manage to get to sleep,we slept well. The only downside to our stay was that the bed literally backed onto the wall which was immediately adjacent the footpath,so we heard every conversation from passers by. Light sleepers might want to bring ear plugs.,,,
Apart from that,the kitchen and laundry were big plusses for us and for the time we were there it felt homely.,,,,
"Gerard and Marie are lovely hosts and always gave us guidance and suggestions when we were unsure of anything.\"",,,,,
708802,21040423,2014-10-10,21109013,Nancy,Gerard met us when we arrived at 9 pm and oriented us to the apartment and the area. He also gave is suggestions on where to eat and how far the Freedom Trail was (only a few blocks). The apt was perfect and spacious. Parking was VERY difficult. And the room was a bit noisy because the hosts live above the Apt ( with 2 teens).
708802,21195059,2014-10-13,12380510,Judith,"We had 2 nights in the apartment recently. It was lovely. Verycomfortable, nice decor, comfortable beds and a great washing machine too, which we appreciated after travelling for 4 weeks. The location is great. Close to the train, shops and also the freedom trail which makes for an interesting walk into town. Gerard gave us information about the area and also things to do whilst we were there. He alsoshowed us where to park the car as parking is a big problem in the area.we were there on a weekend so it was ok."
"Overall we would highly recommend this property to both couples and families. We were with our 2 teenager children and there was enough space. Thank you!\"",,,,,

Marie was very helpful when we arrived and was nearby during our stay if we needed help. Location is good with a mall in 5 minutes walk with a whole foods store.  Recommend if anyone stays in this apartment to bring an eye mask because the street lights get through the blinds."
708802,22058727,2014-10-29,17028648,Heather,"This was a fabulous apartment.  Spacious and exactly as shown in the photos.

There is also a comments book where guests can leave comments in and we found this very helpful.  Definitely recommend this place."

Private accommodation over the whole first floor. Great bed, TV, Internet and well appointed kitchen with washer / dryer. Hosts were lovely.  Whole Foods a short walk down the hill a bonus."
708802,22290861,2014-11-03,18132155,Elizabeth,"Marie and Gerard provided a perfect Charlestown experience for us.  The apartment was scrupulously clean and had everything that we could have needed and more.  We were visiting our children for a family occasion and could come and go as we needed.  Marie provided wonderful guidance in writing on some places to eat, where to find groceries, etc.  Since we spend a lot of time in Charlestown, we knew that her recommendations were spot on.  We were there on Halloween - there is a wonderful Bunker Hill Halloween outdoor party that is family friendly, great fun and safe.  This part of Charlestown is wonderful and we felt perfectly comfortable walking through the neighborhood at night.  All and all, this was a wonderful experience.  It was our first airbnb adventure and because of it, we will be sure to try airbnb again.  In fact, we will look to Marie and Gerard if they are available for staying for future family gatherings!  It was wonderful!"
708802,22524951,2014-11-09,11999764,Laura,"We really had a great time in Gerard and Marie's apartment. The neighborhood is lovely and we enjoyed their restaurant tips, especially the old tavern. Boston is an interesting town to visit and well connected to other places of interest. But, most importantly, Gerard and Marie were friendly and helpful hosts and the apartment nice, cozy, clean, with everything we needed. Definitely recommended."
708802,22662001,2014-11-11,1820461,Dani,"Felt very at home in this quaint space. Clean, a little noisy with the neighbor's foot steps but as expected in closely built homes. Although an overall very quiet and cozy area! More than enough space for my guest and I. The best neighborhood we could have asked for considering it was our first time to Boston! The home came with all the amenities listed and Gerard and Marie were just a call away if needed. They even let us check in early and leave later - SO grateful!"
708802,22896058,2014-11-17,4659621,Ann,Great location.  Comfortable and very rasonably priced.  Boston can be very expensive.

The apartment is fully equipped with washer/dryer, TV, internet worked perfectly!  Overall, our stay was wonderful and Marie  & Gerard were lovely hosts.  One thing that should be noted,  that this apartment is ground level of a residence which was not a problem for us but something to be aware of.  Thank you again Marie &Gerard!"
708802,25197675,2015-01-09,1635011,Amy,What an utterly fabulous experience! Cannot recommend this beautiful apartment enough.
Gerard and Marie are fantastic hosts and were extremely helpful and accommodating to our needs. They clearly take a real pride in being Airbnb hosts,there are lots of helpful things in the apartment for visitors,and all their suggestions were spot on.,,,
The location is on a beautiful street within easy walking distance of the main bit of Boston. It's also right by the freedom trail,which is very handy.,,,,

Marie meet me when I arrived and showed me around the apartment. With traveling alone and knowing a huge snow storm was coming, it was comforting to know Gerard and Marie were around if I needed anything. They were both very friendly and helpful...checking in with me mid week and then allowing me to stay as long as I like on my last day. All in all, the apartment was clean and cozy and the hosts were terrific."

708802,28989335,2015-04-02,27387776,Sarah,We had the most amazing experience at Gerard and Marie's. The neighborhood was beautiful and the house even more so. We felt right at home in this little apartment. It was great to be able relax on the couch and watch tv rather than lay in a hotel bed and feel lazy.
Everything was very clean and up to date. There was a lot of light throughout the house and plenty of windows. It felt like there were more accommodations than a hotel.,,,,,
"Marie was so sweet and even worked with us to get us checked-in early since we had just arrived on a red eye. She left us all the information we needed and offered some great suggestions for the area. We cannot wait to stay here again. It was truly ideal for our Boston trip.\"",,,,,
708802,29454188,2015-04-07,28677866,Karol,L'emplacement est parfait pour une visite à pied de Boston ! L'appartement est telle que décrit et plus que confortable. Merci à Marie pour les judiscieux  conseilles qui on fait de notre de notre voyage un weekend inoubliable. À la prochaine Marie & Gerard.
708802,29667794,2015-04-11,27667638,Rebecca,"Photos are exactly accurate.  A very nice lower level apartment (host lives in upstairs apt.) in an old charming house.  Host set things up so clearly that we never even needed to contact her while we were there. But she graciously checked in via email to be sure all was well. They left a very helpful info sheet about the apartment, places to eat and transportation info."
We were 4 adults and the place sleeps 4 with a normal queen bed and queen sized couch pull out.,,,,,
Other extra stuff: Nice hot powerful shower!  Good heat for an old house that you can control (it was cold & rainy while we were in Boston,so this was key). Very clean. Soft sheets. Coffee,condiments & equipped kitchen available. A nice rack of tourist maps & info in the kitchen.  No need for a car; train and water taxi are 15 min. walk from apt. (Water taxi to downtown only $3.50,runs frequently,took about 15 min. and fun for us out-of-towners.),
Go to Warren Tavern if you're looking for a nice,quaint,close neighborhood bar.,,,
"All four of us gave it a thumbs up and would definitely stay here again. \"",,,,,
708802,29911668,2015-04-14,27016068,Keith,"Apartment is exactly as shown in the listing photos and was very comfortable. This is a ground floor apartment and the friendly hosts live upstairs. Marie met us when we arrived, but everything in the apartment was so well set up that we had no need to reach out to our hosts again."
Apartment is light and airy with nice high ceilings. The bedroom is quite roomy and the bed was comfortable. I can't speak to comfort of the fold-out couch,but our kids who slept on it didn't complain. Coffee (and coffeemaker) was provided and the in-apartment washer/dryer (with detergent provided) was very handy.,,,,
"The neighborhood was great! Don't worry about the reputation of Charlestown as a \"\"rough\"\" neighborhood -- watch Ben Affleck's movie \"\"The Town\"\" (a DVD of which was provided in the apartment) to see what I'm referring to. Our experience was that the neighborhood is quite gentrified. We never felt unsafe walking around",and the folks we encountered on the streets were all quite friendly.,,,,
"It's easy to get around via the \"\"T\"\" (light rail/subway) with a stop about a ten-minute walk away or the bus with a stop just a block or two from the front door. There's even a water taxi that will take you from the downtown Boston waterfront directly to Charlestown (near the U.S.S. Constitution). We didn't have a car",but it appeared that finding nearby parking could be a bit of a pain. I would suggest skipping the car if you're just in town as a tourist.,,,,
The Bunker Hill Monument which is the northern terminus of the Freedom Trail was just two blocks away. Climb to the top (294 steps) for a bit of a workout and some great views of Boston and the surrounding area. Whole Foods is nearby and on the way from the T stop. The Warren Tavern (oldest in the state?) was a nice,nearby spot for a tasty dinner -- it was crowded (and loud) on a Friday night,but how often do you get a chance to eat/drink in the same spot that George Washington and Paul Revere did?,,,
"Great place to stay to explore a really fun city. We'll keep this place bookmarked if we have reason to return to Boston.\"",,,,,
708802,30127447,2015-04-18,27131673,Angelic,"Downstairs apparment is nicely decorated and cozy.

708802,30489685,2015-04-23,3447115,Daniel & Jordan,"We were in town for the Boston marathon and stayed at Gerard and Marie's place. They made key exchange very easy and made us feel welcome. The space itself was very comfortable and quiet. We appreciated that they offered a few suggestions of nearby places to eat. It was close to transit to get into Boston, but just far enough away that we could escape the crowds and the hustle-bustle. We would stay here again if we are back in town."
708802,31168373,2015-05-03,4778017,Anne,This was a lovely apartment.  Gerard and Marie live upstairs.  The apartment is on the first floor.  There was a bus line around the block that takes you to downtown Boston in minutes.  My husband went to the convention center each day by the Orange line.  The neighborhood has a number of tasty restaurants and a Whole Foods.   We will stay there again if we are ever in Boston.
708802,32045697,2015-05-13,24839628,Debbie,We recently spent 5 nights in Gerard and Marie's lovely apartment in Boston.  Gerard and Marie greeted us the evening we arrived with lots of great advice about things to do and see while we were in Boston.  The apartment is exactly as described on the web page and in fact Gerard and Marie have thought of all the little details that made the apartment seem like a home away from home.  We were very grateful for a washing machine and clothes dryer. Charlestown  is a lovely quaint and quiet suburb and Boston and it's outlying areas are easily accessible by the T (transit system) which is only a few streets from the apartment.
708802,32244938,2015-05-16,2220345,Steven,"This was a fantastic place for my sister and her family to use as a base when they visited Boston after2 weeks touring the states. The chance to do washing, and relax before exploring the area. They did not have a car so this was an ideal location."

it was roomy and comfortable,too. looks just like the pictures.,,,,
check in was easy. Gerrard spent time with us pointing out places to see. Marie stopped by after work to make sure everything was okay.,,,,,
the washer dryer was great. my daughter used it,as we had spent 5 days in NYC prior to our Charlestown visit.,,,,
the sofa bed was comfortable. did have trouble finding a place to put the coffee table,when the bed was pulled out.,,,,
the neighborhood is great and within walking distance of Bunker Hill and the Freedom Trail.,,,,,
A shopping mall and restaurants are within walking distance,too.,,,,
We made a loop to go to Boston. We went to the wharf and viewed the USS Constitution,then took the ferry to Long Wharf. From there we started the freedom trail. It is an amazing walk. Wear sturdy,comfortable shoes,as most of the walk is bricks,which some were missing and uneven. It's easy to miss Paul Revere's house....and Faneuil Hall is a must see.,
we walked back to the apartment.,,,,,
We used UBER the next day to take us to Lexington. We did their trolley tour of Lexington/Concord. I highly recommend this tour. Wish we could have spent more time here. The battle trail would have been interesting to do.,,,,,
Our experience with UBER was great. We used them for getting to the airport,as well as getting back and forth from Lexington. they were 5 minutes away,all times,were polite. If you use them,look at reviews,because people list coupon codes
wow-guess I got carried away.,,,,,

LOVED visiting Charlestown and this apartment was perfect for our stay.  The place is adorable and roomy. Both the bed and hide-a-bed were comfortable. Also,  has a cute patio out back with flowers.  Owners live above so that was comforting if we had any issues (but we didn't)."

We were provided with a maps and information on the local area and directions which helped us to settle in and find our way around. Marie was always available and very helpful when we had any questions.,,,,,

The location is great - full of history,"but also relatively central with an easy 30 minute walk across the bridge and into central Boston.

The apples, coffee, and milk were wonderful welcoming touches. The Charlestown area is a wonderful, quiet, and cozy place to stay but so close to everything a tourist wants to see and do. We found the T easy to navigate and uber was plentiful and inexpensive. We will stay with Gerard and Marie next time and we have already recommended their place to family and friends."
708802,53174608,2015-11-06,10751360,Renee,"The hosts were very communicative without being intrusive, and the place was beautiful, clean, perfect! It's in a delightful neighborhood within walking distance to many places. Very highly recommended."
708802,54313514,2015-11-18,43902145,Kevin,"My partner and I used this service for our recent visit to Boston from Canada, with her father joining us for some of the days as well. It was my first AirBNB experience, so I was a little nervous, but it ended up being a wholly positive experience."
Marie and Gerard were very quick to answer enquiries after we made the booking.  Once we were there,they were very accommodating,including when due to airport logistics we arrived for check-in hours later than we claimed we would be.,,,
The apartment itself is clean and well-maintained. The pictures fail to highlight the high ceilings and beautiful hardwood floors. There are enough dishes,pans,appliances,etc. in the kitchen to prepare your own meals there if you wish,and the personal washer/dryer was a nice bonus. It was late November,so it was too cold to use the patio area
The provided sheets and blankets were nice and soft. Beds are on the firm side,so it wasn't the most comfortable for us as we like things a little softer,but that is down to personal preference. We also got a good night's sleep on them all week regardless of this fact.,,,
As the listing and many reviews already confirm,this location is a friendly,beautiful neighbourhood that is accessible to areas of downtown Boston in little time,even if you are using public transit. If you want to be extremely close to downtown Boston but want to come back to a quiet,relaxing neighbourhood,this is pretty much the ideal spot. It's also very close to one end of the Freedom Trail for tourists.  Also nearby are several great restaurants (great meals were had at Warren's Tavern and Figs)
We had a great time being tourists in Boston,"and part of it was due to this wonderful little place to come back to every night. I would recommend this apartment to others and depending on the circumstances could see myself staying here again in the future.\"",,,,
708802,54851173,2015-11-25,1213826,Michelle,The apartment was exactly as described. It was in walking distance to downtown and fabulous Boston attractions. The cafe nearby had great iced lattes and breakfast.

708802,57008367,2015-12-21,30214828,Laura,"Terrific stay!  A well appointed, spacious apartment that is exactly as described.   An ideal location in which to see all of the Boston sites on foot and/or via the train.   Grocery and other stores are within walking distance, as are a variety of pubs and restaurants.  Would highly recommend a morning trip to the Grasshopper Cafe which is literally right around the corner.  Additionally, the hosts are fully available without being intrusive.  This flat is totally worth consideration!!"
708802,58098652,2015-12-31,1749532,Peggy,"This was our third time staying in the apartment, and as always, Gerard and Marie were fantastic hosts.  I can't say enough about the apartment-excellent location, completely comfortable...absolutely the best. We never stay anywhere else when visiting Boston."
708802,58864408,2016-01-05,4655291,Marisa,"Gerard And Marie's place was perfect for our stay in Boston.  They were easy to communicate with and made us feel very welcome.  The apartment was sweet, very clean, warm and private, with everything you could need for a couple days or more.  The location was really fantastic.  You can see the Bunker Hill monument from the bedroom window, which is the end of the Freedom trail.  From there you can easily walk yourself into downtown.  We 100% recommend this great spot and plan to stay there again the next time we visit!"
708802,64167430,2016-02-29,46976552,Dana,What a warm welcome to Charlestown and Massachusetts!

The apartment was private and ideally located with easy access to transport and a supermarket. Having the ability to do our washing was fantastic along with the well equipped kitchen so that we could easily cook our own meals. We would definitely recommend this apartment.

708802,69845201,2016-04-14,60661456,Eric,"My boys and I had a great stay at Gerard & Marie's place. The place was close enough to get to anywhere we needed to go, and just far enough out of the city to feel safe and peaceful. Definitely recommended!"
708802,70708015,2016-04-19,32010290,Megan,The apartment was great and was located close to everything in Charlestown.  It was also only a 10 minute walk to the T which was awesome since we were there for the Boston Marathon.  Gerard was a great host and suggested restaurants and activities in the area.  He also allowed for a later check out.
708802,71055207,2016-04-23,41205029,Talei,We had a fabulous stay in Marie and Gerard's Charlestown  apartment. Marie greeted us on arrival and was super friendly and helpful.
The apartment was the perfect base for us as it allowed us to easily walk all around Boston (with an 11 year old) which was really nice. It was convenient to everything we wanted to see and do and the surrounding neighbourhood is picturesque and lovely.,,,,,
The space was more than ample for 3 people and having a washer/dryer,"great cooking facilities and Netflix etc made our stay very comfortable. We would definitely stay there again if in Boston in the future :)\"",,,,
708802,71879453,2016-04-29,24842832,Robyn,"\"Marie & Gerard's apartment is simply perfect if visitors who want to experience genuine Boston hospitality. We so enjoyed our stay & felt extremely comfortable in their beautiful apartment. It's location in Charlestown is superb. It is walking distance to the commencement of the Freedom Trail & handy to both public transport & shops. I work in the hospitality industry & wish I could bottle Marie & Gerard's \"\"mine host\"\" attitude. I have no hesitation in recommending this wonderful apartment & its owners. Thank you\""
708802,72115217,2016-05-01,44210332,Nick,"Marie was home when we arrived, she was so nice and welcoming.  She showed us around the apartment and how things worked, a really great place they have!   We look forward to returning to Boston in the future and will be sure to try and rent from them again.  Thank you!"
708802,73725606,2016-05-09,42241801,Beth,Marie was a wonderful host. She met us and showed us around the apartment and gave us some suggestions on what to see in the area. The space was clean and well equipped for our family of 3. The space is located in a beautiful safe neighborhood close to all the sights of Boston.
708802,74173915,2016-05-13,33166701,Rebecca,Gerald and Marie's place is very spacious and is convenient to everything. My parents came to visit me from China and I really want to make sure that they could stay in a cozy place after a 13-hr flight. And they felt at home. Thanks to Gerald and Marie!
708802,74963573,2016-05-17,54548279,Jeanne,Our stay and Marie and Gerards home was perfect.  The accommodations were spacious and inviting with lots of charm.  We enjoyed having a kitchen and laundry facilities.  The little back patio was a perfect place to relax with a book and cup of coffee.  This was our first time staying in Charlestown and we loved the area.  Bus stop only a block away and the T a short walk.  We enjoyed meeting Marie and she made us feel at home.  Thank you!
708802,75611780,2016-05-22,29188413,Kristin,Lovely apartment. Marie made us feel instantly welcome and was extremely helpful. Top notch hosts! Thank you...we had a wonderful time :)
708802,76247088,2016-05-25,58252911,Stephanie,"What a wonderful experience this was! We had great communication with our hosts and they made us feel very welcome. The neighbourhood is beautiful and felt very safe and friendly.  This is a ground-floor unit and beautifully maintained.  Our hosts left very thoughtful information about the area, how to contact them, and amenities in the unit.  It is a one bedroom unit with a hide-a-bed couch in the living room.  We found it a wonderful space to relax at the end of the day after exploring Boston.  We felt very welcome and would absolutely return."
708802,77752613,2016-06-03,2752809,Kerri,"My family of four stayed in Gerard and Marie's place for five nights. It was a very clean and comfortable apartment. There was plenty of room for the four of us with my husband and I sleeping in the bedroom, one of our teenaged children sleeping on the pullout couch and the other sleeping on the blowup mattress. Gerard and Marie were easy to contact, and although they live right upstairs, we never heard them. It was very private. There's even a small private patio in the back. We enjoyed the peace and quiet of staying in Charlestown (as opposed to Boston proper); however, be aware that you do have to walk a bit to get to restaurants and the subway. Our favorite restaurant in Charlestown was Figs - about a 10 minute walk from the apartment - which has amazing pizza."
708802,78417167,2016-06-06,26118214,Louise,Marie and Gerards flat is perfect for a holiday in Boston. We only met Marie and she was really friendly and helpful. She recomended a few places in the local area that we should check out.
Location the flat is 10 -15 minutes to the T and about 5- 10 minutes to wholefoods. Its also a nice walk over the bridge into the centre of Boston. Its also located as a great starting point for the freedom trail. Great location!,,,,,
The flat has a fully equipped kitchen,great sized bathroom and a really comfy bed. The living room is great and the tv with netflix and dvds is an added bonus. Something we enjoyed due to heavy rain on one of our nights.,,,,
"Lovely apartement and would highly recomend.\"",,,,,
708802,79004607,2016-06-10,55899223,Julie,This is a lovely apartment in Charlestown and is exactly as it was described.
We didn't see the owners until the day we left but if we had needed to speak to them about something they were only upstairs.,,,,,
"The neighbourhood is delightful and there is a very good supermarket close b...Wholefoods market\"",,,,,
708802,81749047,2016-06-24,31316654,Rebecca,Thank you for welcoming us and all the help shuffling our car rental. Loved our stay.
708802,82695210,2016-06-28,47217118,Anne,"Gerard and Marie's apartment is in a wonderful location for exploring Boston.  It is on a quiet street, but easily accessible to restaurants, shopping, and the T/bus to downtown Boston.  They left a very helpful laminated sheet of information that we carried around with us as we explored the city.  The apartment is comfortably furnished.  The apartment is on the ground floor of a Charlestown house, with the owners living upstairs, but it is very private."
708802,83877413,2016-07-04,64541005,Dawn,"This was a great place!  It was perfect for my family.  The highlights were the patio and early walks to Bunker Hill. Gérard and Marie provide everything to make it comfortable.  If you need anything,  shopping is a close walk. We fell in love with Charlestown.  There are great sites right by Gérard and Marie's place and Boston is easily accessible."
708802,84731258,2016-07-08,5781002,Carole,"Lovely apartment, in a very pleasant, quiet location. Would recommend. Everything we required for our four night stay in Boston."
708802,87582957,2016-07-20,28462528,Sara,"Our family of four stayed in Gerard and Marie's lovely Charlestown apartment for three nights. Gerard greeted us in person when we arrived and gave us many useful tips and recommendations. The neighborhood is absolutely beautiful, and in a perfect location to explore Boston. The apartment was a great place to kick back and relax after a long day of sightseeing. Both Gerard and Marie were very friendly and hospitable. I would recommend their place to anyone visiting Boston."
708802,87950123,2016-07-22,2016493,Yvonne,The apartment is in a great location and Gerard and Marie were most welcoming.  The apartment was perfect and Marie was most accommodating when our arrival time was delayed and we did not get there until after 10pm.  I would definitely recommend the apartment to anyone wanting to spend some time in Boston.
708802,89286257,2016-07-27,11656491,Eric,"\"Cet appartement malgré une situation un peu éloignée de Boston centre est très agréable (il faut compter une demi heure de marche pour rallier le centre en suivant la \"\"red line\"\" du Freedom trail) . L'appartement est très bien équipé et Marie est à l'écoute en cas de souci. Le quartier est très calme et assez joli. Un supermarché est à moins de 10mn à pied."
Nous étions ravi de rentrer le soir après nos visites dans cette ville chargée d'histoire.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
708802,89977376,2016-07-30,53449016,Thomas,"The apartment is located in a quiet, residential area close to Boston. Marie was waiting for us although we arrived late in the evening and she was very friendly and helpful. The apartment has enough space and we found everything we needed. There is even a little backyard to sit outside. Nearby there are shops and the Bunker Hill Monument where the freedom trail starts. So you can start your Boston exploration by foot. Public transport is nearby as well as the Ferry to Boston downtown. Altogether it is a perfect location to explore Boston or to stop over after arrival from Europe, as we did. We can recommend this place without doubt."
"Thomas\"",,,,,
708802,91029553,2016-08-03,3309783,Sandra,Gerard welcomed us and was very nice and explained us a lot about Boston and what to do.

708802,94433901,2016-08-15,56797433,Aafke,"De verhuurder was er op het moment van aankomst. Verder geen bijzondere dingen om ons welkom te heten. De verhuurster was erg vriendelijk .  Omdat de verhuurders gedurende het gehele weekend weg waren, hebben we hen niet of nauwelijks gesproken . De ruimtes waren prima, de meubels in de woonkamer wel wat  oud en de bank erg doorgezakt. Bedden prima en door airco heerlijk koel. De overige ruimtes waren erg warm"
708802,95160549,2016-08-18,58971935,Andy,Lovely place convenient to all things Boston especially the Freedom Trail. The tranquility of Charleston is a welcome break to Washington and New York visits.
708802,96646189,2016-08-23,5545489,Steve,"This is a nice apartment in a very historic and beautiful neighborhood. It is very to close to the rest of Boston, but has its own character. We walked every evening and enjoyed the historic feeling of this special part of the city.  Gerald and Marie were great hosts, communicated well, and provided everything we needed for a short stay. A great place to stay in Boston!"
708802,98216290,2016-08-29,65152109,Emily,We stayed for 5 nights in Marie and Gerard's apartment. We had an all around great experience in Charlestown and Boston. The neighborhood is very beautiful and friendly. We found public transportation to be pretty accessible from the apartment-the bus stop is just around the corner and the train station less than 10 minutes walking distance. Lots of restaurants and a Whole Foods close. We felt the apartment was clean upon arrival and was well equipped. We loved that we had a washer and dryer! It was so nice to wash our clothes on our last night and be able to bring home already clean clothes. We would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone considering it!
5153080,26346183,2015-02-09,1911807,Chris,"Danielle was an excellent host: good, clear communication throughout, very fun and easy to be around the apartment with.  The apartment itself is larger then we were expecting and very comfortable.  Location is really good for all the restaurants and activities in the very trendy South End and transportation (Uber, Taxi, Bus) are very quick to city center.  The back of the apartment opens into a wonderful, large and wooded 'private park' shared by the surrounding houses - really wonderful especially in a city neighborhood like this."
"Lastly Danielle's collection of board games and movies is fun and another unexpected bonus!\"",,,,,
5153080,27973336,2015-03-15,29031838,Harman,Danielle was an amazing host! She is extremely kind and very accommodating. She was really prepared for my arrival and made sure my stay in Boston was as comfortable as possible. Her apartment is beautiful and well furnished (and she already has plans in motion to make it even better)!
"Danielle has an impressive movie collection and is a \"\"German-style\"\" board game expert. She's very involved in the community and an interesting person to talk to and get to know!",,,,,
The apartment is also in prime location. I was attending a conference at the Hynes convention center,which was an easy and convenient walk away. I also had plans to explore the bar scene throughout the city and had no problem with the apartment being in a bustling area of town.,,,,
Without a doubt,if you stay here with Danielle,you'll have a great experience!,,,

Beautiful part of the city in South Boston and great location for exploring other parts of the city (40 minute walk to Quincy Market and 30 minute walk to Fenway). The apartment and room were just what we were expecting - clean, comfortable, and very welcoming. Danielle was an awesome host - full of stories about the city and suggestions of where to go (also a great tour guide!). Would highly recommend it!"

5153080,34653364,2015-06-10,32945248,Rizwan,"Danielle is a great host. She was very helpful from the beginning and had great communication throughout the process. I was in town for a conference at the Hynes convention center and this place was ideal for me. It is a short walk from the convention center and from shopping, bars and restaurants on Boylston St."
My stay was really comfortable. Danielle has a beautiful house and she made sure I had everything that I needed. The room was clean and there was a goodie bag ready for me with toiletries and essentials. There were clean linens and towels in the room. Too bad I was out at the conference for the entire day and didn't get to enjoy the large collection of movies that Danielle has in the living room. The private garden is a great plus!,,,,,
"Overall I had a comfortable stay. I had everything i needed and was within walking distance from the convention center and all the fun parts of town. The T was also within walking distance. Danielle was in contact with me throughout the stay and it made the whole process very easy and stress free. I will definitely like to stay here the next time I'm in town.\"",,,,,

5153080,38057207,2015-07-12,2788894,Stu,"Spent three great days in Boston, looking at colleges and visiting this vibrant city. Danielle's apartment really helped make this trip so enjoyable - apartment is exactly as shown in pictures (deceptive hallway but opens up into beautiful downstairs lounge, dining area and kitchen), and Danielle could not have been more accommodating, with numerous suggestions and insightful comments to getting the most out of Boston. Location was excellent for access to either walking downtown, visiting Fenway or grabbing the T."
Fully recommend both host and apartment!,,,,,

5153080,45790759,2015-09-06,5272812,Daniel,What an awesome place! You can't get anymore of a truly Boston experience unless you stayed in the Commons.
First off: the apartment.,,,,,
You go inside a street level brownstone to find s cozy,comfortable bedroom with linens if you need. A very clean and tidy bathroom with a great shower that was perfect after long days of walking.,,,,
Then you go down an iron spiral staircase to a living room that shows the history and character of the brownstone with exposed brick on most of the walls throughout even in the nice galley kitchen.,,,,,
After a tour through the living room you step outside to the back yard. A beautiful open space that is hemmed in by the block of brownstones. Though shared by neighbors it is a park in and of itself complete with little garden paths,plenty of individual seating areas,large shade trees and ivy covered brick walls. The evenings are perfect for have a rest. You can sit Danielle's nice patio or wander into the grass,no matter what it is entirely quiet at any moment of the day.,,
Secondly: location.,,,,,
Seriously! Don't stay anywhere else. By foot you are 20 minutes from Fenway park,"10 minutes from the \"\"T\"\" which will get you anywhere",and 20 minutes from The Common and the start of the Freedom Trail... And that's by foot people! By foot. If you take a cab or a bus (download the app for that,it's very comprehensive) and get anywhere in a matter of minutes.,,
Then again,you may not want to go anywhere. The neighborhood is picturesque and relatively quiet with so many amazing restaurants to eat at,indoor or out.  I definitely recommend that you have some food on a red-brick patio while taking in the scene of neighborhood that is full of history.,,,
Finally: your host,Danielle.,,,,
What an awesome person! From the start she was sociable and inviting,welcoming us in to give us the dime tour and answering whatever questions we had,even giving a guy some insight on board game styles,of which she has a nice collection of sitting still is your mode.,,
Apart from being sociable,she knows what it's like to be traveler. After taking the red eye from Portland Or,she understands what it's like to need rest and privacy and gives you your space where you need it. She does have a life of her too!,,,
Her personality definitely comes out in her how her home feel; colorful and inviting.,,,,,

Danielle did everything she could to make me feel welcome and comfortable!  I would recommend anyone stay in her home; I will certainly look it up again!"

5153080,48562106,2015-09-27,10458614,Krista,"I had a wonderful weekend in Boston in large part due to Danielle's hospitality. Her condo is beautiful, immaculate and she offered all of the amenities to make it a very comfortable stay. Her condo is two doors down from the local Starbucks and in the heart of the South End. I had an easy 4-5 block walk to Copley Plaza and could find my way very easily without getting lost or feeling unsafe. I would definitely reach out to Danielle about accommodation upon my next trip to Boston. I highly recommend her as an Air BNB host and the photos and write up about her BNB are very accurate."
5153080,49911538,2015-10-07,23243431,Lisa,Very thoughtful host. Went above and beyond to make me comfortable. Apartment is in an ideal location in a lovely neighborhood. Bed and shared living spaces are comfortable. Would recommend.
5153080,50375919,2015-10-11,44696026,Nuree,"Danielle is extremely attentive to detail. From the notes and texts from a few days before checking into her place to the welcome basket and amentities she provided, she has hosting down to a T. She and I messaged intermttenly during the week of my travel, providing instructions on getting in and checking in to make sure we got in without any issues. My friend and I walked into our bedroom for the night and felt so welcomed; she had left a welcome basket for us with a number of things - ear plugs, shampoo/conditioner, soap, eye masks, transportation directions, maps, and even mini tabasco sauce! She also provided a guidebook and city walk guide cards, which were really helpful even for someone who isn't new to Boston."
As someone who is detail-oriented,her attention to cleanliness was great too,as well as how well decorated and homey her place was. My friend and I felt right at home,and after a long day of travel and walking around Boston,we collapsed into what I assume is a memory foam bed. Super comfortable!,
Check out was easy,especially with her checkout list - I'm telling you,she's super organized! And again,Danielle's attentiveness was appreciated.,,
The neighborhood is up and coming and super walkable. There's a really adorable gifts store right next door (literally) and the staff there know Danielle,"which gives you a sense of the neighborhood. Everything about my stay at Danielle's was great and I look forward to booking with her again the next time I'm in Boston. \"",,,,
5153080,51208829,2015-10-18,45915497,Dirk,"Danielle was extremely friendly, courteous and helpful with explanations of Boston, the nearest restaurants, the highlights etc .. We would not hesitate to stay again at Danielle and thank her for her support of the fantastic days in Boston. Thank you so much"

5153080,51966271,2015-10-25,13570256,Katie,Danielle and her home were so lovely. She was very warm and accommodating. The neighborhood was adorable and very walkable to the rest of the city. I would highly recommend staying here to a friend touring Boston.
5153080,52492559,2015-10-30,6918785,Patrick,Danielle was one of the best AirBNB hosts we have encountered.
Incredibly organized and welcoming.,,,,,

5153080,52926437,2015-11-02,69796,Kristina,Danielle's place is perfectly located and an awesome place to stay. The room itself is quiet and comfortable. I loved the welcome basket which goes to show that she's put a lot of thought into making sure her guests are taken care of. Danielle is welcoming and I would stay here again in the future.
5153080,53398573,2015-11-08,6701308,Charlotte,We had a great time in Boston. Danielle was very nice and very helpfull she gave us all the informations that we needed to visit Boston.

Her apartment was beautiful,extremely clean,organized and cozy. She offered all the amenities one may need for a comfortable stay. The location was very convenient to get around Boston by foot or public transportation,and it's a beautiful and quiet area but yet full of great restaurants and boutiques that are not tourist traps. We highly recommend Danielle's place,and would definitely stay there again! Thank you for opening your home to us Danielle,"and making our first Airbnb experience a wonderful one!\""
5153080,54517416,2015-11-21,46989234,Mayumo,"This is a beautiful place in a beautiful neighborhood, and, more importantly, Danielle, who owns the place and was our host, is just such a wonderful person."
As for the location,the place is very conveniently located from Back Bay Amtrak station.  An app. 8 minute walk from the station will put you in front of the very beautiful brick building which includes the host's property.  The place,which is a duplex unit,is both beautiful and well taken care of.  Once you check in,you will find an information booklet and Charlie card (for local transportation) in the bedroom.  Danielle also gave us a plenty of excellent restaurant recommendations and greeted us with some nice warm teas.,
The area is lovely.  You can walk up and down the street to find great Pizza,Indian,and coffee places among others.  We went to the pizza place that also features gigntic American icecreams and a good selection of beers and wines.  It was great.   Wholefoods is in a walking distance as well.,,,
The place also faces a very beautiful private garden for the building's residents.  Right next door to this place within the same building structure is the small gift shop.  People at this gift shop greeted us and spoke very highly of our host.  So that goes to show that we stayed at an awesome place and an awesome person.  Again,highly recommended for business and/or private trip to Boston.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
5153080,55723042,2015-12-05,2921556,Carol,Danielle was a great hostess and we appreciated her flexibility on our early arrival time.  The place was immaculate and in a great neighborhood - South End.  We were only 15 minutes walk from main shopping area in Back Bay and the actual walk there was very charming. The bedroom was small but comfortable.  Very quiet.  Lots of closet space and all the extra supplies available if you needed something.  Enjoyed drinking Danielle's herbal teas and sitting in her living room.  She made us feel very welcome if we wanted to watch TV or listen to music on the main level. There was also a TV in the bedroom. Beautiful view of the park courtyard.  We were out and about most of the time visiting our college daughter and the Boston sites.
5153080,62902705,2016-02-18,11671957,Kimberly,"Staying with Danielle was an awesome experience!  It was my first time with AirBnB and Danielle not only made the experience painless, but also very pleasant."
She is extremely helpful,mindful and organized and the pictures are an accurate representation of her unique and welcoming space.,,,,
Danielle is very personable and is the perfect hostess!  As a bonus,her apartment is within easy walking distance of quaint shops,lots of restaurants and other things to explore.,,,
I will definitely stay with Danielle again in future trips to Boston!,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
5153080,64520036,2016-03-05,14714928,Alisha,"It was an absolute delight to stay in Danielle's home during our recents holiday in Boston - from the moment we booked her, all correspondence was an absolute delight and Danielle herself couldn't have been more helpful or friendly, sending us her past guests' itineraries to assist in planning our trip, offering true local knowledge with regards to transport and local hang-outs, as well as an absolutely gorgeous apartment for us to hole up in during our 5 days in Boston."
Although we crammed in as much as possible,aiming to cover as much of the beautiful city before heading off to NYC,meaning that we were often at Danielle's place,apart from during sleeping hours,we had an entirely positive experience - everything was clean,well-equipped and exactly as the listing suggested. Bonus - Danielle had just had her shower repaired before we arrived
The apartment was wonderfully quiet,a real retreat from the chilly weather outside and the liveliness of the many breweries in which we spent our time in Boston. Danielle has thoughtfully collected many of the guidebooks and general home comforts which make for a perfect stay; we were thrilled by the hand warmers and the loaned CharlieCard in particular!,,,,
I would absolutely recommend Danielle's place - if only for her wonderfully eclectic taste in art(!),and my partner and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again,should we return to Boston (entirely likely - a fab city,even beyond the beer!).,,
P.S. If anyone would like our boozy guide to Boston,"please ask Danielle and you can find out what we filled our time there with - hops and glory!\"",,,,
5153080,67538892,2016-03-30,8596650,Gretchen,"We had a wonderful time staying with Danielle at her cozy and colorful place in Boston.  Danielle had our room set up very nicely including a sweet gift basket complete with Charlie Card if needed.  She was helpful with information about the area, and Danielle is a very considerate and respectful host.   This room is in a great location.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
5153080,68454901,2016-04-05,61282566,Akiyo,"This is definitely my FIRST experiment to use Airbnb, so I can't compare with other Airbnb from my real experiment. But, I can strongly recommend Danielle's apart to all people for sure. Above all, I want to emphasize that she has a wonderful hospitality! Her apart is like a hotel for me in terms of amenities and information about Boston."
She voluntally told me several times by email and text about how to get into her apartment and features in her neighborhood. When I taught to her what time I arrive,she was waiting for my arrival with her big smile and gave me kind instructions about her apart one by one.,,,,
During my stay in her apart,I have no anxiousness,"fear and all negative minds & images with her and her apartment as well. People who looking for some good place to stay in Boston must be satisfied with her Airbnb.\"",,,

5153080,75395786,2016-05-21,11595144,Andy,"I stayed at Danielle's house for two days while travelling to Boston for business. I had a great experience, house is very nice, clean, and comfortable. Danielle is an extremely nice, friendly, and flexible host. The room is on the quiet side with a great garden view. I could hear neighbors from upstairs at times so if you are a sensitive sleeper bring your earplugs. Would definitely stay there again."
5153080,75985483,2016-05-24,71182736,Mindy,Danielle's place was the perfect location! Danielle  thought of all the little things to make our stay stress free.  She Provided  every toiletry possible and Charlie cards for transportation use.  She went out of her way to help us print off tickets and even ran to catch us a bus.  I would definitely  recommend Danielle's place.
5153080,76528794,2016-05-28,15720467,Dawn,"Danielle could not have been a better host!  She checked in with me by email and text prior to my arrival and provided excellent instructions with several options for ways to get from the airport to her apartment.  She thoughtfully included all the amenities one could want, including extra toiletries, detailed instructions for use of the television, laundry, dishwasher, etc., Charlie Cards for use on the public transportation system, checkout instructions, maps and sightseeing guides to Boston, extra linens and blankets, and all the comforts of home."
My guest room was immaculate and had just been redone with all new furniture.  The apartment is exactly as shown and described in the listing - clean and neat throughout and very comfortable.  It is located just a five minute walk from the Back Bay metro station,Copley Square,and the Prudential Center,"and just two doors down from Starbucks.  It is also within a block or two of many great restaurants and shops (definitely visit Olives And Grace right next door - an awesome collection of cool product from US makers). \"",,
5153080,77688786,2016-06-02,31611073,Annie,"Danielle gave me a huge and warm welcome. I knew I would be happy at her place the instant I arrived. She was flexible about my arrival and departure arrangements, helped me plan excursions and provided clear information on how to get about and how things worked in her home. Her home is a joy, a vibrant expression of her personality, but without a single compromise in terms of practicality and comfort. Danielle has anticipated visitors' every need. It was extremely helpful to be able to use the kitchen and washing machine. The neighbourhood is beautiful, convenient for the city and has plenty of places to shop, eat and drink. Staying with Danielle is a great pleasure, totally recommended."
5153080,81196455,2016-06-21,28674894,Deniz,"Danielle was a terrific host. She contacted me prior to my arrival to help me with any questions I had and provided me with useful information on how to get to her apartment and how to get around in Boston. Danielle's apartment was lovely and everything was as described and as depicted in her listing. Danielle was absent for most of the time I was staying there, but she contacted me to make sure that everything was ok and was always available if I had any questions."
"Absolutely recommended!\"",,,,,
5153080,84256860,2016-07-06,18092008,Jessica,"Danielle was incredible - a great source of info about the area AND responded quickly to all questions that I had.  She even gave VERY clear directions on how to get from the airport using public transportation (and I didn't get lost!).  Even when my flight was delayed she was there to greet me as planned.  The location was perfect, walking distance to everything I wanted and close enough to a T stop if I didn't want to walk.  I was only there for a short time this trip but I'll definitely be staying there again when I head back to Boston!"
5153080,85822910,2016-07-13,82308275,Kelsey R.,"This was my partner and I's first AirBnB experience. After finding the apartment location, we were greeted by one of her fablous neighbors (as Danielle was working during our check in time, btw she is very flexible with check-ins/outs!) The apartment and the space was LARGER than we expected! The private gardens let in a nice breeze during the warm summer nights. We slept very well on the brand new mattress (better than what we have at home!) She also had a Charlie card waiting for us, clean linens, and some beer that we could help ourselves to."
The neighborhood is in the South End. Which is very upscale and is a few T stops away from the inner city. Close enough to the action,but far enough away so we felt safe walking along at night looking for Pokemon.,,,,
We did not see much of our host,since we were staying 1 night during the week,but she recommend us a new TV show that we are now hooked on. (Go watch Angie Tribeca) she was very polite,warm,and welcoming,"but she also left us to our devices and let us use the living room. She left early for work and we never even heard her leave! Check out was super flexible and easy. We will definitely be using AirBnB again for our Honeymoon to Cape Cod! We will also love to stay with Danielle (if she will have us again!) I feel like I made a new friend. :-) 15/10 would SO recommend!! :-D\""

12356,23396071,2014-11-30,4590769,Helen,"Anne was very responsive and easily reachable whenever we had any questions.    Because of some renovation work that had been done on another unit Anne manages, there was some question as to where we would be staying, but it all got worked out.  The photo attached to this review form must be the other apartment, where we didn't stay, but ours had the same layout.  Our apartment was roomy and comfortable, and the kitchen was well equipped.  The location was very convenient (only slightly more than a block to a T station that served two lines).  The only drawback to the location was the amount of traffic/noise during the earlier morning hours: garbage trucks, trucks supplying local businesses, etc.  We had to regulate the warmth in the apartment (for which we were grateful, given the cold temperatures we had for a few days) by opening the windows a bit which, unfortunately, let in more of the noise."
12356,23660957,2014-12-07,24293473,David,"Anne met us at the door on our arrival and oriented us to this cozy apartment just a few steps from Boston Common.

The location is very strategic, just across the street from the park, station, and historic locations in Boston. The roofdeck has a breathtaking view of Mass State House and Boston. The flat is very cozy and in a nice and clean building. We did see some roaches a few times but the building extraminators and Anne were very attentive  and great at solving the problem. There is a receptionist in the building and a function room to rent. We really enjoyed our stay and our communication with Anne has been great, as always (it's my second time renting from her). She is always attentive, nice and finds a solution promptly. I highly recommend her place."

There are stores within walking distance for groceries and there was no such thing as a bad meal at the nearby pub. The building is old but that's part of the charm. The rooftop deck was also amazing. No way could our family have afforded to stay in Boston at a hotel - Anne and Airbnb made it possible.

5967421,51790544,2015-10-24,45942476,Ashley,"Todd's place was definitely a luxury Air BnB!  The pictures are 100% accurate.  High quality bedding and essentials, as well as plenty of closet space, were all included in this reservation.  Check-in was very accommodating, and the location is ideal for travel to the Harvard Business School campus and Harvard Square.  We did share the restroom facilities, but found no issue with this as we never saw the other guest/resident.  This was a great place, and we would definitely book again.  Thanks, Todd!"

When I got to the place everything went smoothly. My assumptions about Todd were confirmed. He is absolutely delightful,and always ready to help in friendly yet professional manner.,,,,
I was in Boston for a professional conference and I had a few errands to run and other things to finalise for it. Todd kindly helped me to navigate everything and made this experience  a truly positive one.,,,,,
I would like to reiterate that this place is very minimal,it is only a room and a fridge/coffee machine. It won't accommodate a very long stay. For me it was perfect as I stayed for two nights.,,,,

5967421,68988519,2016-04-08,6827470,Joyce,It was our first Air BnB experience in the US and it turned out exceptionally well. Todd's property was in a quiet and safe neighbourhood minutes away from Harvard Business School. There were amenities in the area and it was never a problem to find food. We stayed here for 8 nights and the room was clean and cosy with fresh towels provided; our baths never ran out of hot water. Todd is a warm and friendly host and we would definitely choose to stay at his house again if we ever return to Boston.

5967421,79012948,2016-06-10,67802073,Marc,"This was my first AirBnB experience so I was a little nervous. Todd immediately put me at ease by responding to all of my questions within 5mins. He sent me a message about a week before my arrival detailing how to get into the room which was super easy. The room had all promised amenities, whatever toiletries I needed and was very clean. Todd delivered everything he promised. Very positive experience and makes me open to using AirBnB again in the future."

5967421,81713576,2016-06-24,7029151,Megan,"I enjoyed staying at Todd's place. I was in bedroom #1. The street is quiet and residential. The instructions were clear to get into the home. It is a bit like a coach house but attached to the home. The room was very nice, large and clean with lots of light and an AC unit. There was a mini fridge stocked with waters, a keurig and microwave near the entrance of the place.  I did not realize that I would be sharing a bathroom with other guests from the other bedrooms, so that was a bit of a surprise but it was clean and some toiletries were provided.  I did not meet the host but would recommend this place to others."

Das ist Zimmer ist groß, das Bett gemütlich und in einer netter Umbebung, ca. 10 min zur Orange T Linie von da 10 Min bis Downtown (Faneuil Hall etc).  Ich wurde von Anfang an wie ein Freund der Familie empfangen. Wir haben zusammen gefrühstückt und die beiden Kinder haben viel Quatsch gemacht - ob als Iron Man oder Spiderman."

It is only 15/20 min on the subway from city centre. Then 5min walking to the house. It is a multicultural one, with a good vibe, lively and great to explore."
They have a cat and my friend is allergic to cats. It seems that we had missed that info from the add. However,they provided clean bed clothes and towels just in case there could be any cat hair on them. We did appreciate this!,,,,
We did not see much of Helder or his family as we spent most of our time out in Boston. They gave us written information regarding the house and the neighborhood though. This was very helpful for us to feel comfortable while staying there.,,,,,

This was our first Airbnb experience, and though we felt a little bit of apprehension, all of our concerns were assuaged by Liz's easygoing nature the moment she opened the door. Liz and Helder are hosts that are happy to engage you in conversation, recommend places in the neighborhood, but also let you come in and out as you please, with no expectation. The room was comfortable and spacious, and conveniently located right next to the kitchen and bathroom, so we had room to access anything we needed without walking through the whole house. Additionally, we had our own back door, so we felt comfortable coming and going at any hour because we didn't worry about waking hosts by moving through the house late at night. All in all a lovely experience - it wasn't easy to leave!"

8166076,50591598,2015-10-12,46028981,Mike,"When our previously booked apartment was pulled from us at the very last minute by a totally uncaring owner, Elisangela came to our rescue and saved our vacation from disaster.  I can't begin to tell you what a wonderful person she is and how much she went out of her way to help us.  Her apartment is in a lively and friendly part of East Boston, just 10 minutes walk from the subway into the heart of the city which is just a 5 minute ride away.  Charming, comfortable and well-equipped for vacationing, the apartment was a good base for our visit and Angela's cafe across the corner was great for breakfasts.  A few blocks away we found the Kelley Square Pub which has a super atmosphere and a wide range of food on the menu, all good.  We love Boston but we loved Elisangela even more."
8166076,51222772,2015-10-18,46112249,John,"Elisangela was a great host. After being caught up in traffic she waited for us until almost 11, and even waited out a parking spot for us when we couldn't find one. It was late, so she wasn't able to fully explain to us but I felt as if we were earlier she would have shared some tips and tricks around Boston. The location was close to the airport and train station. The apartment seemed to have been cleaned before arrival which was nice and the layout allowed for us and our friends to have separate rooms not on top of eachother. The only thing that bothered us was east boston seemed a little run down and you could hear people walking past in the middle of the night. Other than that, our stay was nice, affordable, and enjoyable. I would stay again."
8166076,52025570,2015-10-25,46981182,Johanna,"Everything was perfect! Elisangela gave us the most warm welcome. Her place is exactly like a home should be, warm and cozy.

All amenities were provided for our comfort, and we felt right at home. The neighborhood was also very friendly and safe."
I can echo some member comments regarding noise. If you are not used to living next to a noisy street,this might not be the place for you. There were several groups of people walking by making noise at most hours of the night,"and the building is old so not well noise-proofed. You may be more comfortable with ear plugs.\"",,,
8166076,52811798,2015-11-01,47012102,Kathryn,"Elisangela was an amazing host! I was left the day of my trip in Boston with my previous host canceling that day and was scrambling to find a place to stay. I messaged Elisangela and she responded right away, was able to accommodate me with only a day's notice and was very helpful and kind when addressing all questions I had. The apartment was beautiful, we had everything we needed and it was a great neighborhood. She had such hospitality and I would definitely recommend this listing to anyone in the future. It also wasn't too hard to find on street parking right by the apartment which was great!"
8166076,54686683,2015-11-22,46111142,Scott,"Elisangela's home was perfect for a weekend getaway in Boston.  She welcomed us and gave us a complete tour and was extremely helpful in answering any questions we had.  Coffee and snacks were offered for our stay which was a very nice gesture.  The beds were extremely comfortable and plenty of extra sleeping room on the 3 available futons.  Overall, it was a great place in a great location and I would definitely stay for a return visit."
8166076,58212338,2016-01-01,37836782,Dakota,I thought this was a wonderful place. She was very nice and helpful. The only bad thing was the dishes were kind of dirty and we realized the sheets were kind of dirty as well. Other then that great host and great place!

Elisangela had everything prepared for us: drinks, biscuits, shampoos, even toothbrushes. Elisangela was extremely helpful and patient when we needed help. She is the best host we have ever met. If we ever had a chance to go to Boston again, we would definitely stay in Elesangela's."
8166076,62345480,2016-02-14,49610359,Shougen,"Elisangela is a very kind and nice hostess. She prepares instant noodles, which is very deliciouswhen we had with Boston beef, cabbage and shrimp which we had bought in the Hay Market. This is the best food  we have ever had in the duration of our stay in America. She was also willing to help us with the printing of our e-tickets, although it failed due to the problem of the sending of my email (We succeeded in printing the e-tickets on the spot). Anyway we should appreciate her hospitality. Her apartment is clean and spacious and she makes us at home. In a word, we have a memorable trip in Boston, which is mainly due to our beautiful hostess. Thank you, Elisangela."

I went to celebrate my birthday with some friends and she even had a balloon, a mug full of candy and a card for me which she really didn't have to but it was super sweet. She was very adamant about us feeling at home and making sure that all accommodations were made. She even provided us with some refreshments, extra blankets, towels and etc. She was readily available to contact at any time. One time we had difficulty getting in around 3am and she answered right away and stayed on the line until we got in (I felt horrible about it but she was so kind)."
The place itself was great. Very clean,comfy,spacious for its one floor and very very cozy. Her furniture is so comfortable and her beds,it was great for us to sleep in on and relax. The community around it is nice. Angela's cafe right next to the apartment is a nice place to go get some muffins,"cafe con leche and breakfast. The bakery a couple blocks down has some awesome bread and pastries. It's safe and super convenient to get to the metro from. We all came in at different times and some came a day later and her place being right next to the metro near the airport really made coming and leaving a lot more convenient. My 5 other friends that came with me and myself couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. They all enjoyed themselves. It was my first time in boston & using AirBnB and I have absolutely no complaints with Elisangela I definitely would use her place again when I come back. \"",
8166076,68168565,2016-04-02,10826284,Hao,The apartment  was small but quaint! Elisangela was a perfect host answering questions promptly. She was available via text and phone almost immediately the entire stay. The complimentary items in the house were a nice touch!  Location was great.  It was easy to take the metro into town to see all attractions. The neighborhood had a small town feel with nice restaurants and corner store groceries just a two blocks away. Highly recommended for a budget family stay.

I stayed with 7 others and there was plenty of space, blankets, pillows, toiletries, etc. The big touristy areas are about 15 min away and it's located right next to the airport. Finding the home was a bit complicated but that's just Boston streets not the location itself. The host was readily available for any questions although I did not meet her. The apartment was clean and safe. Would recommend."

It was easy to get everywhere we wanted to go around the city - even the day of the Boston Marathon.   Elisangela was a great a hostess!  She even graciously allowed us to check out late so that our marathoners could shower after the race.   Loved the breakfast across the street at Angela's Cafe.   Great vacation!  Thanks Elisangela!

We had such a wonderful time in Boston and a big part of it was staying at Elisangela's, if we are back in Boston we will stay again! The neighborhood  was great and literally right next to the airport coming and going was a breeze. Transportation into the city is easy too! Thank Elisangela for a wonderful stay!"
8166076,73287557,2016-05-08,57045433,Marija,"If we could give more than 5 stars, we would. We are a group of 8 girls who flew to Boston for a girls weekend to celebrate our friend Ana's engagement and found ourselves in a compromising position our first night in Boston. We had nobody else to call so we called Elisangela (at midnight, might I add) and she called us back immediately!! She made sure we were, first and foremost, SAFE and then took care of us like a family member would."
On top of how amazing the hostess is,the apartment and the building itself is amazing! It's kept extremely clean and is in a GREAT neighborhood! The unit has hardwood floors,high ceilings,whimsy white curtains and is super charming with lots of character. There was a closet full of extra towels,blankets,comforters and pillows and the fridge was even stocked with water and some extra's for us.
Angela's cafe,a Guy Lafueri approved local spot that has been featured on food network,is literally across the street,and has the best breakfast in town (an omelette with toast and coffee only costs $9- Opens at 8am and closes at 10) and a pizza place down the street also delivers until 11pm! We walked to the MBTA just a flew blocks down and took the subway straight into downtown Boston- which was super convenient and budget friendly.,,

We stayed with our 3 kids and felt very safe. Wonderful cafe across the street was bonus as was the very large park by the train station. There is plenty of room and can easily accommodate people as advertised. I much preferred this over a hotel and we'd certainly stay here again!
8166076,75101529,2016-05-18,56991168,Leslie,Elisangela was great! She helped us find parking! The apartment is really nice and in close proximity to everything!

The beds were super comfortable and Elisangela provided many amenities from snacks/breakfast items to toiletries.  Sweet decor.  Elisangela is a fantastic host, so friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend her home."
8166076,78096681,2016-06-05,16708167,Lauren,"I came to Boston with some girlfriends for a weekend trip and we had a great time staying at Elisangela's apartment for the weekend! The apartment was very convienient to get to from the airport (only a 5min free shuttle and few block walk away) and Elisangela was very helpful on how to find the apartment. We were going to a concert at Gillette stadium one night and spending a day in the heart of Boston the next, and everything was very easy to get to and the location seemed central to both. We had breakfast at the restaurant across the street the last day, which was reccomended and very good. There wasn't much else around the immediate area, but since you are close enough to Boston from the T or an uber it wasn't a problem. We would all love to return to this apartment on our next trip to Boston. Thank you!!"
8166076,78981462,2016-06-10,30921416,Minh,"We had a wonderful time in Boston, much thanks to our host Elisangela.  The condo was a perfect location for all we wanted to do in Boston.  It is close to the Airport train station so we were able to use the transit system to get everywhere.  The condo itself was very clean and well stocked for us.  Elisangela was very responsive and I hope every airbnb host I rent from is as great a host, she set the bar very high."

Super friendly and professional and gave us great recommendations for food and travel. She was always available and responded when I had questions leading up to our stay, and was even local the night we were there in case something went awry (nothing did). The apartment was more spacious than it seemed in pictures and was absolutely spotless! The beds were very comfortable and there was plenty of room for everyone. I couldn't be happier with my stay here, and I would definitely rent from her again!! A+ !"

14468407,94680778,2016-08-16,66041938,Jan,"This is a student flat-share type room. The location is great (3min to subway, 5min to shops and coffees) and perfect as a base for exploring Boston. However there is no real AC so the room can get pretty hot and humid, and it is not perfectly clean. If you are a student like me this won't bother you. Thai, your host, is very helpful and will check in on you every now and then to make sure your stay is going well and to see if you have everything. Great host!"
14468407,96369523,2016-08-22,75181253,Fernanda,"Thai was a wonderful host, very welcoming and kind. He welcomed us with lots of fruit, mints, better than what a hotel would ever do! This place has everything you need if you're staying for a couple of days. If you're a dancer, the floor is amazing! He has a nice sound system and a great desk to work on if you have to get things done. If there was any issue we were able to contact him and he would respond immediately. He is a wonderful host, definitely recommend staying with him, and would stay again at this location! :)"
11474629,75780050,2016-05-23,30129052,Anya,"I have to say David is the reason why I am such a fan of Airbnb. Super friendly, lightning-fast communication, knowledgeable and just all around warm, and exceptionally gracious host. His home was just as described in the listing and more. Located on a quiet, clean street, easy access to transportation and safe. Plenty of restaurants, cafes, bars and shops within walking distance. The apartment was charming, home-y and spotless. All the furnishings are carefully selected, every detail thought out and most importantly super comfortable. The mattress and bedding were out of this world. Slept like a baby with a full belly. It was magical! I highly recommend staying here and I'm sure we will be back again."

11474629,87923918,2016-07-22,6911448,Ali,"We rented this unit for 10 days. It worked perfectly for us. I had to commute to downtown Boston to attend a technical conference;  using Bus 9 it took me less than 20 minutes to get there. Access to shopping and other Boston attractions was also very handy. The kitchen was very well equipped, with all necessary appliances and utensils. David and his wife did everything that was in their capacity to help us and they responded to our requests in a timely manner. We just wished for two things to have been there: 1- A separate air conditioning unit in the living room (the apt has a single A/C unit located in the bedroom). 2- A bar in the closet so we can use it for hanging our clothes. If I've ever been to Boston in the future, I would certainly consider staying in this unit again."

4143561,22263962,2014-11-02,22657777,Jennifer,"This was an excellent place to stay in Boston.  The apartment was perfectly situated near the Prudential Centre and Subway but yet nestled on a quiet street.  The Southwest Corridor parks and walkway were right behind it with great kids playgrounds within minutes of the apartment.  We found Henkel excellent to deal with and the apartment was lovely, the kitchen and bathroom welcome packs were a great touch.  We would stay here again when next in Boston without a doubt!"

4143561,35332053,2015-06-17,19912895,Jessica,We really enjoyed staying at the condo in Garrison Square. The staff was very helpful and quickly cleared up a minor issue when we first arrived. The apartment was exactly as described. We loved the rooftop area in the building. The area was very nice and safe - close to everything we wanted to see in Boston. We had a great trip and can't wait to return again soon!
4143561,47763629,2015-09-21,4732936,Tim,"This listing gets you a unit in an apartment building, likely not the one you see in the photos. Upsides: great location walking distance to a ton; very friendly and helpful staff on-site; easy check-in and check-out; the apartment was spacious and the property is well-maintained; was nice having a balcony. Downsides: the apartment was sparse--very little in the way of amenities provided (no hand soap, etc). Cheap low-end furnishings (beds, linens, toilet paper, etc). TV was difficult to use and did not have HD. Apartment could have been cleaner--there were stains on floors, etc."
4143561,48549251,2015-09-27,11615154,Derrik,"The neighborhood was awesome, right in the middle of everything. My only complaint is the photos didn't match the apartment we stayed in. The layout seemed accurate but the one we stayed in had carpet instead of hardwood floors as shown in the picture. Other than that, was a great experience overall."

The building itself is quite nice, and the apartment is nicely furnished and laid out. We received an e-mail from the host early on with suggested Boston activities, and detailed instructions on how to arrive at the property and receive the keys to the unit (as well as what to do, and how to connect to WiFi, etc). Linens and (nice) toiletries were provided in sealed bags, as was kitchen cleaning and laundry in case it was needed. Great place to stay!!"

4143561,66766666,2016-03-24,61850708,Mary,"About 8 days before our arrival we received notice that our rental location had changed, so we did not rent this exact apartment. It was still in the same complex and the Back Bay neighborhood was perfectly situated for us. We were centrally located to Quincy Market and all the campuses we were visiting that week. The apartment was clean and spacious enough for us. I believe the apartment in this listing may not have had a pullout sofa (as another renter noted) which is why we were probably moved. One thing to note, even though there is parking available for a fee, they did not accept cash or credit card. Payment had to be made by check or money order. Luckily I had my checkbook with me, but I know that many people don't usually carry checks with them. We arrived late so had we needed a money order there would have been no way to get one at that hour. All in all this location worked very well for us."

Myself and five friends (six of us total) stayed in the apartment for three nights and it was the perfect place for us!  Best of all,the place is so centrally located (and in a great area) -- we were able to walk all over the city from there.  All six of us slept comfortably and Jenny was kind enough to have a large and comfortable air bed setup in the nursery for us upon our arrival.  The outdoor patio was also a nice feature.  We were lucky enough to snag visitor parking spots right outside the apartment (and therefore not pay for parking over the weekend),but even if we had not been able to do so there is relatively cheap parking right across the street.,,,
Jenny prepared a very helpful document detailing locations of key items/how to work appliances/etc. and was available by cell if we had any questions.  She was also very thoughtful in providing some essentials,leaving us coffee,having towels out for us on each bed,etc.,,

She asked in advance what gear he needed and even left treats for the adults too- wine and iced coffee in the fridge! Her home is lovely, it is a perfect set-up for a family traveling with a young child and the location is ideal. Within minutes you can walk to the South End, Back Bay, Boston Common, T stops, etc. I would absolutely stay here again and definitely recommend this home."

Jenny has a great sense of style and has managed to mix an upscale vibe with a comfy and cosy feel. We were given some great restaurant and shopping ideas and we may just have had the best breakfast sandwiches of our lives this week. For any prospective visitors who might think the price is a bit steep, this home is worth every penny! We will definitely be back. Thanks Jenny and Rob for a great week."

We really appreciated everything they did to make us feel welcome as well, leaving toiletries in each bathroom, towels on every bed, and coffee and wine in the fridge.  The location was also very convenient to many different neighborhoods in Boston. I'd recommend staying at Jenny and Rob's house to any AirBnB user."

594693,1908625,2012-08-06,922635,Dana,"Very convenient if you want to stay on the Boston side. Place is on a trendy street in a trendy neighborhood near the end of the Orange line. Within 50 feet is Bus line 39, which will take you to Copley within 20-40 minutes depending on traffic. Many good restaurants and eateries nearby.  Room is at the rear of one floor condo/decker. Bed is a sofa bed that like most sofa beds is on the soft side. Similar to most places in Boston, host's room has no A/C, so be prepared if the weather is hot and humid.  (This may change if host installs window A/C in room.)  Host and host's dog are very friendly and accommodating."
594693,2075608,2012-08-23,3173181,Cornelis,The room and the bed/bank are very good as is the bathroom. The dog is a sweety. Robin is a very nice lady and easy going. She even arranged an airco for me. I would go there again any time.
"The neigbourhood is nice. Many restaurants of all kinds and the bus stopt almost in front. Downtown in 25 minutes\"",,,,,
594693,2569207,2012-10-09,3762862,Luiz Rodrigues,"This room is really nice, especially comparing an hostel I live in my first night in Boston - this room is quiet, comfortable, private, close to buses and the T, and the most important, almost the same price as a shared room in hostel! Ms. Robin is very kindly as well, helping me a lot on many things. Miss Sammi is very lovely and friendly, that is really interesting to have a really special pose when taking a photo:) I love this room and I'd like to recommend to my friends for their stay in Boston!"
594693,18462629,2014-08-26,20545531,Ravi,The reservation was canceled 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
594693,19638338,2014-09-15,12881674,Sofia,"Robin was super hospitable and welcoming! The private room was perfect for me and my four night stay. Use of the kitchen and refrigerator space for food I bought at the farmer's market across the street was great! I loved being able to come and go as I pleased and just being in a chill space. The room is also close to a lot of cool restaurants, shops, and the T, which was super important for me. Robin's dog Sammie is as sweet as can be. I wish I could've stayed longer. Thanks Robin!"
594693,20057807,2014-09-22,2403494,Mark,Robin was a fantastic host during our trip up to Boston for the weekend. She made sure we had everything we needed and everything exceeded our expectations.
The location itself was nice to walk around,as there were many neat coffee shops,artistic studios,and monuments/old churches to see.,,
Would definitely recommend for those looking for those looking for a cozy,welcoming place to stay in a cute,"artsy suburb of Boston.\"",,,
594693,22199040,2014-11-01,22205301,Chris,"Robin was a gracious host and I enjoyed my time in her home. The room was clean and comfortable. The house is in a convenient location, on the main street in JP, with buses running right in front of the house. I enjoyed my 10 minute walk to the T Station every day through pleasant residential neighborhoods. A co-op and a fantastic bakery (with decadent vegan-friendly treats) were just steps away. Sammie was also wonderful company - a very well-behaved, friendly dog. I felt like I got a good deal for my money and would recommend it to anyone I know."
594693,30597213,2015-04-25,23400027,Balasubramanya,Great hostess. Extremely helpful. Fantastic location: Easily accessed by public transportation and great restaurants very nearby
594693,36182972,2015-06-26,32091042,Devon,"Robin was a kind and generous host and made us feel at home right away. We loved having access to the kitchen and other shared spaces as well as our private bedroom. We managed to stay cool and comfortable on some hot summer days, and we enjoyed sharing some puppy love with Sammi. All in all, Robin's place was perfect for us!"
594693,38840659,2015-07-19,32782125,Sarah,"Private room in a peaceful space was exactly as described. Perfect space for a student or business traveler (desk, aircon, bookshelves, and comfy bed). Robin is a fantastic host. I was here for three weeks and she managed to make it feel like home. Whether food, activities, or everyday necessities, Robin can direct you to the best of Jamaica Plain and Boston. You won't want to leave by the end of your visit. The neighborhood is lovely. Easy commute to the rest of Boston, but just far enough out to get away from the noise of city. This was really helpful in the summer given tourist crowds. Sammi (the resident dog) is a treat too! Incredibly patient and friendly."
594693,55170378,2015-11-28,47320099,Chris,"I met Robin as she was leaving for work. We chatted briefly. Very warm and friendly person! She prepared the room nicely for me, but I fell asleep on the couch, which was too comfortable to motivate me to move. Her dog Sammi is wonderful also. Highly recommended!"
594693,70083010,2016-04-16,45021003,Pauline,"Hostess really nice, great location and room!"
594693,70787307,2016-04-20,34320598,Allie,"We had a great stay with Robin! Her home was quiet, cozy and in a great location (easily accessible to downtown too!). Plus her dog, Sammi is an absolute sweetheart. We would definitely go back!"
594693,72426053,2016-05-02,45021003,Pauline,"Robin is really adorable ! And don't forget Sammy, lovely dog !!"
594693,76079251,2016-05-24,54415603,Xiaocun,"It is wonderful experience to live here. The location is so good that the bus station is at the door. Robin is very nice and answers all questions quickly and she works hard. Samie is a sweet dog, never barks. My friend who was fear of dogs loves her. There is also a Thailand restaurant within 5 minutes walk which is also good. Anyway, it is a good choice and it is cheap."
594693,76965574,2016-05-30,32149807,David,"Yes, this was a great place to stay in Boston! I loved taking Sammy, the wonderful dog, for walks in the neighborhood. The kitchen was fully equipped, and the room and bed were perfect!"
594693,79837464,2016-06-14,24764672,Javier Y Belén,We had a great time in Boston and it was very nice to talk to robin when we had a chance!
594693,80990440,2016-06-20,54003286,Carmen,"Robin was awesome! Always available and accommodating, would love to stay there again on a future trip to Boston!"
594693,84238301,2016-07-06,21648208,Catherine,Thank you again for the stay Robin! you were a perfect host.
The house is located in a calm neighbourhood,30 minutes away from dowtown (door to door) by metro. Another option to go to DT is to rent bikes (the station is located in front of the house). The bedroom is calm,and the bed is comfortable (we were 2 persons sleeping in that bed). Robin offered us cafe in the morning,which i really appreciate when i stay at a host - and gave us good advices!,,
There was another couple sleeping in the living room,situated just next to our room,the «co-habitation» was good,"as there were quiet and respectfull.\"",,
594693,92819539,2016-08-10,35908605,Suzanne,Robin was very prompt and responsive to all communications. She is friendly and outgoing.  The area is great.  There is a coffee house/bakery within a couple of blocks. Restaurants are plentiful. It is within easy walking distance of Jamaica Pond.  Both bus and train transit are close by.   The room is basic but has everything that one needs.  The air-conditioning was great. The towel was nice and fluffy. It is a really good value for the area.  The fact that one has to walk through the semi private bedroom to get to your private room is a bit awkward.
594693,93973024,2016-08-14,82188205,Maria,"It was a great location, close to shops and public transportation. Also in walking distance to the Sam Adams brewery which my boyfriend and I enjoyed. Robin has a great place and a friendly dog. One issue we had was that the living room was also rented out and felt like we didn't have enough privacy. We had to walk through the living room to get to our bedroom."
594693,99738502,2016-09-05,76438273,Michael,"Robin was fantastic with communication prior to arrival. She gave us clear instructions and her home was easy to find. The back room was very comfortable with AC, small desk fans, and TV/Cable. Not a far walk from the T station"
14322546,96850901,2016-08-24,132317,Stephanie,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
164418,547809,2011-09-19,843195,Annemarie,We really enjoyed the stay at Carlos´s house.
Our first reservation at another place got canceled last minute and Carlos helped us out and accepted our reservation just one day before we got there.,,,,,
We had our own clean and big room. The two windows let a lot of light in.,,,,,
Carlos helped us with everything we needed. He gave us tipps where we find certain places in and around Boston. When he would not know a place to go,than he looked it up. His house is not too close to Boston downtown,but we had a very quiet,relaxed and safe neighborhood instead. So we always slept very well and it felt like home. And with Carlos help and some of his maps we found out that there was a bus stop very close to us. With this bus and the orange subway line (that comes very consistantly) we got into Boston very quickly. The last day Carlos drove us with our suitcases to the subway. That was so nice,so we had not to ride the bus.,
He made breakfast for us every morning and the one day he even had homemade bread for us. His cat Jake was nice to us and soft. On a boring day you can still have fun with him. Never seen such a nice cat before. Even my cat-hating-boyfriend liked him.,,,,,
Next time we visit Boston we would book this place for sure. Once you know that the distance to Boston town is no problem,it was an easy and pleasent stay at his big and home-like house.,,,,
"The only drawback is that the bed is not long enough for tall people.\"",,,,,
164418,572048,2011-09-26,1011918,Cassie,he is nice and easy-going. we  feel very comfortable when we living there.
164418,616647,2011-10-10,1236936,Ravin,"I came back to Boston for a funeral, so I didn't stay long at the residence, but I enjoyed the dwelling."
Wonderful stay,peaceful and quiet. Carlos is great host,and most helpful. We had breakfast and he gave me a ride to the train station.,,,
"I'll certainly contact him the next time I'm back in town.\"",,,,,
164418,637903,2011-10-17,441407,Michael & Marta,I had two friends with a baby come into town for my wedding and they stayed with Carlos. They had a wonderful time at his home and enjoyed talking with him. Since I also live in Boston I asked Carlos if I could come by and check the place out before my friends arrived. He was happy to meet me and he has a wonderful house! I would recommend this place to friends and family!! Thanks again Carlos!
164418,1090638,2012-04-06,1945257,Howard,I had a 2-week stay.
Carlos was a good host and cared about my plans and assisted me by helping with directions and occasionally by providing a ride.  Allowing me to use his laundry facilities and the use of his detergent.,,,,,
All in all a very good stay in a location that was safe,and a few miles away from  the Forest Hills orange T line.   It is also about a mile from the Bellview commuter train stop.,,,,
"All in all a nice stay at a reasonable price.\"",,,,,
164418,1169485,2012-04-23,2018145,Rachael,"My husband, our 7 month old and I stayed with Carlos for 9 days in April.  The room was large enough to comfortable fit our small family with the portable crib.  Carlos was very kind and accommodating of the baby and our strange schedule.  He left breakfast out each morning so that we could eat whenever the baby allowed.  His cat was very cuddly and friendly. All in all it was much nice and more convenient to stay with Carlos than a hotel."
164418,1185239,2012-04-26,2069710,Massimo,"Carlos is a very kind host, the house is nice and cozy and is inhabited by a beautiful cat, our stay was very good. A little awkward to reach if you do not have a car, but the bus 51 is close enough."
164418,1330178,2012-05-22,1973319,Seneca,Carlos is a great host. He was very helpful with information. The place was clean and spacious. The stay is just as advertised. I have enjoyed my time in Boston.
"Thanks for your accommodation mate.\"",,,,,
164418,1596160,2012-06-30,2620564,Lee,"Carlos was very accommodating. He wasn't able to be at the house for check-in, so he left a key outside, which was very thoughtful. The futon in the room was comfortable, and the room also had an AC unit, which was useful for the hot nights.Carlos also had food available in the mornings, though I didn't take as much advantage as I should have. Overall, it was a very pleasant stay at a very affordable rate."
164418,1755451,2012-07-20,2785899,Julia,"Carlos was the perfect host: He was very nice, helpful and easy and gave us many good recommendations. His room was comfortable and quiet. It was a pleasure to sit on his deck and to enjoy the sun. Thanks Carlos!!"
164418,1908645,2012-08-06,571867,Brandon,"Carlos was a great host! He was kind, responded really timely with reservation details, the room and shared amenities were clean, he even offered to help us carry in our luggage."
He made himself available to give us directions and suggestions for where to go and was flexible with checkin/checkout times,,,,,
"If I were to visit the area again I'd stay with Carlos again.\"",,,,,
164418,1984015,2012-08-14,1341355,Barbara,Our stay with Carlos and his adorable cat Jake was great! Carlos was very friendly and helpful and we just loved Jake. The house is just a few minutes by car from Beantown and there's no problem for parking. The room was a little bit tiny for us 'cause we were travelling with a lot of luggage but still spacious and comfy. Even with a shared bathroom we had our perfect privacy. We appreciated a small breakfast Carlos provided us and the use of the fridge.
164418,2608755,2012-10-14,1442982,Jason,Staying with Carlos was great!
I needed a place to stay for a week on short notice and he accommodated me within 1 hr of the request,keys in hand. The house was clean and as advertised. Bed is futon but really very comfortable. Located in a very nice neighborhood in West Roxbury.  Small shopping center nearby that you can walk to for Starbucks,Chinese,Anna's Bakery,Dry Cleaners etc.,
Thanks for a nice place to stay Carlos!,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
164418,6973748,2013-09-01,8017571,Prasad,Carlos was very prompt when it comes to response; overall ambiance  of house was really good ; room was exact as it looks in the pics. He was very informative when it comes to give an idea about neighborhood.
164418,7354129,2013-09-16,3708678,Alissa,"I stayed with Carlos for 4 days while exploring Boston. He was very friendly and helpful, providing me with a lot of information on what to see and do in town. The house is located in a very nice, green and very quiet neighborhood. I have stayed in rural areas which were noisier! The only drawback is that the next T station is a 15-20 minute walk from the house, and since it's a commuter stop, there aren't too many trains during the day. There are several bus stops nearby, though, and the service is good. If you don't have your own car, be prepared to use the bus for public transport. Once I figured out the timetable, I had no problems getting around. The house itself is great; lots of space to relax if you need a break from sightseeing. There are two deck areas if the weather is good. Carlos also has a beautiful cat which is very friendly but not obtrusive. It's always up to a cuddle if you like, but will leave you alone if you don't. The room is spacious, too. I liked the fact that it has a ceiling fan, which was a relief because summer made a comeback while I visited. All in all I would recommend the place to anybody who doesn't mind cats."
164418,7655424,2013-09-28,1107257,Alton,"Carlos is really great at responding fast to reassure one of their trip plans. He was an awesome host who was very personable, friendly, clean, and knowledgeable about the area. I would definitely refer him to others who are looking for a great place to stay in Boston. He also has a very friendly cat that I miss already."
164418,8121936,2013-10-16,9037988,Gillian,Carlos was a great host and has a beautiful house out in West Roxbury. They area is adorable and has that very stereotypical East Coast vibe to it (especially during the fall!!). The room is exactly as pictured. It's a nice size room and a fairly comfortable futon. Carlos even has  a little basket of shampoo/conditioner etc. to use as well.
During the week it is very easy to get into Boston via the commuter rail. It was about a 15-20 min walk to the station and then 15 min to our stop. The weekends were a little trickier,but it's mostly about timing the bus right and then the orange line in. There are zipcars near by if you need them too (also a Starbucks and a grocery store nearby to pick up coffee and snacks!),,,,
Carlos' cat,Jake,was also a great host providing lots of snuggles and opportunities to scratch his tummy. He is seriously one of the sweetest,most friendly kitties I've ever met!!,,
"I had a wonderful time staying with Carlos and will be booking with him again during my next trip to Boston. \"",,,,,
164418,8239912,2013-10-21,9409584,Marianna,Carlos is a very sweet and welcoming host. His ad definitely describes the home accurately and the neighborhood is very quiet. He was unobtrusive and his cat Jake was as described in other reviews. Carlos' home was an easy 20 minute drive to Commonwealth Ave in Boston. The only drawback for me personally was that the futon mattress was not full size thickness. If you have back problems that could be a deal breaker. Otherwise I highly recommend.
164418,10423751,2014-02-18,11225718,Samuel,Carlos was a great host. The concierge Jake the cat was also very inviting. Would definitely stay again!
164418,12032303,2014-04-21,14248365,Jay,"Our stay was excellent. Carlos was an excellent host with great accommodations. The bedroom was neat and clean, he provided with creative and scrumptious breakfast (bacon muffins!) and his cat Jake was awesome. Carlos was very understanding and flexible of arrival and departure times and provided with knowledge of the city. He is a great guy and I would definitely stay over again."
164418,14067573,2014-06-10,6373528,Sklivanitis,"Carlos was a great host. Although the first day we arrived late after midnight, he welcomed us and offered us a very pleasant stay. The room is exactly as described in a quiet, residential area and just 15min from downtown Boston."
164418,14323366,2014-06-16,16553251,Kyle,"Carlos is friendly and hospitable.  The trundle bed was uncomfortable for me, but I brought an air mattress as an alternative and so it still worked out well.  The room is cool even in the summer and there are nice dark shades for the windows.  Also a very convenient location!"
164418,17131084,2014-08-07,15648297,Katherin,"Realmente me encantó la estadía en casa de carlos, el barrio es muy bueno, la casa es excelente, la habitación muy cómoda y Carlos una grandiosa persona."
164418,17410786,2014-08-11,821910,Arjun,"Carlos is a great host and everything was just as is described in the pictures he's posted - quiet neighbourhood, friendly host and only 35 min to downtown (if you use public transportation). Carlos's cat Jake is adorable, keeps you company and can turn you into an animal lover instantly. Last but not the least, Carlos was very flexible with the time of checking in (he offered to pick us up) and checking out (we checked out only in the evening). Would definitely stay again here."
164418,18144429,2014-08-22,19814381,Yaqing,"Carlos was friendly and helpful to us! He has a cute cat too :) The room is very nice and tidy, just wish the location could be more convenient (it takes over 20 minutes' bus ride to the nearest metro station)"
164418,20532653,2014-09-30,4317499,Lucie,I stayed 6 nights at Carlos's house. It was ok I wasn't here a lot just for sleeping. The house is nice the backyard is pretty. The room is very nice it's not a mattress so if you have problems with your back I wouldn't recommend it. I had a car and it was great because public transportation are not close but you can drive 5 mins until the metro which get you in boston in 25 mins. Carlos was nice but we didn't have the same schedule  so we didn't see a lot. Neighborhood is great and safe.
164418,32630378,2015-05-19,31147214,Frank,"Carlos is a very friendly host! The cat is also nice. The room is big and the bed was ok. The bathroom was clean. Parking was free and we could reach dowtown by car in about 15-20 minutes. Carlos offered maps and gave us tips on what to do. The neighbourhood is save and quiet. He even allowed me to print something out. I would definetly stay here again, if I come back to Boston."
164418,37258712,2015-07-05,36305117,Fran,"Amazing host and amazing place! If you have a car, the place is just perfect, since you can leave in front of the house without paying to park. Nice neighborhood and cute cat. Thank you very much, Carlos!"
164418,41033476,2015-08-03,36305117,Fran,Carlos is an amazing host! His house is very comfortable and cozy indeed. It was my second experience in his place and it was fantastic just like the first one. I deeply recommend it!
164418,43590294,2015-08-20,16401064,Neal,"Clean, private room, easy parking, close to public transport to Boston. Lovely chilled out resident cat called Jake. We asked to use two bowls & spoons for the cereal & milk we brought with us for our breakfast. No, Carlos doesn't like guests to use his bowls or utensils so the kitchen is a no go area. It's a pity he didn't have some just for his AirBnB guests to use. Carlos was kind to allow us to have an early checkin for which we were grateful."
164418,44225896,2015-08-24,35245381,Daphka,"Although I didn't really see Carlos until our check-out time, our stay at his place was great. Everything was cleaned and ready for us to use. We didn't really hangout in the house except for sleeping. The bed was quite uncomfortable but the room was pretty spacious. As for the neighborhood, it was very quiet and everyone we encountered were very friendly."
164418,44828271,2015-08-29,10814876,Linda,The room was very tidy and had an ac that we very much appreciated since it got really humid in the room. The neighborhood was very quiet and had lots of parking for us. We had no problem with sharing bathrooms since we were out most of the day. Carlos' cat was also very friendly and so cute! I would definitely recommend this place.
164418,45340514,2015-09-01,20130044,Xiao Yuan,Carlos is very kind for guest. The room and shared bath is very clean. The cat is quiet and always stayed downstairs expect hungry.
164418,46515301,2015-09-11,41585238,Sook Ting,The bed is cozy and comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. Carlos provide guide map and information in the room. It take me one hour to go to the downtown from there.
164418,48145995,2015-09-23,27505498,Quentin,"We only stayed twos nights in Boston but everything was great !! The room and the house are clean and as describe, the neighborhood is quiet and safe. We really enjoyed our stay"
164418,87841574,2016-07-22,83810849,Andrew,Great place. Within a 10 minute walk to the commuter rail into Boston. Carlos was very accommodating with my arrival and departure schedule. Would certainly stay here again.
164418,98740825,2016-09-01,75672586,Yuqi,"It is a really nice room. It also has Memory foam mattress and pillow. The household is friendly and helpful, the check-in and check-out time are flexible."
10610205,79970003,2016-06-15,75373040,Edward,Great host and value for money stay. Conveniently located and very spacious room.
10610205,81176994,2016-06-21,30756115,Andrew,"You can't ask for better hosts. The family's hospitality is unmatched. After informing that I was a vegetarian, I was treated to authentic, home-cooked meals that met my dietary restrictions. In addition to phenomenal food that was fresh made and top quality, the best part was the company and conversations. The family is warm, welcoming, and inspiring. I know where I will visit next time I am in the area."
"The place is as listed and a convenient ride to downtown Boston via the transit system. There wasn't a stone unturned in regards to my needs and requests. 6 stars instead of 5!\"",,,,,
10610205,81459453,2016-06-23,75087207,Kate,Wonderful room! The location was perfect for a few days of exploring Boston. Definitely would recommend!
10610205,82050944,2016-06-26,9531360,Matthew,"Loved staying with this family. Very kind, welcoming and accommodating. It is only unfortunate I was so busy while in Boston and couldn't spend more time with them."
10610205,82618412,2016-06-28,79923612,Tram Anh,"This is the best place that I've stay so far! I drived from Texas to Boston for my journey. When  I stay here, I was refreshed myself to continue my journey! The atmosphere in the room is really comfortable, the smell is also good! The space in the room is so wide! For me, this room is better than a lot of rooms in some motels and hotel in my journeys! The host is so nice and friendly! Thank you, Thanh! Next year, I will come back Boston and contact to you to stay this room one more time!!!! I love it."
10610205,85278819,2016-07-11,69405088,Julian Paul,Nice privat room in neighborhood Dorchester; 20 min from downtown with metro.clean 'own' bathroom
10610205,86540776,2016-07-16,20900325,Elizabeth,"Thanh was very accommodating and even stayed up very late on the night of our arrival to make sure we arrived and had everything we needed.  We didn't spend much time at the house so we had minimal interaction with the hosts, but everyone was pleasant.  Close to the T, easy to get to downtown Boston.  The neighborhood is in transition, probably wouldn't want to walk around much at night, but we had no issues walking to and from the T.  Overall a nice place to stay for a reasonable price."

We talked a lot with the family about what to do in Boston, the way of life and everything and it was very interesting. I hope we could meet them soon in Boston or Paris !! See you soon !"

The room was clean and spacious,as shown in the pictures,and we had our own bathroom to use.  Our hosts were incredibly gracious and kind.  For example on two occasions Thanh's mother cooked us a Vietnamese vegetarian meal that was superb.  We laughed lots,got ready help with questions,"and even got some great tips on where to go catching Pokémon!!  We couldn't have found a better place to stay for our first AirBnB experience.\"",
10610205,91244487,2016-08-04,1516316,Amy,"I had a wonderful stay with Thanh and Curt.  They were so welcoming, kind, and thoughtful. They provided a gift card to a local cafe, great for breakfast my first morning in town. Their house is very close to the red line on the T, which made it super convenient. The room was cozy and just as advertised. I would definitely recommend their lovely home to anyone!"
10610205,94677350,2016-08-16,5642037,J.,"This spot is great and spacious! Boston has great public transportation so that is helpful. It's in a middle class vietnamese neighborhood which was like home for me! pho and bahn mi everywhere! My cousin and I shared the double bed, which was a little smaller than we realized. Oh well we slept like babies."

We really liked the location because we were able to walk everywhere, including the Freedom Trail,  Prudential Center, Newbury Street, restaurants, etc.  Their home was lovely and had everything we needed.  We couldn't have asked for a better Airbnb experience!"

"The only negative was the lockbox should have been better labeled. The apartment complex had numerous lockboxs at the entrance and and it was difficult to find the specific one we needed to access.\"",,,,,

Host was extremely responsive and accommodating. Only issues -- gym is right above master and we can hear people working out early most mornings.

3897963,22775593,2014-11-14,23293445,Meghana,"I didn't meet Ari as he was out of town, but he replied to all my messages and gave me the number of a friend who was looking after the place when he was gone. Room very very clean and open, lots of space. Bathroom is also the same. I would definately recommend this place to a friend who would be in this area of Boston."
3897963,22871997,2014-11-16,18897811,Jianbing,"Very clean and cozy room! The host is such a nice person. We were asking for hair drier in the midnight, and the host sent it to me in ten minutes.  Thank you ! We had a really pleasant time in your house!"
3897963,23284775,2014-11-27,20134870,Gina,"The room I rented was quite a pleasant.  There was tons of natural light, micro-fridge, and the bed was really comfortable. Ari was extremely responsive even though he was away when I stayed.  Also, the location is perfect. I would defintely stay there again.  Thanks Ari!"
3897963,23556370,2014-12-04,1784477,Gadi,"The place is conveniently located in a nice part of Allston, a couple of decent restaurants nearby (lookup Grasshopper and Root), good breakfast (Twin DO-Nuts), a russian market and a Wallgreens. T (tram/subway train) nearby to get into Back Bay etc. The flat itself seemed run like a guesthouse: there's a combination lock on the front door so you don't need to arrange for keys (I never met the host who was out of town, but very nice and helpful) and the other 2 rooms are occupied by temporary guests as well. You're at the back of a house, barred from the guest rooms by another combination lock. There are lots of clean towels in the hallway and a shared bathroom with a shower. I thought the place could have been cleaner: when I checked in my room's floor was dirty, waste basket not empty; there's some junk at the entrance. Shower, sink and bed were clean enough though. I was surprised to find out my room didn't have a functioning lock on the inner door; host reassured me in that he screens guests, but I found it a bit unnerving nonetheless. I had a private outside entrance but the key I found in the room didn't seem to work on either lock, so I would either have to leave it unlocked or not use it. Wifi works (more than one network available). Room had a fridge and a microwave. You won't find a cheaper option in Boston, but expect it to be a bit rough around the edges. Also, consider that if you're going to need to take a lot of cabs into Back Bay, Downtown or Cambridge, it may not be as convenient (I found it hard to find cabs there and almost missed a lecture I was giving because of it)."
3897963,24511669,2014-12-29,2603,Jenny,"The room was clean, cozy and warm -- perfect for my short stay in Boston! Check in/out was a breeze. I also appreciated that there was a mini fridge for storing food & drinks."
3897963,24692188,2015-01-01,20090194,Lindsey,"We had an excellent time staying at Ari's place. It was clean, in a good neighborhood and had its own private entrance/exit which was convenient."

3897963,29233633,2015-04-05,30047528,Elizabeth,Ari was awesome about communication and the room was perfect.   This was especially important because Ari is out of town.  He answered all my messages in a timely fashion and followed up about my check in process.
The room was very clean with sheets,towels,blankets,"a mini fridge. and a microwave. The code lock was easy to use and the room key was ideal for coming and going.  I had a great holiday weekend in Boston and thanks to Ari it didn't cost me too much!\"",,

The room was very comfortable, private, and clean, and the fridge and microwave came in handy. I shared a bathroom with other guests,  which was also quite clean. The house is easy to find, and is about a 5-10 minute walk from the Allston Street T Line stop."
3897963,31478188,2015-05-05,31363961,Ted,The combination lock is really convenient and the location is absolutely superb! And Ari has been super helpful and considerate. Overall fantastic experience!

3897963,33166808,2015-05-25,33227953,Claire,The host was very welcoming to myself and my husband. We travelled from Ireland and the host made our journey to his property very easy and had a very personal touch. He was very welcoming and informative about the area and assisted us in every way possible.
3897963,33532893,2015-05-29,29116758,Pat,"Ari is a great host and the room I occupied was great as well. Ari made every effort to ensure arrival and stay would be awesome and they were. The room is clean, roomy, organized and meets the description. The location is wonderful, the environment the best possible in Allston so there are many very positive aspects to benefit from here. The neighborhood is the leafy elegant type. I do recommend Ari and the accommodation offered."
3897963,33630602,2015-05-30,33867511,Nikolas,"I arrived exactly at 2pm as had been agreed upon. I was instantly greeted by the property keeper as the owner was away for the weekend. I was given a quick tour of the property and shown to  where my room was. The key was left in the door for me and upon opening the door, I was amazed to find more amenities than I would in a hotel room. I've been traveling heavily in the past six months and stayed at a lot of hotels; this was my first airbnb experience. I'm not sure I could have been more surprised with the quality of the room. I am very glad that I booked this room. I had a concert to attend at Brighton Music Hall which is just down the street. I was a $20.00 cab ride from the downtown district of the city as well and being able to crash at the room was exactly what I needed. There were also two desks should I want to write or work which, if I was in town to do either, would have been much appreciated. Communication was a breeze and this whole booking went off with out a hitch. When I was ready to leave, I picked up after myself and left the room as I had found it; spotless. I placed the key back in the door as I had found it and on my way out thanked the keeper as she was speaking to another group who had just arrived. Should I find myself in Alston needing a room, I'll definitely be looking to snag this one as the price was more than reasonable for the location and what was offered. Thanks again!"
3897963,33745150,2015-05-31,7008597,Wanda,"The clean and charming room matched the online pictures very well, and the A/C worked nicely. That was a great relief because I was visiting Boston on an unusually hot day. The hall bathroom had a good shower. The neighborhood was also exactly as described. I enjoyed my stay. Also, even though Ari was out of the country, he responded VERY quickly to emails/texts. A great host."
3897963,38062589,2015-07-12,5431375,Shannon,"Ari was great about communicating and check-in. He could not have made it easier. This room is great, brand new and very clean. I found the bed to be comfortable, I enjoyed the nice linens and pillows, plentiful closet and desk space, the mini fridge and microwave are very handy to have. My favorite part is having the door out to the fire escape- it was great to relax there with the door open and enjoy the summer breezes, and the neighborhood is safe enough to not worry about having an open door. Brighton is funky, lots of student housing. Walk through the neighborhood and everyone is outside on their porches chatting, playing music and relaxing. I found neighbors to be friendly. WIth the student housing, landscaping is not a priority, but who cares? Street parking is available on Cambridge street and there's only one time per week that cars need to be moved- I think Friday night/Saturday morning 12:01 a.m. until 0700."
Prior to arrival I did not realize that this is a boarding house situation,with several rooms being rented at once and one shared bath. I was dismayed at first,as I arrived late at night and the bathroom was a little dirty,but the next day it became clear it gets cleaned everyday and it was sparkling,so that was wonderful and made sharing a bath much easier. There are also nice clean towels available and a water fountain in the hallway in between the rooms. Though the fountain wasn't working there was a jug of water available there at all times. Keep in mind there is no kitchen space. Everyone there was clean and polite,"though my interactions were limited to a few \"\"Hi\"\"s and waiting for the bathroom to be free. Each room has a lock and key. I felt plenty safe."
"Overall I had a very nice experience and would certainly consider staying there again. Many thanks to Ari and his crew.\"",,,,,

I enjoyed specially the feeling of being outside the city because of the trees that are around the house. Also, it is pretty well located near from the bus stop and t station. I recommend you to stay in Ari's house :)"

3897963,50902904,2015-10-15,10898795,Chris,"Ari's place was as described; good location, clean, and quiet. It appears that he rents the home out hostel-style to AirBnBers nearly full-time, so though you may not meet Ari himself, you may meet other new folks along the way. Thanks for the stay!"

Everything was in the instructions. It was very private and I felt like I was home. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was super clean. Downstairs was kitchen, if you'd like to use. There was free coffee available which was quite nice. The place was in a very quiet residential neighborhood. There is a very nice bar less than a mile from Ari's place: Harry's Bar and Grill. I recommend you check it out. Mostly students live in the area (as is the characteristic of Boston), but it was surprisingly VERY quiet. There are plenty of food choices within walking distance. If I come back to Boston, I would love to stay at Ari's place."

Basic accomodations, but clean and well located. You won't find a better deal for a comfortable, basic place this close to downtown.

The room was nice, the bed very comfortable ! A must when you have to recover from a flight. There was a fridge and a microwave. Also, he let us leave our luggage the next day til 3pm. The only minor issue was the excessive heat from the heater when we got there. It seems unnecessary when there is nobody inside. An overall good experience, I would recommend Ari's place."

Decent amount of spots within walking distance. House is on hilly land so there's a bit of steps to climb. The place itself was clean and quiet. The bathroom was only a step or two from the room. So the bed shares a wall with said bathroom, take note if you're a really light sleeper. I personally didn't find it bothersome but y'know. Both rooms did seem to be more spacious in comparison to the photos so that was nice. The bed was fresh and really comfy, which was appreciated because I ended up spending a decent amount of time hanging in due to unlucky weather. The only thing I could've asked for was some sort of entertainment during that unexpected downtime but like I said, the listing was entirely accurate so that's no fault of the host. Overall positive stay, I'd book here again. (And okay one last thing, it probably isn't the norm but I woke up to a turkey gobbling in the backyard, only briefly before it took off to gobble through the rest of the 'hood. Which I found to be pretty funny and unexpected in the city. So, I guess I did find some entertainment.)"

The second floor bedroom was clean,comfortable,with an outdoor space and lots of windows,not fancy,but adequate for our week's stay. It had a small fridge and microwave,though we enjoyed use of the full kitchen and socializing with our friendly
3897963,73792113,2016-05-10,66059873,Allen,"Our room was exactly as pictured and was very clean and comfortable with a fridge, microwave, desks and really fast Wi-Fi.  We shared the bathroom with two or possibly three other people which was never a problem. We never actually found the kitchen so I can't speak to that. The house is in a lovely, quiet neighborhood. It's a ways from downtown Boston but only a couple blocks from the T with plenty of restaurants and pubs nearby.  We couldn't get the key to work in the private entrance but it was of no importance to us really and I'm sure since I mentioned it to Ari he will have it fixed soon because he's that kind of guy!   Although I never met him personally, Ari was my first contact with Airbnb  and he was awesome. He made several calls and text messages back and forth during the reservation process trying to make sure I was in the right spot since we were trying to be close to our daughter in Brookline. He is great to work with, very attentive and will make sure your stay is pleasant and everything is to your liking."
3897963,73953935,2016-05-11,34882531,Brett,"The room was neat and clean. The location was great. Ari wasn't there but entry couldn't have been easier. Boston was a pit stop for me on my way to Maine for a camping trip. This place made my visit affordable , comfortable , and very convenient! Highly recommended, especially for the solo traveler"
3897963,74146259,2016-05-13,4759103,Jill,Ari is so attentive to guests needs even though out of the country. Big nice room and I'll be staying there again at the end of the week.

3897963,75131582,2016-05-19,33378319,Kevin,Ari is a great host with exceptional communication skills. He is attentive to all details and places high priority on customer service. I highly recommend him for any stay in Boston.
3897963,75432892,2016-05-21,4759103,Jill,Ari is an amazing guy and host. I stayed in 2 locations of his.  At the last minute I needed an extra night and he was quick to accommodate me. His communication is awesome ( even being out of the county. His places are not far from public transportation and eating places. Combo locks on front doors and private keys on your bedrooms are a great feeling. I will be back when I visit my son at BU again.
3897963,75800000,2016-05-23,14272121,Danielle,"Ari's place was extremely clean, welcoming, and in a great location.

3897963,79618706,2016-06-13,59366011,Meredith,Very convenient location! My lyft drivers were there in less than two minutes every time and my rides to the north side were under $5.
the room was spotless. it also had a microwave and mini fridge. I had several windows and a door leading to a balcony. I had the door open for a while because it was chilly outside and it just made the room the perfect temperature. my favorite part were the sheets. so comfy!,,,,,
there were towels provided and never a wait to use the bathroom (there were a few other guests staying when I was),,,,,
"if I return to Boston I will book with Ari again. \"",,,,,
3897963,81149111,2016-06-21,75162217,Martin,Ari is fantastic at keeping in touch prior to and during your stay. The location is a very short walk from two green line stations and it doesn't take long to get into central Boston.
The room I had was great,clean,comfy and well presented.,,,
I didn't realise until I arived there were a few rooms on each floor but it made it more sociable and I met some good people.,,,,,
If you are visiting Boston and looking for somewhere in a nice part of town,"good bars nearby and transport. You'd be hard pushed to find anything better.\"",,,,
3897963,81833175,2016-06-25,33662460,Chris,"I had arranged for lodging at another Airbnb location but that reservation was abruptly cancelled about 36 hours prior to my arrival.   I had to find another location and Ari had a place available to stay.   I made the request and within a few minutes, Ari had confirmed my reservation.    This is my second stay with Ari and once again, I was pleased.   Ari makes it very easy to check in and check out.    He is very responsive to his guests."
3897963,82039698,2016-06-26,13199308,Joseph,"Ari was very attentive, always quick to reply to messages, and clearly wanted to do everything he could to make my stay a good one. The room was very cosy and comfortable and the neighbourhood was nice and quiet, but still with plenty of bars, restaurants etc. nearby. I was exhausted after a long day's travelling and both Ari and the room helped me feel better. An excellent experience all round."
3897963,95759412,2016-08-20,59080673,Wade,"I stayed at Ari's place when I was on an internship for a couple of months in Boston. Overall I really liked the place. It was clean, quiet, and spacious. The house is in a pretty quiet neighborhood and is very convenient to the metro which is nice. It's convenient to grocery stores and other shops. Ari's really nice and cares a lot about his guest's experience. If you need anything he's very available. I would definitely recommend staying here."

Directions and access were simple and she even left us wine and cookies, much appreciated treats after a long day of traveling. The bed is super comfy. Overall, I had a warm feeling of staying at a good friend's place :) I hope to return next year."
1489289,20203286,2014-09-25,4529087,Jason,"I would highly recommend this apartment and Gabriella as a host. Communication was quick and easy. She sent an excellent list of recommended spots and clear instructions ahead of time and also followed up with me to make sure that everything was going ok. The apratment is specious, comfortable, and in a great neighborhood--plenty of food and entertainment options at all ends of the scale. It was a quick trip, but would look to stay here again for a longer visit."
1489289,20367674,2014-09-28,3966957,Elizabeth,Apartment was spacious and comfortable at a great price in a beautiful neighborhood. Gabriella was excellent with communication. I would highly recommend her listing.
1489289,20981857,2014-10-08,22167191,Eleanor,Fantastic location. Very nice apartment - all clean and tidy. Gabriella provided helpful recommendations and responded very quickly to questions.
1489289,21293612,2014-10-14,20991073,Gina,We had a wonderful time! Our host was so gracious and made us feel so comfortable that we felt like we were staying at a friends home. She was easy to communicate with and super responsive. The apartment was lovely (just as pictured) and in a great neighborhood. We walked all over the city from this location.
1489289,22476948,2014-11-07,3168686,Yusi,"A wonderful stay.  Gabriella went out of her way to make the logistics easy (even when I arrived earlier than expected) and to provide a welcoming environment.  Guests arriving by car may wish to consider a parking space at the nearby Aisling B&B, which rents spaces when available for $16 per 24-hour period.  (URL HIDDEN)"
1489289,22872897,2014-11-16,23591785,Paulina,"Gabriella's lovely brownstone apartment was perfect for our one night stay in Boston! The apartment was cute, homey, very spacious and clean - exactly as pictured. The location was great and we really enjoyed the cute surrounding neighborhood - easy transport via bus from South Station, and we pretty much walked everywhere else from the apartment. This was my first time using airbnb, and from start to finish, Gabriella made our stay convenient and comfortable. We felt right at home and appreciated all of her Boston tips and recommendations. Everything went very smoothly, and we were very impressed with the whole experience overall. Gabriella was a great hostess! Thanks for everything!"
1489289,22995319,2014-11-19,18117121,Deedee,"Walking into Gabriella's apartment was a lovely combination of finding a cosy home away from home with the kind of thoughtful touches that only luxury hotels charge a lot to provide.There was a bottle of wine waiting for us with little chocolates, wineglasses, and a corkscrew.She had sent us an exhaustive set of instructions that anticipated every question we might have had to settle into the apartment and detailed notes and recommendations for everything from where to buy groceries to where to dine.  The bathroom had amenities that you might have forgotten to pack, there were plenty of towels and blankets.  And unlike some other airbnb hosts who demand that you all but clean their entire home with a toothbrush, before leaving Gabriella made our stay very stress free.  We didnt have to take out trash, or recycling or clean or change the sheets and towels before leaving  (not saying there's anything wrong with the hosts expecting their homes to be taken care of, just that Gabriella went the extra mile to make sure our stay was completely stress free and comfortable).  There are magazines fanned out on the coffee table, a snuggly couch with a plush blanket to nap on, and a well cabled TV and videos to entertain yourself with , should you choose to stay in instead of visiting the lovely restaurants in the neighborhood.  Overall a gracious and delightful host with a comfortable, aesthetically pleasing home that I can recommend highly.  The only slight hitch was that phone connectivity was poor.  But it depends on the carrier you have I guess.  My husband's phone worked fine, but mine had no signal.  But if you arent planning to take endless conference calls, its not a very big inconvenience.  The wireless worked well for web connectivity and we went outside the apartment to order pizza or call home."
1489289,24698379,2015-01-01,2803028,M A,Gabriella was an extremely responsive host. She offered valuable suggestions on parking and things to do in the area. She even left us a bottle of wine and chocolates. Very sweet!!

1489289,25528290,2015-01-18,14139455,Stacey,We loved our time at Gabriella's place.  The neighborhood was beautiful and the apartment was nice and quiet.  It was easy to access with a lockbox and I was glad that we had a flexible checkin/checkout time.  The square is tree lined and will be absolutely beautiful in spring.  Gabriella had left us a warm note and some generous and delicious gifts on arrival.  We will definitely be back!
1489289,29709898,2015-04-11,1655966,Adette,"Gabriella was a great hostess. Her recommendations were incredible; we still can't stop talking about the amazing food at Toro! The apartment was clean and well-kept, and the neighborhood was adorable. Will definitely recommend her place to anyone that's looking for a nice visit to Boston outside all the usual touristy stuff."
1489289,30255002,2015-04-19,26833942,Bryn,Gabriella's flat is very much as described and very comfortable.  Although she was away for most of my stay she had left detailed instructions and suggestions to make the most of the stay.  The welcoming beer was much appreciated.
South End of Boston is an interesting developing area but like all inner city areas care is needed particularly after dark.,,,,,

1489289,31207213,2015-05-03,5291144,Mary,My host made me feel welcome by sending me detailed information about the apartment and about things to do in Boston. She responded quickly to my emailed questions.  She left us two bars of chocolate and a bottle of wine. The apartment is very spacious.

Gabriella was quick on responding, left super specific instructions to find and access the residence and gave an awesome guide to eating, drinking and seeing Boston. Being foodies, we already had plans for a Toro, but the other suggestion (blunch, el centro and the Vietnamese place) were all top notch and literally at your doorstep. We walked all around (be smart of course) and never felt unsafe."
As far as the apartment itself,we needed nothing! Everything was provided and she left us a nice bottle of wine (that we are sad we didn't have time to drink) and chocolates upon our arrival. Place was very clean,bed cozy and couch was comfy for our afternoon breaks from walking/eating :) There's a ton of movies and HBO.

The bedroom is a nice size and had a fan to help keep us cooled off during some of the hottest days in Boston!,,,,,
Gabriella provided us with a list of things to do in Boston and restaurants near the apartment.  We went to 3 of the restaurants them during our stay (1 of them twice!) and were not disappointed!  It was nice to know where to find places around the apartment so we could grab a bite in the morning or after a long day of touring Boston.  Her place is conveniently situated,it is within walking distance of the Prudential Center and on a bus line to take you to/from the airport or South Station.,,,,

This is one of my favorite areas of the city - so near lots of public transit,galleries,theaters,and great restaurants. The location was absolutely perfect.,,
Gabriella described her place really well. There are no stairs to lug your bags up and there is a beautiful square right outside the apartment with a fountain. When she says first floor apartment,I didn't think to recognize that meant windows right on the street. In a neighborhood of three and four story buildings,that meant very little natural light.,,,
I so appreciative how communicative and accommodating Gabriella was during my entire visit; she was even kind when I accidentally broke something and had to let her know.,,,,,
The last great thing I'll add is the closest city bikeshare station is a few blocks away so,if you're a biker,"you can get basically anywhere from here. I biked all over town!\"",,,

Her house is very close to Andrew station. The room at the third floor is clean and very comfortable with WIFI and small TV. It is very convenient to travel every places in Boston. I would love to stay here again next year.
5054601,30807078,2015-04-27,7447041,Thijs,"Manuela was very helpful, although we didn't actually meet. The room itself was ok, but the house and neighborhood was quite trashy. Boston is an expensive city, so don't know if you can find a more decent place for this value, but wouldn't book it again."
5054601,31129101,2015-05-02,5030155,Lutfiyah,1. Room was as described.
2. Parking was available and free. It was their private parking spot available to renters/guests.,,,,,
3. Towels provided.,,,,,
4. Communal shower shared with another room on the third floor.,,,,,
5. At the time of my stay,other residents were undergrad/grad students renting the other rooms (for me that usually makes me feel strangely safe and optimistic).,,,,
6. Has the 'this old house' with the narrow creaky warped stairs and well worned ballister that I have come to enjoy.,,,,,
7. I did not use public transportation during my stay but if I did,it is literally right across the street.,,,,

5054601,32556417,2015-05-19,31587276,Daniele,"Manuela is very hospitable. She is interested in why her guests are in town and likes to learn more about them and the programs they're part of. The accommodations were exactly what I needed - private room, shared bathroom and kitchen, a place to park - and she even bought fruit for snacking."
5054601,32789376,2015-05-21,2437612,Nadav,"Manuela was fantastic and made me feel at home immediately. Room is great in general and also for the price. The red line is literally right across the st so it's 7 min to downtown. If your looking for a perfect, quiet and affordable place this is it."
5054601,33019971,2015-05-24,30109064,Blake,"The space is well cared for and comfortable for one person. Proximity to public transportation is prime. Manuela was a most hospitable host whose ambition to accommodate amply, soothingly surpasses that of a pedestrian Boston hotelier."
5054601,33576173,2015-05-30,12638493,Whitney,"Manuela was an absolutely lovely host. Her house is on an older, historic block so it has a lot of character. Located right across the street from the subway station, very convenient. Room was exactly as pictured. Spacious with a sloped ceiling and plenty of storage space. Access to shower and kitchen right down the hall. Boutique style shampoos and soaps provided in the bathroom. Would happily stay here again!!"
5054601,34435172,2015-06-08,1430513,Meme,"I stayed briefly with Manuela for a conference at the Convention Center. Manuela runs an international house, which despite the initial appearances, is very classically so. The location is quite convenient, right next to the T Andrew station, though I have decided I am not a super fan of the transit system in Boston. I was able to walk to everywhere that I needed to travel to in about 30 min."
But that aside,"Manuela is very nice in letting me check in early after my red eye flight and made sure I had everything I needed. The room is simple but the bed was comfortable and clean and the room was very spacious. \"",,,,

The house is unbelievably close to the Red Line T-stop, which makes it very convenient.  My room faced the station, however, so there was a lot of street noise (at night on Saturday and in the morning on weekdays.  There was a mix-up (I didn't stay in the \"\"downtown view\"\" room)"
5054601,36245121,2015-06-26,36359391,Edwin,The room was clean and in a good location. The host was very hospitable and nice.

My son aged at 11 loves her house.Everything is perfect as Manuela is very nice and thoughtful and her location is convenient and safe for all of things. She always kept caring responsible for us. I'd strongly recommend her house as your first choice in Boston! Pleasant staying in Boston! Thank you very much, Manuela!"
5054601,39431642,2015-07-23,28237600,Xiangjun,"Manuela is a such nice and patient host. It is very hot in the first night. I even can't fall asleep. She put 3 fans in the room to help me cool down which is considerate. And the next day, she installed an air condition in the room. That is really helpful. It helps me have a wonderful sleep in the following night. And the house has a excellent location. one minute walk to the subway station! And that area is very safe. Thanks for your helps!"
5054601,40538077,2015-07-31,36663351,Ramin,The room was very clean had a fan and also AC a nice desk with lamp. Everything was great. Manuela has been one of the best hosts I have stayed with. the location is also good close to south end and downtown Boston and the apartment is literally right next to the train station.

That was very considerate. She also accommodated a late check out! She really seems to care a lot about her guests schedules, which was really wonderful!"
The room was confortable,"with wall A/C which worked excellently. I slept perfectly. I didn't hear any noise from other guests. \"",,,,
5054601,49493731,2015-10-04,43642881,Matt,Affordable and excellent location. Very easy to get to downtown Boston any time of day or night. Being across from the T station made this place perfect for my trip. Manuela was extremely helpful and accommodating. Window AC was great when it was hot the first night.
The neighborhood is not the nicest and the house is showing its age a bit,"but it beats paying 3-4 times as much for other (and less convenient) places around town. \"",,,,
5054601,53044312,2015-11-04,29125355,Andi,"I stayed at Manuela's for a month and it was a really excellent experience. The red line access (subway) was as good as it could get, and Manuela went out of her way to make sure I had everything I needed the entire stay."
5054601,53604608,2015-11-10,27357560,Samantha,"Manuela was very accommodating! I had a late flight in, and she welcomed me once I arrived. Her place was very clean and located walking distance to public transportation, food, and some bars. I would recommend staying with Manuela."
5054601,53790070,2015-11-12,48348916,Luis,"Manuela's place was cozy, clean and very accessible to/from public transportation. I stayed with her two nights, the bathroom was clean and had enough supplies, the kitchenette had the necessary elements for a two night stay. Manuela was very friendly and accommodating, she allowed me to stay for a couple of hours more because it was raining really bad on my check-out date."
5054601,54155165,2015-11-16,31587276,Daniele,"Great location.  If you come by car, there's a place to park, and if you take public transportation, it's about a 15 second walk from the Red line.  Manuela is very hospitable and kind (she bought me some fruit for breakfast), and she has led an interesting life and it's fun talking with her.  She's both interesting and interested.  This was my second time here, and if I find myself in town again, I'd come back."
5054601,63911243,2016-02-28,29112036,D.P.,"Manuela did everything to make my stay very pleasant.  She was attentive to details, very friendly and communicative. The room was spacious, comfortable, very clean.  I'm grateful for her hospitality and kindness."
5054601,65496927,2016-03-15,50101606,Janos,"\"Manuela is a nice, open and friendly woman. During my stay, I was always out all day, so we didn't have the chance for much contact, but I felt very welcome. The Room I've been was bigger than I had expected, but I only used the Bed anyway. There is a shared Bathroom and a shared kitchen. Nothing is to fancy, it is simple but clean. Best thing is obviously price and location. The red line is really just in front of your door, so you're downtown within just a couple of minutes. The little grocery store just on the other side of the street maybe doesn't have the biggest range of goods, but it should be enough for vacation. And only a five minute walk away there is a bigger store. South Boston is not the most shiny part of the city, but it's no dark corner either. Good old working class. One thing you might pre-check: I'm about 6\"\"2 and the bed was a bit to small when I would lay down straight. I didn't say anything because I sleep in somewhat of a fetal position"
5054601,66261643,2016-03-20,21986792,Samudra,"Room was OK. Host was very nice, bathroom next to room was well-stocked. Very quiet and comfy."

5054601,71289179,2016-04-24,49479812,Alain-Christian,I felt at home as soon as I walked in. It's unlike anything I've ever felt when staying at a motel or hotel. I was in Boston for a convention and when it was time to leave I would tell my friends I was leaving to go home.
The location is amazing; literally ACROSS THE STREET from the train station! You can go ANYWHERE from here. There's also plenty of Uber drivers around. The wait is about 3-10 minutes.,,,,,
Big spacious room. Very private. Free Wi-Fi. You can totally decompress in here.  And the surrounding neighborhood is full of super friendly and neighborly people. City folk,don't forget to greet the neighbors when you pass them by. It's okay!,,,,
"Overall a wonderful experience. I never got to meet my host but that's because of the weird hours I kept. She was gracious over texts and very accommodating to my needs. I can't wait to return to Boston. I will definitely book here again!\"",,,,,
5054601,73079309,2016-05-06,64195381,Stephen,"The description of this space is misleading - it is in a tough part of South Boston where you have to throw an occasional glance over your shoulder at night. It is nowhere near a beach and no park is in sight. The back yard did provide a distant view of downtown Boston, but to see it, you have to look past a backyard that is better described as a junkyard."
The room is spartan,with only a small desklamp and TV with no cable. The hostess was responsive when I arrived late the first night,but was invisible after that. There had to be 5 or 6 other tenants living in the same building,coming and going at odd times of the day. The exterior,is depressing as is the street. I would be a bit more charitable at $50/night,but at $85/night
5054601,76110730,2016-05-24,166853,Robert,"Great trip to Boston and Manuela was perfect.   Room was exactly as described, large, very clean, and quiet.  Getting up to the room on the third floor does have a rather narrow steep staircase - nothing extreme but if someone has issues with stairs this could be a challenge.  Very close to the Red Line of the T with open parking near by.  While running around to most places in Boston you will want to take public transit, being able to park a car in an area without permit restrictions was very helpful."
Linens and towels were new and clean.  Room locks and included a desk,closet,chair,and drawers for clothes etc.,,
"The layout of the house was very private and didn't need to run into anyone coming and going.\"",,,,,

7996844,46518535,2015-09-11,41301875,Anthony,"Great location, uncomplicated host. Very old building so some user flexibility with the installations/hardware is needed. As a first time AirB user I wondered whether the &B ( i.e. Breakfast) is customarily included?"
7996844,46822967,2015-09-13,26869131,Michael,"Arthur's room on Charles St. was exactly as advertised, freshly cleaned, and gracefully offered.  The location is terrific for access to MGH, downtown, the T, and more.  This is a great location and having stayed in several other AirBnB rooms in Boston, I'd say it's a good bargain!"
7996844,47755103,2015-09-21,28067767,Morgan,"The location is extremely convenient as it's only a short walk to the Red line and nearby shops, restaurants, and downtown. I didn't get to see Arthur much, but he was still welcoming and helpful, and my stay was very relaxed."
7996844,48107700,2015-09-23,4702187,Thomas,Very well situated flat in Beacon Hill on Charles Streeton the Black Heritage trail. Arthur is welcoming and made us feel at home.

7996844,48903353,2015-09-29,11067560,Maggie,"Arthur was a great and accommodating host.  I felt completely comfortable asking him any questions I had.  When we were concerned about getting the keys, Arthur went about and beyond and overnighted the keys to me in Illinois so my plans in Boston would not be interrupted.  That was amazing!"
The neighborhood of Arthur's place could not be more perfect!  It is in the center of everything!  My husband and I felt completely safe and were able to walk everywhere.  Arthur provided us with great recommendations for places to visit.,,,,,
Because Arthur's place is in Beacon hill and in an older building,you need to be flexible with your expectations.  The stairs up to the second floor are steep and narrow,the floorboards creak,and the layout of the apartment is consummate with an old building - and I loved everything about it because I think this all added to its charm.,,
Arthur was super friendly although we did not see him very often.  I would definitely stay here again.,,,,,

Everything is close & easy, be it shopping, sightseeing, transportation & dinning. If ur young and don't mind getting up and down some pretty intense stairways (i would only imagine the same situation for all of the apartments on Beacon Hill since Beacon Hill is a historic site). Arthur is a reliable landlord who free u from worrying about travelling emergencies like change of schedule and forgetting to pack a hair dryer"

It's on the second floor, the stairs are pretty steep and narrow, not the easiest with the luggage. The room itself is actually much nicer than the pictures, really spacious and the bed was very comfy! It is a little bare, there was no mirror, bin or night stand but there are just minor things. I didn't see too much of Arthur but when I did he was friendly and gave me a couple of tips on where to eat, directions etc. Overall brilliant, would definitely stay again!"

It was easy to take the T or just walk to anywhere I wanted to go on my trip (BU, Cambridge, Theater District, Esplanade, Boston Common). Even more importantly, it was great to have a comfortable and welcoming place to return to each night. The neighborhood is quaint but still vibrant, and the apartment is an eclectic haven. Arthur is a personable and generous host who is an absolute pleasure to get to know! Overall, my stay at Arthur's exceeded my already high expectations."

7996844,69118891,2016-04-09,4558941,Marc,"Arthur is an awesome guy and has a great place located in Beacon Hill.  Hotels in Boston are often very expensive so Arthur's place was a good value. Keep in mind the place is basic, but the bed was nice, the internet was good, and the room had a desk/chair/screen combo to get some work done. The bathroom is shared between everyone (three total bedrooms), but I didn't run into any issues in using/sharing it."

The place was very clean. Even though Arthur was not there until the last day of our stay, his friend who was there to house sit was very welcoming, offering us wine and giving recommendations for places to go out. When we met Arthur he made sure to welcome us even though he had just gotten back from a late night of travel. Kitchen and other amenities were very accessible and I felt like we had everything we needed."
Arthur also sent us an email with a lot of good restaurant recommendations and suggestions for getting around town. We followed some of his suggestions and they worked out great!,,,,,

You're steps away from the start of the freedom trail and within walking distance to most attractions. The apartment itself is fine, but simple and bare bones in its furnishings. Reminded me of a college students apartment. It's an old building in need of repairs though, we didn't have hot water for the first 24+ hours of our stay because the water heaters in the building were broken. Made it really inconvenient to shower, but Emma was really responsive in contacting the building super and providing updates on what was going on."
Overall,a good place to stay if you're going to be sightseeing and aren't looking for luxe accommodations,and if you don't mind being in a loud,"busy part of the city. \"",,
13152370,90517281,2016-08-01,26758498,Jonathan,Emma was a great host who communicated all important details. Instructions for entry were clear with multiple sets of keys. The location is perfect for the Freedom Trail and walkable to Back Bay. T stop right across the street. Several coffee shops and convenience stores right around the corner.

13152370,94530112,2016-08-16,32366948,Reine,Nous avons passé un très agréable séjour dans cet appartement propre et lumineux.
Les fenêtres du salon et de la 1ere chambre donnent sur le parc et la Massachusetts State House et la vue en effet est splendide. Notez que la 2e chambre est à l'arrière et n'a pas de fenêtre mais elle donne sur la pièce principale.,,,,,
La cuisine et la salle de bain sont bien équipées,bien propres et pratiques.,,,,
Emma a été très précise et claire et parfaitement réactive.,,,,,
Voyageant avec une personne âgée,j'ai choisi cet emplacement pour qu'elle se sente bien lors de ses périodes de repos et profite de la belle vue,et que le reste de la famille puisse découvrir le centre de Boston à pied. Ce fut parfait.,,,
Si vous êtes plus nombreux,il y a un autre appartement dans le même immeuble qui fut pour nous une extension bien utile.,,,,

"Our first night at the apartment we walked out without taking the key. Emma answered the phone right away and had someone there in 5 minutes to let us back into the apartment! Every time I sent her a email or text meaasge I couldn't believe how fast she got back to me. \"",,,,,

Worked perfect for us, family of 3 in Boston for marathon and 5K. The house had everything we needed and it was very comfortable and inviting. Address easy to find and check in/out instructions easy to follow. Small grocery store/coffee shop in the proximity, Whole Foods and eating places (we especially enjoyed dining one night at The Haven, great craft beers, melting-in-your-mouth salmon and delicious veggie options. Highly recommend this place!)."

The area was lovely and so convenient to the T Line. This was our first trip to Boston and Alexis helped us figure out public transportation and had lots of recommendations for great places to eat. Really enjoyed our stay and hope to stay again in the future!!

The Jamaica Plain neighborhood has some amazing restaurants (Ten Tables, The Haven, El Oriental De Cuba, Sorella's, & Blue Nile). Plus it's easy to hop on the T and get to the middle of the city."
Though we didn't get to meet her in real life,Alexis was great at communicating what we needed to know leading up to the trip and answer questions during our trip. We had a great time!,,,,

Everything was perfect from the location, decor, hospitality, comfort, delicious snacks to the small detail  of a nozzle on the hair dryer!  The only thing that my stay lacked was more time.  I have been telling everyone that will listen about the little Gem.  I will be back for a personal stay soon."

She was out of town during our stay but her roommate was nice and asked if we needed anything. The location is great, just a 5-10 minute walk to a main subway line. The room is as pictured. The common areas could have been a bit cleaner but overall I would recommend."
14246616,92659456,2016-08-09,66610399,Ashley,"The space was perfect for what we wanted and the price; a clean bed, towels and bathroom.

If cleanliness is extremely important to you then this place might not be the best option for you. Although we didn't see her as much, Ashley was very nice and explained everything to us upon our arrival."

Becky was extremely helpful all through the booking process, throughout the stay and even after when we left a bag at her place due to storage constraints. I highly recommend her place to future travelers."
250983,1170633,2012-04-23,2044876,Heather,"I stayed in Becky's apartment for a girls weekend in Boston, and it was the perfect place. The tempurpedic bed was lovely to sleep in, her cats were very affectionate, but stayed mostly out of our way. The roof deck was a great bonus. Easy street parking, and walking distance to the restaurants and shops of JP. I would highly recommend this apartment for a visit to Boston."
250983,1369670,2012-05-29,492046,Arti,"We stayed at Becky's place for 5 days last month. My husband and I were getting married in the area, and needed a place for his family to stay. It was just perfect! The house easily accommodated 5 adults (2 bedrooms + air bed), with two young adults sleeping on the sectional couch in the living room. We loved the decor and feel of the place as well, and the roofdeck was a big bonus! Not to mention that Becky was very friendly and helpful throughout. Thanks Becky!"
250983,1558558,2012-06-25,2500844,Jeff,"We were first time Airbnb users and just got back from our trip to Boston.  Although we didn't meet Becky, she was very helpful and prompt in answering questions prior to our trip.  We were a group of six and had plenty of room to sleep.  The apartment is only a short walk to the green subway line which brings you right into downtown.  The roof top deck is awesome, there is parking on the street and Fenway is only two miles away.  All in all, we had a blast and would definitely use Airbnb again."

My wife, my kids and I loved the place, the cats, as well as the quiet, clean, and warm environment. Also it was located in a very nice neighborhood, with access to public transportation, nice restaurants, and grocery stores. We are happy to recommend this place. We are planning to come back!"

You are so thoughtful...And I have to say sorry for our stupid mistake of locking ourselves out of the apartment…we must have bothered you a lot…
250983,1899351,2012-08-06,2413437,Miriam,"Becky is definitely a most interesting person. Her two bedroom condo is comfortable on the 3rd floor. Air conditioning was appreciated, she has a rooftop balcony & another one off the kitchen. It is in a multicultural neighborhood we felt adeq'ly safe in. We enjoyed a feast at a cuban restaurant around the corner called Miami which was not expensive & she left all kinds of other listings for us from which to choose. She has two cats who are very well behaved. It is a lovely place w/beautiful kitchen & bathroom spaces & ample bedrooms for 4(two couples), a living room which provided community space for us to eat & visit & quaintly & artfully appointed with her many interests. We recommend her for future stays & we would consider coming back when next in JP. (Thanks Becky!)"

The location was excellent, the building quiet, and the neighborhood safe. I was also able to get access to parking from Paige (the host) for only $20 a night on an alleyway adjacent to the unit which was super clutch."
The host was responsive to any issues that I had,and was accommodating in providing a late checkout. The unit is pet-friendly,and a very good option for dog owners given the unit's access to the parkland on Comm Ave and by the river,and very dog-friendly neighborhood.,,
I would imagine for most travelers that they would be quite pleased with this property.,,,,,
With all of that said,I need to provide a few words or warning,which may be relevant to some but not to others,depending on the kind of traveller you are.,,
1) This is very clearly a unit that a permanent inhabitant does not live in,"and therefore lacks many of the \"\"creature comforts\"\" of a home. There is no art or other \"\"charm\"\" piece",the kitchen only has a minimal number of cooking utensils,and there isn't a whole lot of furniture and pillows.,,
2) If you are looking for a professional cooking situation,look elsewhere. The kitchen was functional but very very tiny,"and the fridge is in the living room. \"",,,

We also had rented a car and she was able to provide us a spot close by for $30 a night. Place was neat and clean. It's great for a few nights stay.

Two of us stayed,one in the bedroom and one in the living room on a comfortable air mattress. The apartment is clean and basic,one floor up and looking out onto Mass. Ave. There is a convenience store next door so you can easily pick up food,drinks,soap,and anything else you might need.

The only issue I had was the heat and hot water not working one of the mornings (I stayed for most of a week). Paige was very quick to respond though and it was fixed by the time I returned later that day. Definitely worth the stay. Overall it was a great experience!"

The biggest issue we had was they decided to sell the place.  So they constantly had brokers coming in and out of the place.  We weren't really bothered when they gave us notice so we could lock up our dogs if we were going to be away although over our two week stay it seemed like they needed to get into the place every couple of days at least.,,,,,
It was a big problem when they unlocked the door without knocking and no notice was given twice over two days to show the place.  The first time I was home and told them they couldn't come in because we weren't prepared for them,not a huge deal.,,,,
The second time my wife was home and our dogs got out of the apartment.  The brokers,didn't really show any concern and just barged in and started showing it as my wife ran down the stairs trying to catch them.,,,,
"Like I said Paige was awesome which is the only reason I gave it two stars and not one but the constant need for brokers to come in and the rudeness of the last couple of times really was off putting.\"",,,,,

I would definitely recommend this place!
8670336,67441875,2016-03-29,55265871,Jessica,"The location of this place is great, which is only about 6 min walking distance from the Hynes convention center. The deli is just next door if you want quick snacks and drinks. The beds and sheets are clean. As stated, there are doors in the living room which can act like another room. The light bulb in the living room died when we arrived but we helped to change it ourselves since there was a spare. The kitchen is basically a corner but it is useful to have one if you need to heat up something real quick."
If mirror is important to you (eg. convention goers),there is only one tiny full size mirror and a super high mirror both are in the bathroom. Since we have 4 people it was quite difficult to cram into a small bathroom. The up-side,there is no shortage of hot water,maybe too hot! The equipments provided were minimal so I would bring your own (eg. hair dryer/styler),,

Two units are across the hall from each other giving us lots of options for movie in one unit with games and conversation at the same time in the other.

The only few downfalls were that there was some kind of renovating in the apartment next door so we had power tools waking us up quite early and water shut offs.

Only things I'd mention are: the apt is on a very busy street and the traffic can be heard late night and early morning especially in the bedroom (a fan would be good to provide as white noise), kitchen is really small, the lights for the bathtoom/kitchen were not an easy find but Paige was great at letting me know where they were, and that's it.

I do understand that the rate for this place is lower than many in this neighborhood and took that into consideration upon review, but the concerns/hassles far outweighed the benefits.  I messaged the owner 5 days prior to arrival to ask if there was any parking included, and there was no response in next 2 days.

It seems like maybe prices are much higher in Boston than in other cities,so maybe that's the problem? But we were a little bit disappointed with this rental. For the price we paid,small issues like cold rooms,"the \"\"T\"\" station being much further away than the ad had led us to believe",a kitchen that was missing a few key things (like salt & pepper,sugar
On the plus side,the apartment is very cute,there's a full fridge & oven,and the hosts are very nice with super cute kids! I'm just not sure I would stay here again.,,

Only downfall was the distance into main Boston as public transport wasn't as quick as we had hoped. Perfect location if you have a car though! Beautiful and quiet neighborhood outside Boston. Gena and Leon were excellent hosts and very accommodating with heating and transport ideas.

We were in town for the Boston Marathon, used AirBNB for the first time, and couldn't have asked for a better place to stay.  We are from California, so the temp was a bit cold for us, but the space heater worked great, and warmed up the entire unit."

this was a lovely apartment.. cozy but open with plenty of light.. no crampiness.. tho we flipped on the a/c a couple times the ceiling fan in the bedroom and open windows was generally enough to keep a comfortable temperature.. and the neighborhood is great for kids..,,,,,
roslindale village is cute,close,and has everything one may need..  takes a little while to get to downtown boston,but taking a bus to the T is super easy.. or taking a nice walk thru the arboretum (just under two miles) is quite pleasant..,,
tho i only saw them a couple times gena and leon were very nice!! it's obvious they've been doing this for awhile.. they had a very helpful packet of local info,transit,internet,etc  waiting on the table.. and our kids made crazy sidewalk chalk art together.. good fun..,,

Leon was great, very friendly and full of good recommendations for nearby restaurants and things to do (arboretum is in walking distance!) We had our own car so could get around quite easily.

Leon welcomed us and led us to the 3rd floor of the house. We knew directly that we would spend a comfortable stay. Photos don’t lie, it’s clean, towels and linens at our disposal, and temperature of the apartment was perfect and the 3rd floor is offering a great view."
We had the car,and we drove to go in town for the day,25 minutes max. Use Parking Finder to find good deals,we found several around 10 or 12$ for the day! At night,we used Ubber and the max we paid (to go to Cambridge) was 20$!,

The apartment was a bit too warm, though it was unusually hot in Boston the week we stayed.  We think coming in September - June would probably be perfect, though the summer months would still be fine for those who choose to truly visit the city.

While I did not stay in the room myself, I felt great knowing that my parents had a nice place to rest in a beautiful house."
The room is spacious and has all of the basic things you need (bed,desk,closet). They are converting the walk in closet in the room to a bathroom,which would just make this room the ultimate space.,,
The best part of my parents' stay was certainly the hospitality they felt from both Elizabete and Helder. Elizabete went above and beyond to make them feel comfortable (from hanging out and having a glass a wine,to listening to music,or just chatting). She even drove them to the airport since she was on her way over there.,,,

The apartment itself was beautiful,very tastefully done up and a highlight in itself during our stay in Boston. The location was amazing with everything at walking distance (Quincy Market,Hanover street,City tours,water front).,
Rachel was extremely considerate in what was provided to us. We never had to ask or look for anything. She had told us everything in advance regarding where to find what.,,,,,
I bugged her with many questions before arrival but she very patiently answered all my questions.,,,,,
Our trip to Boston was a memorable one,and Rachel's kindness and her apartment were a huge factor.,,,,
"I would definitely recommend staying at Rachel's apartment if you are travelling to Boston.\"",,,,,
6971836,37403975,2015-07-06,1693721,Tom,Everything was perfect.  Check in/out were both easy.  The place was very clean and comfortable.  Location is great!  Many great restaurants nearby.  Parking at nearby public lot was convenient.  We rented bikes from just around the corner - perfect for touring around Boston.
6971836,41839373,2015-08-09,25559913,Alia,"Rachel's apartment is fantastic! She has a beautiful kitchen, large bathroom and extremely comfortable bed! The apartment was as described - very chic, beautiful décor - I loved the photographs on the walls and it was also very clean.  The location could not be better, in the centre of Boston's North End.   It is very easily accessible to many of Boston's major attractions:  Faneuil Hall, The Freedom Trail, Boston Common, TD Gardens, Boston Harbour, the Aquarium, the T line (subway) among many other things."
Check-in went smoothly.  We did not get to meet Rachel,however her friend Jen was very nice and accommodating when we were 30mins later then we had originally planned.,,,,
Rachel was available to answer a few questions we had once we got there via email which was very appreciated.,,,,,
Free street parking in the area is mostly residential - we found a lot that was $15 after 5pm until 6am and $27 for the day.  Pretty pricy but that was to be expected when you're staying in that part of the city.,,,,,
"We had a fantastic time at Rachel's and would highly recommend staying here!\"",,,,,
6971836,44233093,2015-08-24,30377757,Marco,"From arrival to departure it was an absolute pleasure staying at Rachel home!  Not only was Rachel's home beautifully decorated, but it was perfectly situated in the city with access to great restaurants, grocery stores and easy access to the 'T'."
"I would defiantly recommend staying at Rachel's home.   \"",,,,,
6971836,44977757,2015-08-30,12461880,Juliet,"My daughter and I spent two days here as a gift from me for her 16th birthday. We wanted something different than a hotel room, and were very pleased to find this listing. The apartment is decorated very nicely, and up-to-date. It is clear that Rachel likes and appreciates contemporary furnishings. The bed is very comfortable, and her small but complete kitchen has everything you need (even though we ate out the entire time). I do need my requisite coffee in the mornings and there was a Keurig. Perfect. My daughter and I shared the bed (it was a queen, perfectly large enough) and enjoyed lounging in the living room when our feet just couldn't walk another step. There is a big flat screen TV which we never turned on. The bathroom is large and has a tub/shower, and the water pressure just fine. You can open windows to let in fresh air (her apt faces out over the atrium, which I thought was perfect since there was less noise on that side)."
The most important part of this listing is its location: Commercial Street runs along the perimeter of the North End and at its end runs into Atlantic just across from the Faneuil Hall area. The waterfront,the docks,the ferries,the water taxis,are all so close,as are parking garages (we never used our car except to get us into town and then out of town). We walked the Waterfront Walk and enjoyed the Greenway immensely. You can pick and choose if you want to get caught up in the tourist action or simply pretend you live there and hang out on the grassy park areas and enjoy the briny smells of the ocean. It's cooler here too
It's true,The Golden Goose convenience market does have anything you need,and it's just to the right outside the entrance to her building. We let ourselves in and out with a key. As for restaurants the choice can be overwhelming,as Rachel lives a couple blocks away from the famous Italian eateries in the North End. Between seafood and pasta there is PLENTY to eat!,,
For my daughter's and my visit to Beantown this was the perfect place to hang our hats. The waterfront has become a lively and beautiful part of the city since they put the highway underground,and even though I lived in the city for years a while back this section is still new to me,and has become a wonderful,well planned series of green spaces,fountains,benches and trees for all to enjoy.
There were some very minor things I thought Rachel could improve upon but nothing worth mentioning here.,,,,,

It was very comfortable and beautifully decorated, definitely an example of what makes staying in a Airbnb such a better experience than a standard hotel. The place was surrounded by little shops where we could grab some bread, cheese, and a bottle of wine and just relax in between our sightseeing. Perfect for the girls' weekend we were looking for. Rachel was generous enough to even leave us a bottle of champagne to celebrate our arrival!"
Rachel was easy to coordinate with and made checkin and checkout very simple for us. At one point we had a little trouble with the internet,but Rachel responded right away and was able to have the service provider fix the issue immediately.,,,,
The neighborhood is fantastic,we were close to many of the places that we were looking forward to visiting - Neptune Oyster,Mike's Pastries,"Paul Revere's House. We were walking distance to the T so could get anywhere else in the city that we needed. We were very happy with our stay and would highly recommend this place.\"",,

Getting there from the airport was a breeze on the T (Aquarium stop). I couldn't recommend this place more."
6971836,54972735,2015-11-27,6071392,Lissie,"Rachel's place is perfectly located to explore Boston, it was really quick to get back to after a day exploring. The bed is very comfortable, and it is much nicer to have your own space to relax in than staying in a small hotel room. Rachel responded quickly to any questions we had. I would recommend this if you choose to stay in Boston - there are great restaurants nearby and the location couldn't be better."
7575052,41549788,2015-08-07,18286028,Scott,Had a short but great stay at Glenn's unit. Simple but very clean and comfortable and a perfect downtown walking location.  Easy check-in and out and quiet building

The apartment was very convenient, perfectly sized for two travelers, and immaculately clean (but still cozy).  We were warmly greeted with an early check-in (arranged via text with an extremely responsive host) and were given a quick and informative orientation to the area. Although short, we enjoyed our stay immensely."

It was very cold the weekend we spent at the Airbnb so it was great to have a nice place when the cold became too much to bare. We didn't have any issues and would gladly stay at Glenn's apartment again!"
7575052,66875416,2016-03-25,48479809,Char,Glenn and Kevin were most helpful in accommodating our arrival time as we had to adjust a little.  The apartment was a perfect place for us while attending a conference at the nearby Sheraton with the kitchen amenities of a real coffee maker & toaster. The description of the apartment and pictures are accurate. It's a real gem on the price and location if you're in the Back Bay area. Would definitely stay there again.
7575052,73715472,2016-05-09,69820337,Jennifer,"Glenn and Kevin (who we met at the apartment) were very responsive to communication and were flexible with our request to check out late.  The apartment was great- spacious, clean, good location with lots of restaurants around.  Would not hesitate to stay here again if back in the area."
7575052,75249583,2016-05-20,40077700,Emily,"Glenn's place was great! Although we didn't directly meet him, we were in contact with Kevin and Vivian, who were very helpful and easy to communicate with . The place was very clean and it fits 3 ppl very nicely. All the utilities were great and available, and the location was very convenient to get to Hynes and Copley and all the downtown places by t. We definitely enjoyed our stay there and I would definitely consider staying there again when I'm bringing 2-3 ppl along to Boston."

Glenn even provided a pack & play for our one year old, which was a HUGE bonus and made our stay really comfortable."
7575052,80250618,2016-06-17,56438945,Alex,"Glenn and Kevin were the best. The unit is amazing, at one of the unique locations in Boston. Easy to get in, easy to find and very easy to communicate with the owners. The unit is even better then the descriptions. Best place for a small business trip (my case) or even a touristic time to enjoy Boston. I'll recommend to all! Many thanks Glenn and Kevin for the great week."

Kevin, who was hosting us at the time, was very friendly and made sure we were all set before letting us on our way. We will definitely stay her again!"
7575052,93958786,2016-08-14,26396664,Agnita,Glenn's apartment is a comfortable place in a real Bostonian neighborhood. We stayed 4 nights and it felt like home right away. The kitchen is fully equipped and the bed is comfortable. Communication has been easy and Glenn responded quickly!

9496337,58913287,2016-01-05,15069258,Lin,Alfredo's room is big and bright. His roommates are friendly.  Harvard business school is just 5 minutes by walk and Harvard Square is also not far from there. His apartment is not far from downtown. There is a bus stop nearby and can take you directly to metro station. The neighborhood feels very safe during daytime and at night. I would definitely recommend to stay in his apartment.
9496337,67966819,2016-04-01,10235286,Alexander,"Alfredo's room is light, spacious and comfortable. The neighborhood is very quiet and it is a 20-25 minute walk to Cambridge. So what you see on the pictures is what you get. However, my stay did feature some hiccups at the start. As a host Alfredo was relying on the previous guest to leave everything exactly in order for the next guest to arrive. In my experience, this did not work out as planned: the keys to enter the house were not to be found upon arrival, no fresh bed linen was in place etc. All of this was sorted out within a few hours with excellent support from the AirBnB helpdesk and the remainder of my stay was pleasant enough."
9496337,70650513,2016-04-19,38718993,Kaleb,"Everything was just like in the pictures and the accommodations worked perfectly for me. Everything was clean and his roommates were extremely friendly. This place is about a 20-minute walk from the metro, so that may be something to keep in mind."
9496337,71713383,2016-04-27,34790553,Anna,"Il y avait aucun problème pendant mon logement chez Alfredo. Toutes les questions que je lui ai posé, il a eu toujours une solution. L'endroit est superbe, distance à pied presque partout! Simplement dit, si je reviens à Boston, je sais où loger."
9496337,72083090,2016-05-01,4180372,Maciej,Alfredo's room is typical Cambridge/Allston student accommodation. It's very convenient if you would like to be close to Harvard University. Alfredo provided clear instructuons for check-in and check-out. His flamates were available for trouble-shooting. No-frills university housing close to campus.
9496337,75130523,2016-05-19,22336617,Haozhen,Alfredo is a great host! He was very prompt in communication. The room was clean and well-prepared. Definitely recommend this place!
9496337,78719241,2016-06-08,66829539,Alec,"Alfredo was a great host! The day before we got there, he gave us clear directions on how to get to the home. When we got there it was clean and looked just like the photos on the website. He was available in case we needed anything or had any questions. Alfredo was nice and helpful! Anyone would be happy to stay at his airbnb. 10/10 would reccommend."
9496337,80481026,2016-06-18,19655405,Ali,"Alfredo is a good host. He is very friendly and welcoming and the room is big and has a good light and view. I guess I have shared the bathroom with another person but never saw him/her, so all went well. The roommate on the second floor is very friendly. You would feel relaxed and like home. I liked it for the money ($50) that I paid."
One of the downsides is that it is located in a sort of suburb neighborhood,so you have to walk to grocery stores or restaurants for about 15 minutes. I like walking so it was not a problem for me.,,,,
All together I do recommend Alfredo's place if you are staying in Boston!,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
9496337,81695543,2016-06-24,39344683,Kritaarth,"Unfortunately, I reserved the room at a time when Alfredo was abroad for most of the trip, so I only had the privilege of his company for two days- nevertheless, he was a very gracious, friendly and personable host for that time, and he had left instructions and helpful tips to make sure everything ran smoothly while he was gone. The room is great, the people are great, and the value is great- I don't know what else there is to say! Fantastic trip, will definitely stay again if I come to Boston in future."
9496337,84146927,2016-07-05,56890267,Christina,Alfredo and his roommates were very friendly and hospitable during our stay. The listing was accurate and the location was great for our purposes; it was a short drive away from the downtown area and many tourist attractions. Would recommend!
7264674,38950602,2015-07-19,37420276,Kate,Krissy met us right outside the apartment and walked us in to show us everything.  The location is AMAZING!  I lived in Boston during college years and this is by far one of the most sought after locations.  Tons of restaurants and shops in the area including a grocery store and pharmacy.  I also parked there one night and was able to find a parking spot easily.
The apartment itself is perfect!  Typical Boston style apartment with everything you need.  Very clean and super comfortable.,,,,,
"I can't say enough kind words about Krissy.  She truly was a God send during an incredibly difficult time for my family. We were in Boston so my 5 year old nephew could have heart surgery (thank God he is doing fantastic!) and she was outstanding in understanding our last minute request and accommodating an earlier departure.  She was just so incredibly kind and someone you would definitely want to deal with.\"",,,,,
7264674,41843094,2015-08-09,38461362,Sandy,Krissy was wonderful. Very accommodating and checked in with me to make sure everything was okay. She left detailed notes. The apartment was very clean. Support staff at Airbnb was also very accommodating and helpful. I would use them again.
7264674,43692784,2015-08-21,38693335,Douglas,Krissy was at her apartment to greet us on arrival.  She gave us all the information we needed and invited us to ask questions so she could help us as much as possible.

Although we didn't have any face to face interaction with Krissy, she left us detailed instructions and accommodated our early check in."
7264674,47818703,2015-09-21,12775068,Julie,The appartment is exactly as it was on the picture. A very cozy little gem!
Krissy was really helpful.,,,,,
It is really close to Newbury street ad I found it a perfect location (even tough it could be a little bit noisy at bedtime).,,,,,
It was clean and you have everything you need to cook nice meal at home.,,,,,
"I recommend it!\"",,,,,
7264674,49979791,2015-10-08,7756993,Steve,Small but perfectly formed apartment in a beautiful part of Boston - near shops and a great coffee / breakfast place. Would stay there again!

"Thank you for a great stay . \"",,,,,
7264674,51330664,2015-10-19,32518829,Mike,I was visiting my daughter at Northeastern. This was a perfect place to be near good shops and restaurants whilst being only a 20 minute walk from campus. It was also very close to the Pru centre with easy access to the Duck tours which are fantastic. The apartment was perfect and in particular the sitting room was very large and was a great place to relax after returning home for the night.
7264674,68699345,2016-04-06,12597633,Natasha,"Pretty and cozy apartment, ideally located next to one of Boston's most beautiful streets, functional, yet perhaps smaller than it looks in the photos. Krissy was really welcoming and helpful, very easy to get hold of through texting! She provided plenty of information about local amenities, quarters and washing powder for washes, taxi telephone numbers etc. We had a good time; the place was clean and warm despite the cold Boston weather. As we are a family with a small toddler, however, we would have liked to have more control over the light and sound coming in from outside: the existing Venetian blinds with slater let in quite a bit of light for those who may not be used to it, and the fact that the bedroom window doesn't shut properly because of a cable didn't help, as our stay unluckily coincided with roadworks right outside the apartment! Very homely place otherwise, would definitely recommend to young couples."
7264674,70874609,2016-04-21,10963273,Laurel,"I was in town to run the marathon and the location was absolutely perfect. The apartment was very clean and cozy and looked just as pictured. Since it's located in a busy area it was a little loud at night, but we were prepared and brought ear plugs so it wasn't much of an issue. We didn't get a chance to meet Krissy in person, but she was always available by phone/text and quick to respond. She made us feel very welcome & made certain all our needs were met. When we return to Boston we will certainly try to stay at Krissy's place again."
7264674,74802199,2016-05-16,2493490,Juliette,"This apartment was absolutely perfect for our long graduation weekend stay in Boston, I couldn't have been happier.  Krissy was attentive and available if needed, although, everything went so smoothly we didn't really need to contact her at all."
"Thank you Krissy for opening up your lovely home!\"",,,,,
7264674,75480744,2016-05-21,9509140,Kathy,"This apartment was a perfect place for my husband, daughter and me to stay in the Back Bay area during my son's graduation from the BAC.  His school was only 1 block away, so convenience was everything!  The apartment was clean, very welcoming, and comfortable.  The queen-size bed was very comfortable.  Although it was cozy,  it had everything we needed.    I never got the chance to meet Krissy, but she was always available if we needed anything.  She was very accommodating for our early arrival.

6923446,66463641,2016-03-22,46802399,Khalid,"Met Dan's roommate, Brian, who was immediately welcoming and very  accommodating. Loft was spacious with the most comfortable couches for watching a game or playing some old school consoles (think Mario Kart or GoldenEye on N64)."
Literally across the street from Fenway Park and steps from Kenmore Square/station,which made travel much easier for me,"especially since it was my first time in Boston. I now have a go-to place if I'm dropping by the city.\"",,,

They were very accommodating, friendly, and provided a place that met our basic needs - a place to sleep and shower and relax before going to bed. They readily supplied information about the area - locations of attractions, suggestions for food, etc.  You are staying in their apartment and one of them is always present (to buzz you into the building or let you in the apartment). Overall, I enjoyed our stay and conversations and learned about the area."
The private room with 2 twin beds was basic accommodation but is in a very spacious apartment with high ceilings. It was fine for our needs,i.e. a place to sleep. The bathroom is shared.,,,,
"The location was fantastic for our needs. We traveled via Amtrak for an \"\"accepted student day\"\" at Boston University. The eastern end of BU is located within easy walking distance from the apartment - 200 yards away. Fenway Park is - literally - across the street. The green 'T' subway line is very close by (on the way to BU). There were plenty of places to eat. We walked everywhere","including the MFA (1/2 mile south?) and to Amtrak Back Bay Stn (BBY)(perhaps 1 mile - 25 minutes) - east.\"",,,,
6923446,70441772,2016-04-17,57157025,Heather,My husband and his father stayed with Dan when they were in town for a game. They were very happy with the accommodations. They said the location was amazing being right across from Fenway!! Perfect spot if headed to a game. Also said Dan and his roommate were very helpful and great people! We are planning a trip back next year for a game and will be going back to Dan's place!!
6923446,73955591,2016-05-11,17679631,Glenn,"These guys are the best.  A buddy and I flew to Boston for a game at Fenway and happened upon Dan's place.  If you are going to the game, there is no better place to stay in Boston.  We walked out of the complex and into Red Sox magic. That said, even if Dan's place was 10 miles, two ferries, and ricksha away from the field, we would still stay with him again.  The place is clean. They went out of their way to accommodate us. Their company alone is worth the trip. I could write more, but you get the point."
6923446,78068613,2016-06-05,26767855,Kristen,"Great location if you are doing anything in the Back Bay area. We traveled to Boston to got a concert but there was a Red Sox game at the time so traffic is a little nuts. This place is literally steps from Fenway. We parked at the landmark shopping center down the street overnight for $35, much more affordable than other parking nearby. The room was comfortable. Our hosts Dan & Brian were very kind and thoughtful."
6923446,87755913,2016-07-21,51466681,Joe,"Dan was waiting for us at the curb after flight delays caused us not to arrive until 1 a.m. (three hours late). He was just great throughout the visit. The location was perfect... across the street from Fenway. The ballgame was exceptional and it was great to just have to walk 100 yards to get home. He recommended a terrific inexpensive restaurant. It is a quiet space, despite the location. That is partly because he works quietly in his office. He is there to assist as needed, but not a bother in any way."
6923446,91857058,2016-08-06,58075048,Daniel,"I was looking to stay close to Fenway to go to a concert, they are located directly across the street. Great Price & a great stay!"
6923446,94445996,2016-08-15,5039116,Bill,Great loft in perfect location.  Thanks Dan
10227043,59737184,2016-01-14,54128936,Richard,"The apartment was a beautiful 2 level apartment that has been updated with modern lighting, high end kitchen appliances, beautiful bathrooms and 2 lovely fireplaces.   It is warm, comfortable and located in a very nice neighborhood within easy walking distance of great shopping and dining.   Overall Awesome!"
10227043,62433964,2016-02-14,33240520,Evan,I placed a family of three (two adults and a baby)  who had lost their home. Bobbi was a pleasure to work with and the family who used the home advised it was great place to use and I try to use this property in the future.
10227043,63316205,2016-02-21,21147955,Maggie,"I would recommend staying in this beautiful home for the stunning architectural features and spa like shower alone. In addition the owners went out of their way to make us feel welcome. If you are unfamiliar with Boston, the south end is a fantastic neighborhood for foodies and this apartment is perfectly situated to enjoy every part of it but is also easy walking distance to other downtown attractions like the common, Newbury st and the museum of fine art. This was a fantastic place to spend the night. Thank you Bobbi!"
10227043,64247303,2016-03-01,6094674,Kellen,"\"You know those moments you walk into your Airbnb and have that feeling: \"\"Yes! Just as great if not greater than I imagined!\"\"?  Well Bobbi's place gives you just that feeling.  The space is unique with several rooms with round walls and the kitchen is fantastic.  I loved the granite counter tops and Viking stove."
It's nice having a second bedroom and bathroom upstairs the but gem of the apartment is the downstairs the master bedroom and ensuite bathroom.  I have never seen a bathroom like this. The shower has a steam maker and there is no shortage of counter space with the double sink island.  Again,fantastic marble counter tops really make the bathroom decor something special.,,,,
Finally,I didn't use the back patio since it was February,but I can imagine this would be great during the warm evenings.,,,
I loved the neighborhood as well.  We probably less than a 10 minute walk from a T stop and our first night we we strolled the neighborhood and found FANTASTIC restaurants just a couple blocks away.  If I could have rented or purchased Bobbi's place I would have!,,,,,
"I highly recommend Bobbi and her place and the South End neighborhood of Boston! Enjoy!!\"",,,,,
10227043,64276853,2016-03-01,27807691,Sara,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
10227043,66830451,2016-03-25,21279406,John,Bobbi was great to deal with and the flat was wonderful. Ideal location and perfect place.
10227043,67431460,2016-03-29,25962504,Frank,Bobbi is a very welcoming person and the location of the apartment is great if you want to visit Boston.
10227043,68333114,2016-04-04,25661112,Monica,"This is an awesome apartment in an awesome location in the South End of Boston.  The apartment was easy to locate, very comfortable inside and close to places to eat.  We were able to walk from the Back Bay train station with our luggage with ease.  Bobbi had everything ready for us prior to our arrival (how to access the apartment, linens) and the apartment was clean and well appointed.  I would recommend this listing for it's location and it's luxurious accommodations - we hope to return in the future."
10227043,68363170,2016-04-04,58304894,Jen,"Myself and 2 college girlfriends went up to Boston for a mini-reunion and couldn't have been happier with the accommodations Bobbi provided! The apartment was stunning, Bobbi's taste is impeccable and the location was perfect. The architectural features of the apartment gave it a charm you could never get from a hotel, but the high end toiletries and the luxurious bathrooms made it feel like we were at a spa. I highly recommend this apartment if you're considering staying in Boston!"
10227043,69204903,2016-04-10,55007158,Jackie,"Bobbi's property is a short walk from Backbay railway station in Boston, it is in an upmarket area of Boston, which is  quiet, but still has a large number of  restaurants and bars within walking distance The property itself is of a very high standard and was spacious for the 4 adults that stayed there. It had all the utilities that we required to make our stay comfortable. There are two outside terraces one per floor to enjoy. Bobbi, lives above you and was on hand (if needed) for any queries or advice. I can highly recommend her place."
10227043,69918303,2016-04-14,30532762,Ken,"We visited Boston with our 17 yo daughter to look at colleges and Bobbi's place was perfect.  The apartment was very clean and beautifully restored, in a fantastic neighborhood.  It was quiet, but just around the corner were loads of great restaurants and shops and it was easy to walk to key sites in Boston and public transportation. The unit was set up nicely and the bathroom was really like a spa with an amazing and beautiful shower. Communication with owner was easy and she provided all the information we needed. Would definitely stay there again. Thank you."
10227043,71166494,2016-04-24,26050834,Terri-Lee,"I can’t say enough good things about staying here. This was the first time my husband and I have used AirBnb. We usually stay in hotels because it’s a “safe bet”. But because we were travelling with another couple, we wanted a place to be able to talk and socialize in the mornings or evenings. This unit worked out beautifully. Bobbi and Jim have put a LOT of thought into this place, and it shows. When they say “luxury” unit, they mean it. Heated floors in the small upstairs bathroom, a bathroom downstairs that’s as big as a bedroom, with 4 shower heads….and a steam option with a bench to sit on! That was a pleasant surprise. Also, the beds were so ridiculously comfortable, we had trouble getting up and getting going in the morning. And there is even a nice little patio area in the back where you can have a morning coffee and get the day started.  Although we didn’t eat there once (too many nice restaurants!), the kitchen is very well appointed should you want to, and we made use of all the nice wine glasses and even the champagne glasses (thx, Jim!!)"
In terms of location,we couldn’t have done better. What a great little area. A very short walk to all the walks and tours and downtown action. Not to mention the fact that the South End has lots of great restaurants…very little walking needed! We also happened upon a live music night at one of the bars and really enjoyed ourselves.,,,,
We didn’t need any info from Bobbi,but if you do,I’m sure Bobbi would be very helpful and quick to respond to any questions you have.,,,
Boston would have been an amazing vacation anyway,because the city is so beautiful,and the people are so very friendly,but staying here was the icing on the cake. I would highly recommend this unit.,,
"\"",,,,,
10227043,71700921,2016-04-27,1401111,Bobbi,This apartment is amazing and beautiful. It is on the ground floor of a townhouse with a back door that opens onto a beautiful private patio and a shared park with neighbors that is gorgeous.  The apartment is really comfortable for two couples with private bedrooms and bathrooms. Easy communication with our host. Located in a really great neighborhood with lots of restaurants and great access to the theater district. We highly recommend it.
10227043,71952850,2016-04-30,12623879,Meghan,"We used Bobbi's Airbnb for a little college reunion and it easily slept 4 people (2 in each bedroom).  It's a very classic brownstone in an excellent neighborhood...within walking distance of everything.  Although the apartment has old world charm, it was very clean.  2 of our friends were visiting from Spain and we gave them the bottom bedroom with the fireplace.  They absolutely loved it and said they were living in the lap of luxury!  There's a giant shower downstairs with multiple shower heads and all 4 of us ended up using that bathroom because it had such an excellent shower.  There's also a beautiful patio.  Unfortunately we didn't have the chance to use it, but I imagine it would be very relaxing to sit out there and have a glass of wine.  And Bobbi was extremely easy to communicate with as well!"
10227043,72401338,2016-05-02,26418521,Britt,We had a wonderful time. The place was beautiful and well stocked. We would definitely stay there again. The location was also very convenient and somehow quiet at the same time. What a great find.
10227043,73496056,2016-05-08,12008238,Colleen,"Bobbi was so easy to communicate from the moment I made the booking.  She made great suggestions for dinners for our family while in Boston celebrating our son's graduation.  The apartment is so centrally located to Newberry, South End restaurants, shops and public transportation.  The apartment was clean and well equipped with all that we needed for our stay.  The beds were super comfortable and the shower in the lower level with the steam option was a hit with my husband and son!  We would return to Bobbi's home in the future."

10227043,74154452,2016-05-13,8801464,Sheryl,"Bobbie was a welcoming, accommodating, and communicative host. The apartment was comfortable and roomy and exactly as described. The courtyard patio was perfect for an alfresco dinner. We enjoyed walking around the neighborhood, plenty of nearby restaurants and an easy walk to Copley Square and Newbury Street for shopping. We hope to stay here again!"
10227043,74784671,2016-05-16,2530411,Lavinia,This apartment was the perfect spot for us when we came for our daughters college graduation. The apartment was lovely and comfortable and even better than described in the listing. The location was perfect for us....walking distance to the T and close to excellent restaurants on Tremont St. Bobbi left clear instructions and a bottle of bubbly to welcome us to her beautiful space. We could not have been happier and will return again if we are in Boston.
10227043,77783903,2016-06-03,8619424,Katharine,Great place! Owner responds immediately. Outstanding!
10227043,78550690,2016-06-07,32666170,Jackie,Very nice house in a beautiful South Boston neighborhood.
Very clean and well appointed with new appliances and TV.  Perfect for a family or two couples.,,,,,
"Starbucks being right around the corner was a bonus.  I recommend Charlie's for breakfast.. It's a very nice 7 minute walk away in a beautiful neighborhood.  I would not hesitate to rent this house again.\"",,,,,
10227043,78899863,2016-06-10,74340832,Paul,My family had a great time in Boston and part of it is because of this place. I'd strongly recommend this place.

10227043,79702704,2016-06-13,55541365,Chrisie,"Bobbi was great with communication upon our arrival. The house is clean and has many nice features (loved the large walk in shower). We loved the neighborhood, quiet and just a 10-15 min walk to some great places.  The only things we thought might have been more helpful was instructions for using the TV and how to access the Apple TV.  Also wasn't aware that the large shower had a steam option. But overall we enjoyed our stay and would recommend Bobbi's place."
10227043,80190706,2016-06-16,26079314,Angelina,Bobbi's home is lovely and located in a great neighborhood of Boston.  Our stay was short but Bobbi was easy to communicate with for everything that we needed.
10227043,80805471,2016-06-19,36349186,Kevin,High end finishes in a Great neighborhood. Apartment was available on time and the space was very clean and organized. Perfect for 2 couples with the bedrooms/bathrooms on separate floors. Apartment is centrally located to restaurants and cafes. Easy walk to Copley Square and Back Bay. Bobbi was quick in responding to any inquiries.
10227043,81191265,2016-06-21,59089622,Myra,"Bobbi was great! Everything was clean, organized, efficient, and comfortable. Great neighborhood, we fell in love with Boston."

It is located in a lovely neighborhood in Boston and close to restaurants, metro and some sight seeing spots. It is even better than on the photos! Unfortunatly we did not have the chance to meet Bobbi in person, but she replied to my questions within a few minutes."
"I would definately book the place again!\"",,,,,
10227043,83862130,2016-07-04,381610,Debby,"This well-appointed, pristine, and conveniently-situated South End complex absolutely exceeded expectations! Like others before mentioned, it appeared even better in person than in the photos. Loved the wood floors, full stock of sleek appliances, and the tranquil garden. We didn't lack for any amenities. The master bathroom impressed (big thumbs up to the multiple shower heads and washer/dryer), and the beds were deliciously comfy. The neighborhood contained so many cool boutiques and restaurants; it was refreshing to talk a walk along the brownstones and green spaces. And the Back Bay station really was only a five-minute walk away. Thanks so much, Bobbi, for being an amazing, accommodating host who responded to queries within seconds and let us stay in her serene, super clean, generally awesome place. Highly recommended!"

12343588,71576380,2016-04-26,6229052,Ian,"Mary was a great host! Retrieving the key was not an issue for getting into the building. Once we entered there was a nice living room the left hand side. Down the hall were all 3 bedrooms, which were all cozy. At the end of the hall was the kitchen and back door to back patio. The area was mostly quiet except for emergency vehicles driving by since we were a few doors down from a police station. We felt more safe in the area with the station so close by. Its usually easy to find street parking during the day; more difficult late night.  Overall it was a pleasant stay, had no issues at all. Thanks again Mary!"

It was very clean and had everything we needed, including linens and fresh towels. The house is situated next to the police station, so we felt safe, but we didn't venture out with all the kids to the T. We drove to Agganis Arena for a concert. It took about 15-20 mins with easy access to the highway. The house wasn't air conditioned as far as we could tell, but we opened some windows and all was well. Parking was tough at first, but we eventually found spots close to the house. A nice stay, overall!"

I booked this Airbnb last minute and it was perfect for my 5 friends and I. The beds and pillows were super comfortable, rooms are very spacious, and there is a back porch. Since the summer is so nice in Boston we had cocktails on the porch before we left.  If your looking for a nice place to stay check out this apartment :)"

It was great to have complementary bottles water in the fridge. It was also great to have a store and coffee shop near by. We did have to be patient looking for parking especially late at night after the baseball game, but everything worked out.  If in Boston again we would consider staying in this location. Additionally, our host was helpful with directions and activities in the area. A GREAT PLACE to stay!"

The host Mary was super friendly and kind who replied my message promptly and provided a lot of useful info that I needed. One thing I was deeply touched was that Mary sent one of her staffs to teach us how to use the key to open the door when we have arrived at her apartment around 01:30am at midnight. Again thanks for everything that Mary has done for us, we really appreciated and enjoyed our stay in Boston. We highly recommend Mary's apartment to those whom plan to visit Boston. Hope to see Mary next time."

She provided all the things we needed during our stay -- towels, toiletries, kitchen supplies, complimentary bottled water, wifi and Netflix! Parking on the street during the day was easy, but at night we sometimes had to park farther from the house. Having a nearby police station definitely made us feel safer in the area. Overall, we enjoyed our summer trip to Boston and four nights stay at Mary's place."

The apartment was perfect for our 4 night stay. The beds were super comfy & the whole place was so charming.  Even though the police station was just down the street it was very quiet. We were concerned about the heat & humidity in Boston in July but we shouldn't have been. The room air conditioners worked very well & kept the place very comfortable & we were even able to turn if off quite a bit."
It was close enough to walk to the train station which we took into the city. Lots of little stores & eating establishments nearby.  We had a rental car as well & were able to park in front of or directly across from the house every night.,,,,,

Everyone is happy about the bed and space. And the house is very close to the subway station Fileds Corner, about 6 miniutes walking. And from the place, just walk 1 minute you could find Subway, 711 and Dunkin Donnut. We did not get to explore the neighbor too much cuz I travel with kids.

The room we rented was just like in the Picture,including the cat! It had enough space for us to manage all 4 of our luggages,and it had many drawers for us to use. Bathroom,shower,kitchen,living room were all very clean and efficient. We cooked burgers while there
The closeness of the house to the metro was one of the things we liked most. We didn't need to rent a car. Also,there is a Whole Foods very nearby. The neighborhood is green,silent and very homey. With no outside car noises,music,or shoutings,it is a great place to sleep
We are very thankful to Shawna because she made our stay wonderful. If the room looks good to you,but you still have hesitations,"we full heartedly recommend you stay with her.\"",,,

We were welcomed by Shawna when we checked-in and she gave us a run-down of where things were in the apartment and room, etc. The room was exactly as described. The room and apartment were very welcoming, clean, and beautifully kept. The street seemed a bit busy during our stay and might have been a \"\"one-off\"\" situation (we did have the windows open at night as it was a warm weekend). It is also very close to the T public transit"

Relatively central location in a quiet neighborhood, Shawna and her partner definitely made us feel at home and even gave us suggestions of bars and restaurants in the area! Perfect for our weekend get away."
11418599,78064693,2016-06-05,69241166,Ollie,Shawna was really nice and welcoming and the apartment was in a good location for getting into Boston. The only thing to bear in mind is if you're not fond of cats/cat hair this may not be the perfect place!

Anche relativamente all'orario di arrivo è stata molto flessibile e disponibile."
La posizione dell'alloggio era comodissima,a due passi della metro verde T che porta direttamente in centro.,,,,
La camera è proprio come nella foto,con spazio a disposizione per i nostri bagagli,moltissime finestre e persino un balconcino! Attenzione che il letto è un queen size,non è il matrimoniale classico.,,
Nell'appartamento ci sono due vivaci gatti,uno in particolare non vedeva l'ora di entrare in camera appena aprivamo la porta la mattina,quindi se vi danno fastidio gli animali e i peli che inevitabilmente lasciano,"tenetene conto.\"",,

40601,85608,2010-08-27,199513,Nicholas,"We loved staying at Robert's house. He was an excellent host, took us for a guided tour of Jamiaca Plain when we arrived and made us feel at home. The house is just like it looks online, and is very nice. There are lots of stairs, but they're not a big deal. It was really nice to have our own bathroom and his dog is also very friendly. We did most of our traveling around Boston on the train and the local T stop was an easy walk, plus trains run regularly. The local shops stock mostly organic food and are a bit pricey but it's a very welcoming neighbourhood. Would recommend anyone to go and stay there. Thanks Robert for a great stay."
40601,170167,2011-01-13,331107,Richard,"\"Robert was an excellent host. I had a late flight into Boston and was taking public transportation to his house; he was kind enough to allow me to show up after 10pm. He gave a tour of his home as soon as I got in and offered free range throughout while I was staying there. The room was more than enough space for me. There is a closet to hang all your clothes in, as well as a dresser for anything else. The bathroom is not connected to the room. However, it is just outside of the bedroom door, and it is indeed a private bath. He has a convenient desk in the room which was a perfect \"\"home office\"\" away from home with my laptop connected to the wireless Internet. It sure came in handy when my flight home was canceled! I had to rush to the airport to try to leave a day early and get out of Boston before a blizzard hit"
I spent most my time exploring the city and visiting friends in the area,so I didn't spend much time (except to sleep) in the house. It is pretty close to the T station which made going into Boston very easy,even while it was snowing. Robert was also helpful navigating me around town when I was questioning if I was taking the right trains. It cut quite a bit of travel time off my day.,,,
One other note: If you start to play with the dog,"be ready to play for a while! Rocco loves to fetch and then lay it at your feet to throw again.\"",,,,

40601,846949,2012-01-07,1445536,Vanitha,"my husband and i stayed at Robert's place for 17 nights in dec2011-jan2012.  Robert was host par excellence....he not only offered a private room and bath but very open-heartedly offered us the use of his entire house ...from kitchen to additional bathroom , living room and even a fabulous study.  the house is on 4 floors so there was plenty of privacy. the kitchen was equipped for gourmet cooking....well lit with every possible utensil.  the living room had a nice fire for those cold evenings. our bedroom was immaculate and well furnished and full of light from 2 large windows.. there was a super high tech musical washer and dryer available for our use. the fourth floor with splendid windows and sunshine slanting in every morning is Robert's study which we used as a yoga and meditation room..  it was perfect. the house is decorated and furnished with restraint.... by which i mean no frilly curtains and doodads and kitsch on every surface.   the live plants in the rooms added a lot of vibrance and energy. an added bonus was Rocco the dog,  friendly but not slobbering.. a nice subdued canine who loved playing ball in silence.  altogether we had an A++ experience and even told Robert that the price could be upped.. for which all of you reading this will hate me.     signed   seasoned traveller."
40601,948558,2012-02-26,1304854,Ben,"Robert was great. His house is clean and organized with a ton of sunlight, and Rocco (his dog) is super friendly. Highly recommended!"
40601,994064,2012-03-13,1249562,Mercy,"Excellent accommodations - very clean and very comfortable! Robert shared his whole house with us and it was great! He has a nicely equipped kitchen, a comfortable dining area, a really nice back patio where you can enjoy drinks or lunch during warmer days, a comfortable living room with a TV, and a large study on the top floor.  He also allowed us to use his computer to get online when we needed to and his awesome washer and dryer duo, which was extremely convenient! Jamaica Plains was a great neighborhood and we were in a perfect location - within walking distance from the Orange line (no need to rent a car!), there's a park and a lake nearby (opportunities for a nice morning run!) and plenty of bars/restaurants/stores that are less than a 10 minute walk away.  Robert was a great host - very friendly and gave us suggestions on where to go and how to get there.  We had to book at the last minute (24 hours before our arrival) and even though we were arriving very late at night (after 10pm) Robert was extremely understanding and greeted us with a smile, showed us around his home, making us feel very welcome. Highly recommended!"

Our room was very clean and the bed incredibly comfortable, as the bathroom. In the kitchen we founded everything we needed. Robert is a very nice person and his dog Rocco's very educated."
The house (on a hill,better take a taxi if you've got big tolls) is a little far from the center of Boston,but metro&markets are near to home.  Perfect wireless,"beautiful garden (with BBQ). \"",,

40601,1169970,2012-04-23,2037122,Selby,"Robert has a really attractive and comfortable house.  The room and bath were just what I was looking for, quiet, overlooking the garden in back,  the location in Jamaica Plain was perfect for my needs, very near Centre Street and all the stores and restaurants, as well as my daughter's condo, and Robert was an easy, welcoming host. Parking was no problem.  I enjoyed my stay very much and look forward to another visit."
40601,1213138,2012-05-01,2206688,Jeremy,"This is a beautiful property in a very cool and fun area of Boston. It is close to the shops and restaurants of Centre Street in Jamaica Plain, and the street is very quiet and safe. It is also a short walk to the Orange line subway on the Boston transit system, that takes you straight into the Back Bay, and downtown areas within 20 minutes.  The room is clean, relatively private and well cared for. Robert is a gracious host. Highly recommended."

Robert is a most generous host, we spent some great time together but he also respected our privacy. His house lies in a very pretty neighbourhood where we felt very much at home. We can recommend staying there, good connections with the T to downtown and good restaurants, shops etc in the vicinity: we love J.P. When we get back to Boston we will certainly try to stay with Robert again!!"
"Gérard &Eva\"",,,,,
40601,4318949,2013-04-27,3152471,Michelle,"I had a great stay at Roberts. As other reviewers have noted, he is friendly but respectful of your space.  I have lived in several neighborhoods in Boston and the surrounding areas - Beacon Hill, South End, Jamaica Plain, Charlestown, Cambridge and Brookline - and recently have stayed in several hotels.  I was moving back to Boston and needed a short term stay.  I pursued AirBnB options in Beacon Hill, South End, Back Bay, JP and Brookline, and found Robert's to be a great value for the quality and price.  The stay lived up to expectations. Very quiet, comfortable bed, street with character and the orange line is very convenient.  20 minutes to the Back Bay station."
40601,5450071,2013-07-01,5713976,Max,"Robert offers a great place to stay in Boston. The house offers enough place, own bathroom, a pretty garden to hang out, and a nice and laid back neighbourhood. The place is very clean and tidy, and if you are too, it wouldn't harm. The AC in summer is a blessing and not to underrate. Robert is a great host, he showed me around on my first day, gave me tips about the city and helped wherever he could. Having a bike there made things pretty comfortable, otherwise T and Bus are reachable within a short walk. I had a very good stay there and would definitely return if I pass by Boston."
40601,6210236,2013-08-04,2900145,Gray,"I can only echo the other reviews after my month stay!  Robert was a great host and very accommodating.  Local transport links within easy walking distance, along with a variety of local shops and restaurants.  Robert's house is very clean and tidy and is in a quiet neighborhood.  Robert allows you to have your own space but is also great company to hang out with.  I would definitely stay there again if I return to Boston. Plus Roco his dog was an added bonus."
40601,6433722,2013-08-12,7591922,Johannes,"Robert's house is like an Oasis. The house itself is immaculately clean and very tastefully furnished, and the carefully tended back yard with a nice deck overlooking flower beds and vegetables is very charming. The room is bright and provides ample closet space while the adjacent full bathroom is most convenient. Robert is a very helpful, discreet, and friendly host and I can only highly recommend his place. I had a wonderful time."
40601,6852409,2013-08-27,7545556,Yannick,"Does it suffice to say that we considered moving to Boston after this stay? We had an absolutely wonderful time at Robert's. He showed us around his neighborhood which has a lot to offer and is really quite a cool place. Robert lives on a quiet street. His house is very clean, very cozy and tastefully furnished with a lovely garden in which he plants tomatoes. There is air conditioning and the bed in our room was super comfy. The room has plenty of space for luggage. Robert was always helpful and lent us a card to use public transport (which is really easy in Boston, even the buses). He also lent us his bikes to take a bike tour along the many parks of Boston. A dinner party on the last evening was the perfect end for our stay. Highly recommended!"
40601,7789239,2013-10-03,5662660,Shimrit,"Staying at Robert was a delight. Robert is very friendly, but not intrusive, and had a lot of helpful suggestions. I had my own bathroom, which for me was important, and the bedroom was spacious (great bed). The house is great, a lot of stairs, but washer and dryer as well as fully equipped kitchen (made cookies). I personally am not a dog person, but Rocco really grow on me, especially since he is not a jump-on-you-lick-your-face kind of dog, and I found myself playing with him and petting him just so he won't give me sad faces :)"
The neighborhood,Jamaica Plain (JP),is also cool,more laid back and inclusive,which I liked. Robert was very kind to show me around,the first day
The T station is only 5 minutes away,and you're in downtown in less then 20 min.,,,,
I loved Boston and having my home away from home for more than a month at Robert's was better than I ever expected. I would recommend his place to anybody visiting Boston who's not set at being in the middle of the hustle and bustle.,,,,,
Robert,thanks for everything,"it's been a pleasure!\"",,,
40601,8018436,2013-10-13,7876660,Vic,"I stayed at Roberts place for a week. Robert is a very generous and personable host. On my first night he invited me to a dinner that he was hosting for some of his friends. He also invited me out to an event at the local Hibernian Hall and on the last day gave me a lift to the airport. Roberts house is spotless and all the equipment is high quality. Jamaica Plain is a lovely spot. It has a slightly hipster feel about it and the wooden clap board houses and tree lined streets give it a nice feel. There is also the two T line stations, which make getting into Boston centre really quick and easy, and the old converted brewery which is owned and run by Jamaica Plain Neighbourhood Development Corporation (a non profit). JPNDC have turned JP round in the last 20 years from a run down part of town to where it is now - property sells for $500 per sq ft.The converted brewery contains 40 or so businesses including a really great café and a restaurant. I met some of the locals and the owners of the restaurant on the last night and found them really friendly."

40601,8359970,2013-10-27,1004283,Nicholas,I came to Boston for the World Series and stayed in Robert's beautiful house in Jamaica Plain.
Robert is a very hospitable host and his house is spotless. The bed is very comfortable with a nice private bathroom.,,,,,
Every morning Robert had made some coffee for me which was the perfect start to the day!,,,,,
His dog Rocco is the perfect dog for new guests,very friendly and affectionate but not pushy in any way. When I had to send some work emails he would simply lie on the floor next to me.,,,,
JP has been transformed and Robert's house is on a gorgeous street. The area has excellent transport links to the downtown area; Orange Line is 6-7 min walk away taking you into Downtown crossing and the 39 bus runs from Centre St (5 min walk) into the Back Bay.,,,,,

This awesome place is so hard to describe, because you have to experience it. I absolutley fall in love with Boston - Robert is a great host! Shortly after my arrive, I felt like home. Everything is to 100% like described (clean, tidy and comfortable) and the atmosphere is very familiar. He is very openminded and supports his guest with a lot of good reccomendations or advices. Although I was really busy, we had great talks and discussions, I will miss it. His dog, Rocco, is not such a hyperactive slavering dog type I was afraid to be confronted with - He is like his owner; he takes care of you, but also respects your privacy. I loved these quite evenings, when I was sitting with him in front of the fire and trinking warm eggnog. I recommend this place to 100%! Thank you, Robert for this awesome time!"

40601,10715922,2014-03-04,11102158,Becky,"Just returned from a weeks stay in Boston. Robert is a fantastic host, really lovely guy, very helpful and very kind. Rocco is such a sweet  dog, an added bonus to your stay. The house is amazing, lovely and clean and comfortable. The room is very comfortable and I had the best nights sleep in that bed the entire week. I stayed a particularly cold time of the year and the house was lovely and warm. The location is fantastic, a short walk from the T and lots of local coffee shops and restaurants. I would absolutely recommend staying with Robert and if ever i return to Boston i would definitely be booking to stay here again!"
40601,11091834,2014-03-20,11823233,Pedro,"First of all, I should explain that my experience was not literally my experience; I live in Boston myself but did the booking for my parents that don't speak any English. Robert's place looks great, it's a beautiful house, really clean, greatly decorated, perfect environment for people wanting comfort and cleanness in a relaxed environment. My parents really liked the room and Robert not only was understanding of their poor English skills, but embraced our brazilianism trying out his own Portuguese skills, he's a great guy! About the neighborhood, I live in Jamaica Plain myself and love it, it's got tons of cool places to eat, parks and ponds around and an awesome and relaxed environment with easy access to downtown Boston, perfect for students or turists that don't want to pay ridiculous amounts of money to stay downtown and stay in a place that, in my opinion, is more fun and less busy."

The room and bathroom were immaculately clean, the rest of the house was nicely furnished and comfortable, and the pleasant backyard was a charming, quiet plus where I spent some downtime reading and relaxing. The neighborhood is great with a bunch of restaurant choices. I remember that years ago it was considered edgy but those days are gone, as far as I could see. The T station (subway) is literally 5 minutes away and is the best way to get around in my opinion. We got everywhere from Harvard to the Museum of Fine Arts to Dorchester with some easy transferring. I would recommend without reservation. Also, Rocco is a really sweet dog."
40601,13308460,2014-05-25,9200996,Michele,"My wife and me stayed at Robert's for a week, having a really good thanks to all the attentions of our host.  At our arrival it was raining and  he  came and pick us up at the T train station! It was fun having a chat or two using words in Italian,  Portuguese, French and English all mixed up. Rocco, the dog, is a peaceful,  good boy. We had a bathroom all for ourselves and sharing the kitchen with Robert was never a problem."
We were the problem,as a matter of fact,always cooking full meals! For all the rest we cannot but confirm what the other guests have written in their reports.,,,

He made me feel welcome and was very helpful in explaining the neighborhood. He also offers kind and interesting conversation. Two friends came for one week and stayed in the studio, and they also felt welcome and had a lovely stay. Robert also helped me move out to an apartment in downtown Boston."
The description of the house is very accurate,this is a beautiful,comfortable and clean house. The room is lovely and has a beautiful view,specially at dawn in winter (which is 7 am!).,,
The neighborhood is worth getting to know it,as you probably would not go if staying in downtown. It has a variety of restaurants and coffee places worth exploring and the lake is beautiful. If the weather allows it,"running around the lake is delightful. \"",,,

I love JP, there are many wonderful cafes and restaurants nearby, 7 Pond is my favorite. Robert told me he wanted 5 stars, definitely, he deserves it, super 5 stars."
40601,34709875,2015-06-11,32017673,Roger,Robert was a very helpful and affable host.  He was knowledgeable about the area and readily answered questions about tourism and transportation options.  The Jamaica Plain area was quite nice.  His home is immaculate with a lovely backyard.  It was particularly nice to have the view of the garden from our room.
We would stay with him again if we find ourselves in the Boston area again.,,,,,

40601,35202799,2015-06-16,689838,Jenny,"The room and bath were just as pictured, and were very clean and comfortable, and I slept very well. I travelled each day to the Hynes Convention Center on the T and that worked well. The neighborhood is charming. Robert was a fine host and had everything I needed."
40601,36300096,2015-06-27,6749716,Yaara,"Robert was gracious and considerate, his home is beautiful, tidy, clean, and very pleasant. We cannot recommend this listing highly enough. The neighborhood is fantastic. It is full of good restaurants, bars, and shops, there are trees everywhere and Jamaica Pond is less the 5 minutes away. We will probably return next time we visit Boston."
40601,37837818,2015-07-11,28915741,Sashya,"While it might be easy to be a by-the-book kind of host, it takes a special warmth to be able to make guests feel as comfortable as they would be in their own home. Robert King has that down pat. He has a beautiful home and our room was especially comfortable and spacious. The wardrobe and chest of drawers ensure that you don't have to live out of your suitcase at all! Between the radio and the unlimited supply of magazines and the comfy bed, even a day in was nice and relaxing! Also, we must give a special shout out to Robert's cute little doggie Rocco who did as much to make us feel like part of the family!"
"PS: Morning chats over a great cup of coffee were our favourite.\"",,,,,
40601,38762135,2015-07-18,19841316,Rhona,"Robert is a lovely man, extremely helpful, generous + interesting.  He left his work to pick us up, which was really helpful to us. His house is well organised + maintained, he has a great garden to relax/ have breakfast in. We slept very comfortably + had plenty of room to easily allow us to unpack our belongings. We also really liked Jamaica Plain. It was a lively neighbourhood, lots of bars, restaurants + shops, with a nice relaxed feel to it. We felt it took less time to get into city centre by the T than Robert describes. Would certainly return there."
40601,39821511,2015-07-26,14899525,Giorgio,"My experience staying at Robert's house was great. Robert was very friendly and showed me all the interesting places in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood. His house is exactly as shown in the pictures, and the bedroom and bathroom were very nice and perfectly clean. Also the location was perfect for what I needed. Should I visit Boston again, I would definitely want to come back, and I would recommend Robert's place to anyone interested in visiting Boston."
40601,40448146,2015-07-31,33240456,Emilie,"Great experience! Robert is very welcoming, helpful and friendly, and so we felt at home during our stay. As for his house, it is both beautiful and neat, as shown in the pictures. I would recommand it to anyone who's planning a trip to Boston."
40601,45065884,2015-08-31,9075360,Christoph,"Robert is a great host. He immediately made us feel like home and recommended places to go in the neighborhood. He also went out of his way to help us with moving into our own place in JP. The room and bathroom were exactly as advertised and the house was always kept tidy and clean. The house is located in a beautiful and very quiet part of JP very close to central JP with all its ammenities, restaurants etc. I highly recommend staying with Robert if you want to stay in a great place in a beautiful neighborhood of Boston!"
40601,64907004,2016-03-09,12515862,Caro,"The room was comfortable, clean, and welcoming; I appreciated Robert's tour of the space and his suggestions for meals and walks in the neighborhood. The atmosphere was relaxed and I was able to unwind during my stay. His listing was accurate and I will be eager to stay in his home again when I visit Boston again in the future."
40601,66157910,2016-03-20,48501767,Marcos,"Robert is a great host and and extraordinary person! He was always gentle, kind and really made my wife and I feel like we were home (he cooked a Delicious Feijoada for us). We hanged out a lot of times, which made our trip even better, giving it a more familiar aspect. We felt like we were staying in our friend's house."
He gave us a lot of tips related to different places to go. He knows a lot about culture,politics,economics,history,art,which make our trip to Boston an Unique and unforgettable experience.
The bedroom is awesome with a really comfort bed and full of space. In addition,the bathroom is very clean and perfectly organized.  The house is amazing with full of space,beautiful backyard and very well organized by Robert. The kitchen is neat!!,,,
Everything went perfectly well,much more than we expected. It was our first experience with  airbnb and Robert was the best person we could wish for.,,,,

The bedroom, bathroom and whole house are beautifully maintained, and Robert was an excellent host. He very kindly picked me up at the airport when I arrived and was always available for advice on places to visit in and around Boston, as well as many pleasant chats. The house is close to the orange line for an easy commute into central Boston, and also within 5min walking distance to the 39 Bus, which provides a great link to the Longwood Medical Area. I can thoroughly recommend staying with Robert."

Die Unterkunft entsprach genau der Beschreibung und war genauso wie wir sie uns gewüscht haben. Es war sehr sauber,  ruhig und gemütlich und wir haben uns sicher gefühlt. Robert hat uns, weil es bei unserer Ankunft regnete, sogar vom Bahnhof abgeholt. Er hat uns immer gute Tipps gegeben und stand uns mit Rat und Tat zur Seite. Wir würden jederzeit wieder bei ihm wohnen wollen."

Jamaica Plain is a great neighborhood full of families and young adults. There are several playgrounds and restaurants within walking distance, as well as the Samuel Adams brewery.

Everything was as listed and more--comfortable bed, convenient bathroom, ample closet and dresser space, beautiful yard and living areas.  In addition to that, Robert's genuine friendliness made Linda's and my stay as delightful and pleasant as it could be."

40601,98521346,2016-08-31,21883708,Jeronimo,"Robert's place is awesome. It's exactly as described or even better. Room and bath, as well as the rest of the house, very clean and ordered. Jamaica Plain is a nice and safe quarter, well communicated with downtown Boston. Robert is the best host one can imagine: helpful, polite, respectful, wise and full of sense of humour. About Rocco, the dog, it could be said exactly the same. If we come back to Boston, this place would be our #1 choice, if it's available. You cannot do anything wrong by choosing Robert's home."
4560053,24488546,2014-12-29,21702394,Hangyu,It was a nice historical house. With nice kitchen and comfortable bed. The first bedroom was cold so Terry brought us a heater. The wifi had been great at first time but later it became hard to receive signal. Overall it is a nice place to stay.
4560053,28450190,2015-03-23,15497859,Matt,"Terry was awesome! He had everything ready by the time we showed up and was very helpful educating us on Boston and things to do. The house was really nice as well, exactly what we expected."

4560053,32986514,2015-05-24,19473804,Julie,"Terry is a really nice host. He was so helpful for answering questions and giving us advice. His appartment is very nice and well decorated. The kitchen is fully equipped, the living room, bedrooms and dinning room is so nice which make us feels at home. There's even clean towels in the bathroom! The only down part is that the house is a little historical and the only bath tub is a little small for my dad. The bedrooms are all located on the second floor which may be a problem for elderly people. However, My family enjoyed the stay very much. Definitely recommended!"
4560053,33989937,2015-06-03,25886662,Marc,"Alles war genau so wie in der Beschreibung und den Bildern dargestellt. Die Wohnung bzw das Haus ist sehr schön renoviert und man wohnt richt luxuriös. Chris, der oben unter dem Dach wohnt war sehr nett und hilfsbereit und hat und viele nützliche tips für boston gegeben. Absolut empfehlenswert- wir würden sofort wiederkommen"
4560053,34771683,2015-06-12,29666742,Varinia,"Avremmo gradito conoscere il nostro host, abbiamo solo sentito la sua voce perché lo abbiamo dovuto chiamare al telefono per avere il codice di accesso all'appartamento. Appartamento delizioso, accogliente e confortevole. Il quartiere deludente, distanza dalla metro sottostimata."

4560053,52093416,2015-10-26,24513571,Kayla,"We were able to get into the place with no problems.  It was a nice place on the inside with plenty of room, amenities, and supplies.  However, we were very unhappy with the neighborhood.  While it is close in proximity to the center of the city as described in the listing, it is also in a very high crime area.  All locals whom we spoke with confirmed this location was in a dangerous area, and we found many articles and crime reports for this area.  We voiced our concerns to the host, as well as to Airbnb, and received no help on the matter.  It was not our intent to offend anyone, but police reports do not often lie.  We will definitely find a different location to rent when returning to Boston with safety as the main concern."
4560053,52833691,2015-11-02,11300824,Tijn,"It is a beautiful an spacious house, clean, good beds, stylish furnished and a fully equipped kitchen. We loved the neighborhood because it is quiet compared with the centre. That does make subway and shops  a 15-20 min walk. We didn't mind but you should know."
4560053,57329548,2015-12-24,46880711,Kim,"Terry found the perfect accommodation for our stay in Boston. The beautiful Christmas wreath and flag at the door made our welcome inviting and this continued as we came inside to a warm home which was beautifully decorated and very comfortable. The 5 of us all had plenty of space and this home had everything we needed in the bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen and laundry. There was also a useful folder of information. This home is full of interest and history and, although not in the heart of Boston, made a great base. Having wifi and netflix was a bonus with teenagers."

Lights are available everywhere and in kitchen you can find everything you need for cooking and eating. The most we appreciated during this trip is Terry's warm heart. He immediately brought a set of pillows and quilt to us after hearing our request, regardless of that it has been mid-night for him. We must say thank you again!"

4560053,76594855,2016-05-28,13140014,Allan,As advertised. Nice large updated space great for our family to gather for a college graduation.  Parking on street was always available also.

12752020,80710435,2016-06-19,18262322,Jennifer,The apartment was perfect!  It was just enough space for what we needed and very clean.  The location was only a few blocks from Quincy market and the North End.  Kate was great and very quick to respond to any questions we had while we were there.  I would definitely recommend this apartment for anyone going to Boston for a weekend.
6790961,55996235,2015-12-07,50336953,Joe,First time airbnb user and everything was great.  The location is what sets this place apart from all others.  Fenway is literally in your back yard.  You can not get a better idea of what boston is about.
5640375,28830980,2015-03-30,1858630,Rosen,"My girlfriend and I stayed 3 nights, and we would highly recommend to anyone that wants an affordable, well-located, quiet and safe place to rest in Boston.  It is not a big room, but provides just enough space for two, and it was IMPECCABLY CLEAN!"
We did not meet Will,but he responded very promptly with the initial information after our booking was confirmed and put us in touch with the management company that takes care of the unit.   We had issues connecting to the wifi at the beginning (resolved by unplugging and restarting the router),and the management company responded to our email within minutes.  We had no problems at check-in or check-out.,,,
The place is very much as described,however,the pictures are not of the exact same unit.  The differences between the unit we stayed in and the one in the picture are minimal though:  slightly different furniture (but in same configuration),larger window,and smaller TV.  Also,the ad mentions a Chrome stick
5640375,29850767,2015-04-13,29357545,Nick,"My 5-day stay in this Back Bay studio was fantastic. Everything was as described; all amenities were in great condition, the bed was very comfortable, furnishings were nice and the apartment was clean, quiet and had lots of natural light."
The studio was situated in the heart of South End which had very close access to nice restaurants and bars,and was walking distance to the local train station,major strip-shopping,the river,MIT,the CBD and the medical precinct (where I was working).
Contacting Will was easy,and he made accessing the building simple and convenient.,,,,
"I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to be in the heart of Boston and enjoy the quiet comforts of your own place.\"",,,,,
5640375,30616837,2015-04-25,2622763,Amanda,"The description of the studio apartment was accurate.  It's location was convenient - 15 min walk to the Hynes Convention Center and close to the T subway station.  Hotels in the area are expensive.  Since I was coming for a conference, the airbnb option was perfect for me. There is a keyless entry system with a combination code that also made it convenient.  I never met Will, but he was available over the airbnb website for questions."
5640375,31191231,2015-05-03,10348551,Gloria,"Although the street was beautiful and we were able to get around the city easily, this lacked the usual Air BnB experience.  I did not like dealing with a rental company and felt that it de-personalized the experience.  Unit was clean and served the purpose, although bathroom was very small and we could hear our neighbor's conversations.  Good deal for the area,though. I'm just wish it had more of a personal touch."
5640375,32342344,2015-05-17,29922874,Sarah,"The neighborhood was lovely and the space beautiful! We loved being close to coffee shops, restaurants, and to the T.  The area was quiet, too, but felt close to everything."
5640375,32908763,2015-05-23,1891963,Sydney,"Very hotel-esque feel for being an Airbnb. No hair dryer despite listing one. Photos made it look bigger than actual. Great location, so it's got that."
5640375,35400887,2015-06-18,34130063,Emily,"Clean, convenient, and cool! Great location, completely accessible by foot, subway, bus. I would definitely stay here again."
5640375,35798133,2015-06-22,32167071,Yen,"This studio is located in an amazing neighborhood. It was very peaceful yet accessible and walkable to many major landmarks. We would definitely stay in this neightborhood again. There's a great restaurant about 10 steps from the building that we ate at several times during the week when we didn't feel like making an effort to go out. The studio itself is relatively small. We ran into the corner of the bed several times a day, trying to navigate around the room. Eventhough we went in mid-June the temperature in the room was very hot. Turning on the attached air conditioner was undesirable because it was so loud and was placed right by the bed. The bed mattress was hard and uncomfortable. The shower was another issue because the water pressure was pretty much none existence. Despite the drawbacks, the room was clean and sufficient. Checking in and checking out was very convenient because the doors all have lock codes so we didn't have to worry about keys. Overall, it was a pleasant stay."
5640375,36407731,2015-06-28,13908352,Vi,"The unit was decent and as photographed, and communications regarding the rental were done mainly through Short Term Rentals. It appears like most or all of the units in the building were rentals as we encountered at least 3 other renters while going in and out of the building.  So if you're looking for a airbnb experience, this won't be quite it. It's much more like a hotel."
That said,the unit was perfect for my husband and I. The bathroom is a small,typical Boston bathroom with barely any space for 2 to move around,and the towels are lacking,but it did the job! The water pressure was great and the water was super hot.,
The bed was very comfortable!! The window A/C unit and ceiling fan worked well for hot summer days. The natural light was perfect,and there were even views of the Pru and the Hancock building,my favorite in Boston. The accessibility to the rental was great! Since both the outside door and unit door were code accessible,my husband and I could come and go as we please without worry about transferring the key to one another. (I was in a wedding so we spent the good part of 2 days on separate schedules.) That was very convenient.,,
"The location was great! We were able to walk to most places. \"",,,,,
5640375,40432148,2015-07-31,30241545,Brad,The apartment was perfect for our needs and on a beautiful street in the south end. Will responded quickly to any questions I had and our stay was nice.
5640375,41197370,2015-08-05,5148681,Katherine (Kate),"The listing was accurate.  The sheets are clean and soft, the window air conditioner was crucial!  Be warned, there is no soap of any kind, the cable tv doesn't work well (it's fuzzy), it's a fifth floor walk up, and you have to do a lot of the cleaning yourself when you leave."
5640375,47171903,2015-09-16,13382549,Valorie,The studio was as described.
We LOVED the neighborhood and ability to walk to subway,restaurants,parks and shops.  We loved interacting with locals.  The brick sidewalks,trees,median with a fountain,"little pops concert in the park were so fun.  It was nice and quiet at night.  \""

5640375,64428714,2016-03-04,24458456,Amber,The studio was as described and the location was wonderful. There are plenty of great cafes and restaurants in the neighborhood and it's within walkable distance to the Newbury street. The size of the studio was cozy and perfect for me and my boyfriend.

5640375,68934552,2016-04-07,2297370,Claire,Nice location and room as described. Easy checkin. However there was no hot water when we arrived and the following day - we got a small refund for that but weren't warned beforehand (yet it was a known issue) so we couldn't change our accommodation plans...

4698367,28288732,2015-03-21,20384863,Clara-David,John was a wonderful host and made us feel very welcomed. The location was convenient and the accommodations were exactly as described.  Highly recommend John's West Roxbury estate.
4698367,28846225,2015-03-30,14323729,Amanda,"John's place was amazing! Very nice and super clean. Very easy communication the entire time, plenty of off street parking and overall great experience!"
4698367,30151672,2015-04-18,15511540,Gerard,"All arrangements in advance of taking up residence in John's apartment in West Roxbury, the location, and of course the apartment itself, are top end in all ways. Keyless code-controlled access, wifi, in-house laundry facilities, luxurious bed linen, fantastic TV options etc are all exactly as described. Even better than advertised though is that West Roxbury is a wonderful, welcoming neighbourhood, well equipped with a top class local coffee and donut shop, pub & restaurant, walking/running tracks and reputable food/fashion stores within 5 minutes by car. Value for money is at a level difficult to match for Boston/Cambridge. Commute to downtown is approximately an hour by car - it's a small sacrifice for such top-end accommodation."
4698367,30379680,2015-04-21,1996957,Dan,We had a wonderful long weekend at John's place in West Roxbury. There were 4 of us (2 couples) staying there. Everything was as advertised and we found it very comfortable. John was extremely prompt in all communications and he could not have made it easier. I highly recommend it!

4698367,31779443,2015-05-10,28586888,George,"The listing and the property were a great match!  It's quiet, close to public transportation and shopping, and it's a nice neighborhood.  John's family has owned the property for +/- 90 years and it's evident in how they maintain it and how comfortable we felt in staying there.  We hope to stay here on our next trip to Boston."
4698367,32678868,2015-05-20,28160153,Gaye,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and we absolutely loved it.  We received detailed and accurate descriptions of how to access the apartment and operate the items therein. The apartment was exactly as pictured and described, spacious and lovely.  West Roxbury is a great neighborhood. Never once had a problem finding a parking space on the street.  Lots of extras that came in handy (fan, hair dryer, scads of kitchen utensils, lots of hangers).  John was even very gracious when one of our party, in his quest to learn as much as possible about the door locks, accidentally locked us out.  John had to send a poor chap over to rescue us.  We were more careful after that. Plus there's a convenience store on the corner, a grocery a couple of blocks away, and a donut shop nearby.  What more could a gal ask?"
4698367,33231041,2015-05-26,28133168,Cathy,"We enjoyed everything about our stay in this beautiful apartment in West Roxbury.  Everything was exactly as pictured and described (or better!).  John was prompt, professional and helpful in all communication.  The apartment is very clean, spacious, comfortable, newly refinished and has everything you could need.  Really everything was fantastic - beds super comfortable, crisp clean linens, well equipped kitchen.  Big bright windows and easy parking on the opposite side of the street.  Our kids asked if we wanted to live here!  We hope to stay here on our next visit to Boston.  Highly recommended."
4698367,35226318,2015-06-16,30617904,Amna,"This was our first Airbnb experience. Excellent first time, the place was clean with many windows, full equiped kitchen, and nice neighborhood. Make it up in my mind as future target when I come to Boston Again. Thanks John."

Just a little bit hot in the living room since there is no AC there..And the bedding is not that clean..we washed it by ourselves..But overall the apartment is good! We recommend!

The apartment was spacious and clean and well stocked with dishes, linens, etc. to make our stay comfortable.  We never had a problem finding parking on the street and were more or less able to park right in front of the house.  Access to the house was easy and convenient, letting us arrive at a flexible time and easy access to the commuter rail was a huge plus too.  No complaints!"

It accommodated our family of four very well."
4698367,43244449,2015-08-18,28862026,Lindee,"Didn't get the chance to meet John but he was always contactable. The apartment was big and true to pictures shown, comfortable for 4 persons. We each had our own sleeping areas. Fully equipped kitchen which made it convenient for us to prepare our own breakfasts & suppers. Free parking was available for our car too! Will recommend other travellers to use this apartment when visiting Boston."

John is very responsive and organized (provides all the information needed for the house in one message).  The  location is very nice.

4698367,48193320,2015-09-24,3923966,Erik,The place felt like home for our almost week long stay.  Plenty of room and comfortable places to stretch out.  Close to restaurants and the very cute downtown area of West Roxbury.  I would highly recommend this place to others.
4698367,49121259,2015-10-01,5899143,Randy,"We had a wonderful weeklong stay at John's place in West Roxbury. The property was just as advertised and the photos really do give it justice! It was spacious, yet cozy at the same time and clean too! While it's a little bit further away from downtown Boston, it was walking distance to a commuter rail line (about 25 minutes to Back Bay stop). If you do rent a car, street parking is not a problem at all."
4698367,49636886,2015-10-05,42727816,Antoinette,The neighborhood is nice and the rental looked exactly like the photos.  John was very nice and quick to respond to any questions that arose during our stay.

Took some effort to get to know train & bus connections (schedule and map/directions in apartment would be useful), but once we were orientated, it was easy to get around. Convenient stores nearby. John was a helpful, contactable host."
4698367,50756347,2015-10-14,36949352,Marcia,Fantastic! Did know where to stay in Boston but knew we didn't want to pay the outrageous prices in the hotels of Boston
Right from the beginning our experience was fantastic!!! John answers questions faster than timely.,,,,,
The apartment was spotlessly clean and well appointed.,,,,,
We parked the car and used the MBTA to downtown and to Cambridge,,,,,
Although there were several restaurants handy we used the grocery store that was a block away to prepare 2 of our evening meals.,,,,,
Great experience! Thank you John,,,,,
"We will be recommending you to any Boston bound friends\"",,,,,
4698367,51534816,2015-10-21,7099322,Ruth,"Communication prior to our stay was good and complete.  this unit uses keyless entry, so arriving late at night, as we did, was very easy.  The unit was just like the photos - very nice and very clean.  parking was available right there on the street - again, as advertised and easy as pie.  We didn't spend much time beyond sleeping, bathing and coffee drinking, so we can't say much more!"

The quiet neighborhood, close to stores, with good public transportation, pleased us too.  When we inadvertently locked ourselves out of the apartment by pushing the door handle button, John's family came to our rescue immediately.  Their friendly response made us feel so much better, just what you need in an emergency."

4698367,56280329,2015-12-11,24726004,Graham,Due to flight delays I ended up checking in about 1:30 am. The 24 hr check in capability was so helpful as I didn't have to bother anyone at that hour. I ended up having a very relaxing stay.

4698367,70717199,2016-04-20,16836262,Rhonda,"John's apartment was perfect for our stay in the Boston area.  The apartment is nicely furnished and well equipped.  Neighborhood is great, and we walked to shopping and restaurants in the area.  Major shopping is a very short car ride away.  Access to the city is easy through light rail and bus/metro system and Uber.  The fact that you can park a car on the street in front of the house is a huge benefit.  It was easy to access the apartment due to electronic combo locks, because we arrived separately and very late.  It was a pleasure to meet John's mom when she stopped by during our stay.  We really like the West Roxbury community, and would definitely stay here again."
4698367,71147687,2016-04-24,61979379,Kyle,"Place was great, just as described with easy access to the unit and around the area; Really loved the fact we were close to the train station."

I actually got to meet Steven Falco when I accidentally locked myself out and he was such a wonderful man to come and let me back in.  Very cute apartment that actually has more space than it looks.  There was one small draw back and I don't know if it was the season, but there was an inordinate amount of bugs in the house.  Lots of tiny little crawlers, spiders, especially in the first bedroom.  I think that can be easily fixed with a bug service."
"\"",,,,,
4698367,79717899,2016-06-13,11059597,Kathleen,"John is extremely responsive, responding to questions within a few minutes. We were able to check on a bit early and the place was very clean, spacious and well furnished. The beds were comfortable and the sofa was easily made up into a comfortable bed. The neighborhood is quiet and residential. Close to businesses but on a quiet street. There were quite a few stairs up to the door which was a bit hard for my 90 year old mother but she managed ok. Something to think about though if there are any mobility challenges in your party. Parking was fine on the street. There are not tons of spaces but we were always able to find one close to the house. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston."
4698367,80475932,2016-06-18,45518795,Wing,"John's is an exceptional host. Weeks before we even arrive, he have already send me a message of every details regards of this listing. I get everything that we need upon arrival."

John answered all of our questions and was very responsive when I would call or send him a text.

It's a 3 minute walk to the train station which takes you right into the city in about 1/2 hour. Or take a LYft (cab) right into the city for $20. The apartment was clean, near a grocery store and big enough for us and another couple with lots of space. FREE parking and easy breezy to book and check in and out. If you're looking at so many house that you don't know what you've even looked at! Stop here our stay was excellent! Thanks John"

The pictures don't really do it justice,as this was a lovely flat that had everything that we needed and more.,,,,
The air conditioning in combination with the fans kept the flat nice and cool,as we were visiting in a particularly hot/moist time of the year.,,,,
transit was a quick hop and a skip away and got us downtown in about 30 mins. Groceries were nearby along with great coffee and places to eat.,,,,,
There was always street parking available during our stay,which was a big plus for us as we were lugging around a minivan,,,,
The only negative thing I can say about the flat,"is that now my wife has a whole bunch of new decorating and painting ideas for our home. \"",,,,

Josh did a marvelous job of communicating with us before,"during and after our stay. He provided a clear list of \"\"guidelines\"\" for the place",checked in with unobtrusive texts to make sure we were finding what we needed and made us feel at home.

I found a really good place to stay when I'llbe back to  Boston."

12436115,72240014,2016-05-01,68723023,Candace,"\"Definitely not a pretty place. There is a reason why there is no pictures. Was told I would get a $100 back because of my disappointment with the condition of the place upon arrival but never received it. Allan used the words, we aim to \"\"please\"\" when I was booking this place. I was also told it looks similar to his other postings and lets just say it really took away from the whole experience  of Boston. This place is dirty and there is an old carpet throughout which smells moldy. For the price"
12436115,75743511,2016-05-22,69437365,Yasmin,"Unfortunately, the experience was nothing like we hoped. Major safety issue with this place. The apartment has a sliding glass door that opens to outside, that doesn't lock! We were shown this by the property manager, and informed that the only way to prevent it from opening was to lean a plank of wood on it at a certain angle. It took us 20mins to get this plank propped at an angle that wouldn't allow the door to open, but even then, who knows how well that would've held. This major safety issue should have been brought up to us BEFORE we booked, or even arrived. We did not feel safe at this apartment, and do not recommend anyone to stay there until this door has a working lock. We didn't feel safe staying here & we are requesting a refund as we stayed with friends for most of our time in Boston."
12436115,76798770,2016-05-29,71891614,Christopher,"Alan was very polite and prompt when it came to  communication. Everything we needed was provided in the apartment, just as listed. Apartment was a 10 minute walk to the subway, easy to get around. It was exactly as pictured, though the sofa bed wasn't the type I expected and was a bit uncomfortable, but that was my incorrect assumption. Bed was quite comfy. I would certainly stay in one of Alan's places again."
12436115,80230512,2016-06-17,64646476,Ashley,"Wasn't what I expected , it was in a basement , no air condition , no fans , there was a sliding window that you had to put a peach of wood in the close , and could be open from the outside , but everything I open the window flys and bugs would come in . Other then that nice quiet neighborhood , very nice host"
12436115,86207860,2016-07-15,78502528,Nkem,"A 10-12 minute walk to Maverick T station. Neighbourhood itself is half decent. The apartment left a lot to be desired, and the entrance hallway fives an early indication of what to expect. As Alan said, it's not the Marriott, but then we weren't expecting a five star place. However, we could've done with some clean sheets and a once over with a vacuum cleaner. We did get some clean towels later. Despite its flaws, Alan was communicative made sure we arrived safely as we landed late."
12436115,90039008,2016-07-31,42763912,Laure,"Nothing was done to make us fell like home when until now we always discovered places where our host would let us a note, with cookies, wine, coffee candies or breakfast set...etc !"

Jenni was quite accommodating and has a great little place in the back bay. Beautiful and clean with an excellent central location to the T, bars, shops, and restaurants...including Fenway park, where we were able to catch a game. We would happily book with Jenni again!"
12626504,75573418,2016-05-22,10432120,Daniel,"nice neighborhood and apartment.  Jenni made it easy to connect with her to get in.  Explained  everything in the apartment and left her number in case I had questions.  Close to great shopping and dining, walk to Fenway Park and Boston Pops"
12626504,85352139,2016-07-11,6095662,Kelsey,"Our stay with Jenni was great! Jenni is really nice and helpful and was at the house to hand over the keys and show me around the place. The apartment is adorable - it feels like you walked into an Anthropologie ad. The bedroom itself is pretty small, but there were only two of us so it worked well. The apartment is also located in the middle of everything: right next to Newberry street's great restaurants and shops, a 15 minute walk to Fenway part, a 20 minute walk to the South End."
The apartment is so cozy that we were tempted to stay in and watch a movie,"but there is so much around it that we had to explore. I'd definitely recommend this for any type of traveler. The adventurer/explorers will love the central location and the business or low-key travelers will love the home-y feel. \"",,,,

Nos fueron a buscar a South Station, nos llevaron por comida y nos ayudaron mucho con las valijas (teniendo en cuenta que veníamos de vivir 3 meses, imagínense el volumen de las mismas! jajaj)"
Super limpio,ordenado. Muy hermoso! Ademas,cerquisima del Logan Airport.,,,

8252058,46684181,2015-09-12,41617022,Christopher,We had a great stay in Boston with very caring hosts. The location is great - a nice and tidy room in the apartment with 3 min walking distance to the airport and good public transport connection to the city center. Definitely recommended!
8252058,47136255,2015-09-15,44121019,Viki,"The neighbourhood is nice, the room is exactly the same as described and the hosts are the best! they picked us up at the airport, showed us the nearest T-stations, gave some advices where to go to eat, what to see."

We especially liked the train clock, and nury's morning juice was fantastic!  She even had time to give us a ride back to the airport when we were running late.  We would definitely stay here again the next time we're in Boston!"

Very comfortable accommodation,,,,,
"Would definitely use again \"",,,,,
8252058,50371963,2015-10-11,1111810,Ofir,GOOD:
Nury is a very warm and nice person.,,,,,
She drove us to return our rental car at the car dealership. We really appreciate that. She gave us a good restaurant recommendation in her area,and was in general very welcoming and friendly.,,,,
BAD:,,,,,
1) The night we checked in,while talking to Nury,we had a large mouse running between us. Unfortunately that issue gave a huge negative twist to our stay. From our conversation with Nury it seems to be an on-going issue at her building. She makes an effort to seal openings and not store garbage in the apartment,but it doesn't seem to remove the problem completely.,,
It made us use the apartment for as little as possible and very uncomfortable for the time we were there.,,,,,
2) The bed has a very poor quality spring mattress. We could feel the springs imprint on our body while lying on it and having very weak support. Woke up with a sore back.,,,,,
3) The place doesn't have Wi-Fi. Since we were traveling from a different country,we rely heavily on Wi-Fi for our internet and communication,and found that to be limiting.,,,
4) Airbnb has a Verified ID badge for Oscar Cruz to build trust. We never met him and he doesn't seem to be the real host. He seems to be a friend of the actual host. It was weird and confusing to understand who is our host.,,,,,
VALUE:,,,,,
"I usually believe in \"\"you get what you paid for\"\".",,,,,
In this case we spend a total of $275 (CAD) for our 2 nights,with no real value for our money.,,,,
It was the most expensive airbnb trip we ever had,yet unfortunately the worst airbnb experience we ever had.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
8252058,50604673,2015-10-12,8413965,Charisse,"Nura is an incredibly kind & warm lady. She was accommodating and great w/ keeping in contact. Her place is welcoming and comfortable. Safe neighborhood, walking distance to public transit & Logan airport, and close to Boston. I would definitely stay w/ her again. Private, well sized room. Large kitchen, which she is happy with you using. Great place to stay if you plan on being in Boston a few days and are wanting a place to come home and relax at."
8252058,50707698,2015-10-13,37145178,Jocelyn,Nury did a great job making us feel welcome and comfortable. She was very flexible in our arrival and was quick to show us around both the apartment and the close by neighborhood. The room was comfortable enough and definitely satisfied what we needed it for (the night before we left Boston). Nury is a very conscientious host and wants all of her guests to enjoy their time there.
8252058,51172076,2015-10-18,44758996,Natalia,"Wonderful host, great location - close to the airport and metro. Nury answered all the questions about the city. We recommend a lot this Airbnb!"
8252058,51340527,2015-10-19,39057162,Michael,Nury was a great host.  Although it was a very brief stay as I had a flight that left very early in the morning.  Getting to the airport was very easy since the place is so close to the airport.  The room was very clean and exactly how it is described.  Would recommend staying there if you have an early flight the next morning.
8252058,51780306,2015-10-24,22096942,Irene,I have no complaints at all about my experience; it was entirely positive! :)
Nury was a fantastic hostess. She's a lovely person,very warm and made me feel like at home. I had everything I needed and she made sure I also had everything I wanted! She even took me to see the skylights of Boston and offered to give me a ride to the airport on my departure (which was at 3:30am). I'd definitely recommend staying with her and will return if I ever go back to Boston.,,,,
I didn't spend much time around the neighbourhood,"but it seemed fine. The house is really close to the airport train station and 2 minutes by car from the actual airport. There are shuttles connecting the train station with the airport.\"",,,,
8252058,51802531,2015-10-24,46112507,Bennett,Nury was very quick answering all emails and texts with questions I had.

8252058,52356168,2015-10-28,39864655,Andrew,"This was a fantastic first experience on Airbnb! Nury had everything prepared and told me everything I needed to know. The room was large and comfortable, and the apartment great with a nice balcony to eat breakfast outside! The location is excellent; walking distance to the airport terminal (and even shorter by using the airport shuttle) and also the local subway station. Nury was kind enough to show me around her East Boston neighborhood which was great! She really loves where she lives and now so do I! I will certainly visit Boston and Nury again!"
8252058,52464415,2015-10-29,336254,Christian,Nury is a lovely host!  Her place is well located and very close to the airport. There are a few nice places nearby like Marva's at the Maverick Street Café just off Maverick Square.  Nury organized everything beautifully to let me in even though she was out when I arrived. She left coffee and tea and was an excellent host.  I would definitely recommend.
8252058,53400207,2015-11-08,18007021,Giorgio,The room was exactly what we needed and what we were looking for... and how it looked on airbnb. Nury was a kind and very welcoming host and she was available for everything and anything. Would recommend this place to future airbnb stayers.

The instructions to get into the apartment was easy, and it is very close to the airport making it the perfect place to stay when arriving/taking a flight. There were coffee, tea and wine for us when we arrived, and in the morning (very early) she offered to drive us to the place where we were going to rent a car."

She helped us by communicating multiple times about how to get to her home as quickly and affordable as possible after 20 hours of travel from the Faroe Islands.  I was very sick on arrival and she made me hot tea and even found me cough medicine!  She drove us to the airport the next day!  She was so kind and her apartment was beautiful, clean, warm, and the PERFECT location to get to  downtown Boston.  Staying with her was the best way to end a very long trip.  I recommend her AirBnb very HIGHLY!"
8252058,55597751,2015-12-02,16399155,Mat,Nury was very helpful when I stayed at her place recently. It was closely located to the airport which was very helpful to me. I would stay there again. Thank you Nury!!

Although I wasn't able to interact with her as much as I would have liked, she always greeted us with tea and food. She was also very hospitable by sharing with us full access to the comfort of her home. She was very accommodating when I asked her about her wifi - Nury took the opportunity to have it fixed right when she was free. When we left she even made sure to drop us off so we could easily get to our destination. We can't thank her enough for the wonderful stay for our first Boston visit."

She is quick to offer tea or coffee for you upon arrival, wifi, ask about any needs, and make sure that you are well taken care of.  I would easily stay there again, as the visit was too short. The warmth of welcome, hospitality and cozy apartment with an eager host who loves her city is worth more than a pricey airport hotel room!  She was not worried that I came in at midnight and had an early flight."
From Boston Logan airport,take the Blue MassPort shuttle to the 2nd stop by the Rental Car center,go right and then downstairs,and out that exit to the cars. Hug the right wall and exit toward Embassy Suites.  Walk 2 blocks. Return on GROUND floor for Blue Shuttle (not back to 2nd floor) and in less than 5 minutes you are back at Boston Logan airport terminals.,,
"From Boston Logon you can also get off at the Blue Shuttle's first stop which is the \"\"T\"\" or Blue Line of the Boston MBTA / metro into the city itself",and can use that from her place to visit the city.  (Walk around the stadium).,,,,

We had an overnight stopover in Boston and her apartment was easy to walk to using the free shuttle from the airport and getting off at the rental car stop or the MBTA airport stop, if you want to walk through a park. We really enjoyed the location, which is great for late arrivals needing a bite to eat (Nury recommended Ecco and La Hacienda, the latter was fantastic!). There was also 24-hour drugstore nearby. The bedding was clean and seemed new and we felt very comfortable staying there. Thanks, Nury!"

Just around the corner from the airport,and that close you can even take the free airport shuttle (#33 or #55) to the rental car pick up point and just walk to the apartment.,,,,
If you have luggage; just keep in mind that there a few flights of stairs but once you walk in the door - you would have totally forgotten about that.,,,,,
Her apartment is less than 10 min walk to airport train station,which takes you straight into town in about 20 min!,,,,
Alright so the essentials are ticked off,but then you see the lovely/clean/spacious 2 BR apartment  and meet Nury and you feel right at home!,,,,
We stayed 2 nights,and enjoyed Nury's company so much that we didn't want to leave. Definitely made a trip to Boston :),,,,
Nury has all the things you need; a big cozy big,plenty of space in the room for luggage,a TV,hair dryer,the most amazing towels in the universe and a very good pressured shower!,

We had never used air bnb and we were really worried about sharing someone else's space but it turned out perfectly; it was almost like staying in a real hotel room. Nury was so nice she always asked us how our day was and if we needed help with anything for our next adventure; it was like having a mother there to watch over us and make sure we got back safely. We were so happy with this listing we started planning more trips in the future

Our room for the night was clean, comfortable, & provided everything we needed on the final night of our vacation.  We appreciated the TV in-room.  Our shared bathroom was clean & shower was enjoyable.  Our communications with Nury were great; she replied quickly to text & email messages. We would not hesitate to stay with Nury again if we return to the Boston area.  Her apartment was really close to Boston Logan Airport, certainly within walking distance.  Nury even gave us a ride to the airport for our flight home as it was cold & rainy – way above what she needed to do as a hostess.  Thank you Nury for your hospitality & kindness during our stay in your home."

8252058,77385683,2016-05-31,11314578,Leo,"Nury is absolutely lovely. The descriptions were accurate and Nury was prompt with her communication. This place really is very walkable from the airport. Took me no more than 15 mins to get from the apartment to the check in desk, including waiting for the shuttle bus 1 block from Nury's house. There are plenty of restaurants within 10 mins walk, and the metro to Downtown is just a few mins walk across a park. I highly recommend this place."
8252058,77812160,2016-06-03,59550337,John,Listing was Accurate. Nice and Quite Neighborhood within walking distance from BOS.  Little welcome note made it personal. She made coffee in the morning for us ...

She went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed, including a place to store our luggage before we even (technically) checked in. She was so sweet and the place is clean and a perfect location- two stops in the T to downtown and just a couple blocks from the airport. I would definitely stay there again!"

We enjoyed our time at Nury's!"
8252058,78555014,2016-06-07,4600309,Brian,"Nury is a delightful, hardworking, lady with a friendly and engaging personality.  We had such a short stay but felt like we got to know her because she is so open and friendly.  She has a perfect place which is ideally located for the airport and yet very quiet.  We had a very comfortable night. We felt welcome and comfortable sharing with Nury and her humble home is clean,  well appointed and nicely decorated with little pieces of art and objects.  The bed was very comfortable.  We had to rise early for a flight and this was no problem for Nury who saw us off with a smile.  We would be very happy to stay there again."
8252058,78983326,2016-06-10,8900026,Gerit,"Nury was very nice, friendly and helpful. My mother and me arrived at different times, but that was no problem. I loved the bed and sheets, everything was cosy and very clean. A wonderful place to stay. Even so we were close to the airport the neighborhood was very quiet and we did not hear any planes. It was a quiet home and the neighborhood was peaceful. Nury is a superb host. Thank you."

When I met her in person, she was very friendly and offered me water and tea. The bathroom was very small in this apartment, but that was fine because I only needed a room for 1 night."
8252058,79828982,2016-06-14,55400430,Roger,"Before we traveled, Nury gave us all the information needed to find her apartment and to get in (in case she was not there.  The apartment was easy to find--just ride on a free airport shuttle and a nice 5 minute walk through a park.  We enjoyed spending time talking with Nury, and when we needed some private time that was graciously given."
8252058,80160486,2016-06-16,681244,Brad & Lizabeth,Nury was very kind and hospitable. She gave accurate and helpful directions on how to get to her place from the airport as we were just staying the night during a layover. The space is as shown in pictures. We would recommend Nury to future travelers!

8252058,84079844,2016-07-05,24887026,Susan,"Nury was quick to respond to our questions. We stayed only a weekend and it was in a great location to quickly get to the airport for an early flight. There is also a free shuttle that brings you close to her place and from there is a 5 min walk and also another 10 min walk to the harbour. It is also easy to get to the blue line or silver line to reach downtown boston. Even though Nury was away while we were there, she was in easy contact for questions and left descriptions of where to find things; keys, wifi, maps, etc. I would stay here again."
8252058,84973907,2016-07-10,79398612,Sterling,"My flight was delayed 3 hours and I arrived late, but Nury was extremely helpful and stayed in contact to ensure I had all I needed. I would definitely stay again and recommend her to other guests."
8252058,85149391,2016-07-10,16748024,Daniel,"Small but comfortable BR with own AC and wide-screen TV. Bed was comfortable. BR is on corner of building so not sharing walls with anyone (less chance of noise). The apartment is also small but it has what's needed for a tourist who's not going to be there most of the time. Location is good, close to Logan ($12 cab or half-mile walk from Airport Station) and near many restaurant choices. Third floor walk-up. Nury was clear in her communications and responded instantly to any questions. She was warm and welcoming. I would stay her again if I needed a place close to Logan."
8252058,85979320,2016-07-14,42286571,Mark,Very near the airport and host Nuri is super cooperative and sharing. Stairs to third floor are steep-- but she was honest about that. Bed not very comfortable.
8252058,86424591,2016-07-16,77139524,Jessica,"Nury was an outstanding host, really helpful and incredibly easy to talk to and hang out with. Her place was lovely and she was very kind letting me leave my bag there at the day of my departure so I could go into Boston and then pick up my bag and shower before I left. Very convenient for the airport and I would definitely stay again!"

It's ideally placed next to the airport and car rentals. Nury gave me directions to a local bar on arrival, would definitely stay again."

8252058,92195785,2016-08-07,58911984,Sonja,"I was only there for one night between two flights, but Nury gave a lot of information in advance and was very helpful. She also gave me the number of a cheap taxi company (50% of what I paid from the airport). The room is nice and the bed comfortable.  For me it was convenient because it is near to the airport. It is on a third floor (two stairs up) and without elevator, but she says this in the description. I was able to leave my suitcase overnight in the Airport Hilton Hotel"
8252058,92660468,2016-08-09,81699779,Felix,"Nury was an amazing host. Nice, caring, open minded and very very helpfull. Communication worked great. Nice appartment in a great and convenient location."

8252058,94020957,2016-08-14,20899346,Florian,"Nury war eine gute Gastgeberin, es war alles vorbereitet und ordentlich. Wir waren leider etwas vom Jetlag betroffen und früh im Bett. Die Anbindung an die Innenstadt war schnell und unkompliziert, nur 2 Stationen mit der Bahn. Vom Flughafen kann man zu Fuß in wenigen Minuten zur Wohunung laufen. Nurys Wegbeschreibung war hervorragend und alle Informationen im Vorfeld auch."
8252058,94371196,2016-08-15,49418114,Julia,Best Host ever - 10/10☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆
Nury is the sweetest host I had since my first ever Airbnb rent. The place was very clean,close to a Subway,very close to the airport  (within walking distance) and overall great. Nury herself was really supportive when we asked for information about Boston or even other things. We are sad that we only booked one night at her place. Our room had everything we needed (TV,Water,WiFi,a cozy bed and more). We were even allowed to leave our luggage at her place after check out because our Bus home came late at night! Over all I would give Nury 10 out of 10 ☆ Stars. Thank you for making our already great time in Boston even better!
"If we ever come back to Boston we will definitely book at your place again!!\"",,,,,
8252058,95135015,2016-08-18,281213,Mia,"Nury was a friendly host. She communicated fast and helpfully by texting, which was important when arriving late after tiring transatlantic flight and staying for just one night. Unfortunately we had a chance to see each other only just before we left, when leaving and taking out our luggage. The peaceful flat was located conveniently close to the airport and to the city, so we recommend it to anybody arriving by plane!"
8252058,96706374,2016-08-24,70919469,Christoph,"Nury was a great host. She communicates fast and well and everything worked out nicely, despite the fact that our both schedules were completely out of sync and we actually never saw each other. Solving this, she texted me to make sure I have everything I need, which was really helpful."
The apartment is located really close to the airport,which means traveling back home is easy,"plus you only need two stations to get to the Aquarium in the north end. \"",,,

8252058,97477771,2016-08-27,84485120,Maddie,"Nury is the best host I've ever had. She was so kind and went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. She even dropped us off at a restaurant and came back to get us so that we wouldn't have to hull around our luggage, then she proceeded to drop us off for the shuttle to the airport. Although our stay was short, I'm leaving feeling like Nury is family. Cannot recommend her enough!"
8252058,98546964,2016-08-31,24676099,Jerry,"Nury is so far the best host I've ever met. She is very nice, happy, and enthusiastic about everything. The place is just as described: super close to the airport, nearly walking distance; convenient to get to Downtown Boston thru subway; very cosy room and has just everything I needed. I would love to recommend anyone who is going on a weekend go-away."
8252058,99347692,2016-09-04,61420130,Art,"Nury was great. Our flight was delayed and even though it was late she was inviting, friendly, and helpful.

2823378,12226664,2014-04-26,14332287,Isaac,I got to the apartment at midnight and that was not a problem with 24 hour key service. A guy showed up at the door about 10 minutes after I had called and handed me the keys to my room.
I was also there for an interview. It was a get into Boston and get out kind of trip. My interview went past noon (the usual check-out time),and Tiffany allowed me to leave my things in the room and I ended up leaving at 3pm with no fuss.,,,,
The room was awesome. Bigger than most of my college dorm rooms. It had a microwave,sink,tv,"and an iron. Internet was painfully slow though. The apartment is also walking distance from everything in Downtown Boston. Definitely would recommend this place over other Boston airbnb's!\"",,
2823378,12260607,2014-04-27,14518123,Benjamin,"This room is in a great, very convenient location and all amenities were as advertised. Check-in was easy and flexible to my schedule, and Tiffany is responsive and very easy to deal with. Recommended."

2823378,13578519,2014-05-31,940284,Barbara,"I stayed at Tiffany's place for 9 nights while I was attending a conference. The location was very convenient, and the streets and homes around Beacon Hill are so beautiful. The street and the room were quiet. The other residents I met were mostly medical students / interns doing their rotations at Mass. General Hospital. The room itself was small - but perfect for my needs."
Tiffany was also a great hostess. She directed me towards places to shop and areas of interest in the neighborhood.,,,,,
"I would definitely stay there again!\"",,,,,
2823378,14932880,2014-06-29,17397,Cute Studio,"A management programme at MIT led me to Boston. I booked one of Tiffany's rooms through Airbnb and enjoyed my stay. The room was clean, and Tiffany reached out to me on the first day to ensure that everything was ok. Beacon Hill is a lovely neighborhood, close to Whole Foods, HubWay bikes, the waterfront, the park and MIT. I recommend this place if you are in Boston for a conference or meetings."
2823378,15975926,2014-07-19,16400375,Minho,"The location is perfect. Staying in Beacon Hill is good. The Price is reasonable. Finally, the host is great. Thank you, Tiffany :-)"

2823378,22193795,2014-11-01,21554332,Valeria,"Collocato in un bellissimo quartiere, a circa 10 minuti di cammino dalla fermata della metropolitana, vicinissimo a negozi e ristoranti. Un ottimo prezzo in relazione alla location. Quartiere, strada e ambiente all'interno dell'edificio molto tranquillo. Buona pulizia dei bagni e delle altre aree comuni, forse potrebbe essere migliorata nelle singole stanze prima dell'inizio del soggiorno, ma comunque non ho avuto problemi. Ottima la disponibilità del personale. Purtroppo non ho mai incontrato Tiffany perché durante le ore di ufficio ero al lavoro, ma è stata molto disponibile via e-mail e SMS. Vengono forniti asciugamani, posate, piatto e tazza; nella stanza sono presenti frigo, microonde e lavandino. La posizione della stanza può essere modificata rispetto a quella che avete prenotato (io ne avevo una assolutamente equivalente collocata al quarto piano). L'edificio è dotato di lavanderia."
2823378,22546500,2014-11-09,22785103,Kota,Place was located in a place.  I don't really care about the interior so it had all the basic needs.  Can't complain.

The room was simple and as described and the property was a 5-10 minute walk from the red line, green line and blue line which was extremely convenient. For sightseers, the Boston Commons was a 5 minute walk. Tiffany was courteous and attentive! Whenever I come back to Boston, I know who to look up first!"
2823378,28028831,2015-03-16,27720884,Rebecca,"Tiffany is a great host! Very attentive and encouraged me to let her know if she could help me with anything, day or night, and very friendly. The room had the basics, plus a fridge, sink and microwave in room, which was very convenient. The location is very close to downtown Boston/North End/ Faneuil Hall which was perfect for me. Will definitely stay at one of Tiffany's locations in the future."

Tiffany was really helpfull from the moment I got the confirmation of my booking and also during my arrival. The appartment in Beacon Hill is centrally located and you've got everything within walking distance - it's just perfect. The room was clean and comfortable and everything was as described. No doubt I will contact Tiffany again next time I'm going to Boston.
2823378,30145959,2015-04-18,29227821,Megan,"Absolutely amazing! Even before checking in, Tiffany took care of everything I needed and answered any and all questions I had. From how to get there from the Station, to making sure I knew how to get to the Boston marathon expo; she was incredible! The room was really cute too. Everything was super clean, the bed was comfy, and it was in an ideal location for exploring!"
2823378,30376575,2015-04-21,23864564,Jeff,"The room is exactly what was advertised. No frills. However, it was just what I wanted. I was in Boston to run the marathon, without a car, so I needed a quiet place close to the race venues. It was perfect for that. Plus, everything else I needed was within short walking distance (grocery store, bar, subway stop). I also spent the following day walking to various tourist destinations. Tiffany was accessible and helpful, got me oriented with good suggestions and directions to where I wanted to go. Even though my flight out was much later, Tiffany allowed me to stay past check-out, which gave me a full day for sight-seeing."

2823378,31779797,2015-05-10,28983907,Irene,Tiffany contacted me prior to my trip and was available with room keys shortly after my arrival.  The room was quiet and I slept well both nights resulting in some much needed rest. I have found Tiffany to be very responsive to requests/inquiries.  The neighborhood is very walkable and the location is very near my Boston family members.
2823378,32167307,2015-05-15,9226325,Karen,"Perfect location! Great for touring all the sites in Boston -- so many within walking distance!  Nice room, clean and with all the necessities. Shared bath arrangement was perfectly acceptable."

2823378,32559042,2015-05-19,21563161,Raymond,The host was very nice and accommodating with a call in key service since I came on a Sunday afternoon. The place reminded me of a college dorm room with shared restrooms and laundry/trash room. The room itself was small but enough for a single guest and had a AC and cable TV which was great. Tiffany also provided some flyers for tourist attractions which was also helpful. The location for me was the great selling point as I got to check out Beacon Hill and the surrounding neighborhoods by train or walking. The neighborhood was safe and close to shopping and restaurants.  I was out for most of my time so the room was a perfect place to drop off my stuff and unwind a bit before going to bed. I would recommend this place to any of my friends who would prefer location over luxury (it has got all the basic amenities right)

"I enjoyed my stay!\"",,,,,
2823378,36933995,2015-07-02,13574990,Jane,"This was my first airbnb experience and it was a good one. My husband and I made an emergency visit to Mass General Hospital from our home on Martha's Vineyard, and I didn't have time to find lodgings until around 3 PM that day. Tiffany responded immediately to my inquiry and was incredibly helpful and patient with me. An hour after contacting her I had a key to a clean, safe, and perfectly adequate room a 5 minute walk from the hospital in a charming and historic Boston neighborhood. And the cost was $100 a day less than the cheapest hotel option. It was a lot like my experiences in European pensions back in the seventies. There is a Starbucks down the street, Whole Foods and good restaurants a quick walk away and some great Historic Boston Karma."
2823378,37741868,2015-07-10,31806199,Jim,"This is located in a great neighbourhood and about a 10 minute easy walk to Tremont Street and Park Street T station.  The room is as it was described, and as such a modest room,  and it was  a great value.  Everything was clean and the check in and out were seamless."
2823378,38196343,2015-07-13,18726252,Clay,"This place is conveniently located in Boston, and allows easy access to all neighborhoods in the downtown area by foot or train. Beacon Hill was such a safe place at all hours of the day; I felt very comfortable with the room and location of this building. The room is exactly as described - you've got a bed, tv, kitchenette, and desk. The bathroom and shower are down the hall for use by all of the tenants on the floor, but everyone was very quiet and respectful. I would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Boston. Tiffany was very responsive and helpful throughout the duration of my stay. Thank you Tiffany."

It is exactly what you would need, not luxury, but you are out in Boston so it's not like you need it anyway. Would most likely stay here the next time I visit :)"

2374089,13238670,2014-05-23,12532193,Pierre,"Mary fait appel à un contractuel pour remettre les clés de l'appartement. Tout s'est déroulé tel que convenu dans notre cas. Nous avons adoré l'appartement: l'emplacement est idéal pour explorer la ville, près des transports en commun. L'ameublement et la décoration sont de très bon gout, la cuisine est utile (mais nous ne l'avons pas beaucoup utilisée), la salle de toilettes est de bonne grandeur et fonctionnelle, avec des robinets de douche comme je ne les avais jamais vus! Tout était impeccablement propre. Aucun problème avec la télévision et Internet. Fortement recommandé pour un séjour à Boston!"
2374089,45553663,2015-09-04,6262680,Nicholas,"Mary's Studio is gorgeous! Quintessential Boston in my opinion. As we approached the neighborhood getting to the building we knew we made the right choice. The Brownstones in the area are lovely.  The building where this studio is located is no exception. The studio is perfect, great older floors that creak perfectly when you walk, beautifully redone kitchen, lovely tall ceilings and windows, and an awesome street view. The check-in & check-out procedure was flawless."
Location,location,location. And did I mention location? This studio is in the perfect spot. We walked everywhere,literally. To MIT & Harvard,Chinatown,Little Italy
Mary's studio was very well equipped for our week-long stay. Everything was very neat,very clean,and very organized. Just how we like it. Perfect space for 2 people. Beautiful full kitchen. Very comfortable bed. Nice TV too! I noticed the Jawbone Bluetooth speaker,but we didn't use it. :),,
The weather was warm during our visit,but the a/c unit had no problem cooling the space.,,,,
We wouldn't hesitate staying here again. We absolutely loved it! Thank you!,,,,,

Mary was so very accommodating (providing directions, recommendations, and a clear outline of how to coordinate obtaining entry).  Her place perfectly matched the description and images that are provided. In regards to location, it is smack dab in the center of everything and on on of the most beautiful streets in Boston. We were even impressed to see that her apartment included a French Press, yoga mat, grocery cart, luggage rack and hair dryer. In addition to all this, Mary's timely correspondence and attention to detail were just the cherry on our sundae that was a wonderful vacation in Boston. Tip: Be sure to read the guest book left on the table upon arrival, as it includes wonderful (URL HIDDEN) and tips from past visitors (including us now)!"

1966195,15341343,2014-07-07,4885460,Khristopher,"Great place to stay. It is like a lux hotel with pool and gym. The check in/check out was smooth and they give you welcome packages for the kitchen and bathrooms. It's very ideal for 3-4 people, or families that want a full kitchen and 2 bathrooms. Great views of the Charles river, just next to Chinatown."
1966195,15829572,2014-07-16,9929284,Joyce,"I was in Boston for a conference with some colleagues and needed a central location to stay. Booking this apartment was super easy and check in was very quick. The apartment itself was clean and very well appointed. The view from the apartment was amazing so we found ourselves running back after the conference each day to catch a glimpse of the sunsetting over the Charles river. We didn't get a chance to use the gym or pool, but did drop in to look at these amenities and were quite impressed. I would definitely stay here again if I'm ever in Boston for a conference again."
1966195,16256200,2014-07-24,4423068,Carolyn,"The stay was fabulous! From start to finish, check in was smooth and the concierge were excellent! Conveniently attached to a greatly priced parking garage (relative to the rest of the city), it was easy to come and go. Taxis are easy to come by and many great places within walking distance. The only thing was, we chose this property for the beautiful pool, but it was unfortunately closed for maintenance. Still, the gym, computer cafe with free coffee, and lounge areas were great! And if the pool was open, oh man, that would have been the icing on the cake. The apartment was fabulous and spacious for three people. We loved the little welcome kits and all the info was well organized. There was shampoo, towels, toothbrushes, all sorts of vanity and mending kits, hairdryer -- you really had all the conveniences of a hotel! We would definitely recommend this place for business or vacation stays."
1966195,17691233,2014-08-16,7148504,Vina,This was an AWESOME apartment with fantastic amenities in a SPECTACULARLY convenient location. Check in and check out was easier than at a hotel. And there were extra clean sheets and toiletries. There was even packaged detergent and sponges... everything we could possibly need. Host was very quick to respond regarding all questions and was even able to accommodate an extension mid-stay. A million thanks for a GREAT time in Boston.
1966195,18185662,2014-08-23,15782836,Kevin,"We were very pleased with our accommodations on our recent trip to Boston.  The apartment was very nicely furnished and extremely clean.  It also included a special kitchen package with some of the basic necessities (soap, laundry detergent, paper towels, etc.) and two packages were also included in each bathroom (soap, shampoo, tooth brush, toothpaste, etc.)  Very nice touches that were appreciated."
The Chinatown location is also close to the Theater district,the Freedom Trail and the train stops.  One night we took the subway to Fenway.  Very easy back and forth.,,,,
I would definitely stay here again.,,,,,

1966195,18421238,2014-08-26,18656676,Tina,"Great location and a wonderful alternative to a hotel for our family group. This apartment offers more than we could have had in a hotel for a better price too.  The only downside is the lack of grocery stores nearby.  Walkable to downtown Boston, Boston Common and the Harbour. Subway stop right outside the building too."
1966195,18890715,2014-09-02,3179360,Juhi,Location! Location! Location! Cannot even begin to explain how convenient the location is. Hotel feel with home-like comforts. This is a great alternative for all your travel needs. I would definitely recommend this to family and friends.
1966195,19942926,2014-09-21,4421451,Chris,"This was an excellent, nice place. Communication was excellent and checkin and out was easy - the building is great and has a front disked that is staffed 24 hours, so you just check in at the front desk. The apartment itself was very nice, well-stocked in the kitchen and even and a washer and dryer. It has cable television and wireless internet access, both of which worked great. It was nice to be able to keep coffee, creamer, snacks, breakfast foods on hand, and, of course, with the full kitchen it would be possible to do whole meals if you wanted. With so many great restaurants nearby though, we usually had lunch and dinner out. The building has a nice gym and a swimming pool. It is in a great location with easy access to most anywhere int he central Boston area. There is a rail station just out side the front doors of the building and bus stops within  few feet. This place is a great value and really, really nice."
1966195,20505239,2014-09-30,20092809,Kelsey,"We had a fantastic time in this apartment! Amazing location, great apartment with every amenity you could ask for! Heskel and his team couldn't have been better to work with! Everything was super easy and well communicated! If we're ever back in the area and in need of an apartment, hope to stay here again."

1966195,22019943,2014-10-28,3548793,Donna,Perfect location for exploring Boston.  We were able to park the car and walk everywhere we wanted to go.  The apartment was wonderful.  It was extremely clean and very comfortable.  Everything we needed. The welcome package was very much appreciated.  Would highly recommend.

1966195,22707198,2014-11-12,8870113,Meridith,Great building great location great host!  Everything was perfect and very smooth.  Clean apartment in a nice building 30 second walk to the T and very centrally located!  It was very comfortable for 4 girls the two full baths were key ;) We would recommend and stay there again!
1966195,69328050,2016-04-10,22938859,YuYen,"The location is perfect, only one minute walk from the China town station. Actually most of the tourist attractions could be arrived by walk. The environment is so clean, and the queen size bed is very comfortable. The building make me feel like staying in hotel, with 24hr frontdesk service, friendly doorman, and a lot of public area. (Ex. swimming pool and gym.) There is good Wi-Fi, TV is equipped in every room. Towels, hair dryer, and shampoo...etc are all provided."
Basically it's a wonderful experience,only one thing I hope could be better. The building didn't allow us to deposit our luggage after we checked out,which is very inconvenient for tourists. And the doorman finally suggested us to contact Churchill customer service,and ask if we could leave our luggage in the apartment since there was no another guest later in the same day. But no one answered phone,"even we left message and no one replied back in the whole day.\"",
1966195,70762538,2016-04-20,265722,Blair,I would recommend this apartment and location for anyone who is looking to stay comfortably in Boston either for two days or for months. The unit included two separate bedrooms and full bathrooms as well as an in house laundry unit which really helped my sister out who ran the Boston Marathon and she was able to clean her clothes (bonus if you are a runner)
We were also pleasantly surprised by the packages for both bathrooms and in the kitchen for the supplies we would need in order to stay again comfortably and feel at home. We totally did.,,,,,
Thank you Mike for great communication,an amazing apartment and an easy vacation to Boston.,,,,
my only tidbit of info... if you are traveling and get into the city earlier than 3:00pm they will not take your luggage for you here at this building. My suggestion is to check your bags in at the Marriott at Copley Square,tool around the city,pick up your bags at 3:00pm and then get into your apartment you will be staying at.,,,
"Enjoy your stay and I look forward to coming back and using Mike as my host!\"",,,,,
1966195,71498688,2016-04-25,49267367,Eli,We had to book this place short notice due to another host cancelling last minute. Mike was very helpful in answering each and every question I had. The staff that gave us the key to our room was very friendly throughout our stay. Would definitely stay here again.
1966195,76699957,2016-05-29,5545032,Huib,"Mike has been great. He was very responsive to my emails and requests.

1966195,85879712,2016-07-13,36848027,Chafica,"The location is ideal! Close to Chinatown, 2 blocks from Boston Commons and a short walk to the Financial District (Quincy, the Aquarium, ...) as well as to Beacon Hill. The appartment was very nice and though the building is a little busy, we hardly heard our neighbors on the 16th floor. The only slight inconvenience is that if the appartment doesn't come with a parking space (ours didn't) then parking becomes exorbitant especially that we weren't able to negotiate a weekly or bi-monthly rate. All in all this was an excellent choice and we would definitely stay there again!"

From Boston College to Tufts to Boston University, it was easy to get around. It was a gigantic help to have parking onsite. Everything in the flat was perfect, it was comfortable, and had all the necessities of home."
The location of the apartment was wonderful. Right across the street we got breakfast at Swissbakers and rented bikes from the Hubway. We also caught the T from downtown Boston to Harvard Square,where it was just a short mosey back to the apartment.,,,,
Flatbook was very good about checking in on us. We heard from them shortly after our arrival and again during our stay. When I contacted them with a question,I got a response within minutes. Even before we arrived,the response time and the information they provided was quick and complete.,,,

The only frustrating part was 1) they didn't communicate ahead of time what needed to be done. For example,only when I emailed them for checkin instructions the day before my checkin,they responded saying I had to upload my ID to receive this info. I was never asked to do this when I booked for the reservation months ago. Also there was no instruction on wifi until I had to call them. 2) We were initially only given one key,yet 4 of us were staying in the apartment. We did manage to get one more key but it was still inconvenient,"given that not all of us had the same schedule. \"",

We needed to be near MIT so it's perfect, but there's also T nearby to take us to downtown or any attractions we wanted to go. Go Boston card is the way to go. Great restaurant nearby as well. Check out S&I Vietnamese, awesome food with great price! Front desk and parking guys are helpful as well. My only recommendation is to have a welcome package more informative i.e. map, T map, menus of restaurants nearby and perhaps more supplies in the kitchen. Also, the A/C in one of the rooms was programmed to set at 82 in the middle of the night every night, so we had to get up at 3 or 4 am to change it. We tried to change it before we went to bed, but didn't work. Other than that everything is great. We will stay here again."

3229255,19382616,2014-09-11,20437443,Ponni,I had a wonderful 11-night stay at Ella and Will’s. They were welcoming and obliging hosts. I was able to get in touch with them with ease and they were very quick to respond. They were kind enough to assist me with sightseeing ideas. They were receptive when I raised a few minor problems and rectified them promptly to ensure my comfort.
The apartment is well located in a good,quiet neighbourhood and is easy to find. There are parks within walking distance and good restaurants and a supermarket a 5 minute walk away. It took about 30-40 minutes to get to downtown Boston (via bus and subway). The commuter rail will get you there quicker. I felt safe returning late at night.,,,,
The apartment was as shown in the photos. It was simple and well-kept. The kitchen was fully equipped. The bedroom and walk-in wardrobe were spacious. The bed was very comfortable and the room was air conditioned. There was a very helpful folder in the apartment with information about the local area as well as Boston travel guides.,,,,,

We stayed a complete month in Roslindale,and working in Downtown Crossing (centre of the city),it was very easy to use the public transportations. The area has a lot of buses that take you to Forrest Hill - the train station - (no more than 15 minutes) and from there it's only 20 minutes to downtown. Roslindale has a lot of different restaurants,grocery stores,a lovely bakery (Fornax),and they have every Saturday a farmers market. We don't have a car

Ella et Will étaient très attentifs, disponibles et réactifs. Par exemple, nous avions besoin d'un ouvre boite, nous avons frappé à leur porte et ils nous en ont fourni un. L'appartement est comme un cocon, agréable il correspond à la description faite par les hôtes, le fait qu'il soit sur deux niveaux est pratique pour laisser de l'espace à chacun des invités. De plus, il y a à disposition une farde avec pas mal d'informations utiles (transports publics, sites à visiter, infos sur le logement) et des guides de la ville. Pour la localisation du logement, le centre de Boston est facilement accessible en transport en commun, ce qui permet de profiter pleinement du séjour. En conclusion, nous avons été pleinement satisfaits de notre séjour dans ce logement."
3229255,28520948,2015-03-25,27334985,Judith,"Ella and Will were excellent hosts and made me feel welcome before and during my stay. The apartment was very comfortable. It is located in lovely, quiet neighborhood but is close to public transportation."
3229255,29005664,2015-04-02,28781624,Hong,"It was a great experience to live in this warm house! The block was peace and quiet and hosts are really nice. We have got everything needed and kitchen, washing stuffs and other facilities are very easy to get on. Thanks for bringing us a really pleasant experience here!"
3229255,29411742,2015-04-07,25213007,Diana,"Me and my boyfriend stayed at Ella and Will's apartment and it made our first experience in Boston even more memorable. It was clean, warm and cozy. Location of the apartment was in a very cute town with transportation everywhere. Ella and Will were excellent hosts and we are definitely making our way back again!"
3229255,29743615,2015-04-12,28050567,Pascale,The apartment was perfect for our three-day trip to Boston! The large and beautiful bedroom easily accommodated our baby's pack-and-play. The apartment is perfectly clean and was exactly as announced.
We especially appreciated Ella's kindness,who took time to give us plenty of recommendations for our trip and even lent us some baby books. All of our questions were immediately answered and we would be glad to stay there again.,,,,
The neighborhood is calm and pleasant,and there are plenty of shops and restaurants,"cafés minutes away.\"",,,
3229255,30046660,2015-04-16,17657444,Julie,"My husband and I and our 9-year-old son just got back from a great 4-night stay at Ella & Wills sweet little flat. It was the perfect size to kick back in after a day of touring the sights, with everything we needed to prepare our own meals (complete with the tea, coffee, and milk that was provided for us). The bed upstairs was very comfortable, as was the air mattress that our son slept on. We had no problems finding on-street parking at the end of the day, and the neighbourhood was nice and quiet. The flat is only a short walk away from the centre of Roslindale village where we found several great restaurants, a grocery store, and more. The commuter train into Boston was also only a 5-minute walk away and took us 25 minutes to get downtown during the week. Ella & Will were also the perfect hosts - very prompt responses to all of our questions, and provided great information to us when we arrived on how to get around. We would highly recommend Ella & Wills place to anyone looking to travel to, or stay in Boston!"
3229255,30444592,2015-04-22,6902153,Rosa Nelly,"Because of travel schedules, I did not have the opportunity to meet either Will or Ella but this did not pose any issues.  My son, who also stayed at the apartment, arrived a day earlier and met with Will.  He tells me check-in was simple.  Ella sent me several emails days before my arrival with last-minute instructions and tips and also encouraged me to reach out to them by email or telephone if any questions arose."
3229255,30702314,2015-04-26,18413455,Catherine,"We had a wonderful experience staying with Ella & Will. They were very accommodating from the beginning-- when I was struggling to fulfill the airbnb vetting requirements,to providing a key for our later arrival ,to smoothing over a minor difficulty with the sleeper sofa. They even treated us to drinks to make up for the very minor annoyance of a roof repair!"
The apartment is clean & bright with every possible amenity. The stairs to the bedroom are rather steep but that is noted in the description & we didn't mind-- just use the hand rail . It is in a great location-- walking distance to nice bistros & bakeries not to mention easy access to the train station . Ella is a charming,"helpful host with a delightful family & We hope to stay here again!\"",,,,
3229255,31512480,2015-05-06,28171856,Phyllis,It was a great experience staying here. Ella and Will were so accommodating and friendly. It was wonderful to have the entire apartment.
3229255,32082117,2015-05-13,32311141,Trinh,"My fiancé and I came to Boston for work and a mini getaway. Will and Ella were great hosts! Will gave me a tour of the apartment upon checking in. They even left us a nice welcome card and bottle of wine which was a nice surprise. The apartment was clean, quiet, private, had wicked fast internet. I appreciate the fact that Will and Ella respected our privacy as my fiancé and I were quite busy and we tend to keep to ourselves anyway. Ella did message me throughout the stay to check in to make sure we were getting around okay and that the apartment was up to par. I especially liked the hand-made manual that Ella had put together for the guests which included information on Boston and how to get around on the T (routes/schedule), sites to visit, restaurants/menus, etc. It was really helpful and I found myself referring back to it several times! The bed was extremely comfortable, appliances and A/C worked fine. We have zero complaints and will be coming back to stay at the apartment soon since we loved it and Boston so much! We couldn't have asked for a better lodging experience!"
3229255,32692277,2015-05-20,30588251,Loli,We stayed and Ella and Will's apartment while visiting Boston for my sister's graduation.
The apartment was big enough to accommodate three adults (one bedroom and one sofa bed).,,,,,
Around the apartment there are cute little places to buy pastries for breakfast and it is very family oriented.,,,,,
If you are planning on staying here to spend most of the time in the downtown or Commons area,beware of the distance. It is absolutely doable with Uber and taxis,but it's a little far (about 20 minutes in regular traffic,and between $15-20 per ride),,
The apartment itself is beautiful,lots of light and has everything you need. We didn't get a chance to meet the hosts,but Ella was really forthcoming,accommodating and quick to answer emails. They took time to make sure our stay was going ok (even though they themselves were out of town).,,
"I would highly recommend their place and would definitely stay there again. \"",,,,,
3229255,33149140,2015-05-25,32711620,Amanda,"Cute little apartment in a quiet part of town. Everything was clean and well maintained, perfect for 2 people to stay in. Roslindale had many good restaurants nearby, including a bakery within walking distance that had delicious breakfast sandwiches which was super convenient! The ride into the city part of Boston was 10-20 minutes depending on traffic and/or where you were going so that wasn't bad at all! Communication with the apartment hosts was super easy, they weren't in town while we stayed but we're still readily available if we need anything! Great experience all together!"
3229255,33802371,2015-06-01,30502247,Zahra,"Ella and Will are wonderful hosts. The best, one can wish for. Ella texted me before our arrival and explained everything in advance and asked for any specific accommodations we might need."
The pictures are accurate and the house looks exactly as depicted.,,,,,
The house was extremely clean and in order,Ella has even put together a little binder with house rules and useful info about the neighborhood stores,restaurants and local attractions. It also includes two chargeable public transportation cards which helped us a lot. You can use it for riding buses and the metro in Boston. It had some initial dollar amount so you could use it for a ride or two to your first destination(s).,,,
The house is located in the suburbs of Boston but not too far away; about a 20 minute train ride from the house to Boston south station (in the downtown). It is very close to grocery shops and good restaurants. Very peaceful,quiet and relaxing neighborhood/house. We really enjoyed our time here :),,,,
"There is a bus station right in front of the street the house is located in and the train station is less than a 5 minute walk. The only thing I would recommend if you're using the public transportation is to take the bus to the \"\"forest hills\"\" station (about a 10 minute bus ride) and then from there take the orange metro line to downtown Boston. You will save more money this way. The pricier",yet more straight-forward option is to take the commuter train from the Rosindale village station to Boston south station.,,,,
There was also a rich resource of brochures and info sheets of all you can do in Boston and it's vicinity.,,,,,
"I hope you choose to stay with Ella and Will and enjoy all they have to offer :)\"",,,,,
3229255,34327628,2015-06-07,15486275,Graham,"This is a great apartment in the best neighborhood in Boston. Ella and Will are very friendly, thoughtful and have prepared the apartment  to be a home away from home. Their children are lovely and an added ray of sunshine.  The apartment had everything you might need for a couple or small family to be comfortable for even a long stay. The mattress is soft and comfortable. The location can't be beat. Roslindale is a gem of a neighborhood and the distance to the commuter rail and main area of town are a very easy walk.  I highly recommend this as a place to stay and we plan to return if possible."
3229255,34633287,2015-06-10,3024120,Verna,"The communication in the lead up and during our stay was excellent, detailed and prompt. Ella and Will made us feel very welcomed, not just on their initial greeting, but also in the welcome note, flowers and wine. They thought of everything to help their guests to have a comfortable and easy stay. And very clean! We really valued the information folder that they put together, with tourist and transport information and train tickets that we could use and replace if required. Their place is in a great location with restaurants, fantastic bakery, village market etc. Bus stop just a few steps in front of their place to take you to train station. Only about 20mins to downtown from there. Thank you Ella and Will. Would strongly recommend you to anyone."
3229255,35391252,2015-06-18,32013769,Susan,"I came to Roslindale for a very special birthday party. I found Ella and Wills listing and it was a perfect fit for me. It was the location and space that first grabbed me, but it really was the all the wonderful reviews they received from former guests that sold me to choose this apt. Ella knew I was flying in on an overnight flight and offered me the apt available at 6am. to freshen up before the special party-WOW- how cool is that- very thoughtful and kind and personal. They were away when I arrived but left very detailed pictures and instructions on how to get there and enter the apt. In the apt I found a lovely personally written note welcoming me along with a hand made book of the local area, restaurants, bus schedules and bonus -2 charlie cards for transportation -another -WOW- Even more thought went into the welcome by finding wine and milk in the fridge. They truly extend a personal welcome. Will called me that arrival evening to make sure everything was ok. I was lucky enough to meet them once during my 4 night stay as they were dining in the yard with their  children. We  all saw the first seasons fire-flies. As for the apt it was as described. Very clean and comfortable, foam mattresses were soo comfortable to sleep.. AC worked great on the one hot night while there. The roku was great too-- caught up on my series-. Bathroom had everything you need, soap, shampoo, towels..... It is a very quiet area, great restaurants and easy walking to everything. They are great communicators in keeping in touch with you during your stay. I would absolutely stay here again.  I truly felt they cared about my stay and did above and beyond what I expected  and it showed."
Very detailed  hosts,,,,,
"Susan\"",,,,,
3229255,36100286,2015-06-25,23230859,Niki,Ella & Will were excellent hosts! Everything we needed was in our quaint apartment and it felt like a more natural experience to stay in the neighborhood vs. downtown Boston.
We had a rental car and driving in and out of the city was easy. There was also ample parking in the neighborhood.,,,,,
Our favorite activity was to walk down to Roslindale Square every morning to grab some breakfast from the local bakery before heading off to our touristy stuff. There's a great local market as well.,,,,,
If you're looking for the Boston neighborhood experience,this is it!,,,,
The apartment was also clean and pleasant. Overall,"it was an excellent stay.\"",,,,
3229255,36566457,2015-06-29,28346046,Russell,"We had a wonderful stay with Ella & Will. From the start they were incredibly accommodating, particularly when we had some travel plans change. There apt was exactly as advertised.  We had sufficient room for ourselves and 2 little ones under 3 and it was lovely to be able to spend some time downstairs in the kitchen/living area while the kids slept.   The area is just a block away from Roslindale Village and Ella & Will had a large book describing places to go in the area.  We had a lovely dinner at Sophia's Grotto and enjoyed a few trips to Fornax for coffee and baked goods.   They are only minutes from the commuter train and we were able to get into the city for the afternoon without trouble (and headed back in time to enjoy a wonderful Farmer's market in town on Saturday afternoon).   It was a lovely trip and we're looking forward to visiting Boston again soon!"
3229255,36897317,2015-07-02,20887937,Inho,"Thanks to Ella and Will, we had a great stay at their apartment.  It's very cosy and well maintained (i.e. super clean). The welcome process was quick and efficient.  The apartment is in a great, beautiful  location close to many shops.  And all the necessities are available in the kitchen to cook a meal.  It rained couple of the days so that's exactly what we did."
My family and I had a great time and we would definitely come back here again.  Highly recommended.,,,,,
"Thank you.\"",,,,,
3229255,37959274,2015-07-12,6788731,Margaret,"Ella met two of us on the first day and explained how the apartment worked. Pictures are accurate and the apartment is clean and fresh. there is now also (summer) a fan in the downstairs window which brings in the cool evening air. I came later and had missed the instructions and directly meeting with Ella but she was very accommodating and quickly answered texts and emails. (they were out of town) so had a very nice stay. Easy access to town less than 5min. and its shops, restaurants and cafes. Very nice location if you are visiting family in the area. Also only short walk to trains and 15min into Boston itself. Enjoyed sitting outside for breakfast and in the evening."
3229255,39619217,2015-07-25,14166811,Olivier,"We spent two weeks in Ella and Will's appartment, we had a very good time there. The neighbourhood is very nice, with many local shops and  it is convenient to go downtown Boston."
The apartment is large enough for two with a baby,and is well equiped. We even could use the garden and the bbq,which is very nice for hot Boston summer nights !,,,
Ella and Will were very friendly,even if they were in vacation when we were there. They regularly checked on us to see if everything was fine and very quickly answered the questions we had. The only issue was that we could not meet them !,,,,
"\"",,,,,
3229255,40452982,2015-07-31,12268972,Katie,"Ella and Will were great hosts. We didn't meet them, but checked in with us regularly to make sure we got in okay, our stay was comfortable."
The apartment was clean,was as we expected per the pictures. We all had the essentials that we required. We didn't explore too much in the neighborhood (Roslindale),quiet suburb area and not much to do,"but the apartment was conveniently located next to a bus stop to get to the major areas in Boston.\"",,
3229255,40925087,2015-08-03,33614676,Megan,"Ella was a great host! She was out of town when we arrived so we did not get to personally meet but she was very quick to respond back through phone, text and email! The house was a little farther away from downtown than originally thought but Ella had a binder of all the great things to see and eat in the area and how to ride the T so it wasn't bad at all! She even had a couple T cards with money on it for us since there was no where to pay at the first stop near their house. An adorable letter and a bottle of wine along with milk in the fridge and some other things like tea were at the house when we arrived!! So open and friendly and the house was so warm and cozy. Didn't realize there was no A/C but the fans cooled it off perfectly so no worry on that! Overall our trip to Boston was great and Ella was a perfect host! Even when one of our scheduled tours got cancelled, she was quick with ideas and ways to fix it! I would highly recommend Ella's Apartment!! And the pictures are exactly what the apartment looked like! Thank you for an amazing stay!"
3229255,45671843,2015-09-05,37195338,Wendy,"It was my mom and my first time in Boston and our first Air bnb experience and I have to say that the decision to stay in Ella and Will's home was one of the best decisions I have made regarding accommodation so far. The place is as pictured and is very clean and spacious (which was a paramount feature we considered during our search for a living space, since our stay was long term). Ella and Will were extremely helpful and considerate with every aspect of our stay from helping us carry our heavy bags into the house to giving us awesome restaurant recommendations. Overall, I highly recommend this place for anyone that is planning a trip to Boston. Thank you Ella and will for everything !"
3229255,50265725,2015-10-11,22422920,Alessandro,"Abbiamo trascorso quattro settimane a Boston, ospiti di Ella e Will. La casa è molto carina, pulita e confortevole, proprio come nelle foto. Si trova in un quartiere tranquillo, silenzioso, fornito di ogni tipo di negozio e/o ristorante, ma soprattutto, molto ben collegato con la città, tramite i mezzi pubblici. La casa è indipendente, dotata di ogni comfort (cucina, lavatrice/asciugatrice, TV, wi-fi, riscaldamento/AC, ecc). Will ed Ella sono dei proprietari fantastici! Sempre attenti e disponibili, simpatici e gentili. Con i loro tre bambini sono una splendida famiglia. Per noi è stata una fantastica esperienza, speriamo un giorno di tornare!"
3229255,53244241,2015-11-07,7552655,Benjamin,"We really enjoyed our stay. The appartment is family-friendly (we spent three days with a one year old baby), very clean and for us it was spacious enough. It was also equipped with everything we needed including kitchen equipment. Ella and Will were great hosts and there was also information in the appartment about what to do in Boston and surroundings. The neighbourhood is nice and there are a lot of restaurants and other shopping / grocery facilities in walking distance. We did not try the public transportation system but a station should also be in walking distance. For a stay with more and / or older kids the appartment can be a bit too small. We would definitely come again and thank Ella and Will for the great stay in Boston."
3229255,53635238,2015-11-10,47339299,Vonnie,"Ella and Will were very considerate, honest, and helpful hosts.  From the initial rent request they were prompt to respond and answered all questions thoroughly.   The neighborhood was safe and offered a friendly corner market and a tasty Greek restaurant where we ate breakfast one morning.  We loved the bed, so comfy.  We found the apt very comfortable and clean.  Though the steep stairs to the bedroom posed no problem for us, they might be challenging to anyone with mobility issues."
3229255,54759471,2015-11-23,36326988,Becky,Great base for exploring Boston. Exactly as advertised. Very good value. Delfino's and Sofia's Grotto were fab.

Roslindale is very safe,has good shops and restaurants! It's easy and fast to go to Boston downtown  by train or subway.,,,,
Ella answered all messages we send before and during the period we stayed their. She helped me even when I was doing my bags telling me what me and kids should wear! We experienced the real spirit of Airbnb!,,,,,
Ella and will are 5 star host!!!!,,,,,
Thanks for the dinner you  offered to us! Thank you very much for receiving my children so well! Ella and will have a beautiful  family and are special host ...,,,,,

And they gave me the good wine and cards  to welcome us, which is very sweet. Ella is a great host. She prepared a lot of tourist guide books and even prepare bus cards! The apartment can actually accommodate 3 people. the aerobed is quite comfy. the location is great. it's close to the bus and train.only takes 30minutes top to go to the downtown.

3229255,73251307,2016-05-07,43208048,William,"Spent 3 weeks at this apartment while visiting for the birth of my grandchild. It was walking distance to my daughter's home which was ideal. Also convenient to downtown Roslindale, the T station and a local park. There is a binder with a wealth of information about other local offerings as well as numerous books."
I found the place to be clean and neat and was a lovely little getaway at the end of a long day. Stairs to bedroom are a bit steep but navigated them fine. Laundry was available,and again stairs but nice to have access to a washer/dryer. Requested that you supply your own detergent so something to keep in mind.,,,,
"I would definitely stay here again for an extended stay. Met Ella the owner who is a lovely person. Very accommodating and accessible. A good find....\"",,,,,

Roslindale Village square is just around the corner,and it's easy to catch the bus to Forest Hills station.,,,,

3229255,76490771,2016-05-27,1432846,Gracie,"This was our 1st visit to Boston and Ella & Will's place was a perfect base. My husband and I stayed with our 1.5 year old and the space was a good size and very clean, pictures are very accurate. We were welcomed with wine, a card, and a handy binder of information on the neighborhood and greater Boston. Ella even provided a booster seat for my son so he could sit at the table. The upstairs bed was very comfortable and fit all 3 of us, although a pack n play was available that we didn't end up using. The Forest Hills T station is a few mins away by bus (stop is at the end of the block) so we used that every day to get to the T and into Boston - very easy and fun for my toddler to ride buses and trains. It was about 45 mins to Harvard for graduation and about 20 mins into downtown. Ella & Will were easy to get a hold of, both before our stay and during our stay, and were very nice when we met them during our stay. Would definitely stay at their place again!"

3229255,81806885,2016-06-25,47170296,Katie,Perfect place to stay! My friend and I needed a place to stay while we waited for our apartment become available. It was super convenient to be so close to the commuter rail so I could get to work in Boston. My roommate has a car and street parking was easy. Only spoke with Ella once in person and she was really sweet. Throughout our stay they continuously checked in on us via the Airbnb app to make sure we had everything we needed. I would definitely stay here again!

We were very glad and happy live there!"
3229255,93221033,2016-08-12,78796728,Arelis,"I stayed with both my parents at Ella's and Will's place and we loved it. Although we did not meet the family because they were away during our stay, Ella was super helpful and I felt as if we already knew each other! The place was very clean and we felt right at home! We also liked the neighborhood a lot(I-not so secretly-wanted to stay living there). The Rosindale village is great and full with interesting and useful stores within short walking distance. There is a pharmacy, supermarket, home made bread store, Indian food restaurant (delicious!!!!), and many other we did not get to see since our main focus was Boston city and Berklee College. So we can attest that transportation to and from the city is also super close (bus stops less than 3 minute walk from the house) and convenient. We would recommend this place to anyone who is going to Boston and we would definitely stay again!"
3229255,95236265,2016-08-19,32013769,Susan,"This is the second time I have stayed at Ella's & Wills. I love this place. It is clean, quiet and comfortable and they are amazing hosts. Communication with them is easy and fast.  They check in with you when you arrive and again when your leaving . They really do care and I feel the love they have in their care of the apt and the guests. On both my visits I have taken an overnight flight and they have made the apt available to me for early check-in. I come to Roslindale to visit family, but this location is walking distance to Roslindale Village with their great shops and restaurants and to the Commuter Rail. They are 5 STAR hosts and I hope to come back to their apt next year. P.S. I love that Ella has made a special folder  for their guests, detailing the area, restaurant menus, maps , bus and train schedules- which you will find on the table when you arrive."

3434614,15369726,2014-07-07,17409488,Eveline,"Keshav was a very welcoming and friendly host. He was great with communication leading up to our stay, and when we arrived he showed us the apartment and had put together a list of some highlights that were close by in location. The apartment is located is a very fun and convenient location, 5 min walking distance from the T station (North or Haymarket)."
"We really enjoyed our stay! Highly recommend it.\"",,,,,
3434614,18861683,2014-09-01,18015514,Kate,We really enjoyed our stay at Keshav's apartment! It was very centrally located and gave us all the comforts and independence of home plus very easy walking-distance access to most of Boston's top attractions. Keshav responded very fast to all our inquiries and was very flexible with our arrival and departure arrangements. Highly recommend!
3434614,24350303,2014-12-26,24326149,Victoria,"Keshav ha sido bastante rápido respondiéndo a los mails. A nuestra llegada a Boston ha sido muy atento y nos ha resuelto todas las dudas. El piso es muy bonito y está muy bien ubicado, cerca de la estación sur y muy cerca del red trail, además de ser una zona muy céntrica se encuentra dentro del barrio italiano, y puedes ir andando a las mejores zonas de la ciudad."
3434614,24620937,2014-12-31,21282767,Anthony,First trip to boston was made great by the fact that Keshav's apartment was in immaculate condition and very spacious!
It's in a great location in the city walking distance to amazing restaurants and to the subway.,,,,,
"I would highly recommend staying here and would do so again!\"",,,,,
3434614,24779837,2015-01-02,1354294,Sophie,We had a short stay of 2 nights at Keshav's place but it was a nice apartment !
It's very well situated in the Italian neighborhood. We could try some great italian food and pastry for dinner.,,,,,
Keshav was very helpfull as we had several problems on the road to be there on time to get the keys while he has a flight to catch.,,,,,
Also,he answer very quickly to all our questions during our stay !,,,,
"I would gladly recommand him ;) !\"",,,,,
3434614,26716191,2015-02-17,17894951,Jamee,"Great location, and the place was as expected. Had to extend one more day because of the blizzard and Keshav was very accommodating. Will be happy to stay again!"
3434614,29333780,2015-04-06,29634588,Julie,L'endroit était super bien situé dans un chouette quartier. Il était facile de trouver les endroits clés à partir de cet appartement. Vraiment super bien. Appartement propre et spacieux. Tout était super! Merci :)
3434614,30351253,2015-04-20,11246904,Jordan,North End perfection!
Keshav was a great host and responded quickly to any questions I had.,,,,,
Situated in the heart of Boston's North End,Keshav's home was located in an ideal location.  Once you step out of the front door,you're in the middle of it all:,,,
- Right next door is Parziale's Bakery whose cannolis,in my opinion,are better than Mike's and perfect accompaniment for that cup of coffee.,,,
-The surrounding neighborhood is filled with Italian restaurants,but the most memorable ones were Neptune Oyster and Pauli's which are a 5-10 min walk away.,,,,
-The LAZ parking garage is a less than 10min walk away (roughly $36/24 hours),and...,,,,
- right near the garage are tennis courts with Hill Bridge in the background and basketball courts.,,,,,
- A few of spots off of the Freedom Trail are just several minute walks from Keshav's apartment.,,,,,
The apartment itself was more than enough for the three of us that stayed there. The couch converts into a bed,if need be. The Bose speakers were our best friend--hook up your iPhone and BAM,instant dance party (all the while being respectful of your neighbors,of course). Beware of lookers as the apartment is on the first floor (dance like no one's watching,right?!).,
"Beautiful home. Beautiful neighborhood.\"",,,,,
3434614,33851763,2015-06-01,27223810,Jonathan,Keshav's apartment was just as advertised. Perfect size for 2-3 people in a perfect location. The apartment was clean and ready for our arrival complete with a print out containing fun facts and locations to visit. Keshav was easy going and helpful when I asked about places to eat and ideas around the neighborhood. Overall the experience was just what I was looking for. The AppleTV was a plus as well!
"I recommend this apartment for anyone looking to stay in Boston. The North End is a perfect location; walking distance from to any major Boston attraction. Amazing food as well in a predominately Italian area. \"",,,,,
3434614,35171690,2015-06-15,14105626,Carlos,"VERY well-situated in the heart of Little Italy.  I was able to walk to Haymarket Subway station and go anywhere in the city.  I actually walked to Charleston, Bunker Hill, and Boston Harbor (tea party attraction).  The noise level was low at night and lively in the day time.  I really enjoyed myself."
The apartment itself was clean and everything worked fine.  I was able to watch HBO,but I didn't try the WiFi.  I don't know whether Keshav offers WiFi or not.,,,,
"I hope to return with my wife next year to the same (URL HIDDEN) was quite memorable.\"",,,,,
3434614,37413583,2015-07-06,37061913,Frank,Pictures are accurate in a great part of town.
3434614,40983669,2015-08-03,34818388,Marianne,"We were very pleased with our stay at Keshav's apartment. Our interactions with Keshav were very pleasant; he was responsive and accommodating. The apartment is a great size and very tidy. It is in a fantastic neighbourhood, safe and close to everything. A few doors down from bakeries and restaurants, but not noisy. We walked everywhere!"
3434614,48777730,2015-09-28,35250062,Rachel,Great place to stay when visiting Boston! Location could not have been better! Place looks just like the pictures - very clean and comfortable. Host left some recommendations and guide books. Endless eating options around you and easily walk-able to anywhere you would want to go. Would stay here again.
3434614,49567209,2015-10-04,6413665,Kevin,This apartment was in a great location in the heart of North End and was surrounded by nice restaurants just a block away. We enjoyed our stay. Thank you!
3434614,51374498,2015-10-19,20702257,Mani,Perfect location and unit in the heart of great restaurants and sites including the popular Mike's Pastry! Keshav was very easy to communicate with and addressed any questions I had quickly. Highly Recommended!
3434614,59541021,2016-01-11,894437,Gavin,"What an amazing place in such a great location!  Never met Keshav, but he was very accommodating!  Thanks for the wonderful weekend!"
3434614,68460267,2016-04-05,40789721,Hunter,"This was the perfect place to see Boston from - its on the North End, with a wonderful bakery two door up and several good community bars within walking distance  - the picture for the place tells the story - comfortable. Keshav made it easy to get in and stayed in contact to help with anything that might have turned up. Very clean, contemporary. If you are visiting Boston for a weekend - a great place to operate out of!!"
3434614,71180397,2016-04-24,22682010,Franchelly,"The apartment was really pretty and comfortable with a lovely location on the first floor!! After moving all around Boston, I would not change this location! I only wish we would have known with enough time we had to bring our own towels. On the listing this is not clear and definitely should be as in all of my previous stays using Airbnb I have been provided towels. Keshav noted this to us late night the night before our arrival and I only realized this when we were already on our way to Boston. Upon arrival, we had to run to the first place we could find that sold towels (a TJ maxx) before they closed which made our arrival to Boston a bit of a hassle. So people please note you should BYOT. Also there were dirty clothes (including underwear) in an open hamper in the bathroom which in our view could have been put away prior to us arriving."
All else was perfect (hot water,good air conditioning,tv with an apple tv (no cable)) and Keshav,"is very nice and highly responsive.\"",,
3434614,73561638,2016-05-08,4010792,Jaime,Enjoyed staying at Keshav's apartment. Great location! Great cozy apartment. He made it very easy to arrive late as we did. It was the perfect home-base for a Boston weekend.
3434614,75369040,2016-05-21,4668763,Andrea,"A comfortable and tidy apartment in the perfect North End location, right in the heart of it - loved it! Right next to all the Italian delis your heart could desire. Short walk to the green line, parking just down the street, $32 overnight."
3434614,75603034,2016-05-22,49344292,Macy,Great directions! Nice home! We had a lovely time. Absolutely no complaints. :)
3434614,76605055,2016-05-28,67583739,Mike,Keshav's place was great. The apartment was very clean and located  very near to everything we wanted to do and see in the city. We had a wonderful stay.
3434614,79594176,2016-06-13,8206366,Jordan,Had such a great stay at Keshav's place. It was ideally located and was a great space. Keshav made the checkin process very easy and was quick to respond to any questions. I would definitely look at staying here again if I'm in the Boston area.
3434614,82346958,2016-06-27,78721061,Isabel,"Our stay in Keshav's one-bedroom apartment was fantastic. While we never met Keshav, he was welcoming, accommodating, and made check-in and check-out easy for us. The apartment was spacious and clean, and was located on a quiet street in the adorable North End neighborhood filled with Italian restaurants and cannoli shops. It was also easy to walk to many of the other neighborhoods. I'd definitely stay here again the next time I visit!"
3434614,92339493,2016-08-08,34229957,Jenna,"Keshav was an amazing host!! He made retrieving the keys to his home very easy, he even went as far as to recommend us places to eat in the area - all of which were exceptional!! His apartment was clean, comfortable, and homey. And the location was beyond perfect! Walking distance to almost everywhere we wanted to go and surrounded by the best restaurants, bakeries, and cafes. Because of Keshav, I have no desire to stay anywhere in Boston again but the North End, and would highly recommend his place!"
9425902,61823937,2016-02-08,48721125,Gary,Camille is very welcoming and went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. The location is excellent and the apartment is very cozy while still very stylish.
9425902,67483275,2016-03-29,11884128,Stephanie,Beautiful apartment in a great neighborhood!  We walked to everything or it was a quick walk to the metro. Camille was very helpful before and during our stay.  When she wasn't around she gave us the contact information of others we could turn to for questions.
9425902,76324357,2016-05-26,66301059,Mahmood,"We visited Boston for a week to attend our son's graduation. Camille was so welcoming and always a quick phone call away if we needed anything. Her place was gorgeous and centrally located in North End. We were only a few minutes walking distance from numerous attractions, North End restaurants, the train station, and a ~20 minute walk to downtown. We had an amazing stay and will definitely rebook when we're back in Boston!"
9425902,80655872,2016-06-19,7139029,Angie,"Camille's place was fantastic.  The location was central to everything that we wanted to do.  Also, it was so comfortable, clean and well appointed.  We will stay there again for sure."

9425902,88426988,2016-07-24,23085796,Grace,"From the very first communication to the welcoming note, Camille could not have been more helpful in making this visit perfect. Her apartment is beautiful, comfortable, quiet, and so conveniently located. The little deck for coffee, the surround sound that connects to my music, the view of the harbor through the tree branches, the comfortable bed, the spacious shower, the inviting living room... I felt at home!  Will absolutely come back to Camille's, and for anyone looking for a place to enjoy Boston yet escape from the hustle, cannot recommend it enough!"
9425902,92394498,2016-08-08,3848784,Monica,"Highly recommend! Seamless check-in along with comfortable, clean, and welcoming apartment make this an awesome place to stay if you are visiting Boston."

I could walk to work downtown and certainly enjoyed coming back to the place. I didn't have a chance to interact much with Camille, but from what I could tell she is kind and a fine host."

Jonathan's home offered me one of the best experience, live like a local.  Since I don't have a car, so you'll want to purchase a week or more transit pass, \"\"Charlie card\"\" from MBTA.

3164650,18884469,2014-09-02,16691471,Lihui,"Jonathan is very nice and helpful. The room is clean. The neighborhood is safe and quite. Bus stop is just 2 minutes away, and take 20 minutes ride to ForestHill T station."

3164650,30513623,2015-04-23,30185078,Fran,"I spent a really nice time in Boston. The house was exactly as in the description (what you see in the photos is what it is) cozy and comfortable. Also Jonathan was a really nice host, he helped me with everything from my arrival to my departure and he has been a great guide to Boston, the public transport, the suburbs, where to buy, etc. Near Legacy Place is really convenient for shopping and the neighborhood is really quiet and safe with great public transport options (train, bus). I can just sincerely recommend this house to everybody who want to live as a local in Boston in a quiet house. Thank you Jonathan!"
3164650,32590191,2015-05-19,32398983,Swagat,"I had a good stay at this place. I did not stay in the room as shown in the figure. I stayed in some another room which he kept ready for me. The room as well as the linen were clean. He also provided a pair of towels for me to use as I did not have any. The neighborhood is in a residential area and it was peaceful. However, visitors should note that they need to share a common toilet (washroom)."

6292261,32283691,2015-05-16,32538352,Jason,"Location, Location, Location!"
Gustavo was helpful and friendly and at the door to greet me. The room was large and airy and filled with character. I stayed for six nights and loved the proximity to back bay and downtown. The T was around the corner and no where was far on foot.,,,,,
I would certainly recommend staying.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
6292261,32924480,2015-05-23,32966093,Xilin,"My friend and I stayed in Gustavo's house on Fayette Street for three nights. The house is in Bay Village, a perfect location for sightseeing. Most attractions of Boston are within walking ranges. Besides walking we also travelled by riding bikes (hubway) and subway (MBTA). There is a hubway station on Stuart Street (6 minutes' walk). Boston hubway bikes are definitely worth trying during the summer. Nearby MBTA stations include Arlington and Boylston (8 minutes' walk) for Green line and Tufts Medical Centre (4 minutes' walk) for Orange line."
The house and room is like what's in Gustavo's description. It was built in 1830s and it feels like staying a piece of history. There is no lift,of course,which is not necessary for a four-storey building. Wi-fi is available in the whole building and speed is very good. The neighbourhood and other guests are both quiet.,,,
All rooms are clean and tidy. There are two bedrooms on 2nd floor and a bathroom is shared. Warm water is always available. Touring brochures are placed on the table of bedroom and Gustavo gave us some advice on sightseeing and dining when we arrived.,,,,,
There are a lovely living room and a kitchen on the 4th floor. Every morning we have our breakfast here which includes bread,yogurt,orange juice and coffee. Personally I think the yogurt is sweeter than I expected,but I guess it should be OK for most people.,,
Overall the 3 nights at Gustavo's place is very satisfying for me.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
6292261,33161857,2015-05-25,31242139,Lauren,Gustavo was a friendly and accommodating host; easily one of the best airbnb experiences we have had. The apartment was conveniently accessible to downtown Boston but was also secluded enough to feel as though we'd been transported back in time to a quiet colonial street. The continental breakfast was delicious. The bed was comfortable and the water pressure was great. Everything was clean! Gustavo gave us some great recommendations for dinner and things to do. He has impeccable taste!
6292261,33527455,2015-05-29,7057862,Anne,Comfortable room in a lovely residential neighborhood just a few blocks from Boston Common. Gustavo provided a warm welcome even though my schedule didn't allow me to meet him. I especially appreciated the early breakfast provided before my conference - wonderful croissant and yogurt!

6292261,34318997,2015-06-07,32717056,Jacob,"Gustavo was a wonderful host to my wife and I.  He was very knowledgeable about the city of Boston.  The location is centrally located, as it is walking distance to Boston Commons, the Theatre District, the North End, and the South End.  It is only a 5 minute walk to great shopping on Newbury Street and to the subway.  The pictures represented the place well, and it gives you the feel of what living in Boston is like.  The bathroom was shared, but was never an issue.  The door to our room had a lock on it, so we didn't have to worry about our belongings while we were out.  It was a nice touch to have breakfast and coffee available every morning.  When we come back to Boston, we will definitely be staying with Gustavo!"
6292261,34644789,2015-06-10,32147960,Katie,"We had a fantastic stay with Gustav.  The room was great, the breakfast he provided was a nice addition and the location of the house is brilliant for exploring the city on foot.  Spot on for what we needed.

6292261,34788765,2015-06-12,4231207,Pamela,"Our host was kind, thoughtful, and very helpful, and responsive to all our many questions.

6292261,35228386,2015-06-16,5303650,Melanie,Lindo lugar para quedarse unos días en Boston!!! Todo resultó tal cual la descripción del anuncio. Gustavo muy buena gente nos recomendó muchos sitios y estuvo atento en todo momento.
La zona muy linda y céntrica. Cerca a las avenidas principales como Newsburry y Boylston llenas de tiendas y restaurantes. También a pocos minutos caminando al parque Boston Common y a muchas más atracciones para conocer. Si no quieres caminar también está la opción de las estaciones del T (Train) que te conecta a todos lados y quedan cerca a la casa.,,,,,

6292261,36194519,2015-06-26,33567792,Shaurat,This was the first time we tried AirBnB and the experience was good. Gustavo was very accommodating and provided great recommendations for places to eat nearby.  The location was perfect and close to the T.  The room was as expected though we didn't get A/C for the first three nights as Gustavo was out of town.  Communication was mainly through email and we saw him a couple of times for the week were there.  Wifi was fantastic and fast.
6292261,36697195,2015-06-30,34410499,Aaron,"Gustavo is an excellent host. Very friendly and welcoming. The building has old world charm. Built in 1835.   The bedroom we had was fairly spacious and comfortable. Shared bathroom is just a step away. Kitchen on the top floor is quaint. Fun alcove to hang out at breakfast time. This rental is close to Boston Commons, Freedom Trail, etc.  We were able to walk everywhere."

And we love the breakfast!!! Neighborhood is amazing. You can almost walk to everywhere you would like to go. Just let you know that the bed is kind of smaller than queen size, which makes it not that easy for two to stay. But definitely perfect for one person. Anyway, this is still a perfect place to choose!!!"
6292261,40938341,2015-08-03,26150656,Isaac,"Gustavo is awesome!  He was extremely helpful (and patient) in answering all our questions before and during our stay in Boston.  I wanted to find a gym and dry cleaning when I arrived, for example, and Gustavo warmly directed me to where I needed to go.  Although, I did find Wang's YMCA which is literally a block from his place which is perfect if you just need the basic amenities ($15/day)."
The house and the neighborhood are both really charming and they sit right in the heart of Boston (just like the description says)!  It was really easy to get to to the places we needed to get to during our friends' wedding weekend despite some of the streets being closed for what was believed to be the filming of Ghostbusters 2!,,,,,
The Continental Breakfast upstairs was a nice addition to our stay and enabled us to check out the rest of the building and meet the other guest(s)!  The air-conditioning in the room was also awesome because it was so hot in Boston during our stay.,,,,,

The bathroom was also nice and clean. Gustavo always made sure we had breakfast and was flexible to what time your need for it was.
The location is in the center of everything in Boston,just south of Boston Commons. Everything is within a 2 mile walk,which is very do-able in a city like Boston.,,,
The room came with A/C which was great since Boston was in the middle of a big heat wave. Towels and robes were provided as well as some bathroom supplies. The bathroom seemed upgraded which was nice.,,,,,

Very close to Beacon street and South End, as well as the river. Gustavo was a very warm and friendly host, gave us lots of advice and tips about where to go, what to see, where to eat etc. Much appreciated! The room was clean and the apartment is quiet, with atmospheric touches of furniture that give you a vintage feel. Shared bathroom, with a bath robe thoughtfully provided!"

6292261,50925589,2015-10-16,35335010,Amarosis,Gustavo was quite accommodating - he messaged me that my room was available earlier than anticipated. He was there to greet me and show me the room.
6292261,51111893,2015-10-18,27756568,Janice,Gustavo was absolutely wonderful and the room was great! Very cozy and welcoming and in a perfect neighborhood!

6292261,51726107,2015-10-24,11207296,Andrew,"My wife and I had a wonderful stay in Boston while at Gustavo's B&B! The B&B is located on a lovely narrow street, footsteps away from Boston Common, Boston Public Garden, plenty of restaurants, and the T-line (Tuft's Medical Center station on the orange line is the closest stop.) We arrived early in the morning after a red eye flight, and Gustavo was kind enough to let us drop our luggage off before check in time. He messaged us when the room was ready, and had recommendations for dinner when needed. The room was cozy and comfortable, and felt like a slice of home. Thanks for making our first visit to Boston a great one!"

6292261,54606380,2015-11-22,46991372,Jonathan,"I was in Boston for 3 days for an event at the convention center, and was worried about where to stay. This trip was many of my firsts: first time staying overnight in Boston, first time traveling alone in the US, and first time using Airbnb. The stay with Gustavo met my needs and totally exceeded my expectations. Despite being in an unfamiliar city alone, the moment I arrived at the place I immediately felt at home. The house is cozy but the rooms are spacious and beautifully furnished. Gustavo was very helpful and knowledgable, providing information about the area and recommendations for meals, as well as letting me know what sorts of people will also be in the house during my stay. The location was great, and it was quite easy to know how to get around by walking or using MBTA. Service was great but not overdone, providing a great feel of privacy. I will definitely come find Gustavo if I visit Boston again."

6292261,70676899,2016-04-19,39388021,Mike,"From the time we made our reservation, Gustavo took steps to make us feel quite welcome.  He communicated with us with details about the reservation, and accommodated our many questions.  As we were new to using AirBNB he also accommodated some of our uncertainties as our reservation day approached.  He met us at the door with keys and welcomed us to the home. The room we had was clean, comfortable, and as described in the on line information.  The bathroom was also very clean and quite convenient to the room.  The community kitchen and social space upstairs was quite pleasant and a wonderful place to enjoy the continental breakfast provided in the morning, and meet others who were there at the same time.  The location of the home was quite convenient, being located just a few blocks from restaurants, shops, and T stations to go anywhere we wanted.  The neighborhood was quiet and provided a break from the hustle and bustle only a few blocks away. We felt safe in our comings and goings at all times of day.

He serves breakfast and coffee in the morning and it was nice chatting with other guests. He was also very helpful with recommendations for restaurants and things to do. The location cannot be beat as it is in the heart of Boston and walking distance from a lot of places we want to see and mass transit. His rates were very affordable compared to hotels and great service. I'll definitely stay here next time I'm in Boston!

Wir haben fast alle Sightseeing-Touren von dort aus zu Fuß erledigen können. Ansonsten ist in wenigen Gehminuten eine U-Bahnstation zu erreichen, von der aus man ebenfalls überall hin gelangt. Die Unterkunft war genau wie beschrieben und liegt in einer sehr schönen Straße, wir haben uns dort immer sicher gefühlt. Ankunft und Abreise verliefen reibungslos. Gustavo hat uns zusätzlich noch weitere Informationen zu Sehenswürdigkeiten und Restaurants in der Umgebung bereitgestellt, die wir auch genutzt haben. Das Frühstück war einfach, aber für uns vollkommen ausreichend. Gustavo war ein toller Gastgeber und sehr zuvorkommend. Wir können die Unterkunft weiterempfehlen!"

I was his first tenant; Chris checked in with me regularly (but not too regularly) to see if I needed anything. When I mentioned that it would be nice to have a lamp in the bedroom, he provided one the next day. The kitchen is well equipped for a short stay. And the location cannot be beat.  A quick walk to restaurant row on Tremont or countless spots in the Back Bay.  Can't say enough good things about the apartment of Chris as a landlord!"

7965521,91750456,2016-08-06,39013029,Nicole,"My fiancé, dog, and I stayed at Chris’s place for about 4 weeks.  It was a great experience! My favorite thing about Chris’s place was the location.  We couldn’t have asked for a better location! Because we were visiting for a long time, we wanted to stay somewhere close to downtown to experience it easily but also stay in a safe, residential area.  Chris’s place is located in South End, which is full of classic Boston brownstones (his place is located in one), tree lined streets, and pretty parks.  I never felt unsafe while staying there.  If I were to go back to Boston this would definitely be the neighborhood I would choose! Not only was the neighborhood great, but the location of his place was only a two blocks from the metro, three blocks from shopping on Bolyston & Newbury streets, two blocks to tons of restaurants on Tremont, three blocks from the Boston Public Library, and close to many convenience & grocery stores."
With bringing a dog,I was a little worried before our trip about finding her somewhere to go outside to play and potty. But we had no problems with it! She adjusted quickly to small squares of grass and close by – about three blocks – there was an awesome dog park (“Carlton Court”).  We went there a few times a week.  There was a ton of space for her to run around and all the dogs were nice.,,,,
The inside of Chris’s place was very nice.  When we arrived it was clean and beautifully decorated.  The kitchen was well equipped with everything we needed – dishes,utensils,pans.  We ate out a lot but when we cooked it had everything we needed. The TV was nice – had all the channels we could possibly want. The Wi-Fi was great as well.  The place has its own modem so it was very fast and we never had any problems (we worked remotely during our trip).  The bed was super comfortable and the shower was really nice!,,,
We loved the courtyard with the place.  It was our own private courtyard where we spent a lot of time eating,hanging out,and working.,,,
Chris was a great host.  His communication to my questions was very quick and he was always ready to help.  When we arrived,he had pamphlets,maps,and articles ready for us.,,
Overall,if we were to go back to Boston we would love to stay at Chris’s place again.  It was definitely a quintessential Boston experience.,,,,

Many thoughtful extra touches.  TV/music system is incredible.  Even the towels were supremely soft!  The host rightly takes pride in what he offers in this home.  Location could not be better - in quaint & historic Charlestown, on the Freedom Trail, steps away from Bunker Hill & USS Constitution, and 15 minutes' walk to the North End.  The host, Alex, was so thoughtful & accommodating.  Contacted me ahead of time to ask about coffee/milk preferences he'd have waiting for us, in addition to some lemonade, which was a great refreshment after a long drive to get there.  Readily available by text/phone to arrange arrival, as well as throughout the stay, and he offered many great recommendations of nearby places to eat/shop.  A terrific value for a place to stay in Boston!  Would happily stay here again the next time we visit the area!"

56937,17747709,2014-08-17,14451283,Ray,"Following is a review of apartment 979759 at Emerson Place, Boston. I would not use Seamless again and would not recommend them. 1 week prior to our arrival date, Seamless phoned me to advise that the reserved apartment was not available but alternative accommodation would be provided.  I would describe the manner of this call as unprofessional eg I was repeatedly talked over in a very loud tone, when I remarked that I was not deaf and there was no need to shout at me, I received an apology and a comment that the volume on the phone would be turned down but shortly afterwards the loud tone resumed.   I was told in this call that I didn’t have a choice in the matter but to take the replacement apartment on offer, I was also offered a refund +10% on what I paid in order to find my own hotel.  When I advised that I wanted Seamless to find a suitable replacement apartment, it was agreed that a link would be sent to me in order to review the proposed replacement.  When I returned the call within an hour to advise that the proposed apartment was acceptable I was told that a 2nd option had also been sent through for review, when I advised that I’d like the opportunity to review the 2nd apartment I was told (i) that Seamless were fed up of dealing with me, (ii) that the issue had been dragging on for a month and I was being too difficult to deal with as I kept rejecting everything Seamless offered to fix the issue, (iii) that the proposal had been sent to my wife 3 days earlier and she rejected it (iv) that AirBnB had advised me of the change previously.  None of the above statements were correct. It was only when Seamless called me by the wrong name and I told them that the first I knew of the issue was when they rang me 45 minutes earlier and I asked them who they thought they were talking to that they realised they had their facts wrong.  Another apology was then forthcoming.  We did stay in the replacement apartment, it was described as 5 star, it’s not, 3 at best, eg the bathroom needs renovation, photos can be provided of the holes in the walls around the shower outlet. The swimming pool included in the apartment description can only be accessed by payment of a $40 daily fee per adult.   The photos provided on the site are not of the actual apartment which is very bare. The location is very central, it is clean."

4098410,20401170,2014-09-28,2454352,Miriam And Brendan,Josefa and her daughter were easy to communicate with and quick to respond in figuring out logistics.
The apartment was clean and a good place to land for a couple days. One thing to note is that there may be someone staying in the room next door,so this makes it harder to get out to the back deck. It sounds like this isn't always the case,"though. \"",,,
4098410,21259289,2014-10-13,17061272,Paula,"This was my first experience with Airbnb I was not disappointed at all, the communication between Josefa and her daughter Oriana could not have been better responding to emails and texts straight away. The house was in a great neighbour hood 5 mins away from the subway it couldn't have been any easier to reach downtown which was about 10 minuit ride away. Oriana was staying in the house with her beautiful dog, she was very helpful and polite in any questions I asked, the house was very quite, clean and comfortable, I would definately stay here again if I ever came back to Boston."

4098410,39711277,2015-07-25,9588929,Allison,"\"I do not recommend this room. Josepha was an unreliable host, and I think the \"\"airbnb business\"\" she's trying to run is a little shady. There were many issues that she did not bother telling me about upfront/before I booked the room."
First,I gave her a total price I could pay for a 3-night stay and she ended up charging me over that amount and blamed it on the airbnb fees,even though I had already given her my total budget and asked if it was doable.,,,
Next,she did not tell me that she also rented out other rooms to other airbnb guests,which 1) meant sharing a single bathroom between 6 people and 2) there is no  lock on the bedroom,which means you have to just trust that your belongings will be okay (even though the host room has a lock on it).,,
Then,Josepha told me she personally would be there to let me in,but turns out she lives in Florida and it was her daughter who let me in.,,,
Next,"the daughter asked me to \"\"lie to the neighbors and just say I'm her friend\"\" if they ask why I'm staying there.",,,,
Then,on my last night there,"Josepha's son had a date over and they stayed outside in the common space immediately next to my room talking until after 3am about \"\"how much money he is making off of airbnb\"\".",,,
Lastly,there was a fridge in the room which was a nice touch,except that it was full of someone else's old food and really dirty on the inside.,,,
"I get that airbnb is not a traditional mode of accommodation and that \"\"you get what you pay for\"\" but there were just too many issues with this that seemed like the host wasn't being up front with. It would have been much better if Josepha were just honest and said \"\"there are other guests\"\" and \"\"I can't technically  have airbnb guests","please let me know if this makes you uncomfortable\"\" - but no",there was no disclosure. If you are going to have multiple guests,you should have locks for each room. This room is listed at over $120 a night but trust me,that it is barely worth $60 a night. However,her daughter (the one who let me in and actually lives in Boston) was very nice
4098410,40182899,2015-07-28,38709109,Vanessa,"Josefa's apartment was beautiful and her dog was super calm and friendly. When I arrived Josefa wasn't there but it was her brother who let me in. I only met Josefa once, on the final day of my stay, but I could communicate with her through Airbnb which was fine. Overall it was a nice place to stay. Also, there is no laundry but there is a laundromat right across the street, literally 1 minute away."
4098410,43435400,2015-08-19,40911279,Catriona,"Great room, great location. Ori was very nice and hospitable and everything was perfect when we arrived. The room was comfortable and well equipped, as was the bathroom."
We only had 2 minor issues with the room. Firstly,most of the slats underneath the bed had broken,meaning that the bed dipped in certain areas which was uncomfortable to sleep on. It shouldn't need replaced,just a bit of repair.,,
Secondly,we received a text from Ori asking us to tell the neighbours (if asked) that we were there as friends and that we didn't have anything to do with Airbnb. As it was our first time in Boston,this was a little unnerving and made us a little uncomfortable every time we were entering the building.,,,
Other than that,"we would definitely recommend staying here. The facilities are great and we were well looked after. Thanks Ori and Josefa!\"",,,,

I didn't actually meet Josefa,since she was out of town,but she checked in several times to make sure everything was okay with the check-in and my whole stay.,,,
I would definitely recommend this space if you're looking for a warm welcome and a unique place to be in Boston. And if you have a pet traveling with you,"this is just perfect!\"",,,,
4098410,51179494,2015-10-18,14236381,Johnson,Great and quaint little place in Jamaica Plain. It's about a 20-30 minute drive to Cambridge and downtown Boston. Host was accommodating and check in and out process was easy. Being able to find car parking and having our puppy with us was a huge plus.

The host was accommodating and very laid back. Very convenient location, close the Green St. stop on the Orange Line. We had a great stay!"
4098410,56954036,2015-12-20,13104221,Grazyna,"In short: poor communication, unhygienic and dirty, electricity issues and unexpected surge pricing."
While I had always had great experiences with Airbnb,the experience with Josefa was horrible. My complaints start with unexpected surge pricing and continue with every aspect of the experience,,,,
While Josefa advertises her room for $69,when I filled the application the price changed to $87. I asked her about this change and she told me that the price depends on the day. But when I checked the price on Airbnb the next day,the website still listed it at $69. Very suspicious surge pricing.,,,
The poor communication continues to my arrival: I wrote Josefa my arriving time at Boston and she said it would be no problem. However,when I landed in Boston at 3pm and was in the taxi she sent me a message that neither she nor her daughter were home. The daughter’s boyfriend could let me in after 5pm. I had to change my plans and wait. This was already a red flag.,,,,
Alex,the very kind boyfriend,let me in. But then the room had some cleanliness issues: the bed looked like somebody had slept in it already and the sheets had stains. Since now it was 9 pm,I had no choice but to sleep in there. The room was cold and drafty,so the next day I asked for blankets – but the ones I received also looked like have not been laundered. This raises serious hygiene concerns.,
But it get’s worse: next day there was an electricity outage in my room,and the only way to get any light was to get an extension cord from one of the rooms to mine,so that I could have one lamp. Connecting the cords,I looked on the floor and wished I hadn’t. A lot of dust. Wonder what the $50 cleaning fee is for?! The long cord was also a tripping hazard.,,
Neither Josepha nor her daughter – who arrived in the middle of the night but hardly spoke with me - ever bothered to ask how my experience was,or to apologize for the fact that I was without electricity. There was clearly no interest in being a good host.,,,,
In conclusion,the experience was terrible: bad communication,a drafty and dirty room,and no electricity. The host was dishonest about the price,and disinterested in my experience.,
The only positive sign was the dog and the daughter’s boyfriend,Alex,"who was polite and nice and tried his best.\"",,,

Staying at the host location you will feel comfortable and relax and feel free to talk and be your true self.

2247190,16996585,2014-08-05,471608,Queenie,"We were a party of 5 and stayed at Garrison Sq. for 3 nights over a weekend. Communicating with the management company was easy, and we checked in using the lock box without a problem. The apartment was clean and consistent with the posted photos. Given its age, the suite did have some signs of wear and tear. The toiletry and kitchen packages were very handy."
Overall,we had a good stay. The real beds were comfortable,but the sofa bed was not great (pretty standard for a pull out). This corner suite was generally quiet,except for the T running just behind us. After having a big lobster dinner,we discovered that the dishwasher wasn't running. Since it was the weekend,we elected not to use the 24h emergency line left by the company.
Building is historic,well-kept,"and centrally located. We had nice meals at nearby seafood and italian restaurants.\"",,,

The location was perfect within walking distance to Newbury & Boylston Street and the subway.,,,,,
"Check-in and the directions provided were excellent!  And the concierge \"\"Michael\"\" was very helpful.",,,,,
The apt seemed to be fairly new and very clean,however,there were a few disappoints but an easy fix: (1) the condo smelled strongly of cigarette smoke.  Even though we opened up the windows during the time we were in the apt it did not eliminate the smell (2) there were no hair dryers (we packed lightly and none of us thought to bring a hair dryer as every apt I've rented also provided this (3) there was no soap for the dishwasher which we expected with 4 people utilizing the space (we did not realize this until the last day when we were leaving and planned to put the dishwasher on) (4) the windows in the 2nd bedroom would not open.  We called maintenance,but did not have anyone come by during our stay.,,
Overall I would recommend this apt especially if the little things above were fixed.,,,,,

We were contacted the next morning setting up a time for the problems to be addressed.  We were preparing to check out before the 11:00 a.m. deadline when the cleaning service employees unlocked the door and wanted to start cleaning. However, all in all, it all worked out very well.

The location is perfect, 2 Min Walk to the prudential center right in Back Bay. Apartment was nice very safe and secure although the first thing we all noticed was the carpets, they were old with lots of marks and need replacing. Our main issue was the beds and temperature control. We didn't like the beds, The four of us agreed they were very uncomfortable and along with the fact we couldn't control the temperature of the apartment (Very Warm), and had to open and close windows which resulted in us not getting proper sleep on our trip to Boston."

Slight surprise that the room we booked was not what was shown in the picture because I specifically booked the room showing two couches as there are multiple nearly identical rooms for this apartment complex posted on Airbnb.

Sure, it has it's quirks (small shower, squeaky kitchen sink faucet, some neighbour noise, etc) but it's an old building so that's to be expected. It was clean and that's all that matters. The internet, cable tv, and air conditioner were huge pluses."

Our only complaints were running out of hot water for the last person showering and the one-ply toilet paper.,,,,,

Uber drivers know the area by heart and even public transportation is accessible with a 10 to 15 minutes walk. The building is clean and it appears to be a mix of young families, professionals, and a few travellers. Overall I recommend this rental."

Photos/description of this furnished corporate unit were entirely accurate.  Unit was more spacious and comfortable than expected.  Quiet dead end street is just around the corner from the Prudential Center T.  Underground parking is a convenient bonus.  Self check in went smoothly.  Was too cold to take advantage of the inviting garden courtyard seating areas.,,,,,

Liesl was quick to respond to any of my questions,and was always accommodating. Any instructions regarding access and leaving,we clear and simple,and she made me feel comfortable to reach out if I had any questions.,,
The apartment itself was great. Its location is ideal,near everything was walkable. The Commons is just up the street,the river is one street over,and Newbury street,filled with great shops,restaurants
The apartment was clean,updated,very spacious,and an amazing piece of history. In a charming old brownstone on a street filled with beautiful old homes,I felt like a true Bostonian. The apartment still had its charm,yet was updated and homey.

The apartment is quiet, has a comfortable Murphy bed that makes the room spacious, and you will have everything you need to cook, if you are so inclined.

9144588,76596183,2016-05-28,58948308,Lisa,This apartment is in a great location and you can't beat the beautiful views of Beacon St. The only downside was the wifi barely worked while we were there. Not sure if this was a temporary issue but was experienced over our entire 4 night stay.
9144588,78176334,2016-06-05,24194271,Irv,"Liesl was the mossssst accommodating and friendly hostess one can ever have. I had an early morning arrival and up to the night before she was trying to make sure I could get into the place before the usual mid-afternoon take over time. Then I had a late afternoon flight and again she was willing to allow me to keep my bags in the place so that I could enjoy a few last hours in the Boston area. To top it off,  the BnB was located in a beautiful part of town easily accessible by foot or car to the areas in which I was interested. And it was a very cozy compact unit that provided all a visitor needed to make the most of a stay in Boston."
9144588,79231013,2016-06-12,39295312,Calle,"Liesl's Back Bay apartment is just beautiful. The location can't be beat -  close to the Boston commons, historical points of interest, restaurants and shops are right around the block. The historic brownstone is immaculately clean, and classically styled, located in a prime Boston neighborhood. Its a very quiet building with good security. Liesel's directions for accessing keys and communication from initial inquiry through booking and checkout was top notch. The bed was comfortable and the linens and pillows were Hilton quality. Thank you Liesel for a wonderful Airbnb experience!"

9144588,88905962,2016-07-25,20806975,Zoe,"Liesl's apartment was lovely. The photos accurately describe the space. The booking and arrival process went really smoothly, since Liesl was very responsive to emails and texts. We were even able to check in a bit early, as our flight arrived in the morning and the apartment was empty the night before. The apartment is on Beacon Street, which is full of great Brownstones. We loved the neighborhood and its proximity to everything. We walked everywhere pretty much."
The apartment is well stocked with all the basics - cutlery,crockery,various condiments,towels,linens and soap/toilet rolls. We were even able to do a quick wash as there is a really good washer/dryer in the unit.,
The one and only drawback - and this may not be an issue for anyone else - is that the murphy bed is very small (only a full) and not very comfortable/too soft. If you don't mind how you sleep,or if you are traveling alone,"then this place is perfect for you!  \"",,,
9144588,89521571,2016-07-28,65345221,Derek,"We had a great time at Liesl's place in the Back Bay.  The apartment was immaculate and close to the T (Copley station) as well as nearby shops and restaurants on Newbury and Boylston.  We even walked to Fenway for a game, although that was a little more of a hike (about 30 minutes)."
The Murphy bed was a comfortable queen,the bathroom looked new,and the kitchen - even though we didn't use it much - was beautiful.  Checking in and out was easy.,,,
(Side note: The only reason why I didn't give it a full five stars is because there was no electricity in the bathroom (possibly a blown circuit).  Liesl did try to help us troubleshoot the situation,and was communicating with us throughout the process,but we weren't able to get it fixed during our two nights.),,,

The murphy bed has the standard firm mattress.  We purchased shower gel and hand soap for the kitchen.  Plenty of electrical outlets.  Very clean.  Perfect location for Back Bay and Beacon Hill.  Public Garden is 2 blocks away.  Newbury Street is a quick 10 minute walk.  The building is very quiet.  The unit is on the back of the building so no street noise from Beacon Street traffic.

13864196,89893534,2016-07-30,25409253,Trevor,The area is a good one to stay. nicely away from the centre but just a short bus or underground journey to the city. there are some nice places to eat and shop locally. we did not meet Ellen at any point which was a shame as she could have assisted us by explaining where these were. also there were no instructions on the fact that there was air conditioning or how to use it. consequently we were very hot the first night. The place is shared with at least 2 others including the bathroom.
13864196,91264778,2016-08-04,19985617,Tom,Ellen was helpful and responsive.  The location is a real plus as West Broadway is nearby and the MBTA's Broadway station is an easy walk.  The location was very neat with a restful living room available.

13864196,94907511,2016-08-17,3660628,Michelle,"I needed to be in a place near the convention center for a work event and this was perfect. It was just a short cab ride from South Station and a short walk to the convention center. The place is pretty basic in it's function, amenities, and decor. You can tell it serves normally as a rental and is not someone's home, which kind of detracts from the charm of why I like to choose airbnb over hotels. So if you're someone who likes to meet your host and learn a little about the area, this is not the place. But if you like a the anonymity and are just looking for a place to crash, this is the place. The price is right for the area for sure. It was very well kept, clean, the wifi worked well and it was walkable to cool spots along the waterfront."
13864196,95973087,2016-08-21,24204408,Amanda,"We would definitely stay here again.  It was about a mile from the Blue Hills Bank Pavilion and close to the T station; so it met our needs.  Ellen communicated with us related to any questions we had.  My impression was this was an AirB&B rental only, as when I called she clarified if I was referring to the Boston apartment.  This didn't bother me, but was different than my past AirB&B experiences.  She also let us know that there were other people staying in the other rooms, which I greatly (URL HIDDEN) I would want to know if I were there alone.  We saw one other guest (once) when we were both coming home."
I had one issue in the upstairs bathroom.  The summary information specifically said not to use the upstairs shower portion of the tub.   About 3/4 into my bath I realized that water was coming out of the shower nozzle (it was hooked to the water spout so it wasn't impacting my bath).  I ignored it as I thought perhaps it had been fixed or I had read the information incorrectly.   When I got out of the bath the floor was pretty wet...towel,bath mat,clothes,etc.  There was a baking pan under the tub,I suspect to catch runoff (it obviously was full).  I had my partner bring in an extra towel...but if my partner wasn't there  I would have been left with uncomfortable options.  This wasn't a big deal for me,but for others I suggest you check  that the shower is indeed turned off prior to filling up your tub!
It was also a bit noisy,but it didn't keep me awake.  The central air was nice!  It was hot upstairs when we got there but Ellen made sure to tell us to make it conformable.,,,,
We didn't even need to use the parking garage as we found free street parking closer.,,,,,
As I said,overall,good experience.  Be sure to check your email,as that is where Ellen will send the codes to get in the apartment door shortly before your check-in time.,,

The place itself is in an amazing location where you can literally everywhere.  For the weekend we walked everywhere - Fenway Park, Boston Commons, North End, Cambridge.  Steve also was gracious enough to leave us two bikes which were great when we went over to Cambridge for Sunday brunch.  Just be aware of the stairs!  This is an old walk up and the apartment is on the top floor (four stories up!) and can be a chore to climb after walking all day or with luggage!  Overall, it was a great place and made our Boston trip that much better!"
13433298,86953387,2016-07-18,73211495,Amanda,"Our stay with Steve was absolutely amazing!! We had a blast in Boston and our location was just the cherry on top. His apartment was near everything. Even though it was a fifth floor walk up, It was perfect for the 3 of us and had everything we needed. Steve was always very prompt with answering all of our questions and his place was immaculate. We would recommend Steve to anyone! Have fun in Boston!"
13433298,87664645,2016-07-21,45858938,Myra,It is a nice apartment in a great location.   The cozy decor made it a lovely place to return to after our long day.   Steve is a great communicator and wonderful host.
13433298,90298383,2016-07-31,50152965,Liang,Steve is a very nice host. He mailed keys to me and provided us with water and bikes.
13433298,92880117,2016-08-10,1398084,Trey,"This was a great apartment in a fantastic part of the city. Steve met us at the apartment and showed us everything we needed to make this stay perfect.  He gave us very helpful directions to the subway and other local landmarks. The apartment had everything we needed : Full kitchen, full bathroom, comfortable bed, foldout couch, television and Internet. Plenty of space for two and I would have no problem with a third person.   Easy trip in from the airport and less than a block to a subway stop. If you need more I can't imagine what it would be. I'll certainly plan my next trip to Boston staying here."
13433298,95429268,2016-08-19,54111396,Noah,Steve was a great host. He responded to texts very quickly and made sure we had everything we needed. The place was spacious and clean and the bed was very comfortable. Definitely recommend.
13433298,96597795,2016-08-23,24252442,Lidia,"Our experience in Boston was great thanks to Steve as well. The apartment is cozy, clean and fully furnished, with litterally everything you need and it is located in the most beautiful area in the city. I would recommend to stay in his apt and would definitely come back to his place if I will be back in Boston."
13433298,97038401,2016-08-25,78827721,Michele,Wonderful stay!  Everything is within walking distance and borrowing the bikes made for the perfect afternoon!  Thank you!

13433298,97484328,2016-08-27,2965834,Amanda,"Great space! Please note that it's a 5th floor walk-up, so it's not for the faint of heart. The street is beautiful and historic and right by everything you need: Charles street, the running esplanade along the Charles river, and great shopping. The windows give great light and the space is well decorated and stocked with waters in the fridge."
13433298,98797062,2016-09-01,590107,Filip,"Steve was a great host. His condo was exactly as described, clean and well equipped. It's hard to think of a better location for a stay in the city of Boston. Highly recommended!"
10653150,61105287,2016-01-31,25696250,Thibaut,Anthony gives very clearly informations about the appartement
Also,he is very flexible about the key.,,,,
The appartment is clean,very good for 4 people and close to the TD Garden,parking and subway.,,,
"The appartment is in very a nice neighborhood. \"",,,,,
10653150,61512698,2016-02-05,4491477,Cory,This was a great stay in a very good location.  It's a comfortable place with a well equipped kitchen and comfortable main bedroom.  The second room is a great living area with a pull-out sofa bed so enough room for your group to have two private bedrooms.
10653150,62227030,2016-02-12,14989449,Nicolas,Anthony was super available and friendly with us ! The place was really clean and exactly as mentioned on the post. I for sure recommend his place to every one who wants to be on a great central location in downtown Boston.
"Thanks again !!\"",,,,,
10653150,63568899,2016-02-24,39466028,Marco,"I've spent almost a week in Anthony's apartment. All the communication with Anthony via email was very efficient. I've felt extremely comfortable here, the house decoration is very original and made me feel at home. The place was clean. It is situated in a wonderful area of Boston, the neighborhood of Beacon Hill is awesome! It is very practical when coming from Logan airport since the blue line stops quite close (Bowdoin) and for all my business in Boston it was very nice as well since the red line passes by and with that one can reach MIT and Harvard easily. I'd definitely come in this apartment again!"
10653150,63806265,2016-02-27,9427461,Vicky,"\"The apartment is located on one of those steep beautiful Bostonian streets, which adds a whole lot of charm to it, however the apartment itself wasn't what I expected. Perhaps I missed this from the description but if you have a 50lbs bag with you, going up the narrow staircase to the 4th floor is a big workout especially if you are a gal. The Internet didn't work even after we tried to reset it as per Anthony's instructions. As soon as I tried to go on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) I was getting Network Error and web pages wouldn't load. I switched back to my data plan and all worked as expected.The sink in the bathroom was vibrating and making loud noises  which sounded like it was about to blow up. Anthony was aware of it and suggested opening the cold water half way but that didn't help. The shower is really old and looks like it's dirty which made me uncomfortable stepping on it bare-feet. Anthony suggested he could send a cleaning lady once more but I wasn't comfortable having a stranger in the place with all of our belongings there. The apartment is pretty tight. The door has a big bolt inside which makes you question if the area is safe but Anthony assured me it was very safe neighborhood. Anthony was quick with responses. There is a great sushi right down the street I recommend: Fins Sushi and the original \"\"Cheers\"\" is about 15 min walk from Anthony's place.  Perhaps it's just me since the place has tons of good feedback so please treat this review as it is- just my honest opinion.  \""
10653150,64676527,2016-03-06,57319827,Larry,"Great location for a visit to Boston. Condo was perfect for two guys just there to sightsee. If your driving, do your research on local area parking. We had to park in a garage that was about a 10 minute walk away at a rate of $35  a day."
10653150,65252672,2016-03-12,393372,Ryan,The good: Location
The bad: The apartment could use a significant overhaul in terms of decor,amenities,towels,"etc. The bathroom is ridiculously small and cramped.  I'm only 5'9\"\" and I could hardly move in the shower.  The wifi seemed to go in and out as well.  Very annoying for a business trip.",,
The odd: I get that not all neighbors love an Airbnb neighbor. However,I'm a very respectful person and sending me reminders about being quiet,not buzzing the neighbor's doorbell,changing the location of the lockbox,etc. makes me feel as if I'm doing something illegal.,
"\"",,,,,
10653150,65531220,2016-03-15,55005025,James,"Anthony's place was perfect for what we needed (staying a couple of nights in between flights) and as described. The shower takes a while to find temperature and the sink taps (faucet) can be noisy, but these are minor details. The apartment is situated in a perfect location, a short walk to Charles/MGH T station, or a manageable walk to Park Street (Charles station was closed when we arrived), and great to be able to go out for a walk/explore Boston. Anthony was easy to contact throughout and had a great hassle-free experience, especially as my first time using AirBnB and in another country!"
10653150,66059216,2016-03-19,24805093,Yeqing,It's a good apartment. It's very convenient to go to everywhere. Also there are a lot of restaurants near the apartment.
10653150,66944859,2016-03-25,63159357,Ileana,"We really loved the location of the apartment, is in a beautiful neighborhood and it was very easy to move around Boston from there. The description of the apartment is exactly as listed, a fully equipped kitchen, one master bedroom and an additional room with a sofa bed that provides privacy for guests in both rooms. The mattress in the master bedroom is great, the mattress of the sofa bed is not really comfortable but overall we enjoyed our stay there and we will be happy to comeback."
10653150,67215615,2016-03-27,25097631,Helen,A lovely place to stay - as described. Location good - close to good places to eat on Charles Street. Easy walking to most of central Boston. Great host.

10653150,68858606,2016-04-07,16723531,Mike,The stay was nice. Key was 2 blocks away which was a little odd but no big deal. The sink made a terrible noise in the bathroom when turned on and the shower had a little mold but other than that it was good. Definitely worth the money for the location.
10653150,69678207,2016-04-12,41426299,Susan,We had a great experience with this rental - Anthony was responsive to all our needs and the place was exactly as described.

The bathroom and shower are a bit tight for someone 6'1\"\" and the drapes let in plenty of sunlight in the morning so if you need darkness to sleep"
10653150,71304119,2016-04-24,4561244,Marc,"Neighborhood, price, location, communication and scheduling was all great, no complaints at all."
Was exactly what I needed it for in terms of a place to stay for a reasonable price.,,,,,
I'm not one to complainer (insert but and complaints here) but I'm not sure if they make toilet paper that's less than 1 ply but that's what is in the appt and as another reviewer says the shower is very small. A few of the plugs don't work due to rot,and the wifi worked but wasn't the greatest (would go in and out) so if you need to be in the apartment a lot for work maybe an issue but for staying connected it was fine for us. Those are the only things that weren't the best.,,,,
Overall the host was great,we had 0 issues with the stay,"was a great weekend.\"",,,
10653150,71852733,2016-04-29,36874448,Megan,"This was a nice space.  Small because it's in the city, but it was clean and served our needs for a place to crash for the night before a meeting."
10653150,72250187,2016-05-01,39289370,Duo,Anthony provides everything needed in the condo. Thus we actually did not have any more requests from him. The condo is clean and the location is great. I would definitely recommend this listing for anyone visiting Boston.
10653150,72420978,2016-05-02,69357764,Masha,Our stay in Anthony's appartment was great. It is clean and very nice house. We also love the location. I would highly reccomend everyone to stay with Anthony. Thank you!
10653150,74046581,2016-05-12,50153127,Lucas,Really nice place to stay. Clean and very good location! Will recommend to friends.

On the downside,we did experience some issue with the in-house wifi. Also,the apartments is not as spacious as in the picture - we had 4 people and requested 2 beds,but the second bed is actually a sofa bed in another bedroom,"and with the sofa bed extended bedroom 1 is basically full with space for 1 person to stand. \"",
10653150,75675955,2016-05-22,5065078,Ian,"Anthony was a prompt and clear communicator. Key pickup was easy, just around the corner. There are some stairs (as he mentioned) so if you have heavy suitcases it could be uncomfortable. The place was clean and had a stocked kitchen. Not so big but coming from NYC our expectations for size are quite low. The bathroom was clean but the pipes were VERY noisy; I am used to city living and noisy pipes but every time we turned on the water it was very jarring."
"Overall we had a fine stay despite the noisy pipes. The price was a bit high for what we got but it was graduation weekend.\"",,,,,
10653150,76741346,2016-05-29,40690478,Shani,"Anthony's apartment is in the perfect location if you are trying to sightsee around Boston. Everything we needed was within a comfortable walking distance. We didn't actually get to meet Anthony but he was very kind and responsive when it came to answering our questions through text and he left very detailed instructions of how to pick up/drop off the key which was fairly easy. The apartment itself is okay, nothing super special but it's great if you're just looking for a place to crash for a day or two. Would definitely recommend Anthony's apartment."
10653150,78743833,2016-06-08,49445822,Elizabeth,"This isn't the first time I have stayed at one of Anthony's listings and it was PERFECT. He is an incredibly gracious host and answered all of my questions before check in as well as any questions I had during my stay. The apartment is along a picturesque street in Beacon Hill and is so easy to get to via public transportation while also being in a nice quiet part of Boston. I'm a temperamental sleeper generally, but the bed in this unit is INCREDIBLY comfortable and I had no problems drifting off. The unit is clean and well kept, should I need to stay in Boston again or need to recommend an EXCELLENT place to stay I will first turn to Anthony!"
10653150,79166866,2016-06-11,10159265,Ken,"Everything was great at Anthony's place. He communicated quickly, and everything was as described. It is very convenient to two T stops, which made coming in free on the Silver Line, and leaving fast on the Blue line easy."
We LOVED the neighborhood and were surprised how quiet it was without much traffic noise (from having living in cities before).,,,,,
The apartment space is very flexible,so we worked out sleeping for my wife and I,as well as two spots for my sons to have a bit of space to themselves. Everything was very clean,with plenty of dishes,and even a nice chocolate on our arrival.,
Being on Beacon Hill really hit the AirBnB idea of feeling like you really live in an area... we even got to be friends with a neighborhood cat,and chatted with the locals— shopped at Whole Foods and walked everywhere quickly for work/touring.,,,,

Now the bad.   Host is not on site.   Keys are obtained from a lock box 1 1/2 blocks away,so be prepared to lug your luggage around a bit before you gain entry. (in the dark,and the rain)   Upon arrival,apartment smelled of stale cooking odors (garlic) and old cologne.  Main bedroom was really bad so I had to sleep on fold out couch in living room where smells weren't as bad.   Lights in bathroom didn't work (first switch I tried upon arriving) had to shower by flashlight.  No wash cloths available,just hand towels and bath towels.  Air conditioning doesn't work,so apartment was too hot and humid.  Sheets are 100% polyester so you will sweat even more when laying on top of them. No closet space to hang any suits or dresses.  Main hallway to apartments smells of cigarette and marijuana smoke.  Bannister and stair railings are greasy feeling but you have to use them when climbing the 3 flights of stairs to the apartment.
"The ugly.... 2x4 barricade to secure the entry door. \"",,,,,
10653150,84076799,2016-07-05,39757913,Amber,Anthony was very welcoming. He provided us with detailed information about the check-in and check-out process and even accommodated our request to check-in early. The apartment was in a great location in the city. All the major sites of the city were within walking distance. Public transportation was within walking distance as well.
The apartment was a little small. However,we accommodated four people in the apartment for a long weekend just fine. All the essentials were available: kitchen table,stove,fridge,beds,towels
This is a great location to book while staying in Boston,"and Anthony was great to work with. I would definitely recommend staying here. \"",,,,
10653150,84089927,2016-07-05,7286036,Phil,"Very good communication, exactly as shown in the pictures. Very good last minute life savor during 4th of July weekend."
"4 people can stay there comfortably .\"",,,,,
10653150,85311855,2016-07-11,17508935,Akshat,"Anthony sent all instructions precisely. The apartment was in a really nice neighborhood.  The apartment is located on the 4th floor but the listing doesn't mention that there is no elevator. Nonetheless, we love our stay here."
10653150,86205584,2016-07-15,6155629,Jonathan,"We survived one night in this sad little place. The unit is up four flights of very steep stairs in a very tight stairwell, so get ready for a workout with suitcases! When you turn on the sink in the bathroom, it sounds like someone is jackhammering. The jackhammer sound will also come on spontaneously and intermittently  and was a most unpleasant early alarm part-way through the night. There is one small window AC unit, which is barely ample for the room it's in and absolutely useless for the extra bedroom down the hall. This room was like an oven. There is a circulating floor fan in that room, but it was broken. The towel holder in the bathroom is barely hanging on, which you'll discover if you place a hand towel there as the rack falls off the wall. And now, let's talk about the key entry situation: you have to walk more than a block and a half around the corner and down the street to find the lock box to be able to get into the apartment. Instructions say that there is a green key in the lock box, but there is no green key. Informed the owner of the property that there was no green key, and he replied (much later) that there is a key with a green dot. There is no green dot on either key. It's not really that big a deal once you figure it out, but it is unsettling to arrive at a place, go through the hassle of getting into the lock box which is not directly at the property, only to find that the green key described is not in the lock box. I would not recommend this place, unless you absolutely have no other option!"
10653150,87303323,2016-07-19,1727450,Roberto,"Anthony was very nice, responsible and communication was clear and accurate.  The location of the apartment is perfect.  Anthony accommodated a later checkout (original time was 10:00, he agreed to 11:00.)  Since our flight was late afternoon we managed to store our luggage at the nearby Wyndham hotel.  However, the description of the apartment is not quite accurate, as it is not a two-bedroom.  The second bedroom is a converted living room with a not-very comfortable sofabed (we put the mattress on the floor and it was fine, though.)  No real closet in the main bedroom, and no dishtowels, but other than that comfortable.  He does mention that it is a walk-up, so be prepared to carry bags up 4 flights of stairs."
10653150,87729070,2016-07-21,34733966,Jamie,"This was a great place to stay. Perfectly located in Beacon Hill, quiet neighborhood next to everything you need.  Just blocks from subway which made getting around the city very easy. Everything about apartment was exactly as the host described and perfect for my husband and me.  We came to see some baseball and experience Boston.  Recommend this to all.  Our host was very accommodating and helpful during our stay. So glad we were able to experience Boston in this home away from home."
10653150,91465072,2016-08-05,1584636,Philippa,We stayed for one night only. Beacon hill is a great area and the accommodation although small and fairly basic is still charming. 3 floor walk up is a bit tricky with luggage and parking close by is very difficult in peak season but Anthony was very helpful with suggestions for our visit including finding parking.
10653150,93636648,2016-08-13,54085873,Brian,Good location. Pricey but decent apartment. Parking is a bit of a hassle. Host was very accommodating and very quick to respond. Overall very good experience.

He made it easy to find the key, and explained everything thoroughly ahead of time. The A/C unit and fans were also much appreciated as it was August. :-)"
10653150,98739536,2016-09-01,6200534,David,Anthony was very responsive. The condo is well located and offers great access to Boston. Be prepared to get some exercise with a the hill and stair climbing you'll be doing.
6850880,76125056,2016-05-24,519681,Paulina,Great location. Having a lock box instead of a key made things very practical.  The place was clean and the description is accurate.  Having to leave the room to go to the bathroom seemed uncomfortable at first but it ends up being only a minor concern.
3415434,19137611,2014-09-07,18759168,Otavio,"The location is extremely convenient, the neighboorhood around is famous for not being that good but I personally did not have any problems. There are also some food places, laundries and grocery stores a couple blocks away. It is forbidden to smoke inside the house, but on each floor they have a porch where you can have a cigarrette and maybe enjoy some time with your housemates. I had a very pleasant experience there."

Bathroom was not clean at all. The tub was plugged up, so the water would fill up.  At least it had some Lysol (I used it before and after).  No towels. I had to ask the host to give me one which he did, but very reluctantly."

It's only 3 stops away from south station where bus and train terminal located The picture is exactly what you will see. The matress is clean but the floor with a little dust. It's hard to walk with bare feet. They don't have any air condtioner. Staying here alone will be fine but don't go with your wife.

An economy place to stay in South Boston within walking distance to the Red line train station.,,,,,
Queries were answered within a reasonable time.,,,,,
The cleanliness is not as good as one would get in a hotel but then at a fraction of what you pay at a hotel,its reasonably good. Wait to see the room rather than common places,before judging.,,,

Only downfall was air conditioning in the living room didn't work great, but there was a window unit in the bedroom to make sleeping comfortable.  We felt completely safe walking through the neighborhood at night, which was one of our biggest concerns leading up to our stay.  Host was also very accomodating with check in/out needs and responsive to questions. Would definitely rent this spot again!"

8815257,58147208,2016-01-01,21689644,Aaron,We had a great stay at the apartment! The views from the apartment are fantastic. The kitchen is perfect for cooking. TV and WiFi are exactly as you'd want in a high end apartment.
We had a few teething issues getting into the building as the concierge was on break. I'd suggest someone meeting guests to hand over keys might be a better way of handling things.,,,,,

The neighborhood has some great restaurants and cute shops.  Being close to Whole Foods was a big plus.  That made it easy to pick up snacks and breakfast foods.  Overall, the apartment was clean and exactly how it was described online.  Just like the pictures. Very modern and nice open space.  No complaints!"
8815257,69946778,2016-04-15,48126884,Keith,Nice stay and location with a big whole food market !! The amenity is wonderful ! It is great for 5 ppl to stay here ! Thanks
8815257,70634472,2016-04-19,38442379,Kurtland,"Great location, great apartment in a great building. Very convenient that the Whole Foods is so close."
8815257,71486043,2016-04-25,49503051,Matt,The area was pretty good. It was really convenient to have the whole foods connected next door. It was close enough to tuff's medical station exit that you could get anywhere easily via train.
The size was slightly smaller than expected. I thought there would be three beds and a couch,but one bed is the pull out couch which made it super crammed at night and morning time. The blanket that came with the couch had blood or poop on it... Did not want to figure out which but it was,disgusting. The bathrooms were oddly huge though.,,,
Biggest complaint was the AC was separate in two parts of the house and one unit was broken making one of the two bedrooms a hot box (80+ degrees inside). It was really only bad for two of the five days we were there as the other days were colder but required the window to be open which lead to street sweepers scaring the crap out of you in the middle of the night. I did contact Josh to fix the problem which he did respond. He said if it continues he'll fix it,which of course it was going to continue but since colder days were ahead I didn't want to bother having repair people over. I'd give it 4/5 stars if this wasn't an issue but it really pissed off the couple that got stuck sleeping there and the couple that got stuck on the couch bed. They had to rotate just deal with it.,,,,
It had a gym on the basement level which was nice and construction is currently going on across the street,but it was minimal noise overall. The front desk people were nice in block 3,but rude as hell in block 1 (accident went there first). They also are very strict about the 4 a clock time frame which was a little annoying flying in with 6 things of luggage and waiting 45 minutes for no reason. I understand that i was told this prior though and I do believe they contacted Josh and they let us in slightly early.,,,
"I would have picked another place knowing the AC was an issue but hopefully it will be fixed soon.\"",,,,,
8815257,71794696,2016-04-28,59314584,Takiya,Kyle was an awesome host. Was extremely kind and attentive to all questions we had about check in and check out.
8815257,72366917,2016-05-02,33218151,Ricardo,"Great place! Josh was very helpful, the stay was nothing short of amazing. Had a really good time. The place is very well located with a WholeFoods steps away. All in all, would recommend Josh and this or any other listings he has."
8815257,72884675,2016-05-05,64371865,Jose Ramon,"the area is very quiet and central to get to various places in the city. the building is very new as the department, is very well equipped."
8815257,73457213,2016-05-08,61335691,Ramamurthy,Josh was responsive and got back in a timely manner.  The apartment was well kept and kitchen has all the utensils etc. we needed.  Bathrooms were clean and sufficient towels were provided.
The initial check-in process was a bit awkward because of how the buildings are in the INK Block.  Finding street parking was a pain but we found parking in Chinatown at B&B Parking.  Overnight parking was about $10.,,,,,
"Lighting in the two bedrooms is not sufficient for reading.  Josh might want to install some high wattage bulbs.  Beds are creaky ... some improvement there would be good.\"",,,,,
8815257,74422870,2016-05-15,14415815,Kristina,"My family and I stayed here for a few days and we each absolutely loved it! The apartment was in perfect clean condition, and the location was really great. We were only about a 20-25 minute walk from Boston Common and Newbury Street, and we were just down the block from SoWa, which is a very cute and quaint neighborhood filled with art galleries, markets, and restaurants. The Whole Foods just downstairs was also a major plus!"
The only issue we had here was parking. The building has a private underground lot,but our car was too big to fit so I never asked the host if he had a spot we could use in there. Street parking is an absolute nightmare,and if you leave your car anywhere for a minute longer than specified on the sign,it WILL get towed (we almost got our own car towed). We worried about our car way more than anyone should,so to avoid any headaches,I'd suggest leaving the car at home.
Otherwise,"I definitely recommend this apartment. It was fantastic and I would return in a heartbeat!\"",,,,
8815257,75395572,2016-05-21,3501687,Koen,"The place was great, spacious with excellent facilities. The two fixed beds were very comfy, the sofabed less but similar to other sofabeds. Location is good, short walk to downtown and wholefoods down stairs. Josh was very responsive an helpful with instructions. One downside for me is that the apartment is clearly just to be rented out, don't expect something unique & personal but you can expect to have a nice & comfortable stay."
8815257,77783264,2016-06-03,10209650,Fiona,"Great place! Very clean, new and trendy. Close to T and within walking distance to Chinatown, Southend and the Commons. Josh is very quick responding questions. Highly recommend."
8815257,78880787,2016-06-09,1948925,Richard,"The apartment was great; it was in a super convenient location in Boston with easy access to public transit and within walking distance of good areas. We stayed for an event at the Convention Center and didn't have a problem getting back and forth on foot, as well as taxis and Ubers. Josh was a communicative host and we didn't have any trouble getting in touch with him. The apartment was clean, had great amenities, and good access to Whole Foods and a coffee shop on the same block."
The only issues we had were with the noise and heat of the apartment. Construction nearby made it a pretty loud place to spend time,a major building site was across the street. We also had an issue with the A/C that left one of the bedrooms at 80 degrees overnight; this problem wasn't fixed during the stay.,,,,
These were the only issues we ran into though,"and otherwise had a pleasant stay.\"",,,,
8815257,86011049,2016-07-14,79178380,Rachel,"I had an incredible stay here with my parents and sister. The apartment is very new, spacious and clean. Josh made the check-in and check-out process extraordinarily smooth.  Enough fresh towels were provided. Dishes and plates were just washed when we arrived. We really enjoyed our stay there!"
8815257,86593705,2016-07-17,19199949,Theresa,Josh's place was great; he provided us with all the information we needed for our stay. The amenities were amazing! It is a cool building in a neighborhood with lots to offer!
8815257,87503147,2016-07-20,79138799,Paulette,"We had a great time during our stay in Boston. The location of the apartment was perfect! Having Whole Foods next door was really a plus. We walked around the south end of the city one day, we used public transportation another day and we did pay for the parking garage and it was well worth it to have a car on the days we did college tours outside of the city."

Finding a hotel is always tough, and frankly the quality is terrible, especially for the cost. This was a great find.

7919500,49951831,2015-10-07,18835,David,Large modern well furnished apartment next door to a Whole Foods and about 3 blocks from the Tufts University T (Orange Line) station. Reception staff was very friendly and helpful. We will book this apartment next time we return to Boston.

7919500,60619587,2016-01-25,30713479,Octavio,"Great apartment, facilities in building were excellent. Check in and out process very good. The location is a bit edgy, but is very close to everything."
7919500,60796464,2016-01-27,42206992,Stella,"Great building, great flat! Loved the walk in wardrobe. Easy to pick up the keys from reception and move about."
I was on a business trip,so had no touristy questions to ask Flatbook but all my questions prior to the trip were answered immediately.,,,,
I would definitely recommend the apartment. The only downside is that it isnt directly in the centre of Boston,so its either a 10-15 minute walk into town or a very short cab ride for around $5. Both were no problem for me. There is a great Wholefoods next door and the flat is amazing! Great service,"so five stars from me :-)\"",,,
7919500,61386308,2016-02-03,42206992,Stella,Loved the apartment! Also forgot my handbag on my way out and flat book arranged for it to be left with the concierge so I could pick it up on my way to the airport.
"Great service!\"",,,,,
7919500,64327643,2016-03-02,59966142,Richard,The apartment was well maintained and very comfortable. Close enough to downtown and local shopping to be very convenient.
7919500,67616444,2016-03-30,60518744,婕,"由於當我checkin的時候房間並沒有即時清潔好,我並沒有感覺到自己受到了房東的歡迎。我打電話反覆催促才等到清潔人員。我由於本來就比原定的計畫要遲了幾個小時。當時熬了整夜坐飛機,到達波士頓的時候又餓又累,但即使趕到了住的地方也無法好好的休息。房東工作的不到位導致我不得不又浪費了至少兩個小時來等待房間清潔好才能出門。除了道歉客服也並沒有給出任何合理的解釋為什麼在他們擁有比原定checkin時間多出至少10個小時的情況下也沒有在我們到達前清潔好房間。我覺得自己以後不會再定這家的房子了"

The bed linens were so amazing! I actually did an online search,found the manufacturer and bought a few sets!,,,,
The Flatbook team was top-flight,answering my questions immediately and even accommodating me with a last-minute change of plans.  I would definitely stay here again,and recommend Flatbook to friends,"family and co-workers.\"",,
7919500,77640843,2016-06-02,50582461,Luis,"The actual place is fantastic. It's in a brand new building with a great outdoor pool (which you'll probably enjoy of course in the warmer months). I did take my kids there and they had a lifeguard on duty until 9pm so that was nice. Nearest T station is quite a hike, but the Silver Line bus stops 1 block away. The Whole Foods downstairs is AMAZING! On Sundays, there's a cute farmer's market across the street."

The location is great; I could walk to a meeting in the Convention Center, while my family could walk to the Boston Commons in about the same amount of time. A Silver Line bus is about a block away for easy access to the airport. The Whole Foods next door is wonderful, the perfect place for breakfast or a quick lunch and inspired us to cook! The Flatbook team was very accommodating and left easy instructions for check-in and check-out. We will stay here again!"
7919500,82941468,2016-06-30,79842740,Alex,Great space with a fantastic view. Prime location to the T and a Whole Foods right downstairs. There's also a gorgeous rooftop pool with a life guard and common grass area.

From serving Chinese-style breakfast every day to laundering my clothes every week, they have treated me like family. I give them my highest praise."
13028899,87475037,2016-07-20,80985998,Britt,"Susan was a great host who made my stay very pleasant. Her home is very clean and in a safe area. The room I stayed in was comfortable and quiet. It also was perfectly located nearby the apartment where my family resides. I appreciated having such a nice place to stay without having to break the bank as I would have had to do if I had stayed at a Boston area hotel. For me, this was a very positive first experience of finding a room through Airbnb."
13028899,87612392,2016-07-21,13645921,Umar,I had to travel to Boston and booked a place last minute. Susan was very accommodating of my last minute request. She responded about an hour and 40 minutes after I inquired about the room and pre-approved me to book. My evening train was delayed and I didn't end up getting to her house until 9:50pm. Susan was still very accommodating which I appreciated.

5918944,34210504,2015-06-06,6878743,Carey,"We were arriving to this AirBnB in two waves. Dorothy graciously contacted those who were arriving first to make sure they had no trouble getting to and into the house. We were also traveling with a nine-year old and she brought an extra air mattress so that she could sleep on a bed, rather than the couch."
5918944,34726074,2015-06-11,11082876,Dominique,"This apartment worked very well to home some of my out of town colleagues who were in Boston for a team retreat.  Dorothy was very accommodating and the apartment was clean, neat and easy to stay in."

She warned us of track work on the T, which was very helpful to know in advance. Although we didn't spend too much time in the house, we enjoyed our stay."
5918944,60447824,2016-01-23,3210528,Cat,This was one of the best places I've stayed on airbnb. I loved it!!! My communication was primarily with Dorothy and she always was quickly responsive. I stayed at their home while they were mostly out of town (we overlapped by one night) and I was so happy to be there. Perfect location - a wonderful feel - immaculately clean - so beautifully decorated - everything you need and beyond! I loved how eco-minded the home was too - it was easy to compost and recycle - all the cleaning products were eco-friendly and there was an abundance of dish towels so as not to use paper towels. I felt very comfortable and happy there. I usually have a hard time sleeping and slept so well every night. The bed is so comfortable. A wonderful value and such a great place to stay! I loved talking with Dorothy and could have talked longer. She's so kind and helpful. I can't rave enough about this place and the hosts.

One thing to look out for is public parking, I couldn't find any close.  It was mostly residential/2 hour parking in the surrounding area."

We've had the chance to meet Shawn while checking out. They were bringing an Air Conditioning unit to the apartment,just because they were afraid of customers to be to hot in this warm spring !,,,,
We've had a very nice chat with very nice people aside behing very good professionnals.,,,,,
South Boston used to have a bad reputation,now it's becoming the place to be.,,,,
Across the street there is a very convienent shop for food and cofee.,,,,,
Also across the street a rental bicycle (did not try) to go downtown (+ rail station),. DownTown is 15 minutes away walking,plenty of taxi on the way back if you're tired.,,,
A very good place to go if you want to enjoy the real Bostonian life for some days,or just a night,,,,

2135075,17928533,2014-08-19,14774646,Richard,The apartment was conveniently located near the Red Line T stop just across the street. Shawn was an excellent host and responded very quickly to our questions.
2135075,18154128,2014-08-22,14540060,Yuki,Shawn is a good host. Everything went smoothly. There's a welcome package in the living room. Everything you need to know about the apartment is in the welcome package. The apartment is very clean. Internet might not have ideal speed. Subway is right across the street of the building. There's a convenient store steps away. A nice place to stay.
"The only issue is the outside front was locked the day we checked out. We were not able to open the door. Fortunately there's a back door we could get out from that. Shawn said the front door would be fixed soon. Hope next time I won't be locked in again if stay there lol\"",,,,,

2135075,20491816,2014-09-30,16520536,Michael,"We are happy to have chosen Shawn's place for our stay in Boston. First of all, Shawn is very responsive. He answered all our queries before we travelled and also when we were in Boston literally within minutes. He also dropped by to install a curtain on the bath room window (where there wasn't any before). He also talked to the property owner who had the apartment above us renovated while we were there to ask him to turn the noise level down on the first evening when we had just arrived and needed some rest. So we felt very well taken care of and we trust that Shawn and his team would also have helped us if we had run into any trouble during our stay in Boston."
We loved the apartment. It looks very much like in the pictures. It is very cosy with a comfortable bed in the master bedroom and also very convenient with the subway and bus station and the food store all just across the road. It just felt a tiny bit run down,but this seems only natural after being used regularly for a while. We left a small list of suggested repairs and improvements with Shawn and the Urban Vacation Home team,and we are sure that they will take care of them,but none of the items on the list should make anyone not choose this place,"since it is good quality and good value for money.\"",
2135075,20741205,2014-10-05,18130036,Jiang,We didn't see Shawn often. But this is really a nice apartment. The Bedrooms are clean. The kitchen is amazingly well equipped. There is many big supermarket nearby for about 10m walking. The traffic is also very convenient. The red line is nearby for about 2m walking.

Shawn vastasi viipymättä kaikkiin viesteihin, ja saimme mutkattomasti järjestymään aikaisemman check-in sekä myöhemmän checkoutin. Kaikki sujui asunnon suhteen mutkattomasti. Suosittelen AirBnB-aplikaation asennusta, sillä yhteydenpito sujuu helposti."
Metroasemalle on n.100metriä matkaa. Vieressä minimarketti,isompaan kauppaan n.10min matka. Metroaseman ympäristö ei välttämättä ole ole siistein/rauhallisin,"mutta kuitenkin vaikutti ihan turvalliselta. Metrolla pääsee keskustaan n. 10 minuutissa.\"",,,

Shawn is also a great host, he replies promptly when we have questions and is very friendly and funny! We would recommend this house to friends and will probably come back for it :)"
2135075,23619015,2014-12-06,5977430,Jonathan,"The apartment is near South Boston, extremely close to the Andrew T stop on the Red Line, which makes it very convenient for getting around the city. The check-in and out procedures were very easy and Shawn was prompt and easy to communicate with."

The apartment itself was clean and comfortable, and right across the street from the subway which was very convenient. Shawn communicated well and we had no problems checking in or out. Overall we enjoyed our stay, thanks Shawn!"
2135075,26744968,2015-02-18,26261517,Andrea,"Shawn was a professional host.  He answered emails etc immediately.  We visited Boston during the blizzard and he was able to give us information on parking and let us check in early so we could get the car parked before the storm.  The apartment had everything we needed.  We were very comfortable during our stay and we spent lots of time there because the city was shut down.  We would highly recommend.  Right across the T, great price, everything you need and a host that responds quickly."
2135075,28301042,2015-03-22,24773444,Michael,This was my first time using airbnb and it could not have gone better. Shawn explained every step of the reservation and check-in process and getting there was a breeze.
The apartment itself was exactly as described. A perfect stay for the two of us while we were attending a meeting at the Westin Boston Waterfront. The apartment is located right across from a subway/bus stop and using public transportation would have been easy. We ended up using Uber during our visit for convenience,though.,,,,
"There is a bar right next door and several convenience stores and food options within walking distance. We did not see too much of the neighborhood because it was cold and snowing while we were there and we also did not have too much time but it felt safe and under better conditions we would have explored more.\"",,,,,

Shawn's house is very clean and tidy. Kitchen has all for cooking.There is a booklet on desk that wrote nearly all required info during your stay. House located across the red line subway stop that is really great! I would definitely recommend staying at Shawn's house."
2135075,29494239,2015-04-08,27794069,Joris,communication via e-mail was ok.
location is indeed very close to the subway station,,,,,
minor points were:,,,,,
the pictures did pretend the place was much bigger. In fact this was a really small appartment and not suited for more than 3 persons.,,,,,
"cleaning was not ok: the oven in the kitchen was very dirty \"",,,,,
2135075,30924905,2015-04-29,26817743,Jessica,"Great location.  Easy access to the subway.  Shawn was easy to work with, and checking in/checking out was very painless.  Apartment is as advertised and was clean and tidy when we arrived.  We did not cook, so I cannot comment on the function of the kitchen, although it looked to be in working order with everything you would need.  Slightly noisy neighbors, and with an older house you can hear them when they were walking or running any water (dishwasher, sink, shower etc.).  Luckily, they were not up late and you could no longer hear them around 11PM each night."
2135075,31134495,2015-05-02,22676754,Alastair,"Great apartment that lived up to it's listing. True two bedroom apartment within 2 minute walk to Andrew station (T red line - best line to go downtown and onto Harvard etc). Reading reviews on this site people are always happy with the host so, not to be cliché, Shawn was excellent. I'm pretty late at following up on anything but this didn't seem to worry him at all. In fact he communicated through phone SMS and email with punctuality I could hope for from a big hotel. One tip: if you want a quiet night with takeout, check (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) and walk a few blocks for good pizza and a local bar rather that the ones very close."
2135075,32082052,2015-05-13,32305852,Daniel,Shawn was very responsive via SMS and email which was very helpful  as this was my first time using Airbnb.  Every question or request I had was answered within minutes.
Apartment was really comfortable for myself and 3 others.  It is a true two bedroom apartment with comfortable beds and ample space for luggage,etc.  Living room was a tad small with limited seating,but it wasn't too important to us since we didn't utilize that space.,,,
Parking may be an issue if you are driving in with your own car.  Be wary of where you park as most of it is residential permit parking.,,,,,
I was overall very happy with the accommodations,the host,"and cleanliness of the apartment.\"",,,

A quick trip to Goodwill would really help! :) Small apartment but nice little back porch and feels removed from the street scene. The neighborhood is a tad sketchy, but it felt like an authentic south Boston experience - both the apartment and the neighborhood. Was a good value for the price, and the location was great for subway use. Hard to find parking - watch for tickets. I was going to a conference at the convention center and was able to get there in 15-20 minutes by the red and silver lines. Very convenient and affordable.  I would recommend it, although if you are looking for someplace really safe for families, there is a bar next door and lots of people hanging around near the subway, so this probably isn't it. But I had my daughter and we did fine!"

2135075,34281115,2015-06-07,12693691,Jaren,"One of the bed did not have the comforter so it was a little hard to sleep at night when temperatures got a little colder. The smaller bed slopes on one side, not sure if that would be due to the slant of the floor or just that the mattress is old. The outside of the apartment has got a very subtle smell of trash and it does get overwhelming at times, just that I am pretty sure it has nothing to do with the apartment. Also do make sure NOT to use the microwave and hair dryer at the same time as it trips the whole circuit."
"Nonetheless Shawn was really nice to come by to help us reset in the shortest possible time. Checking in was really easy as well and not much problems. Shawn was also very flexible with the check out timing which made things very convenient for us. In all it was a pretty decent stay. \"",,,,,

There are local restaurants and pubs within a few hundred yards. The back bedroom doesn't have an A/C and even though it wasn't real hot yet in early June it didn't cool down back there until around 3am. Shawn tried to help us get the wifi working but it never would.

2135075,41257444,2015-08-05,36953797,Joan,"A really cozy apartment, as described. We spent two nights in it and enjoyed a lot the city and how easy was to go to the downtown from there."
"Shawn has proved to be a great host and very helpful giving us all type of directions\"",,,,,
2135075,41415235,2015-08-07,5416821,Romain,"Very functional and clean appartment. The neighborhood is not that attractive, but it is very well located, and close to downtown given the proximity of the subway. We did not have the opportunity to meet Shawn, but he was accessible for the information that we needed."
2135075,42128831,2015-08-11,29414408,Julia,Location! 3 stops to Downtown crossing !
Shawn is an excellent host. Apartment is small,but practical,We found everything in working order,fully equipped kitchen. I feel that for the price of that deal we got a good accommodations and very helpful host. Neighbourhood is not so great,but we always felt safe and the best part is,"that it located right on the subway line. \""
2135075,43191840,2015-08-17,39546529,Christian,I enjoyed my stay at the location. It was right across from the T station as noted in the description and in the other reviews.  The apartment was clean and I found the neighborhood to be quiet (unlike some of the prior reviewers).  I note that the bed in the master bedroom creaked a lot for each movement made and can keep up a light sleeper.  I would suggest a newer bed be provided that doesn't make that kind of noise.  I was ok with everything else.
2135075,43609826,2015-08-21,15836778,Vivian,"Great stay! The location was perfect, directly across the street from the subway station. We were out most of the time. But the place provided a great resting place after long days."
2135075,44283280,2015-08-25,19697272,Ansgar,"The apartment is well located next to the Andrew station, which makes it very easy to get into the city. Moreover, the grocery store next to the apartment offers everything you need. The rooms were clean and the kitchen is well equipped. Only the large bed creaked a lot. Shawn is a great host and was always concerned if everything was fine. In summary, the accommodation demonstrates an excellent choice."
2135075,45109366,2015-08-31,17710717,Michelle,"Shawn was so friendly and accommodating.  The space was great for us and our two friends, and there was a convenience store about 100 feet away.  While the space is right next to a T subway stop, it's an easy walk to central Boston.  We'd definitely stay there again."
2135075,45363254,2015-09-02,6612501,Emeline,"L'appartement est malheureusement plus vetuste qu'il n'y parait. Les matelas sont bruyants et peu confortables, ils mériteraient d'être changés. L'avantage de l'appartement est clairement son emplacement, juste à côté du metro."
2135075,46570226,2015-09-11,39256942,Shruti,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2135075,46878124,2015-09-14,21287916,Emma,"Shawn was very communicative and direct, which was very appreciated! The apartment was clean and bright and we had an excellent stay in Boston. Thank you!"
2135075,47470236,2015-09-19,6296509,Sören,"We enjoyed our stay in Boston. The apartment is tidy,clean and really close to the city or rather the sights .  Everything worked out with the check-in as well.  We can recommend a stay at their flat a 100%."
2135075,48628846,2015-09-27,33615475,Xiaojiao,"Shawn is very nice.the house near the subway station.very convenient,room is very comfortable have kitchen .I sooo love the here."
2135075,49011657,2015-09-30,22656493,Veronica,"The apartment was pretty easy to get to via the T from Logan airport, which was a plus, and the keys to the building/apartment were easily accessible. It was also near a Dunkin Donuts for a quick, easy breakfast stop. Overall, this apartment did it's job- it was a place for us to relax after a few days of college visits and exploring Boston- but definitely didn't provide as much comfort as we had expected based on the flawless photos. The apartment and building  itself could definitely use better housekeeping and a few repairs should be made to the unit itself."
Cleanliness/Housekeeping: The $99 cleaning fee is a bit high for what we walked into. Paying that price,I would expect this place to be in tip-top condition,when in reality it left some things to be desired. When checking the place out once we arrived,there were a few items left from previous guests (i.e. moldy strawberries in fridge),some hair ties on the ground,a musty odor
Noise: The bed/mattress in the smaller bedroom makes all sorts of loud noises with any sudden movements. The walls/floors are also very thin--during our stay we could hear the guests above us very loudly moving chairs,walking etc,when we were trying to sleep. There's also a bar right on the corner across an alley,which while a little loud,wasn't horribly disruptive.,
Sean stopped by briefly on our second day to check-in,which was nice because we were running low on a few paper items. There's also a convenience store right across the street for any other needs.  I'd say if you're planning a quick trip and just need a place to crash,this place will be fine. I've used Airbnb a few times before,so I usually know what to expect,"but this was the rest of my family's first time and they're weren't completely convinced after this experience. \"",
2135075,51744656,2015-10-24,35662357,Tessa,We enjoyed our brief stay: the apartment was super easy to access with public transport; Shawn's check in instructions were great; the apartment was comfortable and clean; and Shawn responded immediately when contacted.  We would recommend to others.
2135075,54399480,2015-11-19,25234596,Robin,Great apartment. Very simple check in and right on the Red Line for easy access to downtown Boston with 15-20 minutes. Thanks for a great stay!
2135075,54706539,2015-11-23,43962453,Nakamura,何かわからないことがあればShawnさん尋ねることができ、とても助かりました。宿泊先の雰囲気はとてもよくリラックスできました。

2135075,59865180,2016-01-16,13302053,Alexandra,"We all loved our stay in Boston. The bedrooms were comfortable but we would have like a little more seating in the living room. Maybe a love sofa instead of a chair. Otherwise it was perfect for our midweek getaway. Shawn was super friendly and very easy to contact. The home does have cable tv but doesn't have access to a lot of channels. I would definitely suggest a Roku/streaming DVD player that way guests can watch Netflix/Hulu or grab a movie from RedBox and hangout. Parking was actually pretty decent for the area. There's plenty of restaurants, delivery places, a convenient store and a couple liquor stores all within walking distance from Shawn's place. I honestly wish we had longer to stay there but we will absolutely be back in the future."
2135075,62668349,2016-02-15,45938910,Emmanuel,Shawns place was amazing! Exactly how described in the post and he was very responsive when contacted. The subway is located right across the street and there are plenty of different food shops in the neighborhood. Check In was very smooth and checkout was even smoother. Definitely would stay here again
2135075,64091551,2016-02-29,41388994,Fernando,Thanks Shawn! Great Space! No problems at all and enjoyed the stay.
2135075,65443163,2016-03-13,57057872,Deepti,"\"Shawn was always very prompt and polite when responding to questions I had. The apartment is smaller than it looks in the pictures - but is very representative of the sizes of other apartments in Boston as well. Besides the size, the pictures are accurate. The apartment isn't in a \"\"new\"\" state but is a great deal for the price offered. The South End neighborhood is not as pleasant as being downtown but once again"
2135075,66078771,2016-03-19,33331947,Kaitlyn,"Shawn was very friendly and accommodating. The apartment was lovely and perfect size for a few people. Very clean and spacious. Finding parking was a bit of a hassle, but that was the same throughout all of Boston."

2135075,71414287,2016-04-25,47719658,Patrick,Shawn was very accommodating and allowed me to arrive early. He answered all my questions and let me know. The place was perfect for what we need it for.
2135075,71761649,2016-04-28,68178442,Khadeeja,"I was so happy to stay in this apartment,  was clean , prepared well. The supermarket was in front of the apartment . Bus stations near. I enjoyed staying.  Thanks"
2135075,72383820,2016-05-02,31534653,Stacy,"The location of the apartment is really convenient, it's right beside of the red line. However, the room facing the street is a little bit noisy during the night. You can basically hear everything when someone are passing by the  window. Other than that, it's a great place to stay for your visit."
2135075,72898635,2016-05-05,49549217,Kk,Nice and clean apartment. The location is quiet and convenient. Metro is just opposite to the building.
But one of the bed seems a bit old and unstable with the sound of 'it it it,et et et'... should have to fix it before next rental. Other than that,"everything is fine for me. Satisfactory!!\"",,,
2135075,74060212,2016-05-12,8288857,Ron,"Shawn was responsive and very easy to work with and the place was as described.  It was clean with fresh bedding, and check-in/out was a breeze, even though I arrived well after midnight.  It was a great value for Boston.  The only negative is that the neighborhood is very noisy (trucks, planes, etc...) which made it tough to sleep past 5:30.  That's just South Boston though, not a knock on Shawn or his place.  :-)"
2135075,75984058,2016-05-23,43943866,Gloria,"House is convenient to the subway, clean, and has everything one needs to be comfortable. The host is friendly, and approachable if there are problems."
Things to note: the house is in a noisy neighborhood (south Boston) with lots of street lighting at night. The front bedroom is exposed to this street noise and light. If you live in a city,you'll be used to this,but if not,you'll find it difficult.,,
Walls and ceiling are thin. People walking on second floor,and running up/down stairs to get to the second floor apartment can be heard easier than in most other apartments. Talking outside of the apartment can be heard like you're standing right there talking with them.,,,,
TV is not connected to anything: no cable or satellite service.,,,,,

2135075,76818647,2016-05-29,23220461,Romesh,"The listing was accurate and, perhaps, underestimated how great this unit was. It was a little small, however, it is 100 meters from the Andrew MBTA red line. It is 400 meters from ZipCars. It is near restaurants, a really handy small corner store and a short walk to a major shopping center."
"The small unit has 2 air conditioners. The kitchen is a fun place to make food with family and the TV has many Cable channels. There is also wi-fi. \"",,,,,
2135075,81155036,2016-06-21,39946250,Sarah&Spencer,"Stayed for 2 nights in June. Initial impression of the building entrance is not great as the hallway smells awful, but the apartment itself is good. Space is clean but living room and back bedroom are small. Front bedroom is right on the street so it can be loud at night. Location is great- right across the street from the subway."
2135075,81715659,2016-06-24,76552671,Jerry,Great value and very convenient for everything we wanted to do. Shawn was a pleasure to deal with.
2135075,82544897,2016-06-28,42328679,Yao,"房东的回复非常及时,迅速!我们住了三晚,休息得非常好,房间温度适中,夜里也很安静。感觉这三天房子完全属于我们,没有人会进出打扰,这点安全感对我们来说非常重要。房东把住户需要的基本物品都准备好了,家具家电齐全,厨房里甚至还有油盐,方便了住客,对此非常感谢(没有洗浴用品,我们对此ok)。美中不足的是家具和装修不太新(床有点晃/桌子沙发有破损), 厕所的窗户没有遮挡。另外停车不是很方便,要在街上仔细寻找。对于有很多旅行经验的我们来说,夜里九点左右回到住处时,找到合适的车位需要十分钟到二十分钟, 这是我们尚可接受的程度。总体来说,我们感觉满意。谢谢Shawn!"
2135075,83087412,2016-07-01,79474881,Yue,Very convenient location in terms of subway. Both condition and cleanness are poor though.
2135075,85826048,2016-07-13,80464858,Emily,We enjoyed our stay here.  The location was convenient to the subway - right across the street.  It is also within walking distance of many things we wanted to do.  It was HOT when we were in Boston and the airconditioning in the unit was WONDERFUL!  Shawn did mention in his listing that parking was only on street and only in specific spaces.  These spaces were difficult to find and get.  My suggestion is to plan on not parking on street.  We parked in a garage closer to the city center - this was the easiest solution since we hadn't intended on using our car for getting around while in Boston.   All in all it was a great value!
2135075,89505928,2016-07-28,10966236,Spencer,"Shawn's place was exactly as listed. It was a great value for the price, particularly in Boston's extremely high-priced hotel and Airbnb environment. Shawn's apartment was great, extremely clean, and stocked with towels and bathroom supplies. The entry/exit instructions were extremely easy to follow, and he was extremely responsive both in the lead up to my visit and when I had a question upon arrival. I would highly recommend Shawn's apartment and would definitely stay here on a future trip to Boston."
2135075,90196642,2016-07-31,69994445,Matt,Shawn was very responsive and the home was well prepared for us upon arrival. The location is great for using the train and access to the city.
2135075,93113229,2016-08-11,29898451,Roberto,"Shawn gave us very clear directions on how to get in, without requiring his presence, which turned out very handy as we arrived late in the evening. The house is old but in relatively good shape. The apartment is spacious, and both bedrooms can easily host two guests each. Kitchen appliances are older than they look in the pictures, but everything was working well, especially the fridge."
The neighborhood is not a tourist attraction,but it looks reasonably safe and the biggest plus is the closeness (across the street) to the underground line. In three stations we were in downtown. We managed to leave the car parked for free on Dorchester St.,not far from the apartment,"and use ground transportation to avoid hefty parking bills.\"",,
2135075,94903957,2016-08-17,51887936,Evelyne,"Generally satisfied with our stay, which was comfortable and we were at a good location. The only thing is that there was no aircon in the small room. Shawn was very helpful and replied quickly to queries and requests."

The roof top deck was my favorite part. I wish the description was more accurate. The listing said there were 2 bedrooms with 2 separate beds. Granted, our host was moving within the week overseas, but then his profile should have been updated saying so. For the price I paid, 2 blow up mattress, (one that had a hole in it) and no furniture was not my ideal setup for a vacation. I do feel we should have been reimbursed some of the money we spent. All in all, it was a place to sleep which is really all we needed for our short stay."

Zach and Diane are very cool and gave a lot of nice tips for cruising around Boston - I had never been before. The neighborhood is nice as well. The apartment is very close to the Stony Brook stop on the orange line of the T. Whole foods and Stop & Shop groceries stores are short walks. Jamaica plains is full of inexpensive cuban, dominican, italian, deli restaurants. It was a good stay and I recommend it. I miss the dog already."

13602808,96605427,2016-08-23,14794254,Mark,Great loft apartment.   Supreme location in Seaport area close to everything yet in quiet neighborhood.   The building is an old garment mill from the early 20th century.  Apartment was clean and fully equipped.  A far better alternative to the Intercontinental or other local hotels.  Patrick was a great host who called several times during the week to make sure all was OK.
13602808,97781919,2016-08-28,534418,Emily,"Patrick was a great host and communicated consistently throughout the process, which made for seamless a check in and out process. My friends and I enjoyed the space of having an apartment to relax in versus a cramped hotel room. The apartment was very well located and we enjoyed our time there."

It is close to restaurants , food store , nail spa and transports. The neighbourhood is quiet and safe. We couldn't have been happier. Thank you Richard giving us the best Airbnb experience."
4750791,37842060,2015-07-11,30939204,David,"It was a great pleasure to stay in this beautiful, clean, well-located and well-supplied apartment.  All needs had been anticipated and the provisions were appropriate and high-quality.  Check-in, check-out and communications were smooth and clear.  The WiFi worked beautifully.  We anticipated challenges with parking (due to the urban setting) but it was actually not too bad, using a combination of a nearby lot, occasional open visitor spaces, and meters.  I highly recommend this unit and host to anyone looking to visit Boston and especially the lovely South End."
4750791,46052651,2015-09-07,13706707,Tanya,"Coming from Europe, we were originally a bit miffed by the personal information requested for security purposes. However, it was a beautiful flat and Richard's claims of a spotless flat are not exaggerated e.g. bedding is double covered / protected so really felt clean. High spec appliances and fittings."
"Great location too - a short walk from many great restaurants and bars and 30 mins walk to downtown Boston.\"",,,,,

4750791,50180854,2015-10-10,25036537,Cherie,Our stay at the South End condo was fantastic! The condo is just as beautiful as it appears in the pictures. The area and building felt very secure and safe and everything in the apartment made you feel like you were staying at a high end hotel. The condo location puts you within walking distance to fantastic restaurants and shops in the South End and everything else you wanted to view in Boston was a short can ride or 15 min walk away.  George was also available for questions pre trip and even left a few bottles on wine for enjoyment. Thank you George for the wonderful accommodations!
4750791,53731535,2015-11-11,47861215,Diana,This apartment is such a touch of class. It was exactly as the photos represented and very clean. It was like staying in a hotel but also at the same time felt like a home. I would definitely stay here again!

I arrived later than expected,approx. 8pm,and there was an issue with entering the unit. I messaged Richard and he quickly took action. He met me at the unit within 10 minutes and let me in.,,,
Let me tell you,the wait was worth it...,,,,
The unit is fantastic. Open and spacious,and beyond Spic n Span clean. Seriously,Mr. Clean would be impressed. I can't stress this point enough.,,,
You have a comfortable bed,a great shower,furnishings,appliances,cutlery,cookware - essentially everything you need to call this condo home.
The building and street are also clean,quiet and modern. Franklin Park is right across the street,and you're minutes away from Back Bay where you'll find everything you need,and then some.,,
I highly recommend staying here when you visit Boston.,,,,,
Thank you Richard,,,,,

My trip was very last minute (I only booked a week in advance) and Richard answered all of my question promptly.  The apartment was very clean, to the point of immaculate, and in a great location.  Check in was a breeze and Richard's instructions were very well written.  The silverline stop was only a block away, so I was able to travel around the city without any problems.  There is a grocery store just a few blocks away, which made it very easy to buy food for my few days stay.  This will definitely be my first choice the next time I'm in town and I even recommended it to my friends!"

With their warm and open hospitality, Luz and Daniel had a wonderful way of making me feel completely at home. I stayed with them for a week and enjoyed every moment of my time in their home, including several unexpected meals with them and an impromptu Spanish conversation session.  Their home is simple, welcoming, very well -kept, and conveniently located in a safe and diverse community. It’s a 10-minute walk from terminal A at Logan Airport and a 5-minute walk to the Rental Car Center. It’s also a 1-minute walk to the bus stop and a few more minutes to the Maverick T station. I’m already looking forward to staying at Luz’s home the next time I visit Boston."

The place was very close to T-line (10 min walk) and airport (take the bus to car rental and then a 5 min walk) which we liked a lot. Luz had the perfect plan for us to visit all the historic and popular places in Boston. We got a chance to taste the organic and vegetarian breakfast at the cooperative restaurant - La Sanghita and it was very delicious. She was flexible with the check-out time and allowed us to collect our luggage later in the day. I will highly consider staying at Luz's place in the future.

The location is excellent,close to the city,but not too close. Just a short walk or quick bus ride to the subway,and only one subway stop from the vibrant waterfront. The area is very safe and as two women we felt totally comfortable walking back to the house even late at night. PS.. don't miss the café on the corner! Yum!,,

Me and my girlfriend went to Boston for a 4-night stay. We choose Luz's place because of the nice description,the pictures and its closeness to the airport. Since we arrived at weekend Luz offered us to pick us up from the airport. This was very nice and made our arrival very comfortable.,,,,
After the first night in the very nice room we slept in - which is in size absolutely appropriate for a couple - Luz went with us to the coop around the corner for breakfast. Afterwards she showed us the neighborhood and the amazing park on East Boston's shore which offers the best view on Boston's skyline ever :),,,,,
Luz provided us with more insider tipps about Boston every time we met her. It was always nice to chat with her about Boston but also other regions of the US and other countries.,,,,,
The other days Luz provided us with coffee,fresh fruits and toast for breakfast - we liked it a lot.,,,,
In summary,Luz made everything to make our stay a very comfortable one. Her place is highly recommendable!,,,,
"Thanks a lot!\"",,,,,

She gave us some tips on where to eat, the Italian restaurant around the corner is indeed very nice, and there are nice parks in the neighbourhoods with a great view of the Boston skyline. Luz even prepared a little breakfast for us! The house was really clean, and the location is as described: Close to the airport, so not downtown, but it is easy to reach the city by subway. All in all, it's a great place to stay, and Luz is a great host. She even dropped us off at the airport!"

There were some cookies and water prepared. Luz was really nice to introduce us the nearby restaurants and a park having good view of Boston's skyline. From the house, it's a walking distance to Maverick Station for 10min. There are  also Bus No 120 at the corner you can ride."
Every morning Luz prepares breakfast herself. One day we had to catch train,Luz drove us to station and the last day she gave us a ride too. And she send us a cute gift we really appreciated!,,,,

The location is in the center of Boston, so that is really convenient to go anywhere. 15 min from the airport, and just 3 min walk to the subway station. The room is bright and everything is clean. However, there would be a little noisy around midnight since the apartment is beside the road and a bar right under the floor."

9111413,68332298,2016-04-04,1703980,Marilyn,"I spent 4 nights here while attending a conference, and for convenience I loved the location...location...location...this place is perfectly situated to easily walk around downtown Boston plus 2 doors away from the T station. Can't beat that for EZ access. On the downside, its location is above the 49Social bar/restaurant and there's another bar across the street. It was very noisy, impossible to sleep, even after earplugs and a sleeping pill, especially Friday night with the booming band's bass throbbing through the walls like a jackhammer bam bam bam and the throngs of drunks bellowing out on the street below in the early morning hours like town criers gone mad. Plus the other occupants in the building think nothing of yelling and tromping up and down the stairs at all hours. The place is very secure on the second floor reached by a dark, dinghy, stairway up stairs covered with a filthy carpet. So I was surprised that the apartment appeared clean and pleasant, however it was occupied when I arrived at 3:30pm by a young woman who apologized and said she didn't think I was coming until 4pm and she just needed to take a shower and she would leave. I said ok and she left after her shower, leaving clean towels. Later Rebecca, who manages the apartment for the owner Talal, told me that the woman wasn't supposed to have been there. The incident didn't bother me too much. Apparently she was a friend or employee of the owner. Once the woman was gone, I found the apartment very spacious and suitable. That is, until that evening when sitting at the table, I saw something move along the floor and jumped when I saw it was a very fast-moving mouse. That night I saw 3 of them and called Rebecca to see what could be done. She was very apologetic and said that Talal, the owner, had another Airbnb apt but it was going to be occupied so I couldn't move there, and she would have the building maintenance guy set some traps. Jose came the next evening and reassured me that the building and Boston is full of mice and putting out these plastic packets would cause their demise. And they did. After the first two nights I saw no more mice but I did have to endure for the rest of my stay the musty mouse odor in the kitchen. I wish I could have moved but my conference schedule did not permit that. I asked Rebecca about some compensation for the situation and she agreed that was appropriate but did not get back to me on that. She did invite me down to the bar for free drinks when the wifi upstairs was not working. (It worked off and on throughout) I was appalled that everyone seemed to trivialize this rodent situation...the bartender laughed about little Micky Mouse skitting about the floor. I expected the owner Talal to contact me and offer something, if only..."
9111413,68743338,2016-04-06,59029350,Alice,"the location is very good where is not only next to the T station but also near the Macy's  department store and t the park. however, the Internet wasn't good when I arrived. At least, the property is very good and cozy."
9111413,69219180,2016-04-10,590821,Amy,"The apartment was conveniently within walking distance to many shops and restaurants, so the location couldn't be beat. Talal booked my reservation and Rebecca communicated with me leading up to our arrival. We got there at 3:00pm, our check-in time, and around 3:30pm a man walked in the door without knocking or announcing himself. It was Jose, the building maintenance person, who was friendly and apologetic for barging in. However, it was a little unnerving. We went out for dinner and a show, and when we returned, the restaurant downstairs had turned into a bumping nightclub and the noise didn't stop until 2:00am. We had read about the noise in one review, but we felt it should have been communicated in the listing. In the morning, we were hoping to sleep in after being kept awake by the music, but the curtains in the bedroom do not come up to the top of the window and let in a ton of light. Overall, we were happy with the location of the apartment but would not recommend it to anyone traveling with young children where noise would be a concern."
9111413,70663665,2016-04-19,20491082,Katie,"Rebecca was great, my flight was extremely delayed and she was able to accommodate my arrival times with no issues."
The apartment is very cute and comfortable,however be aware that it faces the street and there was very loud street noise and noise within the building. It was not an issue on Monday night,"but Saturday and Sunday night (Monday was a holiday) were extremely loud all night long. \"",,,
9111413,71130163,2016-04-23,65017984,Mark,Rebecca was great in communicating with us and accommodating our needs during our stay.  She checked in with us and was very responsive to questions.  We appreciated her hospitality.
Location,location,location.  Great location just off the Common and within a very active part Boston with shopping,sightseeing,dining,pubs
As noted in other reviews,being on the second floor in an active part of Boston,it stays pretty noisy most all the time with traffic,buses,the bars/restaurants,"and early deliveries.  Realize it's over a bar so the music and patrons are busy until early morning hours on weekend nights.  Plan on 3 to 4 hours of quiet during any given night.\""
9111413,71708594,2016-04-27,3504790,Angela,"This property was great!  The location was central to many areas of interest, and the apartment had everything we needed for a relaxing and enjoyable stay.  Rebecca made it very easy to check in and out and suggested local places to eat.  Thanks for everything!"
9111413,72126606,2016-05-01,22303847,Natalie,The place was very nice and very clean. The location was great and it was all very accommodating. I highly recommend the place the only thing is to unlock the door is a little tricky so you have to play with it a little other than that it was great.
9111413,73651115,2016-05-09,62455598,Niamarie,"This was a lovely one bedroom right in the center of Boston. The apartment was very clean and it was a pleasant stay. It was within walking distance of everything we wanted to do. We didn't have much contact with Rebecca when we were there, but that just means everything went smoothly."
However on our last day,about an hour before we were going to check out,a lady from maintenance walked through the door unannounced/without knocking which was worrying,however we weren't too bothered as we were leaving in an hour.,,
In regards to other reviews talking about the loud music below the apartment,it didn't bother us because we were out late during our weekend there,"so missed it.\"",,,
9111413,74184308,2016-05-13,7321005,Dan,"The apartment was nice and Rebecca made me feel very welcome. The apartment was easy to get to and in a great location. There was a bit of street noise, but not enough to bother me."
9111413,74455509,2016-05-15,6734856,Sonya,"Had a great experience with Rebecca.  She was very respectful and getting into the apartment was easy.  The place was clean and had extra blankets and pillows for someone to sleep on the couch.  The living room furniture is slightly different from what is in the picture but still big enough for someone to sleep on (minor detail) and there is an opening between the bedroom and living room high up ( so its not fully closed in (another minor detail but I just didn't realize that) .  The location of the place was safe, easy to find and had lots of stuff close by like a convenient store, restaurants, liquor store, shopping, and so close to boston commons so great if you are here to be a tourist.   She had wifi available also that was easy to access.  The only thing i would mention that really isnt any of her control is that on saturday night there was extremely loud music playing from either the restaurant next door or one of her neighbors, not sure which one but it went on until about 3am.  Overall, no major issues and a great stay.  Thanks so much."
9111413,74976503,2016-05-17,31744541,Jen,"Rebecca's place was pretty much perfect.  Clean, well-appointed, stylish and convenient.  I stayed only two nights, but this would be good for longer term too because of nice living space and spacious kitchen with great appliances etc.  highly recommend."
9111413,76339882,2016-05-26,3070075,Steven,"This was a wonderful place to stay.  Rebecca was waiting for us at the time we agreed upon so we quickly were able to enter the apartment. Rebecca showed us around and did a wonderful job of answering questions and generally making us feel welcome.  The apt was clean and very well appointed.  We really appreciated the fact that there was a closet with hangers and a dresser to place our clothes.  The kitchen had sufficient supplies for us to cook simple meals.  Rebecca even brought us some great ground coffee so that we had some available in the morning.  The location couldn't be better and is close to several subway stations and many attractions.  The only negative to be aware of is that on Friday and Saturday, from about 10 pm until 2 am there was music coming from the bar/restaurant below the apt.  It was not terribly loud, but there was this definite sort of bass vibration that came up through the floor boards of the apt.  We found that it didn't bothers us, but I suppose it could if you need a really quiet environment to sleep.  Also, there was some street noise, e.g. you could hear people talking, but we didn't think that was a significant problem.  All in all, I'd stay here again (or at a place hosted by Rebecca) without hesitation."
9111413,77185776,2016-05-30,7173812,Robyn,"Rebecca was the perfect host. She was very accommodating when our bus was delayed getting in. She walked us right in and made she we had everything we needed to be comfortable. The apartment was in an excellent location. The orange and green T were right there! Everything was pretty walkable from the apartment - we only took the T when we were in a time crunch and needed to get to Back Bay. The apartment had everything we needed for cooking and dining, which saved us a lot of money (and time). The location is downtown, so it does get a little noisy at night. If you are a light sleeper or go to bed early, I would recommend earplugs."
9111413,77859623,2016-06-04,35051210,James,"Check in was easy, location was excellent. Close to shops and restaurants, as well as public transport - perfect for sightseeing in Boston. The apartment itself was clean and comfortable (apart from the creaky bed), the kitchen was stocked with cooking utensils and things like coffee and condiments, the bathroom was clean and had toiletries for guests to use. Bathroom doorknob was broken when we arrived and fell off at some point during our stay, not a big deal though it could be inconvenient."
Some concerns; while the apartment itself was clean,the main entrance of the building seems to be used as a urinal by people outside. On two mornings,the floor outside was wet and stank of what could only be urine. I understand that pedestrians outside are not within the control of the host,but just putting it out there that this is a problem. Also,the area can be pretty noisy during the night - as it is on top of a restaurant/ bar. Also since the apartment is on the 2nd floor,facing the street
All in all,the place was excellent value for money despite the inconvenience. If you're in Boston for short stay,"this is highly recommended. \"",,,
9111413,78458059,2016-06-06,54568998,Bethny,We had a wonderful stay here!
Although we never met Rebecca in person,she answered all my questions in a timely matter and was very helpful. Easy access to both the building and apartment with passcode keyless entry.,,,,
The place is gorgeous and clean. Fresh towels,linens,etc. Even mini Bottles of shampoo,conditioner,and body wash like in hotels. The apartment is In one of the best locations in the city. Right downtown in the theatre district; Boston Common at the end of the street. Tons of restaurants and cafes around. The best part,is the T stop is literally at your doorstep where you can catch 3 of the 5 lines (orange
General info to note but not necessarily bad/good things: *the hallway up to the apartment is steep and about 25 stairs (and it smells- but the apartment doesn't!) so just beware if you are limited in mobility.,,,,,
*there are tvs with cable in the living room and bedroom but they have to be on the same channel,which is controlled in living room.,,,,
*shower curtain must be super tight against the wall on both ends or shower leaks on the floor.,,,,,
*kitchen is pretty much fully loaded! There is even a dishwasher! However,there is no toaster or cutting board.,,,,

9111413,79158832,2016-06-11,53339201,Brighton,"My husband and I loved staying in this location. This apartment is in the perfect central location if you want to see all of beautiful sites of Boston. It is right next to Boston Commons, all the T-lines, and the great attractions. We just loved knowing we could be in walking distance to everything. The apartment was clean and well maintained."
Rebecca was very easy to communicate with. Our flight arrived very early in the morning and let us check in as soon as we got in.,,,,,
The only downfall is the windows are older (its located in an older building) and you can hear a lot of noise from the street. We brought with us earplugs and slept just great through it. I would recommend bringing an eyemask and earplugs because the top of the windows are not completely covered with a curtain and can be really bright. The grocery store was right around the corner and we were able to save some money and eat in the apartment.,,,,,
The apartment does come with dishes,which was so nice to have. Overall,"we would definitely stay here again! \"",,,

9111413,81535300,2016-06-23,4769131,Kristy,"This apartment was exactly as described and pictured. Right in downtown Boston you can easily walk to many places on the freedom trail. We took a lot of tours through Brush Hill tours and it is a short 0.5 mile walk to catch the tours.  As previously stated there is some street noise and music specifically on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights. Rebecca did provide us with a fan that really helped block out those noises. Rebecca is very accessible  and quick to respond to questions and requests. The apartment was very clean and the towels smelt great! I would highly recommend this apartment and location!!"
9111413,81934774,2016-06-25,5835798,Malina,This was our first time to Boston and our stay was amazing.  Rebecca was always prompt to respond and was great to work with.  The apartment was at a great location and very clean.  She was very knowledgable is what was around the apartment for shopping and eating and was able to get us a discount at the reasturant below the apartment which was greatly appreciated! We ended up leaving behind a stuffed animal and Rebecca was great to work with to help get it sent back to us.  I highly recommend this place for a nice stay in Boston.  I hope to stay here again on  my next trip to Boston! Thank you for making our first time there an amazing experience!
9111413,82141643,2016-06-26,62252341,Kelly,"The place was very spacious and clean as the pictures showed and came with all the necessities such as a blow drier, extra shampoo etc. The bed was very comfortable, although we did not receive a very good nights sleep because of all of the noise below from the bar and then the after bar crowd that made its way outside. We could not check in on time because the previous guest was still there so we did need to make some arrangements for things to do in the afternoon to wait until the place was ready. We didn't wind up getting to the place until around 5. Overall it was very easy to access and the best location, 10 minutes from Faneuil hall and shops and restaurants right below."

Within 30 seconds access to the T line@Downtown Crossing Station. It's really lucky to stay at the apartment having such good location and enjoy local life, restaurant and shopping. Recommended restaurant: Pho Pasteur, Legal Crossing and Stoddard's Fine Food and Ale. We stayed here on weekday, the noises from the bar stopped before midnight, so it was fine for us. We would highly recommend this apartment and location!!"

Rebecca was easily contactable & sent us detailed info on how to find it & how to enter the flat. The flat itself is a perfect home form home with everything catered for. I have only 2 issues, its on a very noisy road, throughout the night its constant, If the double glazing was improved & the white blinds & curtains were replaced with dark to stop the bright light & heat coming in, it would be PERFECT.. But saying that i would totally stay here again..Thank you Rebecca."
9111413,88438641,2016-07-24,10889479,Natalie,Great location; easy & helpful communication with Rebecca; good size space for 3 adults.

La cocina está perfecta para cocinar aunque faltaban algunos utensilios como ser ollas y asaderas. Es importante aclarar que es un primer piso con una escalera bastante alta. Rebecca fue muy amable con nosotros."

The unit was sparkling clean and was very comfortable for the three of us. There was an issue with the air conditioning leaking but Rebecca was constantly following up and ensuring it was repaired by the end of our stay.,,,,,

9111413,92856287,2016-08-10,43706801,Carlton,Rebecca was easy to communicate with and very welcoming.

11826815,65924361,2016-03-18,51343202,Jon,Derian offered me a room last minute without hesitation and made things easy. He adjusted his busy rooming schedule to accommodate what I was looking for. He even went out of his way to grab an extra desk and chair for the room from downstairs. This is the second room in his place I have stayed and both rooms are exceptional. I would highly recommend booking with Derian.

We left the car there for the weekend and used the t. We bought our tickets at a convenience store near the stop.  The apt was very nice, the bed and pillows were really comfy. My friend stayed on the couch which was comfortable. The pull out part is a trundle for kids, and the top part is like a twin bed size. There was plenty of extra bedding. Communication was great with Misha. I would definitely recommend this place."

The reservoir makes for a great morning walk and escape from the city. The Green line T is conveniently across the street. Misha was a great host. He was easily reachable and extremely quick with resolving any issues we might have had. The A/C wasn't functioning properly on day 1 and Misha replaced it very quickly. Overall it was a great stay. We also really enjoyed the nespresso machine.

We bought groceries at the cute grocery across the street, we walked EVERYWHERE in Boston and took the T to more remote locations.  It is  a fabulous location.  The bed was super comfortable, the kitchen was well appointed.  It was spotlessly clean.  The building was quiet. We'd really like to keep it a secret so it's available on our next visit."

I should also mention how perfect the location is! For my first visit to Boston, this studio on Newbury was so convenient. I ended up enjoying my self so much that I extended my stay another night, the host was very accommodating to all of my requests. The host also responded very quickly to any questions I had during my stay. Overall a wonderful experience!"
7856323,64138462,2016-02-29,1579201,Rain,"I have mixed feelings about this place. It's in a great location with shopping and food and just an overall great neighborhood. It's also got a  kitchen that is well stocked. It looked  just like the pictures. And there were some extras like candles and such. However, I was told that there was a queen bed and it was a full sized bed. Also, the water would only stay hot for a 5 minute shower. It's also extremely hard to get in and out of the place. It's got four flights of stairs which is rough with luggage. Parking in the neighborhood was $300 for the week.  The company that was hosting was easily reachable."
7856323,66469023,2016-03-22,59183910,Katie,Great little studio
I was in town for a conference and wanted to stay close to the Hynes at a price cheaper than nearby hotels and this place really delivered.,,,,,
First of all,The studio is pretty much as pictured. It was on the third floor although flatbook also owns rooms on the second and fourth. Front door opens up into the living area with a full size bed on the far wall under the big bay windows. The kitchen is off to the right and is pretty new and stocked with some essentials such as some coffee and tea. There is a washer/dryer combo in the kitchen which is interesting but convenient for longer trips though I didn't need to use it. The bathroom is a bit dated but nothing glaringly wrong with it.,,,,
My biggest problem with the place is probably the shower. The water doesn't seem to get particularly hot and although I never ran out of hot water I can see how someone else might. It's not a place to take a luxurious long hot shower. Also there's not much space to have your toiletries out in the open,just on top of the toilet really. However,there is a linen closet in the bathroom.,,,
Another nitpicky detail is a lack of table space. There's a cute chest/coffee table but it's not really a place to eat at if you're so inclined,and the kitchen only had one stool if you wanted to sit at the counter. We only had this problem once,though,since there are a ton of restaurants to explore in the immediate vicinity.,,
More importantly,the place was very clean and otherwise quite comfortable. There was some road noise at night but not too much,less than what I expected for the area. Which brings me to the best thing about this place- the location. It's right in the thick of things on Newbury. My husband had no problem exploring the area shops and restaurants while I was stuck in conference meetings all day! There's a drugstore on the corner as well if you forgot to bring any necessity.,,,
Overall the negatives are really quite minor and did not detract from my stay. I would absolutely recommend this place to others,and would stay here again in a heartbeat.,,,,
"Of note I had a minor issue getting into the apartment when I arrived- the folks at Flatbook answered my phone call right away and sorted it out.\"",,,,,

7856323,69914542,2016-04-14,8378525,Danielle,"My sister and I had a wonderful stay at this apartment.  The location is perfect - right on Newbury St, dining, shops and more. Plus it's very easy to get the metro or bus to anywhere else in the city."
The apartment itself is beautiful,clean and has all the amenities you need,including basic kitchen items and fast wifi.,,,
One small issues was I had some difficulty accessing the key from the lock box upon check in,and had to call customer support to assist. The person I spoke to mentioned that other guests had experienced similar issues in which the box jams a little - hopefully they will replace this so future guests have a better check in experience.,,,,
Overall,a great option for Boston accommodation!,,,,

7856323,72284943,2016-05-01,6589081,Meghan,"Studio was perfect for our weekend stay in Boston. Came here with my boyfriend to celebrate my birthday. Neither of us had been to Boston before and we couldn't have asked for a more perfect location to stay. We were conveniently located near everything we needed (food, Fenway, shopping, subway, airport, etc)."
The studio is a good size for two people. We didn't plan to spend much time in the apartment other than sleeping so it fit our needs well. Only thing that was different than we expected is that the bed,while very comfortable,is only a double and I think it is advertised as a queen.,,,
Only negative was that we had upstairs neighbors who caused a lot of noise late night,but nothing that Flatbook could've probably prevented,and nothing we haven't experienced in a hotel. Flatbook owns most of the apartments in the building which makes accessing the apartment easy,but also can result in annoying renters.,,
"Would definitely stay here again.  \"",,,,,
7856323,73084375,2016-05-06,15527398,Shalena,Flatbed are very responsive and non-intrusive. You basically check in and out without needing to see anyone. They also provide you with a folder of helpful information about Boston in the apartment which is great.
The apartment is absolutely gorgeous and looks exactly like the pictures. The location is also perfect and incredibly central. Its a stone's throw to Boston Commons and there are a tonne of cafes,"restaurants and shops all within a five minute walk. The \"\"T\"\" is also within a 5-10 minute walk. The Uber ride from the airport was about $20.",,,,
The apartment is super clear and has all the amenities you could possibly need (hair dryer,washer,toiletries,etc).,,
The only real downside we faced was luggage storage. Our flight was not until 10pm of our check out date. We were given slightly later check out (1pm instead of 11) but that didn't really help with the luggage situation. We ended up having to pay $50 to store it elsewhere. Other AirBnb hosts we've stayed with have always been able to accommodate so this was quite an inconvenience.,,,,,
But otherwise,"this place is great! One of the nicest and best located AirBnbs we've stayed at. \"",,,,

Desvantagens, apartamentos no terceiro andar, um vizinho santo me ajudou com as malas. A Newbury é muito barulhenta a noite, carros e jovens bagunçando, principalmente no fim de semana. A equipe do Flatbook é muito organizada."
7856323,79350858,2016-06-12,12286450,Ben & Asya,Overall it was a good experience but there are couple things that weren't perfect. Katie's review from March 2016  describes this listing perfectly.
The place is chip for Boston,the location is great,the design is beautiful,the bad is hardly double bad,"there are no real drapes so if you need complete darkness for good sleep you better bring blindfold. The hot water is a problem because the owners didn't mentioned in the listing descriptions that the amount of the hot water is limited and you need to wait at list 30 minutes between showers (or else you do both of them really quick).  \"",
7856323,81651423,2016-06-24,21983024,Gregory,Great apt in a fantastic neighborhood! Centrally located and walkable to everything you want to see. Host always available and willing to help with any questions. Would definitely stay here again.

7856323,83122445,2016-07-01,61432947,Rachel,"The neighborhood was great. The unit was nice. The rug is very worn (dirty), especially in the white parts. That happens! It's probably just a poor choice of rug. The glass chest of drawers was shattered, but it still worked! Bathroom was nice and clean. Regardless of flaws, the location can't be beat."

7856323,86542190,2016-07-16,2674595,Brian,Pros:
-The flatbook team was easy to communicate with via email. -Check-in was simple; keys in a lockbox outside.,,,,,
-The location is the best thing about this apartment. It is located right on Newbury street in the middle of tons of shops and restaurants,two blocks away from a Trader Joes! I did all my grocery shopping there and found myself not really eating out much. It is also two blocks from the Hynes Convention Center and a short walk to Fenway park,and centrally located to most major sites in Boston.,,,
-Overall the studio is a nice space with tons of natural light. The kitchen was modern and the bathroom was simple but clean.,,,,,
It was 90+ degrees F each day I visited and since the building is very old there is no central A/C but a large window unit did a pretty good job of cooling things off.,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
"The first line of the site's description is \"\"you'll find a clean place.\"\" For the most part that was true with a few big exceptions.",,,,,
The fitted bed sheet was not clean. There were many large fluid-like stains on the top of the sheet as well as reddish/brown stains along the sides of the bed. The overlying sheet and comforter appeared clean however. When I contacted the team they apologized but it took over a day before I received new sheets and even then,they were left hanging in a Whole Foods bag on my front door. I guess they expected me to change the dirty sheets myself? I've never had an experience like this at any other Airbnb.,,,,
Additionally,I never sat on the couch because it was similar to the bed; stains on all the couch cushions and dirty-appearing.,,,,
Finally,the welcome manual had a large messy substance clinging to the front plastic cover and the pages inside appeared dirty as if something had spilled all over them and then dried out.  I had to wash my hands after picking it up.,,,,
In conclusion,while the location was great,"there are many great Airbnb sites in Boston that offer a clean residence. I will not be staying at a Flatbook location again. \"",,,
14296152,97910245,2016-08-28,51427654,Savannah,"Arrived after a long day of flying and Ketai and his wife made the check-in super quick and easy. I ended up meeting one of the guys living there too and he was super nice. The room was super nice. There was a clean, comfy bed and lots of storage space. At night the place was very quiet - I did not even hear the train station near the house. The bathroom on the other hand... Was a little scary. It was dirty and the shower was falling apart. However, this place was in a super convenient location and I could work with the scary bathroom because of the location and affordability."

This apt. Was extremely clean and tidy. Nice comfortable bed and cute living room. A great place to curl up with a book.,,,,,
Although everything needed is provided I advise to always bring your own toiletries,hair dryer,snacks and sleeping bag. Bringing these essentials to every Airbnb I stay at has been helpful. I use Airbnb often even when abroad.,,,

It is conveniently located, with stores and dining options super close by, plus street parking and a bus stop right outside, so really everything you could need. But what made our stay at this property so lovely was the warmth and attention to detail that Lita so thoughtfully provides and the beautiful decor and details. It's clear that this home is treasured and well cared for, and we truly felt like a friend had allowed us use of their beautiful home for the weekend. Everything you could possibly need is provided, which allowed us to spend our time together with ease, whether in the home, dining at the corner restaurant or strolling to the pond and admiring the other beautiful houses in area. We happily recommend this lovely property."

It is a charming place and it worked well for us. The rooms and bathrooms were a bit smaller than expected, but very workable. Beds are comfortable with nice linens. Lita, who lives in the building, was quick to supply extra towels, sheets, and blankets, and all our interactions were extremely pleasant. There are nice little inglenooks for private conversations and catching up on work. WiFi access is free but limited to the sunroom area."
The kitchen is clean and well-equipped,with a round oak table seating 6+. One of the bathrooms is inside a bedroom but easily accessible to all during the day.,,,,
We were able to park in the driveway which is helpful in a busy neighborhood near a hospital complex. There is a Whole Foods two blocks away and other services and restaurants within walking distance. Lita provided coffee and tea,music CDs,and tourist/transit info.,,,
The stair lift was very welcome for an older member of our group,as there is a steep interior flight of stairs from the front door to the second-floor flat (there are about 8 steps to the front door as well.) There is a door buzzer system with a security feature allowing someone upstairs in the flat to see who is at the front door. In all,"a very nice home-away-from-home.\"",,,

Although it is located in Jamaica Plain (greater Boston) you can be in in the city centre within 30 minutes including the walk to the subway station. There isa 7Eleven right next to the house as well as a CVS pharmacy and a few restaurants. I would definitely recommend if you want to stay in Boston."

1109224,22135596,2014-10-31,18141226,Hannah & Duncan,The description was pretty much spot on so our expectations were met.
The location is extremely handy...bus connections to the city are right outside. The 'T' is only a 10 minute stroll down a quiet road. The only consideration would be a bit of road noise as it's a busy road at rush hour. But it's not extreme.,,,,,
There are some excellent eateries within easy reach. One (Canary Square is 50 yards from the door),and a few cafe / coffee shops a 10 minute stroll into Jamaica Plain.,,,,
The bedrooms are all excellent sizes. There were 6 adults and an 18 month toddler in our group. Plenty of room for us all and are bags (travelled in from UK and New Zealand,so we had plenty!).,,,,
The bathrooms have everything you'd expect,as does the kitchen. We ate in most evenings and we had all we needed.,,,,
The kitchen is a bit tight for eating space...the round table is a good size,but would be a squeeze if there's more than 6 of you eating.,,,,
Jamaica Pond (5 minute stroll away) is beautiful. An idyllic spot for a stroll. We visited end of October so the trees were an array of colours and a freshness in the air.,,,,,
"We'd certainly recommend Lita's property for a group who are looking for comfort a little way out of the city centre (albeit you can be in the city within minutes). We really enjoyed our stay. Thanks Lita.\"",,,,,
1109224,22941706,2014-11-17,20145745,(EMAIL HIDDEN),The reservation was canceled 86 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1109224,23359220,2014-11-30,20656644,Jill,"Our family of four, 2 adults, 2 children ages 12 and 14, enjoyed our stay at this beautiful condo.  Lita met us upon arrival, showed us around and provided helpful tips.  She told us not to hesitate to call her if we needed anything, showing great hospitality."
The condo is the entire 2nd floor of the building.  There are tenants on the first floor and Lita is on the 3rd floor so she is close by if needed.  Laundry facilities are in the basement.  The condo was very clean and cozy and the location is ideal for exploring Boston.   The T stop,the main street of Jamaica Plain with many shops and restaurants and Jamaica Pond are a short walk away.,,,,
Although the condo has 4 bedrooms it is compact.   We were very comfortable as a family of 4 and think the space is best suited for up to 5 or 6 persons.,,,,,
"We hope to return and would highly recommend this condo. \"",,,,,
1109224,23572720,2014-12-05,15943116,Jon,Lita's place was great! And Lita's place was great! My staff and I have stayed at many Airbnb's across the country and Lita's place was one of our favorites. Nice part of town. A Whole Foods is nearby and we grabbed dinner locally a few nights and the restaurants were great.
1109224,23741523,2014-12-09,19566041,Karen,"The house was clean, central and offered us enough space to not feel like we were living on top of each other. This was a concern as we were traveling as a group of 7. The kitchen was well stocked with appliances etc. to allow us to cook and prepare several meals."
The bus line,fantastic restaurants and WholeFoods were within walking distance. These were all a plus,plus,plus.,,
We had several questions during our stay and Lita answered each one quickly. Overall,"I would stay here again if I found myself in Boston. \"",,,,
1109224,24706555,2015-01-02,21149612,Walter,"Lita was a great host; she showed us the apartment, every detail was explained well, and then left us to enjoy our new home for a week. The neighborhood is great: bus line outside the door, food store 1 block away, CVS even closer. On street parking was easy."
The six of us were very comfortable during the stay,"and recommend it highly if you visit Boston. \"",,,,
1109224,26261185,2015-02-08,7829312,Adi,I am the co-founder of a ride-sharing platform called Tripda ((URL HIDDEN) - our team was exhibiting at the Boston Globe Travel Show on February 6-8 and we needed a place nearby as we were lugging much equipment back and forth and were very tired by the time we arrived to the house after a whole day at the show.
Lita was very nice,waited for us until late to let us in,walked us through all the amenities in the house and told us about the neighborhood and where we can find anything we need.,,,
The house was clean and well maintained,"and we loved the beautiful fireplace!\"",,,,
1109224,27872300,2015-03-14,23096066,Junyong,Lita's house was really nice. I and my friends had a great time in there. Location is perfect and facilities were really nice. I strongly recommend Lita's house for everybody.
1109224,29032236,2015-04-03,22801751,Jane,"We were a party of 7 - 2 grandparents, 2 parents and 3 boys aged 8, 5 and 2.  The accommodation was perfect - comfortable and well equipped with plenty of space for the boys.   Lita was a great host and provided us with lots of useful information. The neighbourhood was great with good transport links into central Boston. There was an excellent child-friendly restaurant, Canary Square,  two doors away."
1109224,32048062,2015-05-13,26700894,Juan,THE House os Gert confortable and very clean. Lita is friendly and respectfull.
1109224,35057035,2015-06-15,18195350,Jamie,"My family stayed here during the week of my wedding. They found it to be a beautiful, comfortable, and very conveniently located space.   Our host, Lita was incredibly friendly and helpful - and responsive to our inquiries.   It is on the second floor of a three floor building."
1109224,37769658,2015-07-10,34842343,Mingyu,It's a nice and comfortable house. Lita is really friendly and helpful.
1109224,40202242,2015-07-29,29800731,Thierry,Disappointing experience.
The reality doesn't correspond to the  description and photo. It isn't very clean nor comfortable. It s noisy and the price was too high for what we got.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1109224,42117294,2015-08-11,31894532,Patrick,"Lita was a very welcoming, sincere host who made us all feel right at home. The apartment is well located, with direct bus connection to the popular Back Bay area although down town is a bit further. There are useful local shops and restaurants providing all that you need. The apartment is traditional in style and is well equipped."
1109224,44880976,2015-08-30,8546761,Mary,"My husband arrived at the property before I did, and Lita was very friendly and took him through the apartment and told him how everything functioned.  We were in Jamaica Plain for a wedding and she graciously let us use the backyard to entertain some of the wedding party on Thursday night. We are very appreciative. The apartment itself was lovely and just as pictured."
The neighborhood was very convent to a variety of restaurants and stores,"and there was ample on street parking.\"",,,,
1109224,49997525,2015-10-08,42788097,Eric,Lita's description of home was perfect! Home was equipped with all amenities needed for an enjoyable vacation with a 7-11 located across the street for any odds and ends needed.   Home was located 1/2 mile from T station which made for an enjoyable walk to and from station for easy access throughout the city.  I would definitely stay at this location on a return visit.  Thanks again Lita.
1109224,50634051,2015-10-13,5446679,Paul,"What a great time we had at Lita's place in Boston! 7/11 across the street for snacks, Whole Foods down the road for breaky, close to a bus and train that go straight to Copley Square, and great spaces to live. Had 8 adult family members and no complaints from anyone. Loved it!"
1109224,53958450,2015-11-15,30484093,Olga,"Lita was very helpful, friendly and welcoming - she provided us a full information on how to use everything in the house and was very responsive."
The location is great - the Stony Brook T station is in a short walking distance (about 10 mins),bus stop is just outside the house. The way to Downtown Crossing or Copley Square takes maximum 30 minutes,normally it's much faster.  There are many places to eat and drink in a walking distance,food store is just one block away,7/11 and CVS are just across the street.,
The house was well-equiped with everything necessary. We used a free parking place for a rented car just in front of the house.,,,,,
The only remark we could make is that it was not clean enough - we noticed dust somewhere in the house and crumbs on the kitchen. As for towels,bed linen - they were clean.,,,,
For such a big company as ours (7 adults,"2 kids) the apartment was very comfortable!\"",,,,
1109224,68278643,2016-04-04,22068655,Lyse,"We just returned after a nine day stay at Lita's property. It was perfect for our purposes: a beautiful and comfortable home, with everything we could possibly need provided. It was centrally located, in a lovely neighbourhood which we really enjoyed exploring. Whole Foods was very close by and a number of interesting restaurants were near by as well. It was accessible to transit, right on the bus line or just a short walk to the T, so easy to get to downtown Boston and other areas of the city. The only downsides were that the house is at a major intersection so its quite noisy, and the room heating was a bit tricky to sort out. But we absolutely enjoyed the house - there's lots of room in each of the bedrooms and the main living areas were all beautifully decorated and very comfortable. Its a wonderful place to make your home base in Boston."
1109224,72412971,2016-05-02,2120134,Xiao,"Lita was very accommodating regarding our arrival, which unfortunately was delayed by several hours due to air travel issues. The house was neat and just as pictured. Our guests loved the place and will definitely be staying here again when they return."
1109224,73623641,2016-05-09,20043185,Sarena,Confusing themostat- extremely warm in the middle of night even when heat was turned off
Old house,so squeaky floors and thin walls,loud bus stop,,,
Toaster didn't really work,,,,,
Great electric wheelchair up the stairs,,,,,
Large enough for big family,lots of towels and well stocked kitchen,,,,
Cleanly,,,,,
Nice furnishings,,,,,
Some beds very comfortable,,,,,
"Good proximity to pond and restaurants \"",,,,,
1109224,74754540,2016-05-16,17924842,Eric,"I booked this condo for my family for graduation weekend. It was perfect! It was very comfortable and in a great location with easy access to Whole Foods and CVS among other restaurants. Lita was able to accommodate us earlier than we had expected as well, which was a big help. Would definitely stay here again!"
1109224,82104646,2016-06-26,52764168,T,Lita was Very Kind and Welcoming! The place was Super Convenient to the T. We were downtown in minutes.    The place worked out perfectly for the 3 days in Boston.
1109224,87720200,2016-07-21,66377771,Jillian,House was very spacious and clean. No complaints. Lita was very welcoming. We loved our stay in Boston. Lots of towels/extra blankets/pillows and a well stocked kitchen. Beds were very comfortable. Neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. Thanks for the great time!
1109224,99669666,2016-09-05,55923407,Lisa,"The apartment was charming, and as described, and much cheaper than renting two or three hotel rooms for our group.  It was clean and comfortable, and we especially appreciated having enough keys available for all of us, the complimentary coffee, and the hair dryers!"
The neighborhood provided all the conveniences we needed - between us all we went to Whole Foods,CVS,and the 7-11 across the street.,,,
Most of all - the good value for a large number of people,and easy and free street parking were the reasons we booked this listing.  We didn't find,as some other reviewers have,the street to be particularly noisy (but we all live in cities).,,
All communications with the owner were smooth and clear,and she was very flexible about our check-in and check-out times - no issues.,,,,
While not as close as other neighborhoods to what we were there for (moving our son to Northeastern),it was painless to get there by car (we didn't try the bus - but I understand that is easy too).  We even walked one day from Northeastern - it's really not that far from major city attractions.  We also enjoyed walking around the neighborhood looking at the old victorian houses.,,,,
Finally,"the kitchen table is a cosy place for a good card game!\"",,,,
4263736,21065400,2014-10-10,20223744,Rodrigo,Jonathan was great!

The apartment is wonderful - we had a clean room, a large private bathroom, a comfy bed, fast internet - everything you could wish for. The best deal in town! Would definitely recommend!"
4263736,21254473,2014-10-13,22134987,Cody,"Jonathan was an excellent host,  he was very welcoming and flexible with checking in and out. Though he wasn't able to meet us when we arrived,  he made arrangements for someone to show us around and left instructions."
The apartment was very modern and the room itself was clean,well kept and even included its own bathroom. When we met with him later,he was very friendly,told us about the neighborhood,"and recommended fun places and restaurants.\"",

4263736,21719315,2014-10-22,22137363,Melinda,"Jonathan was super friendly, welcoming, and simply a tremendous host. The apartment is LOVELY. I would recommend this listing to anyone over a hotel.  The neighborhood is closely located to everything in the city, with a very short commute from Roxbury Crossing Station on the Orange Line to downtown Boston.  There's a great Hilal Somalian restaurant as well as the largest mosque in New England within walking distance, should someone be needing to access those things."
4263736,21805711,2014-10-24,169314,Cesar,"A lot of pros for this offering: spacious bedroom and bathroom, well appointed furnishings, quiet surroundings and private space. Nice roommates. A good deal for the price."
Highly recommended,just make sure there is soap in the shower (the hotel size sampler was empty). A hand towel wouldn't hurt,"and ground coffee to be able to use the stylish french press provided would be plus.\"",,,
4263736,21923459,2014-10-26,3013450,Jessica,Jonathon was an absolute pleasure; he is very welcoming and his home is a reflection of this. He was very responsive and accommodating.  If you are looking for a quiet place in the City to relax this is definitely it. The neighborhood is just a block away from the hustle and bustle so you can spend less time in transit. On street parking was a breeze too which is always a plus.
4263736,23154118,2014-11-24,21880975,Andrés,Staying at Jonathan's place was an amazing experience.
I visited Boston for a month. I needed to stay in a place nearby Longwood Medical Area (25 min walk,18-20 min bus ride[Bus 66]) and I was lucky to find such a great place. It's also near a Metro/Subway/Train station and therefore you can visit Boston very easily.,,,,
Jonathan is a very warm host. He is always around when you need him,but also manages to give you privacy to concentrate in whatever you came to do. You usually meet other people who are staying in the house as well. I met approximately 4 different people,they where all very nice,helpful,quiet and clean.,
The house and the room were impeccable. I stayed in a bedroom with a private bathroom,which was incredibly clean. You have your own desk,tv in your room and a comfortable sofa. To top it off there is fast wi-fi,washer and dryer and every kitchen appliance you will need.,,
Overall,Jonathan's house is the perfect place to stay. The host is very friendly and helpful. The roommates are very kind. The house and room is very neat and comfortable.,,,,
If you come to Boston,"this is the place to stay.\"",,,,

4263736,23885696,2014-12-13,17413093,Tiffany,"Jonathan was a GREAT host. Really friendly and nice but gave us our space. I loved how it felt like we were living alone but in a large apartment triplex kind of thing. Cheap, affordable, and really clean!!! Plus the other airbnbers are super friendly as well.

His place is impeccably clean and planned out for a guest's stay. He has a knack for providing you with things you may require before even asked. And a news wonk and history buff... You will always have a great story to walk away with. I think I'm moving in for good...

Only one of his housemates was around during my stay, and he was also very nice. Overall, I had a wonderful stay and I would highly recommend this room and Jonathan as a host!"

I was gladly surprised when entering the bedroom, as the A/C was turned on, and had made the place very comfortable for a Summer night. The private bathroom is huge and neat, with a robust shower, towels, and a hair-dryer. The high-speed internet, with plenty of electrical outlets, is a big plus shall you work. The neighborhood is quiet, as well as the apartment, since I hardly noticed the other guest. You get a full set of keys, including for the bedroom, to protect your privacy and belongings. Make yourself at home :-) I used to book hotels in Boston, and honestly never got such great value for 3 times the price!"
For people who plan to stay longer,the kitchen is amazing,and I noticed the bright new appliances (washing machine and dryer,etc.). There are tons of closets for your personal belongings. There is even a barbecue... ( :-) but maybe we need to ask before using it).,,
Also,Jonathan was very prompt & proactive at answering all the questions I had,with remarkable courteousy,and the process for checking-in/out was super easy,"even if no one was there at the time I got to the apartment. I enjoyed the full process & STRONGLY recommend this place.\"",
4263736,37345035,2015-07-06,8290964,Jeffery,Jonathan was a wonderful host. He took time to show us to his beautiful apartment and answer any questions we had. The bedroom is as pictured and very comfortable. It functions as its own private apartment other than the kitchen downstairs which you have access to as well. Though it was very hot during our stay the AC window unit did more than enough to keep us comfortable.
4263736,37879921,2015-07-11,35769454,Joachim,Jonathan is the perfect host very friendly and kind. At arrival he was home as agreed and showed me his fabulous place which he has renovated himself. The room is really big with your own tv with all the channels you can ask for. I big major bedroom bathroom with 2 sinks. All very clean and tidy. One think you should know Jonathan is that he is very tidy and keeps his apartment very clean. Best of recommendations to his place.
The house is located close to the subway with easy access to Boston and the airport. It is no problem to stay at Jonathans place without a care.,,,,,
"Roxbery is a neighborhood dominated by afroamericans but you find a mix of different races. In the white communities they will tell you to be careful but I felt safe and it was no problems. I get the feeling it is a neighborhood i transaction where more and more middle class move in. In the neighborhood you find an irish bar and a lot of different restaurants so you can get things close by.\"",,,,,

The place was exactly as described (see details), and Jonathan was a very friendly and accomodating host.  My stay in the master bedroom suite was brief, as I was visiting my daughter who lives in town, but I can see this place and its amenities would be well-suited to a longer stay as well.  Jonathan's Brownstone is impeccably restored and super-clean.  On-street parking worked out OK, though later at night I had to search a bit (parallel parking skills required!).

The room is spotless; you have your own perfectly clean private bathroom,and the TV helped when I wanted to catch the Republican debates that night. Getting keys is also dead simple; he has a little lockbox installed,which means no messy timing coordinations.,,,
"We had a great conversation on multiple occasions. Would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Boston. \"",,,,,

The space is exactly as pictured, beautiful and super clean. 3 of us stayed in the space and fit just fine. Jonathan is very friendly and helpful. He constantly checked in to make sure that we were doing well and did not need anything. We requested an extra pillow and towel and he was all over it! Just a short 5-7 Minute walk to the T station, and a quick 10 minute ride into town from there, Very convenient. Would definitely recommend Jonathan."
4263736,48545725,2015-09-27,38596584,Ben,"Absolutely wonderful host.  Took the time to answer any questions we came up with. The room was beautiful, clean, and very spacious. The double vanity sinks were a plus. Great location to explore the city.  Thank you for everything Johnathon!"

He had fresh towels for us and I honestly couldn't think of anything that we didn't love about it. Quiet neighborhood a close uber away from tons of fun bars and restaurants .

4263736,50892229,2015-10-15,42194148,Patricia,Lovely spacious room with sitting area and TV. More spacious and better equipped than most hotel rooms.
Parking in street was easy to access and down town easy to access by train or a longish walk.,,,,,

4263736,54627755,2015-11-22,43536196,Rebecca,"Jonathan made it incredibly convenient to check in and out. The room was fantastic, and very close to the orange line. I had a great time."
4263736,54928874,2015-11-25,18732873,Nathan,"Jonathan was the most gracious host. The instructions to arrive were crystal clear, and the place is very very comfortable. The room is very very spacious - bathroom too."
The place is also really convenient for nearly everything,being a 5 or so minute walk from Roxbury Crossing station.,,,,
Jonathan is also the most lovely guy,very easy to talk to. You could chat to him for hours about everything and anything. And he has great recommendations for restaurants and stuff nearby should you need them! He was even kind enough to drive me to the rental car place on my last day.,,,,
"I would absolutely not hesistate to stay with Jonathan again when in Boston.\"",,,,,
4263736,55827538,2015-12-06,37168372,Taylor,"Jonathan was very kind, organized, and friendly. He even went out of his way to accommodate me by driving me to one of my events! The house is spotless. All of the appliances and hardware are updated, the items in the room are organized, and the environment was very quiet. The master bedroom and bathroom felt more like a suite and were better than almost any hotel room I have stayed in. I would definitely come back if I visited Boston again!"
4263736,56958820,2015-12-20,49209911,Randy,"This was the best service i've had in my longest memory. Everything was as described and the room was clean organized and pleasant. All amenities are brand new and the bed was soft and comfortable. The location was a perfect distance to transportation and access to other areas of interest such as restaurants, supermarkets, cafes was in easy access."
4263736,59295826,2016-01-09,50021785,Hao,Absolutely great place and really nice host. Definitely a great choice if u wanna stay in Boston for a while. Really nice experience.
4263736,64736799,2016-03-06,35786255,Carla,Although we did not get to meet Jonathan his instructions and his quick replies helped make our weekend trip to Boston an amazing one. The room was exactly as described and in pristine condition. We could not have asked for a better location/ private bedroom. As mentionned in other comments parking was easy to find which is a relief when it comes to Boston parking :p We would be glad to stay at this place anytime we visit Boston again!
4263736,64955780,2016-03-09,43126484,Sarah,Jonathan was a great host and the room was just as pictured. The entire brownstone is lovely and located in a great neighborhood close to downtown.
4263736,65704927,2016-03-16,2990002,Jonathan,"Jonathan is a wonderful host, and his home is amazing.  He was quick to respond to any questions we had, and was very kind and inviting when we met him.  He gave us recommendations of where to eat, and things we could do while visiting the city."
We met several other people staying in his home and quickly made friends with the others.  The room was clean and spacious,a perfect blend of luxury and character.  The bed was very comfortable.  We loved the large bathroom,the shower was large and had lots of hot water.  We ended up staying an extra night,and Jonathan had a separate room on the ground floor of the house that he moved us in to accommodate us.  It was also very comfortable and private,and had all the deluxe amenities.  Despite not having a kitchen,Jonathan complimented the room with a small fridge
The area was a great location and was a quick and cheap UBER ride to downtown.  We didn't utilize the local transit,but understand it was very close,and easy to use.,,,
Jonathan has several other people staying in his home,from around the world,and we loved meeting them.  Jonathan made a communal meal for everyone on the last night we were there,and it was delicious.  This just isn't an experience you can get in a hotel.  I have to say that the evening dinner was my favourite part of our trip to Boston,even after spending time in the city.  The home and family type environment we experienced was something that will stay with us forever.,
I would recommend Jonathan and his home to anyone looking for a place to stay when visiting to Boston.  If you haven't yet decided where to stay,just do yourself a favour and hit the button to request to stay here,cause it's totally worth it.  We loved it,and you will too!!!  We will definitely be back,as we felt we came by ourselves,"and left with a group of new friends.  \""

"We had a great time and thought the room was stunning. Many thanks!\"",,,,,
4263736,71254632,2016-04-24,6310744,Maybritt,"Jonathan is a very friendly and reliable host. The room was spic and span and exactly like the pictures. The center of Boston is a nice little hike away. During the daytime the neighbourhood is friendly, during night time I don't think I would go out alone by myself. I would definitely recommend staying at the apartment if you need to stay in Boston a bit longer then just a layover."
4263736,72281834,2016-05-01,66697,Bill,"The place is awesome. Very spacious and clean, Jonathan and other tenants in the house are all awesome people. Highly recommended!"

He is very welcoming and attentive to all questions or concerns. The home is clean and comfortable while also being in a great location. Jonathan provides information on local sites and eateries to complement your stay.
His home is a true gem and if I'm ever in need of another stay in Boston,"I would rent with him again.\"",,,,
4263736,73228652,2016-05-07,73077,Lauren,"Fantastic apartment - really clean, lovely bed, bright.  Bathroom was great and the whole apartment was excellent.  Good facilities in the kitchen.  TV in the bedroom was great with loads of channels.  Location isn't great for eating out in the evening or for supermarkets - we ended up driving to a supermarket and getting a takeaway delivered as there was not much about and I didn't feel hugely comfortable walking around or taking the subway at night.  Having said that, during the day, the subway was easy to get to and not too far away from the centre of Boston."
4263736,73643186,2016-05-09,35339279,Ge,Very good place
4263736,74062241,2016-05-12,69603683,Michelle,"Jonathan is truly a phenomenal host. He was very accommodating in allowing me to check in early so that I could get ready for my appointment and make it on time. He was welcoming throughout the entire duration of my stay and I felt so at home I did not want to leave! His home is very clean, the room/bathroom is as beautiful and well lit as photographed, I felt well rested every night. The Master Bedroom overlooks his adorable neighborhood, I actually looked forward to coming home earlier at night just to unwind to that view while watching a movie (he has cable as well). He also gives fantastic recommendations for places to eat/drink around his home (shout out to Pasta Express, you rock!), so you know where to go for your meals if you don't feel like going far. Five star experience! Highly recommend!"
4263736,75114669,2016-05-19,71543964,Hee Ho,"Jonathan greeted me very friendly and his explnnation of how the get the keys was just as he explained in his email. He put my heavy luggages into the room when I came for them in the morning and put the luggaes down when I came for the them later in the afternoon. His house is large, beautiful and the view out the windows was stunning. The location is good, as it is close (in a walking distance) to the Roxbury Crossing T. It was my first time to use Airbnb and he really made me feel very comfortable. Use of laundry, which is right next to the room was also perfect. I had a great time and thank you for your hospitality!"

Jonathan is a treat:  genuine,sincere,grateful,trustworthy.,,
All in all,"a very pleasant experience!\"",,,,
4263736,76141697,2016-05-25,33634377,Stephan,"Alles war fein, der Jonathan versuchte mehrmals, uns persönlich zu erreichen, leider haben wir uns verpasst. Die Nachbarschaft hat uns gefallen, eine gute Alternative zur Hektik von New York. Wer kein Problem damit hat, die Unterkunft mit anderen Kurzzeit-Gästen zu teilen - für den ist das stylische Zimmer mit Bad ein guter Deal!"

My flight was delayed so I didn't  reach Boston till 2:30am: ( I told him about my delay and all he cared was me. When I arrived the apartment. The door light was on and I could spot out that lovely brick bundling instantly. He put some dim Small lights throughout the entire apartment which led me to my home sweet room. It was so nice and charming, the bed linen smell so nice too! I really enjoyed my stay , there was one day I slept through noon and made some lovely lunch after! OMG as a regular airbnber I never see there were so many spices for the guests. Jonathan is very responsive and helpful that I can even take his sun hat to Ptown ! This is going to be my default pad in Boston! I ll be back !! Oh Roxbury is such a convenient neighbourhood I literally spend $12 to 15 on average to my commutes."

4263736,83924355,2016-07-04,10695123,Tina,My friend and I recently stayed at Jonathan's place for the Fourth of July weekend. It was our first time visiting Boston and after much research we chose his Airbnb based on the rave reviews and description of the apartment.
Jonathan's apartment was just as described. Very clean,well decorated,quiet and comfortable. Our room was spacious,comfortable and we felt right at home. All the necessities were provided including towels,shampoo,conditioner
There were other guests staying in the additional rooms but we never saw or heard them. As two female travelers we felt safe and had no issues while in the apartment.,,,,,
The apartment is located in the neighborhood of Roxbury and is about an 8 minute walk to the Roxbury Crossing station. From there you can catch the orange like going inbound to Downtown Crossing and catchy any of the other lines to the various neighborhoods/sites you wanna see in Boston. My friend and I didn't explore Roxbury,but it was close to the South End.,,,,
Overall if you want a clean and comfortable space with a friendly host that checks in and is available if you need him,this is the space for you. You'll need to use the train on a daily basis to get around. Overall I recommend this Airbnb and would stay here again when visiting Boston!,,,,
"Thanks Jonathan for a friendly and comfortable visit. \"",,,,,
4263736,85101255,2016-07-10,32379485,Reza,Exactly as described on the add. Jonathan is very nice and welcoming. He is always accessible. He pays attention to details. His building is the cleanest Airbnb I have stayed at. I will definitely stay at his place again.

And this master room had a private bathroom, which was really convenient for me when I went back at late night and took a shower without bothering others. I didn't use the living room and kitchen because I was out all day and only back to sleep at night. But the living room and Kitchen was really clean and beautiful. Staying in Jonathan's house made me feel at home. And another good part was Jonathan is a really nice person and gave me many suggestions about eating and having fun in Boston. I had a great time in Boston. Also the location of the house is good, 8 mins walking to metro station and it's easy to take metro to downtown. I'll book Jonathan's house again when I go to Boston next time!"
4263736,92617142,2016-08-09,88514308,Jana,"Jonathan was so pleasant and his place was exactly as pictured. I am always extremely nervous about staying anywhere due to lack of cleanliness and his place is absolutely immaculate. We were only there over night for a few hours but I would highly recommend if you are searching for a place that is CLEAN and for someone who is wonderful, this is it!"

I would definitely stay here again."
4263736,97381638,2016-08-27,62662248,Kristin,Jonathon was really easy to communicate with and very nice when we arrived. He helped us with directions for transit. The only issue we had was the neighborhood. Outside of the apt there were people smoking and drinking and it didn't appear to be safe. This is by no means the hosts fault but its something I want future guests to be aware of.
4263736,97533858,2016-08-27,15412914,Jiyeon,"Thanks to Jonathan, i had such a comfortable night in Boston. Room and bedding stuff was clean and tidy. I could find in the room everything i need.

4263736,99155149,2016-09-03,26814228,Fifi,"Jonathan's building is truly one of a kind. It is an incredibly spacious, bright and well furnished building with several rooms for his guests. He has done a fantastic job in making the building function perfectly for the guests. If you like to cook there is a spacious kitchen with individually arranged and stored utensils for each guest party. About the room, we stayed in the en suite room which had a large double-sinked bathroom and shower. It was more than enough space for myself and my partner to stay in for the week. The bedroom itself is well furnished, very light and clean, comes with a great cable TV package, extra towels and bedding. This was the first time myself and my partner stayed in a shared-property, as long-time AirBnB users we were skeptical about privacy but Jonathan's building is large enough that you do not hear others and you do feel as though you have adequate privacy. Staying with additional guests turned out to be really pleasant experience, when we crossed paths with some of the guests we had great conversations and shared stories about Boston! Overall, I would highly recommend Jonathan's space especially if you're looking for something affordable and with good transport links to the centre of Boston. Thanks so much Jonathan, lovely to meet you!"

His apartment is wonderful,it is fully-equipped and has all amenities you need for your stay! We felt right at home. We know for sure that we will be staying in Mike's apartment when visiting Boston again. No other place could offer it all at once: location,comfort,safety,"an exemplar host....!\"",

It was close to all the shops on Newbury and perfect location. It has a great view, comfy bed, and the host Sebastien is very helpful and easy to get in contact with. The only thing to keep in mind is it's on the 4th floor, there is no elevator so if you are traveling with many luggage or have elderly people with you, it might be a challenge going up the beautiful Victorian stairs. Nevertheless I would stay there again in the future."
1811776,10388404,2014-02-17,2392595,Anton,Sebastien is an excellent and communicative host. His apartment is everything my girlfriend and I wanted for a great getaway in a brownstone for a couple of days. The apartment is tasteful and uncluttered. A big window grants a view of the impressive Church of the Covenant. Everything else is in the details and Sebastien got them right.

His apartment is in a fantastic location...and is very nicely appointed.  The bed is huge and very comfortable.  It is a lovely spot to stay in Boston, in the best part of Commonwealth Avenue - short walk to the Public Garden, Newbury St.,  and Beacon Hill.  The Arlington T stop is steps away.  Great bath amenities, bedding and a chocolate Easter bunny compliments of Sebastien!  We will definitely plan to stay here again."
1811776,12228965,2014-04-26,14337002,Bobby,Went up to boston for a work trip and to explore the city.. Sebastien was more than accommodating and provided us a very clean and convenient apartment. He was willing to work out a special arrangement and took very good care of us. I deff reccomend this place to any future travelers.
1811776,12564014,2014-05-05,182057,Azie,"It was my first time using AirBnB for my visit to Boston.  The location is perfect for my trip and the apartment is close to a lot of things.  I can just walk to Newbury, Boston Common. Sebastien is very efficient, friendly and accommodating.  The apartment is very comfortable and spacious and I would recommend this listing if you want to visit Boston."
1811776,12626964,2014-05-06,1397207,Mark,Great place. Sebastien was the consummate host. Awesome location. Will be back. Note: You need to know it's a four story walkup. I liked the excesses :)
1811776,12733692,2014-05-09,8584852,Yein,The interior design of house is wonderful. He have a projector and a big screen. So I watched a movie in the riving room. And the location is good. We walked to MIT by following riverside. And very closed to Newbury St. Sebastien is very stylish and handsome and kind. I was happy to stay there.
1811776,12756995,2014-05-10,8285257,Melissa,"Sebastien is a wonderful host and his place is extremely convenient, clean and stylish :) He was so helpful in coordinating both the check in and check out - he was easy to get ahold of and warm and friendly. I'd definitely stay with him again!"

1811776,13270306,2014-05-24,5925840,Clayton,Excellent host. Very helpful in meeting us and getting us to his place. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a cozy stop in back bay.
1811776,13837533,2014-06-05,2472921,Henry,"Everything was great, thank you for a wonderful stay Sebastien!"
1811776,14005232,2014-06-09,618802,Mohit,"Sebastian was a great host for a day i was there, he told me exactly where to find the keys and his apartment is super convenient. He was great when he communicated about parking, since i was driving to his location. If u are young, and want to experience boston then his apartment is just perfect"
1811776,14128562,2014-06-12,15581573,David,The apartment is very well located with everything in walking distance. The size of the apartment is perfect for 2 people and very clean. I haven't met Sebastien in person but he was very responsive and always polite.
And even though you're very central,the room was very quiet and so we had no problems of getting woken up by street noise. The only thing to note is that it's a 4th floor walk-up (there is an old elevator which goes to the 2nd floor,although it didn't work when we were there) and so this may be a bit tricky if you have a lot of luggage. Also,the air-condition didn't work when we were there in early June,which wasn't necessarily ideal (Sebastien assured me that this was supposed to be installed in a week or so). In summary,"great price for a superb location but make sure you're fine with walking stairs (and hopefully the AC will already be installed).\""
1811776,14174310,2014-06-13,16445922,Dan,"The apartment is in a great location, it is very clean, roomy, and the king size bed has a high quality mattress, sheets, and comforter.   Sebastien was very responsive and easy to work with.  We enjoyed the experience and look forward to staying there again soon."
1811776,14581861,2014-06-22,16444033,Ryan,"Great host, flat and location. Sebastien was easy to deal with, was organized with his check in, and had his apartment in a very clean condition. The flat is located right in the Back Bay area, on one of the best streets in Boston. We walked to Cambridge, Alston, Boston Common, Fenway and more. You're 2 blocks from Copley Square station as well, so the T is easily accessible. I will say that it might have been an oversight on my part, but the flat doesn't have A/C. It really isn't a big deal because you're not there during the day, but I could see it getting a bit hot in July/August during midday. Other than that it's exactly what you'd expect from a Boston brownstone in a high end historic neighborhood. Thanks Sebastien!"
1811776,14867602,2014-06-28,8109970,Erin,"Sebastien was very communicative and accommodating. We had one issue with the TV projector not working, and he came over immediately to fix it even though it was rather late at night. The apartment was just as pictured and very clean. It is very close to parks, shopping, restaurants, and public transit; the perfect location for anyone looking to experience Boston, but also extremely comfortable if you decide to stay in! I definitely recommend this apartment!"

1811776,15407559,2014-07-08,1800027,Jess,"We thoroughly enjoyed our night at Sebastien's Back Bay apartment, and wish we'd had more days to spend there. His space is comfortable and elegant, with a perfect location a couple of blocks from the public gardens and Boston Common—we walked from the parking lot at the Common (very reasonable for overnights on weekends) to a game at Fenway Park and then back to the apartment afterward, with most of the walk along the beautiful park in the center strip of Commonwealth Avenue. There are ample dining and drinking options on Newbury and Boylston just a couple of blocks away. For a one bedroom, the apartment is spacious; the bed is comfortable; the kitchen and bathroom are small but adequate. As a host, Sebastien is extremely prompt and responsive. He warned us in advance that the many steep flights of stairs leading to his fourth-floor unit might be challenging for my 79-year-old father-in-law, but he used the tiny elevator for the first two floors and we did fine. We would choose this rental again for its style and location—it really merits more than one night."
1811776,15580538,2014-07-12,3441900,Linda,Nous avons passés un agréable séjour dans l'appartement de Sébastien.

Il est situé au 4 eme étage d'une ancienne Brownstone avec ascenseur pour les 2 premiers étages. Il correspond au descriptif : 2 grandes pièces :1 salon -salle à manger et 1 grande chambre avec 1 lit double, 1 petite cuisine équipée (frigo, plaques et cuisson, micro-ondes), 1 petite salle de bains. 1 grand placard de Rangement dans la chambre. Notre famille (2 adultes, 2 adolescents) a séjourné 3 nuits en août 2014. Idéal pour 2 personnes il peut accueillir jusqu'à 4personnes : nos enfants ont dormi dans le salon sur 1 lit d'appoint gonflable confortable et le canapé. La décoration est raffinée.  Climatisation dans la chambre. La communication avec Sébastien est excellente de même que l'accueil."
Attention à bien lire les panneaux si vous garez votre véhicule dans la rue : il est autorisé de 8pm à 8am,et certains jours jusqu'à 6am...risque de voir sa voiture emmenée à la fourrière,ce qui nous est arrivé...donc préférer un parking (32€ les 24h).,,,

He responded to both my e-mails and text messages very quickly. On our day of arrival, he waited for us at the house to hand over the keys and helped us with our tons of luggage - thanks again, Sebastien, much appreciated!"
The very best about the apartment is its location. It is close to Newbury St. (ideal spot for shopping and dining) as well as to the park and the subway stations. The neighborhood is safe and lovely,"dominated by old brownstone buildings and small individual shops. The main sights are also available within walking distance. \"",,,,

We ended up spending more time in the apartment than we originally intended because it rained quite a bit during our stay in Boston.  We took advantage of his digital projector and watched movies.  It was really nice that he had a Nespresso machine with a variety of capsules to choose from.   The bathroom was well stocked with Aveda products.   Sometimes it's the little things that make a big difference.   Sebastien was very nice and helped us with our bags upstairs when we arrived and even offered to bring us quarters when we inquired about doing laundry in the building.   We would definitely recommend this flat to others."

He met us in front of the apartment at the correct time, he helped us with our luggage, and opened the door into the apartment just as the pictures show it. It was spotlessly clean, kitchen was well stocked to either prepare a meal or snack. Location was near shopping, metro and in a safe neighborhood.The bed was heavenly. The building was quiet and secure. Please note- the large screen is for movie viewing. There is no television - I called and asked ahead of time. We were fine without television, the movie selection is fine. We left something in the apt. and Sebastien is going out of his way to mail it back to us!

He provided excellent restaurant (BarLola) and cafe (Thinking Cup) suggestions and was happy to answer any questions. Also, when he found that I had left my laptop charger he quickly contacted me and offered to ship it free of charge. The tasteful flat was perfectly described in the listing and was perfect for my stay in Boston during a conference. The neighborhood was fantastic!

This was my wife's and I first time to use airbnb.  This experience certainly left a great impression.  First,the apartment is as described.  I would be aware that is on the 5th Floor and the older,tiny,two-person Elevator only goes up to the 3rd Floor.  This may be a concern for older individuals.  Other then that,it really was  perfect for our trip.  We are able to stay in the Back Bay area right on Commonwealth Ave and 2 -3 blocks from the Boston Common,Copley Square

I will not hesitate to stay here again as I come for work and the hotel rates in Boston are ridiculous.

Sebastien was very accommodating with meeting me, I was running later than expected due to traffic but he had no problem waiting for me. The location is definitely the best part, you are real close (a short walk) to plenty of shops, restaurants, and other attractions. The T (train/subway) station is also very close. Parking can be difficult, you're in a prime location in a busy city so it is expected, but make sure to do your research of where to park to help limit the cost.

The bed is comfortable, the building is quiet, and bath and living areas are very clean. I cooked several meals. With no pot holders, toaster, tea kettle, etc. the kitchen probably isn't used much. Understandable, with so many restaurants in the neighborhood. I'll eat out, in warmer weather, next time I stay at Sebastien's. I will certainly return."

There was a last minute change to our housing options due to an icicle incident but Sebastien quickly found us another option, one which was an upgrade from our previous choice and which he let us have without paying the extra cost. I would definitely recommend staying at one of Sebastien's places as he will accommodate you and make you feel right at home"

The kitchen is well stocked with pots, utensils, etc., but we found that there was no wine opener for a bottle that we had purchased. He quickly came by with a wine opener for us that night! Talk about speedy delivery."
You can't beat the location. It's located in the heart of it all,on a crazy beautiful street lined with historic Victorian homes. Easy to get anywhere you need to in the city,and was within walking distance to the beautiful park.,,,
Had no complaints - would definitely recommend this place to friends and family who happen to pass through Boston. The nightly cost to stay in the apartment is not cheap,but you definitely get what you pay for - and hey,it is Boston,"after all. Nothing is really cheap here.  \"",,

1811776,33652277,2015-05-31,2025643,Andrew,"Sebastien was great.  Very nice, very accommodating, and an all around good dude.  The location was perfect.  It's in a really nice area, and it's walking distance to public transportation (the T), shops, restaurants, bars, and historic sites.  The actual apartment was comfortable, and clean.  One heads (URL HIDDEN) at the top of a 5 (maybe 6) story building, and the elevator (which is small) only goes up to the 3rd floor.  So you will be going up and down a lot of stairs.  Totally fine by me, but if you're elderly, injured, carrying a lot of luggage, or with small kids, it could be an issue.  Just an FYI."
1811776,34173848,2015-06-05,18968755,Nathan,"Sebastien's flat was very nice.  Great location, clean, and convenient.  Sabastien was a great host."

The apartment had a great view,was very well furnished and had everything you could ask for. It's located in the heart of Boston and there's plenty to see and enjoy nearby including the park and the esplanade. Overall,"it was the perfect place to stay whilst in Boston.\"",,,
1811776,34405050,2015-06-08,17110765,Sonja,"Sebastien's apartment is in a great location for exploring Boston by foot. Sebastien was very helpful and responsive, providing tips for nearby places for coffee and shopping, both ahead of our stay and while we were there. The apartment was clean and as shown on the photos. We enjoyed our time there!"
1811776,35248532,2015-06-16,34317422,Ignacia,"Tuvimos una muy buena experiencia en Boston, el departamento está en una ubicación privilegiada, en un barrio precioso. Sebastien fue muy amable y resolvió rápidamente nuestras dudas."

1811776,36480761,2015-06-28,616545,Morten,"Wonderful location, close to the nice streets and in a great neighborhood. Sebastien was really nice and responsive. If you have a lot of luggage, be aware that you have to carry it several floors as the elevator does not go all the way up."
1811776,37017607,2015-07-03,35000540,Rico,"This was the perfect location to explore Boston. A beautiful apartment, a very welcoming and caring host. You can ask Sebastien anything, he´s got the perfect answer. The neigbourhood  is very professional, so it´s not a party spot, but if you just walk around the corner you´re in the heart of Boston."
1811776,37373147,2015-07-06,36003209,Arun,Sebastien was a great host. He was friendly and told us some great places to see whilst we were in Boston.

1811776,37526060,2015-07-07,36620227,Josh,Sebastien was a great host. He was very accommodating and professional. I would highly recommend. Can't beat the location.
1811776,38501859,2015-07-16,34145743,Molly,"Sebastien is an excellent host.  He is kind, thoughtful and helpful.  He made us feel at home in the apartment, oriented us to use of the iPad/AV system, provided all amenities as described, and even had many wonderful restaurant recommendations for us. The location of the apartment absolutely cannot be beat.  It is 3 blocks from the Charles River with walking/jogging trails, 2 blocks from Newbury St., 3 blocks from Boston Common, and walking distance from the North End.  We would love to return!"
1811776,39253530,2015-07-21,36210401,Phil,A great apartment in a truly perfect location for exploring the best Boston has to offer. Sebastien was on hand to provide all the advice we could need. I thoroughly recommend him and this apartment!
1811776,39569901,2015-07-24,38250490,Jaclyn,"My husband and I contacted Sebastien with very short notice, as another Airbnb place was not a place suitable for our stay, and he was a gracious host. He was able have place ready on short notice and it was fantastic! Great location and the property was well maintained, with all of the conveniences any guest might want. Truly a great host and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Boston. We couldn't thank him enough for being the ideal Airbnb host."
1811776,41002151,2015-08-03,9371540,John,"The location is great; the apartment was great with one exception: there is only one Air Conditioner, so if you have 4 people (like it is advertised to hold) the person on the couch (and blow-up mattress, if you put it in the living room) will be quite hot during the summer.  I don't know if the description said this (if it did, I didn't see it)."
Sebastien was pretty good; he kindly offered to meet us early when we arrived,but was then late twice and when we got there was frantically cleaning one of the rooms.  Also,we didn't get clean towels until midnight.  Overall though,super nice guy---very very responsive.  I suspect he just had a busy day the day we came.,,
We accidentally took a charger from the living room (for an iPad that stays at the place),"and he was super nice about it; he simply bought a new one.\"",,,,
1811776,41290975,2015-08-05,39191268,Chantal,Perfect location! Sebastien was very helpful with informations about the city and his favorites places around the neighborhood! Great city!
1811776,41383320,2015-08-07,3485986,Katie,"Sebastien was a great host, and the flat was comfortable and clean. The building's late 1800s brownstone history and location were perfect for our first night in Boston. We took just about all of  Sebastien's recommendations for drinks and dinners within walking distance of the flat-- I always like to go where a local would vs something touristy, and he had great ideas of what we would enjoy. Thank you, Sebastien! Our stay was better than any hotel!"

1811776,43391827,2015-08-19,8939804,Frances,Sebastian was very friendly and responsive.  He met us on arrival and helped carry our bags up 2 flights of stairs!  He answered our questions very promptly!
The apartment is in a really great location.  It is simply decorated with plenty of space and beautiful shiny hardwood floors.  Better for a couple,"but worked ok for our family of 4 (with 2 teenage kids in the living room).  We really enjoyed watching a movie on the big screen set up in the living room! Thanks Sabastian!\"",,,,

He gave us excellent places to visit and a low down on the area. We had full privacy.. He also made us aware that he was a phone call away incase we needed anything. I already looking forward to my next stay!"

1811776,45111273,2015-08-31,2920918,Sharon,"We loved it! The apartment was in the best possible location; we walked everywhere and enjoyed being in the heart of such a great neighborhood. Sebastien was a gracious and accomodating host, and we enjoyed his restaurant recommendation on our first night in town. We have a 4-month-old so the stairs were a little more of a challenge with all the extra gear we had (not used to traveling with a baby), but still totally doable. What a great place to stay!"
1811776,45450819,2015-09-02,29837253,Kim,"The location and the property were both great, we were abel to walk all over Boston. The apartment was located on a lovely street and just around the corner from shops and cafes in a great area. Sebastien was great and gave us some good tips and info."
1811776,45741549,2015-09-05,42940613,Jordan,"Sebastien was great! A wonderful host and impromptu tour guide. The flat was also really nice and the location was great for all the touristy/shopping things we wanted to do.  Take his suggestion to eat at Neptune's Oyster, worth the 2 hour wait!"
1811776,46914603,2015-09-14,40840218,Elizabeth,"The place itself was beautiful and in a perfect location. At the price you pay for though, I only wish there was a second aircon or fan in the living room as it was very hot over the weekend. The refrigerator also had leftover takeout from the previous occupants. We were also made to check in 30 min later than the listed check-in time, which was less than ideal considering we were lugging around multiple bags."
1811776,48089427,2015-09-23,7575281,Nicole,"This apartment is in the best location, and Sebastien was incredibly welcoming and responsive to all our questions and needs throughout our stay. However, stay here only if you are willing/able to climb four flights of stairs in case the elevator breaks (it's an old building). This was not a problem for us, and it was fixed within a day."
1811776,48455030,2015-09-26,20658311,Mike,"Sebastien was very helpful with my arrival. The location is superb. It is an ideal place for a couple under the age of 55, if they are in at least fair physical condition. The fourth floor can be an arduous uphill walk after a long work or vacation day. The decor is beautiful although I would like to have a regular TV to catch up on sports and weather. At first I was worried about where to park at night but sebastien assured me there would be plenty of free overnight parking and he was correct. Parking is plentiful on Clarendon and commonwealth ave."
1811776,48974193,2015-09-29,1445577,Kevin,Great location and very comfortable apartment. The host was very accommodating.
1811776,49059711,2015-09-30,43501333,Rob,The host met me at the property and oriented me to the apt.  He was amenable to my leaving my luggage the several hours after check out.
Its a great location and from the outside,the building is lovely.  The interior spaces are a bit dated and the common areas could use some new paint and carpet cleaning.  The apt is on the 5th floor with no elevator which makes it tough with luggage.  The apt itself is functional,clean and spacious.  Its a bit minimalist but worked well for my one night stay.  It was a warm night in Boston and there was no air conditioning in the unit which was uncomfortable.,,,
Even with that,"it was a good value for the price.\"",,,,
1811776,49330776,2015-10-03,13056830,Inbar,Great location. Sebastien was very kind and helpful.
1811776,49628313,2015-10-05,19471409,Brittany,"We had a wonderful stay at Sebastian's. The apartment was as described and comfortably fit the four of us. The location couldn't have been more convenient, we were able to walk to do just about everything we wanted to do/see. Sebastian also provided great recommendations of places to try out."
1811776,50329270,2015-10-11,44209483,Erin,This spot was amazing. The location was supreme and the apartment was very nice. I would 100% book this place again.
1811776,50502525,2015-10-12,13780341,Nathaniel,The unit is beautiful and could not be more centrally located in the middle of Back Bay. My wife used the unit to get ready with her bridesmaids and take some pre-ceremony photos. We had to get in the unit a bit earlier than normal check-in. Sebastien and his cleaner worked together to get the unit ready early. He was super accommodating.
1811776,51648000,2015-10-22,34213587,Andy,"Sebastien was an outstanding host. Met me on time, and got me into the apartment within 10 minutes all done. The only small critique was that there was no regular coffee maker, only an expresso. But the place was clean, and of course location was great."

1811776,52617039,2015-10-31,27335679,Corinne,"This property is just as it is presented and in an elegant building in an utterly fab location. We were able to easily walk just about everywhere. Sebastien met us at the property and ran us through everything and was on call, though we didn't need him. Negatives of the property are the flights of vintage stairs to access with luggage, and a complicated computer/projection TV set up that was unpredictable and frustrating. Positives, apart from those at the outset, included excellent wifi and a fantastic, huge and comfortable bed."
1811776,53298130,2015-11-07,46740137,Michael,Sebastien was very responsive from my initial inquiry all the way to my check out and was very accommodating. I had a pleasurable stay and the apt was exactly as posted. Great location in the heart of Boston proper. Overall very positive and nothing negative to say about the apt and the host.
1811776,53798240,2015-11-12,12304687,Adam,"Had a good time in Sebastien's place, the bed was very comfortable and the entertainment system easy to use and extensive. It was mostly clean but a bit dusty. Overall a good experience."
1811776,55121612,2015-11-28,7152568,Kristen,"This was the worst experience I have ever had using AirBnb. Upon arrival at the apartment I noticed it was dirty throughout and not as clean and new as the pictures depict. There was broken furniture, the white couch was stained and the bathroom was dirty (and the sink drain didn't work). There were also dirty/wet towels hanging in the bathroom and the whole apartment smelled of cologne. Very disappointing."
Sebastian was nice,but unfortunately these were not things that could be fixed to make my short 3 day stay comfortable.,,,,
For the amount charged,"I expected the place to be in good/excellent condition.\"",,,,
1811776,55290376,2015-11-29,9508643,Rauly,Sebastien was a great host who gave us directions to the nearest parking garage before we arrived and met us outside of the building to let us in and give us a tour of the place. He was very friendly and showed us how to use the awesome projector which came in handy for the last two episodes of Narcos season 1!
The apartment itself is beautiful,REALLY comfortable (from the couch to the plush bed),"and just a pleasure to call home. It's in a gorgeous historical building one block from buzzing Newbury St. in one direction and three blocks from the Charles River in the other with its amazing views and relaxing park. I highly recommend this apartment and would love to stay here again on future trips to Boston. Thank you Sebastien!\"",,,
1811776,55647913,2015-12-03,50239324,Pamela,Sebastien confirmed our last minute reservation quickly. He met us at the door and showed us the apartment. It was perfect and the location was more than perfect. I hope to spend more time at Sebastien's place. Thank you Sebastien.

Overall was a great place to say,with nice windows and a great living room.  The bed was quite comfy.  There was a bit of noise from the near by back alley,"so perhaps bring ear plugs if you're a light sleeper. \"",,,
1811776,56709834,2015-12-16,1962020,Theresa,"Sebastian helped me out with some very last minute accommodations for a friend who was visiting me in Boston.

1811776,59261707,2016-01-08,446281,Paul,"Was in Boston just for a couple of days looking for a relaxing spot in a great location.  You can't ask for anything more in Sebastian's rental.

For a visit to Boston,you cannot get a nicer place or a better location.  The apartment is big,very clean and very well furnished.  Plenty of hot water and heat when it was 20 degrees outside.  It also has the cool factor of an urban loft and the warmth of a very nice apartment.  You are two blocks from everything in Boston and parking was very easy in the evenings.,,,
We will definitely try for Sebastian's place first,"next time we are in Boston.\"",,,,

1811776,60801519,2016-01-27,1267007,Jonathan,"\"Sebastien made us feel welcome at the outset. The place is run down, and not as high end as the listing makes it out to be. Right off the bat the bulb in the projector didn't work, and Sebastien said his place was 5 minutes away after an hour and after several calls and messages that were never returned by Sebastien we called Airbnb they then called him and he said he had had an emergency at his salon. Emergency or not a text message easily could have been fired off. Upon his return he didn't seem to get that he wasted our time. Instead we ended up wasting the early evening waiting for him to come back and exchange the bulb. The Tommy Bahama Egyptian cotton Towels that are a \"\"feature\"\" of this apartment shed. The fireplace is unusable and in our complaint to Airbnb which they sided with us on they refunded us partially for the fact that this is listed as an amenity yet it can't be used because there is a stereo system in the way. The couch is incredibly uncomfortable and dirty. The apartment has a mini step down that if you are not careful might be a problem. Anyone with suitcases be advised you will have to haul your stuff up two flights of stairs the final section without any railing for support. This could be explained better in Sebastien's listing. The neighborhood is great"
1811776,61239647,2016-02-01,4291801,Leonardo,Sebastian was an outstanding host! The flat was just as pictured with all of the amenities. Will definitely be staying here again.

1811776,61455235,2016-02-04,22908077,Clare,"He's the best host amongst 3 AirBnb houses I've been to in this trip. His apartment is located in the most expensive residential area in Boston. And he literally has everything ready for you, from towels to movies. When he was bringing the extra bedding we needed, he went to wash and dry it for us. Sebastien lives very close by and when you ask him what you need through text, he will get you what you need right away."

The location truly could not be better for anyone looking to explore the city.  The apartment itself was modern, with a minimalist approach that made it feel quite elegant.

1811776,64895428,2016-03-08,34103907,Karl,House is as it is as the description. Close to public transportation and shopping area just a few blocks away.

The rooms are bright during daytime, and you can watch Netflix or YouTube as provided. The rooms are clean and cozy, really a great place for a couple. And the position of the apartment is great, not far away from downtown. Highly recommend. Definitely will go there again if have a chance."

1811776,74064071,2016-05-12,11272969,Brendan,"Sebastien was very responsive. The flat itself was large for Boston and is in an amazing location. It's less than one block away from the public gardens and the heart of Back Bay. There are 8 flights of stairs to walk up, so if you're out of shape or have any type of walking issues- I would not recommend this flat. If you're healthy and don't mind a few flights of stairs, I definitely would recommend it."
1811776,74900816,2016-05-17,53917849,Sonia,"Sebastien has been very responsive from the beginning. We were late due to traffic jams and he was very flexible on the check-in time. He was very nice to help us with our luggage in and out, the apartm is located in the 4th floor and the lift only goes up to 2nd floor.  However due to some personal matters (everybody can have a bad day) there were a couple of minor points like no towels available until next day and the kitchen could have been a bit cleaner. During our stay he was always avalaible to help us out in what we needed. The apartment is nice, nevertheless the building is old and a bit negleted. The location is super, in a quiet and one of the nicest neighborhoods of Boston. But,  for those who are sensitive to noise the bedroom gives to an ally that can be a bit noisy in the very very  early morning, so bring earplugs!"
1811776,75163692,2016-05-19,37840406,Abi,Sebastien was a wonderful host - very accommodating and kind. I left a necklace at the apt accidentally and went out of his way to make sure it was returned!

He kindly offered to bring my baggage upstairs and got me aquatinted with the apartment and the local surroundings. His apartment is beautiful and decorated so nicely and the bed was just so comfortable! I slept well and went off to my meetings. I will most definitely recommend Sebastien and his apartment. Truly enjoyed my stay. Thank you! Sebastien.
1811776,87310526,2016-07-19,35251232,Daisy,"Sebastien was a great host and his apartment is wonderful - spacious, clean and centrally located. I highly recommend it for anyone visiting Boson or Back Bay!"
1811776,87723823,2016-07-21,81858621,Joe,"I was in town for a conference at Hynes.   The location was superb within walking distance to Hynes, (10 minute walk)shopping, restaurants and various businesses."
The apartment is sparse,but very clean and functional.  The building itself has seen better days and could use some updating,but the building condition is in now way reflective of the quality of the apartment.,,,
Please be aware the elevator only goes up two floors and the apartment is on the fourth floor,so the reaming two floors are walk up.  The elevator was down one day,so it became a four story walk up.  Not great on a warm day in a suit and tie.,,,

1811776,88856766,2016-07-25,1895886,Justin,"This place is great; especially if location is important.  You could not be more central here.  Back Bay, the Public Garden, China Town, Beacon Hill and more are all walkable!"

Sebastien is a great host who responded extremely quick to any questions or concerns that I had. I believe his response time was usually less than 10 minutes, if even that long. Apartment is exactly as pictured. I would stay here again."
3377100,14846689,2014-06-27,106176,Yenyi,"Bernardo was a great host. He met me to get me setup. The hose location is great, in the heart of the beacon hill area close to restaurants and stores. The apartment was quiet.  All in all I was very happy with my stay."

My husband and I stayed here with our toddler for a week while in town for a wedding/our wedding anniversary.  We did a lot of walking and Beacon Hill was the perfect home base for us.  Charming, historic neighbourhood filled with little shops, restaurants and the friendliest people.  Short walk to many of Boston's sights and sounds.  The apartment was well maintained, quiet and delightfully decorated.  Bernardo welcomed us with open arms and did everything he could to make our stay as enjoyable as possible.  We enjoyed our visit immensely and intend to stay here again next time we are in Boston!"
3377100,15984623,2014-07-19,13629883,Jake,My stay was excellent. The host met me upon my arrival and gladly helped me find a parking spot. Some juice and fruit was left in the fridge for me which was awesome. Would highly recommend and would stay again in Boston!
3377100,16125582,2014-07-22,7992421,Avni,"We had a wonderful experience staying with Bernardo in Beacon Hill. His apartment is perfectly situated to be in 2 block distance of CVS, cute restaurants and the T (subway) line. In addition to the fact that Beacon Hill is one of the most beautiful areas of Boston."
Bernardo greeted us at the door,and even allowed us to come in way earlier than our check in time which we appreciated! He was incredibly sweet,and gave us great recommendations on what to do in the city.,,,
The apartment itself looks exactly like the pictures and was very comfortable for two people. The area is residential and off the major roads so it was very quiet. Bernardo also laid out some great tourist information to get us started,"all in all it was a perfect trip!\"",,,,
3377100,17054367,2014-08-06,687096,Margaret,"This was one of the best Airbnb experiences we've ever had.  Bernie is the friendliest, most thoughtful and helpful of hosts.  He is Boston-born, and has lived in this building since the late 1970's, so he knows every last thing about the neighborhood and is very willing to share that knowledge.  Being an architect himself, he has lots of interesting info to impart about the architecture of this historic area. The apartment itself is wonderful: cozy yet comfortable, tastefully decorated, with an excellent shower and fully equipped little kitchenette. The location is unbeatable for visiting Boston.  The building is itself historic and when you step outside, you are in the middle of gas-lit Beacon Hill.  You will feel as if you are living history itself.  Walking in any direction takes you to one Boston landmark after another, and the T (subway) is about 2 blocks away.   Highly recommended."
3377100,17375453,2014-08-11,191929,Rukmini,Bernardos place was beautiful. Perfectly located. It was extremely clean and had everything in place. Bernardo was also very helpful with everything. He showed us around the house and even had small place cards with wifi passwords. Out flight was delayed and he let us stay back in the house for quite a few hours past our check out time.
Very well located. Close to the commons and many restaurants and the T. Would definitely stay there again.,,,,,

Nachdem Bernardo uns vorgängig genau erklärt hatte wie man vom Flughafen  mit Bus und U-Bahn ins hübsche Quartier Beacon Hill gelangt, haben wir die Unterkunft problemlos erreicht. DasAppartement ist sehr günstig und ruhig gelegen. In der Umgebung befinden sich Restaurants und Geschäfte für jeden Geschmack. Viele Sehenswürdigkeiten sind prolemlos zu Fuss erreichbar. Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt in Boston rundum genossen. Das gemütliche und sehr gechmackvoll eingerichtete Appartement und die Möglichkeit sich zu verpflegen ohne ausgehen zu müssen haben wir sehr geschätzt."
3377100,17955348,2014-08-19,18318136,Francesca,"Il nostro soggiorno con Bernardo e' stato perfetto. La casa è molto accogliente, Bernardo è un padrone di casa discreto e presente per qualsiasi informazione o indicazione. Ci ha fornito una culla per il nostro bambino di un anno, coperte e quant altro.. Insomma è stato come essere a casa!"
Il quartiere è bellissimo,comodo x girare a piedi il centro o per prendere la metropolitana (a due isolati).. Ci sono supermercati e un sacco di negozi,abbiamo trovato subito quello che ci serviva anche perché Bernardo ci ha dato subito indicazioni al nostro arrivo.,,,
"Grazie! Speriamo di tornare presto \"",,,,,
3377100,18142057,2014-08-22,17217815,Jeffrey,"\"Bernardo hosting us at his lovely home was our first experience with Airbnb and it was excellent. He made us feel very welcome upon arrival and showed us the charming unit which was just how we imagined from the photos. He and his partner were very respectful of our space while we were there. My wife and I don't get to vacation together very often so this was very much appreciated. She went to school while living in the neighborhood several years ago and wanted to show me many of her old haunts during our two day visit. We were able to cover a lot of ground in our short stay because of the convenient location. It's very well situated for walking all over most of the city and it's only a few blocks away from a red line \"\"T\"\" stop if you wish to extend your explorations even further. We never felt like we needed a car which is a good thing because non-resident parking appears to be pretty difficult. I would highly recommend getting in touch with Bernardo if you're headed his way.\""
3377100,18319116,2014-08-25,17652908,Anna,All Excellent!!!!
3377100,18551637,2014-08-28,17361601,Suzanne,"I lived in Boston for many years and consider it home, so when I visit I like to feel like I'm at home, and this apartment was perfect in that respect, and many others.  Bernardo was a charming, generous, kind, and very interesting host.  He greeted me right at the door and showed me where everything was.  He left fruit, snacks, and juice, which was really nice.  He was easily reachable at all times but unobtrusive and respectful.  The house and apartment are just beautiful, exactly as the photos show.  It was immaculately cleaned with fresh linens on the bed and thick, fluffy, hotel-style towels in the bathroom (including washcloths - bless you, Bernardo!).  There is ample closet space.  The small but efficient galley kitchen was very well stocked with all you could possibly need - dishes, mugs, glasses, coffee maker, teapot, coffee and tea, salt and pepper, cooking oil, pots and pans, tea towels, etc.  I mostly only had breakfast there but you could easily prepare other meals if you wanted to.  Bernardo has lived on Beacon Hill a long time and knows the neighborhood and city extremely well.  Beacon Hill is one of Boston's oldest and most historic neighborhoods, with winding streets, beautiful brick townhouses, and a lot of great one-of-a-kind shops on Charles Street, just a few steps from the apartment.  The subway is very near although I mostly walked - Boston is a compact, very walkable city and the house is close to all the best sights.  (Bring comfortable shoes, as the brick sidewalks on Beacon Hill, and indeed most of Boston's neighborhoods , can be hard on your feet.)  This was my first airbnb experience and it was a great one.  The best part is that I not only got to stay in a beautiful, super-comfortable, well-equipped apartment in a gorgeous, central neighborhood, but also feel like I made a new friend.  Many thanks to Bernardo - I am sure I'll be back."
3377100,19266693,2014-09-09,17652908,Anna,Bernardo has been more than  an excellent host!!!

We could not have asked for more charming hosts. The pillow-top bed was so comfortable. Offers great support combined with cushiony comfort. The living room is elegantly appointed, and a kitchenette allows preparation of breakfast or more. But the neighborhood offers delightful restaurants. Hope to come back some day!"
3377100,21072814,2014-10-11,16822890,Andrew,"We were very warmly greeted by Bernardo on arrival and made to feel very welcome.  The apartment was beautiful and everything about it was in excellent condition. The house is in a lovely old street, very quiet but within two minutes of lively Charles Street and a short walk from the subway station in one direction and Boston Common in the other."
"One could not wish for a more agreeable place in which to stay.\"",,,,,
3377100,21282741,2014-10-14,1699532,Nerinna,Bernardo's Townhouse was charming and conveniently located.  We absolutely enjoyed our stay here!
Bernardo responded to my emails immediately.  He greeted us upon arrival.  He was extremely accommodating.  For example,we arrived 8 hours before check-in and he let us leave our baggage at his home so we can tour.  He also allowed us to leave our luggage with him on our last day after check out since we didn't fly out until early evening.  He just made everything simple,easy and convenient.,,,
The area is very very very charming.  In my opinion probably the most charming out of all the neighborhoods in Boston.  It felt safe.  One night we were photographing late and didn't walk back to the place until after midnight.  There were still people walking in the area.  John Kerry's (our secretary of state) house is in Beacon Hill.  The area boasts yummy restaurants close by.  There's also a market just around the corner from Bernardo's townhouse.  And just another half mile away (possibly closer),there's also WholeFoods and a CVS pharmacy.  The Blue line (train station) was close.,,,,
On our end we mostly walked because 1) we love walking and 2) most of the historical places were relatively within walking distance.   And if we didn't feel like walking we just got on our iPhones and contacted Uber for a ride.  You don't need a car if you are staying at Bernardo's place.  In fact,if you do have a car,you can't park in the area because parking is for residents only.  With that said,again you don't need a car.  That didn't bother us because again we just contacted Uber for a ride (definitely better than contacting a taxi and half the price of a taxi).,,
All in all,I would definitely stay at Bernardo's place again.  Bernardo was kind and quick to respond to emails,his place was clean and charming and located in probably the most charming area in Boston,shops were close by,and getting to different areas in Boston,whether walking or taking the train
3377100,21403935,2014-10-16,22331137,Lamar,Bernardo was welcoming and easy to reach -- although I never had any need to reach him as the place was in perfect condition and everything was clean and in well working order.
3377100,21580170,2014-10-20,19232113,Francine,Beacon Hill est un merveilleux quartier où vivre à Boston.

Bernardo is a charming host, he always responded promptly to any contact, he gave us plenty of info about the local area and pointed us in the direction of the Whole Foods Market which is a short walk away.   This suited us so much more than a hotel - we would definitely stay here again and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone considering visiting Boston."
3377100,46863885,2015-09-14,4923906,Veronica,It was an absolute pleasure to have met you and really feel lucky to have stayed in your wonderful home. I had no idea how central to everything Beacon Hill is and how unique the area is.
Your home is perfect. Thank you so much for the use of your laundry. After traveling a bit,the simplest thing of having fresh clothes means so much.,,,,
We enjoyed the space,especially being able to hang clothes up and to put our bags out of the way and to be able to sit and relax after a full day sight seeing.,,,,
"Thank you Bernardo. \"",,,,,
3377100,47802412,2015-09-21,22529745,Amy,"Bernardo was a wonderful host! His apartment is adorable and you can't beat the location. He lives/works in the building so it's easy to reach him if there's anything you need and he made us feel like we were old neighbors instead of strangers crashing at his house. His response time is almost immediate, and was very flexible - and funny! I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone looking for homey little spot in a great area"
3377100,49475042,2015-10-04,42650422,Jaime,A charming place. Great location and beautiful decoration. Perfect maintenance. Very comfortable apartment.  You do not miss anything. We followed Bernardo restaurant recommendations and his advise was perfect. A marvelous place
3377100,50432337,2015-10-12,1892781,Rich-DeLaGarza,"We had a wonderful stay in Bernardo's Beacon Hill Townhouse. It is very conveniently located in the absolute best part of the city. The neighborhood is perfect (dozens of shops and restaurants; and it feels very safe day or night) and a subway stop is very close by. The Townhouse, itself, was just as advertised. It's just the right size for two people. Overall, we were very pleased with our stay and would highly recommend Bernardo's place to others."
3377100,52322610,2015-10-28,16681397,Donna,"\"Absolutely the perfect place to stay in Boston.  If you love a beautiful neighborhood and at the same time the ability to go anywhere in the city easily, Bernardo's place is the one to book.  You do not have to go far to get great food and shop in beautiful boutiques.  If you perfer a vintage neighborhood with class then Beacon Hill is the place.  The weather was amazing this past weekend. The train is about 2-3 blocks away and the \"\"Commons\"\" is 3 blocks in the other direction. I will surely be back.  I love when I end up choosing a place which works out as perfectly. It was heaven.\""
3377100,54444456,2015-11-20,14367109,Nertila,"We just had one of the most amazing experiences in Bernardo's beautiful apartment full of character and charm. The apartment is as beautiful as it appears in the photos. We felt at home as soon as we entered. Bernardo was just wonderful- he always responded within minutes, he gave us the best of tips, he even walked me down to the street to get a taxi for the airport. We also could check in earlier and check out later. The location is also great- in the centre of the gorgeous Beacon Hill, two steps from Charkes Street, full of life, boutique shops and restaurants. The Subway is a 5 minutes walk - the same for the Whole Foods store. Boston Commons, commonwealth Avenue and Back Bay are all a nice 10 minutes walk. The ambiance is perfect - one feels like time has stopped a couple of hundreds years ago in Boston."
3377100,54744213,2015-11-23,6184716,David,"This is a real treat, a quiet front parlor right in the middle of Beacon Hill. Comfortable and well appointed, with a full kitchen and nice bathroom and comfy bed. One minute's walk to the shopping and restaurants on Charles Street where we became regulars at the wonderful bakery Tatte and had a boatload of comfort food at Paramount. Bernardo made us feel very welcome and communication and coordination was perfect - thanks!"
3377100,66629657,2016-03-23,3661135,Sarah,"Bernardo was very accommodating. I had a last minute reservation and a small mix up with Airbnb, Bernardo was great and sorted it all out right away. I loved his place, clean, adorable and very Beacon Hill. Just off Charles St - fantastic location."
3377100,68291081,2016-04-04,49793463,Beth,"This was the perfect spot for my week long stay in Boston.  The apartment is just as lovely as it appears in the photos and host Bernardo provided helpful suggestions for sightseeing.  He was even kind enough to walk me to the local grocery store when I arrived.  This apartment was located within walking distance to many shops, restaurants and public transportation, yet was very quiet due to its side street, residential location.  The bed is comfy and the apartment has everything you need for your stay, including toiletries you may have forgotten and books and brochures about Boston.  I highly recommend this lodging for your next stay in Boston."

The location was in the heart of Beacon Hill.  Our first trip to Boston and I was so impressed with the city, the people, and of course our digs for the week.  I'd highly recommend Bernardo's Beacon Hill Townhouse to anyone looking to stay in the area.  Thanks for everything."
3377100,73068818,2016-05-06,46943084,Carson,"Bernardo's apartment was beautiful and very spacious. It was perfect for my week long stay, and since I'd been on a business trip for a week prior, the perk of free laundry in the basement was especially helpful. Bernardo himself was always responsive to texts in short time, and accommodating to the few questions I had throughout the stay."
3377100,73624205,2016-05-09,17243836,Walter,"Great apartment, exactly as advertised!  Bernardo was a great host.  There when needed, but hidden when not.   Will rent again."
3377100,77433057,2016-05-31,26699886,James,"Our stay was a very positive experience. The apartment is very clean, quiet, attractive and comfortable. The Beacon Hill neighborhood is unique and one of the most desirable neighborhoods in Boston. There are lovely shops, restaurants and public transportation within easy walking distance. You felt just like a resident being in this apartment. Our need to drop off our luggage and pick up the key earlier than the stated check-in was graciously accommodated. We would happily stay here again."
3377100,80992134,2016-06-20,58718408,Julien,The appartment was great and close to everything that we wanted to do in Boston. The place was clean and very well equiped.

In spite of being in a super central and convenient location, the apartment is very quiet. The living room gets good light and has nice view of the street -- bring your camera!"
"Beacon Hill is amazing and it felt great to be a resident if only for 3 nights.\"",,,,,
3377100,84336551,2016-07-06,56805873,Tom,"Bernardo was a charming and helpful host, answering questions (via email) before we arrived in Boston and helping us to settle in when we got there."
The apartment is as described and is in a great location - the shops and restaurants of Charles Street are just a few yards away and we found that everything around central Boston (Common,Freedom Trail,North End,etc) was walkable from Revere Street. We used taxis a couple of times when we had done enough walking or to return from dinner outside Beacon Hill,and only used the 'T' once. So,if you want to experience Beacon Hill and the central area
The apartment is perfect for two - beautiful lounge,galley kitchen with huge fridge,bathroom and comfortable bedroom with lots of storage space.,,,
We would highly recommend this - far less expensive than the good central hotels,"and with character and charm to spare.\"",,,,
3377100,85647135,2016-07-12,72178977,Nicole,Bernardo was a fabulous host and his place was just lovely in a fantastic neighborhood.  I highly recommend!!  We'd love to come back!
3377100,87359514,2016-07-19,34387,Georgina,"Bernardo was the perfect host - welcoming, helpful, hospitable and friendly. He went out of his way to assist us upon our arrival - thank you. The apartment was a gem - clean, beautifully decorated and extremely homely -  a joy to return to at the end of our very busy day. It was perfectly located - safe and beautiful neighbourhood - close proximity to Charles Street - we had a choice of a great number of restaurants to choose from.  We would not hesitate to return to Beacon Hill. Thank you for a wonderful stay."

10855052,74429473,2016-05-15,55978754,Vic,Dealing with Jessica was very easy and the place was in a great location.  This is my first time using Airbnb and it was a great experience.  My trip to Boston was a success and my stay in Beacon Hill definitely added to it.  I would recommend staying at Jessica's place to anybody else that wants to be in walking distance of almost everything in the city.

The apartment we stayed in was not the one shown. The one we stayed in was obviously not lived in and there were several problems with it. The toilet wouldn't flush and couldn't be fixed during our stay. It also wasn't fixed to the ground. The cable socket wasn't fixed to the wall. The curtains in the living room didn't fit,and fell down when we tried to draw them. That wouldn't matter so much,but the living room faces directly onto the street at ground level,and one of our party was sleeping on the couch,so there was zero privacy for her. The fridge freezer wasn't clean,and the floors were dusty. There were none of the little amenities that make airbnb stays special - no soap
Nice host,great location,"but not the apartment is not cared for and the issues made it a bit of a crunchy stay. \"",,,

Doug worked with me to get the key to another place in the area since he would not be in town when I arrived.  Upon arrival I found a wonderfully kept 4th floor apartment with all the amenities that anyone would need.  The location across from a park is ideal for relaxation, solitude, and exercise.  It is safe and also close to Fenway and Kenmore square for all the activities like shopping, dining, sightseeing and entertaining that you could ever want.  I hope to return to Doug's place in the future and would highly recommend it to couples, singles and small families.  Great spot, Doug, thanks for sharing it with me."

The apartment was quiet and comfortable,and the location could not be beat.  We were able to explore Boston on foot and using public transportation without a problem,and there were good eateries nearby.  The view of the park from the living room was excellent,making the apartment special.,,
We loved that it's just a short walk to the Museum,and to Fenway.,,,,
Furnishings were a tad spartan,but the beds were comfortable and the kitchen was small but useable.  Good shower!,,,,

Parking is not allowed on the street between 10:00P-6:00A for non-residents but Doug directed us to a convenient overnight garage.  All I had to do in Boston was within walking distance"
Doug made snacks,cereal,fruits,pastries,milk,and coffee available to us

Needed to be close to my son's college as two days of graduation ceremonies required a short 8 min walk to campus.  A quaint one bedroom  apartment on the fourth floor overlooking the park provided a beautiful view. Quiet neighborhood and very quiet building. Most everything is a short 5-10 min walk away.  Fenway Park, Dunkin, Target, Restaurants, Bars, and more than a few colleges. Doug was a great host and really made checking in and out a pleasure. Thanks again Doug for helping make this a wonderful and memorable trip."

The apartment was clean and comfortable.  Our 19 year old daughter slept on the futon in the living room and that was perfectly comfortable.  Doug was very responsive by email.  He arranged for someone to meet us when we arrived - and he was responsive as well when we texted him from the airport.  We appreciated the water, coffee and snacks provided - so we didn't have to do a grocery run when we first arrived.

The house is furnished with a great attention to the detail and the bedroom is pretty big. I would strongly recommend to stay at Randi´s - just keep in mind to check the bus times when you plan to leave the house early in the morning, so you don´t have to wait long. Make sure you don´t suffer any allergies though, since Randi has a dog!"

The two bed rooms were based on the third floor and the shared toilet and shower were on the second floor.,,,,,

A couple of things to note- we had a car and in the beacon hill area it is all permitted parking for residents. There is some metered parking and a parking garage near by but it's pretty expensive. You wouldn't need a car because everything is close by but we had driven up so we had to figure out parking."
Also there for 3-4 steeper flights of stairs to go up so I wouldn't recommend it for elderly or those with can't walk.,,,,,

Lance was not present himsef but the contact was easy and prompt. There were clear instructions for welcome and departure. Perfect place, nice surroundings. The only point for improvement was the fact that we mentioned that the tap in the bathroom was dripping and from point of view of waterspillage we ere hoping for a quick repair. That proved unfortunately not possible, but for the rest a perfect stay at prefect location. Next time we'll be back at a location of Lanxce Swank."

561769,66442571,2016-03-22,39181362,Christine,"My husband and I traveled here from California during spring break while my son was in Boston with his high school orchestra staying at a nearby hotel. The apartment is quite large which makes it feel more like a house than an apartment. The bedrooms are quite large and if you had a family of 4 or more staying, it would not feel crowded at all. Keep in mind there are a lot of stairs, but unless you're going to be going up and down those stairs multiple times a day, it's really not a big deal. We had no problem. The bathroom is nice and big and there is a washer and dryer in the unit just off of the bathroom which is great if you're going to be staying a week or longer and want to do laundry. The view from the glass door in the kitchen is great. Sunrises were beautiful from that vantage point. It snowed one day while we were there and the view of all the snow covered homes and streets was so pretty. Logan airport is only about 6 miles away which is a big plus. We never walked to or from the house so I can't tell you how the neighborhood is safety wise but it seemed nice enough. We were pretty close to everything and there's the South End shopping center less than a mile away with a Target, Panera, Olive Garden and Applebee's restaurant as well. We didn't rent a car while we were there but used Uber and Lyft regularly. If you haven't used Lyft before, their prices are better than Uber and if you're a new customer, they will give you ten $5 off coupons to use on ten different rides which is great.

About the place: great position, 15 mins walk to Jackson Square for Orange Line to Downtown, 10 mins to the 23 bus go to Ruggles to Downtown, and 15 mins Uber ($7 if uberpooling to downtown). The surrounding neighborhood is close to a public park, a museum, and a lively dinning area. About the host: Firlian is a very hospitable host. He introduced me to a Cuban restaurant nearby, which has killer Cuban food. It is a must-try. He also gave me a few trips around to get to know the area and the nightlife in Boston. I met another lone female traveler and teamed up with her for the rest of my trip thanks to his introduction. Beside being an attentive host, he is very easy to talk to, a great friend. I really enjoyed my stay at his place. Thank you"
13258244,84584429,2016-07-08,74464084,Majd,"I stayed with Firlian for a little over a month. He is a Great host, always willing to do anything to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Very friendly and easy to get along with. I would be very happy staying here again and would highly recommend it to others"

She provided clear instructions, local magazines and Zagat rating restaurants (within walking distance and with personal suggestions). Best of all - there were home baked cookies for our arrival! That was a great unexpected welcome present."
The location perfect and we walked everyone,even to Fenway.  Plenty of local spots to try.  We flew into Boston and didn't have a car,which I think is a better way to go. There was no need for it. There is public transportation close by if that's an option one would like to consider.,,,

We were shown around the apartment and he was so kind to arrange supplies for breakfast including a beautiful fruit basket, muffins, orange juice, cheese spread, cereals and bagels.  Our family was very touched by the kindness of our host."
The apartment was spacious and was as described in the Airbnb website.  All systems were in perfect condition and the entire apartment was clean and tidy.  Ample fresh towels were provided. We didn't feel the need for anything extra.  The television,DVD player,the computer,printer and Wi-Fi were all functional and were an added benefit to the apartment.,,
We also found the washer and dryer very useful in the basement as it was convenient to wash and dry our clothes.  The neighborhood was quiet and pretty with a small store,just opposite the apartment. The access to buses and T stations were very convenient.,,,,
On the whole,our stay at 66 Day Street,Boston was a very pleasurable and enjoyable experience and we would like to thank Heriberto and Cathy for being such good hosts.,,,

Restaurants Tres Gatos and the Brendan Behan Irish Pub are right around the corner. The green line was close, but we opted to Uber Everywhere! 14 Dollars to north end! He was even polite enough to let us know we were being a bit too loud when we didn't realize that sound was traveling downstairs after dark. A convenience store is located DIRECTLY across the street. A CVS a short 5 minute walk. I couldn't have asked for easier access to everything."

We enjoyed the well equipped kitchen, the  proximity to Whole Foods and the ease in getting to downtown Boston.  Heriberto was very responsive to two issues we had. Although this neighborhood could be  loud occasionally, we preferred it to a sterile hotel. Overall it was a positive stay for our family."

The apartment itself was very cozy, my family and I were very comfortable and felt right at home. There was free wi-fi and cable too!

Tenía todo lo necesario no solo en habitaciones y cocina, sino también en el baño. Todo estaba según lo esperado y respondía a las fotos y descripciones. El barrio era muy tranquilo, muy bonito, cerca de parques y bastante cerca del comienzo de una línea de subte que nos dejaba en pleno centro"

It was described as a few steps up. But,there are 6 steps up to the front door,then 16 more up to the second floor and the door to the apartment.,,,
"The building is quite old and looks old with peeling exterior paint. The neighborhood is not good although we had no problems. The host came by and showed us where they provide parking in a private fenced lot.\"",,,,,

The apartment had enough space for the 5 of us, everything was as in pictures. Also, we had a private parking spot for our car, so we didn't have to worry about it during our stay. The neighbourhood was a little gloomy and far from the main attractions, but if you have a car, it isn't a problem."

5025015,38482655,2015-07-16,8804002,Leigh,"Overall, this apartment matched the description on the website and Heriberto was extremely responsive (couldn't ask for more on that front).  However, there were a few things that I wish I had known about before renting.  First, the shower is extremely small.  I'm a very petite person, but I still found it quite cramped.  Second, one of the kitchen chairs was missing at the high top table, so there were only 3.  Since we came with a family of four, this meant we couldn't all sit and eat at the same time.  (We couldn't just move in a chair from a different room because the table is quite high - you'd be at the height of the bottom of the table top sitting down.)  Third, there were no flat sheets on the queen and double beds.  Fourth, the air conditioning window unit in the third bedroom is literally right above the headboard, next to your head while you're sleeping.  All in all, the apartment was functional and adequate, but just a few things potential AirBnB'ers should know going in."
5025015,38701180,2015-07-18,30519080,Shu,"The house is beautiful and there are three (URL HIDDEN) is enough for five people.We can cook there and enjoy our meals.The host is very nice and kind.The night of the second day we stay,we washed the clothes and decide to use the dryer.We met the host and they are using it,but they said we just need to leave the wet cothes there and they will help us to put our clothes into the dryer.Since it was late so we decide to take the clothes next day.The next morning we went to the basement and wanted to take our clothes,we were surprised that the host have folded them and put them well.It made us feel warm and thankful.I think it is worth to have two special days there."
5025015,39597899,2015-07-25,10475804,Jessica,"Good points : it was easy to communicate with heriberto, he answered to our questions fastly. We did'nt have the chance to meet him, but everything was clear and easy to find in the appartment. There was enough room in the appartment for our family of 5 adults + 2 babies. The appartment is well located near the T and grocery."
What could be better: we found that it could be more clean. When we arrive there were hair on the floor of the bath room and in the bath. The other rooms were Ok.,,,,,
"The neighborhood is a little loud by night. But overall we enjoyed our stay and recommend this appartment.\"",,,,,
5025015,40409258,2015-07-30,39722441,Morgan,"Greats hosts. We felt comfortable and the area was great. The cost was very fair and that was the main reason we stayed, but the experience was amazing. A great location to be able to visit different parts of the city. The living space was spacious and the hosts were very helpful. They offered flexibility and had good communication with me leading up to the visit. I highly reccommend and may stay with them again."

5025015,42124358,2015-08-11,3951639,Laurie,"While the pictures accurately reflect the apartment, and the hosts were very easy to communicate with, we had a poor experience in this apartment for the following reasons."
1. The key was not at the apartment at check-in,we had to wait a short time.,,,,
2. The toilet was clogged upon arrival,and the janitor had to come two times before it was fixed. Even then,flushing was slow. We were told that NO toilet paper could be placed in the toilet at all. If we had been notified of this in advance,we would not have stayed here.,,
3. The internal doors of the apartment lock automatically,and no key or note is provided. My son was locked in a room alone until the janitor could break the door open.,,,,
4. There was not a top sheet on the beds,and no washable cover on the duvets; this is not sanitary from guest to guest.,,,,
5. The apartment was not thoroughly cleaned,stained and dirty shower,old food left in fridge,some unclean glasses in the cabinets.,,
6. One of the kitchen outlets ruined a new Kindle that I purchased less than 10 days prior to our stay.,,,,,
I appreciate and believe that the hosts are trying to provide a good experience,and this is a good price for a rental in Boston,but I would not stay here again due to cleanliness and the number of problems we experienced. The parking is off-street,"which is nice.\"",,

The appartment was well equiped and the wifi was working good (especially important for our kids)."
We met Heriberto and Cathy later: they are very nice and helpful people.,,,,,

The apartment was exactly as advertised, perfect size for 4 people. We were only there for 1 night but all of us would have enjoyed staying for longer. Finally, this is a great neighborhood to stay in if you're visiting Boston. It's close to both the green line (E) train, 39 bus route, and the orange line. This makes it incredibly easy to get into downtown Boston."
5025015,45464915,2015-09-03,13738936,Jose Carlos,"Para empezar no recomiendo el barrio a nadie y menos de noche. El anfitrión no se preocupa de nada,el piso esta muy sucio pero mucho. Donde esta la lavadora es en el sotano y es una pocilga. Los cerdos (cochinos) están mejor. Desde la cocina se veian las ratas del patio.Lo  único bueno es el menaje de cocina que tiene mucho y de buen aspecto pero por lo demás no recomiendo el piso a nadie ni siquiera a mis enemigos. La bañera oxidada con hongos en la cortina. Llegamos y aun estaba ocupado . Sin información de la ciudad y eso que la habíamos pedido. Tuvo el detalle de dejar fruta,croasanes y leche. NO  VOLVERIA NI LOCO"

5025015,46266692,2015-09-09,27615559,Cindy,My friends and I stayed in this apartment from Sept 6 to 9th and I am NOT recommending it! I have reported this complaint to Airbnb as Heriberto did not respond to my concerns.
We had a number of concerns related to safety and cleanliness.,,,,,
"- the fridge was leaking and we reported it to H and he said he had someone in fixing it \"\"yesterday\"\". After wiping up the water from the kitchen floor",the paper towels were filthy and still were the second day we had to wipe up. When was this floor last mopped????,,,,
- there were NO top sheets on the queen and double beds and the comforters are shabby (I now see that someone has complained about this previously). So,why did this happen again?,,,,
- the kitchen table was filthy and not wiped off clean,,,,,
- the bathtub/shower was small but that was ok. The tub however was so rusted grrrrrr. Thankfully they bought a shower mat after I mentioned the state of the tub,,,,,
- the fabric on the kitchen chairs and the ones in the living room are very old/grungy and I didn't want to sit on them.,,,,,
In terms of safety .....,,,,,
- The fire escape is almost totally blocked by the fridge and once we did open the door the escape route is cluttered with stuff,,,,,
- the electrical/hydro panel outside of the house broke away from the house and was suspended,hanging 2 feet way from the house. Thank goodness there was no fire as this posed a serious fire hazard.,,,,
- the entrance to the apartment involved negotiating several steps and the hanging and swinging outside door was not stabilized so that made it difficult to hold on and get inside (not good for someone in a cast who had to hang on).,,,,,
So,I have asked the host for a discount on our stay and he has ignored me for the past week. Airbnb is now involved in resolving this complaint and my feeling is,don't be fooled by cheap prices.,,,

5025015,49216527,2015-10-02,6328149,Jo,"Unfortunately we only arrived very late at night and left early, but Heriberto and Cathy made the odd arrival time possible and gave us clear instructions on how to get into the apartment. The apartment was great for the three single adults to stay in, each with our own room. The lounge room had a great TV for us to relax with after our work day. Although we didn't use it, there was a well-equipped kitchen."
"Would recommend this great priced accommodation!\"",,,,,
5025015,49418209,2015-10-04,28530661,Des,As previously Advised in email 2nd Oct we were unable to remain at the premises due To extreme access difficulties and left the same day. We did not feel safe in the neighbourhood and did not have any cell phone reception together with considerable able walking distances to public transport. We felt very isolated. This was not made aparrent in the initial airbnb advertising of the property. Finally the flat was shabby and was over priced for the internal and external condition.

5025015,51108388,2015-10-18,13029911,Emily,Great place.  Exactly as described.  Heriberto was very responsive!  We appreciated the snacks and water he left us!!
5025015,51463376,2015-10-20,36156965,Luis,"His place was cozy, spacious, and perfect for us! A short walk to the T line and into downtown Boston. Thank you!"
5025015,51695346,2015-10-24,23280625,Rosni,"Heriberto obliged my party to drop our luggage in prior to the official check-in time which we are thankful for. . Both Heriberto and Cathy were quick to respond to the minor issues we had. Breakfast pastry, bottled water ,orange juice and bananas were waiting for us later. The neighbourhood especially around the public transport station is questionable. We saw housing projects  close to the T station. We walked very briskly to the (URL HIDDEN) Friday night there was noisy revellers who we assumed were coming home after their evening out.The laundry facility are in the basement but we did not have the need to utilise the washer and dryer."

5025015,52327118,2015-10-28,23681805,Lorrie,A nice place to stay within walking distance from the T.   Though we never Heriberto or Cathy.  They were responsive to our needs via text or phone.  We had a great time in Boston.
5025015,53341924,2015-11-08,44296935,Jim,"We stayed 1 night with Heriberto to visit our daughter. The unit was as advertised. It was clean, plenty of room. The location was convenient. It was a good value for the money."
The unit had a neighborhood convenience store across the street for incidentals.,,,,,
"Heriberto was very prompt in responding to my questions both via emails / phone calls.   \"",,,,,
5025015,53979374,2015-11-15,24013847,Valentin,"Heriberto's apartment is very large, very clean and well located in Boston. Buses and tram lines are within 10 minutes walk. We enjoyed the croissants and fruits left by Paul for us in the apartment. We also liked the parking space available behind the building, I recommend Heriberto and his apartment."

5025015,54694641,2015-11-23,2168012,Tim,Lovely place close to town gracious host we have a large group and we were very comfortable
5025015,56926914,2015-12-20,35526882,Vera,"Our stay at this place was perfect. The moving-in instructions Heriberto left for us were very clear, the apartment felt homey and the neighborhood is safe. We appreciated the complimentary foods the hosts left for us too! The place has a parking slot near the house, and it's just about 15 minute drive from downtown Boston."
5025015,57108086,2015-12-21,7263983,Anthony,The host was wonderful and communicative.  The apt is a bit old and dirty as mentioned on a few reviews.
"The paper towels had insect dirt and bathroom has a distinct smell.  The cleaniness is a biggest holdback and we couldn't get the wifi to work.  \"",,,,,
5025015,59359264,2016-01-10,5595257,Karolyn,"The hosts were in great communication at the time of booking, the week of arrival, the date of arrival and anytime we needed them.  They left sweet touches of breakfast snacks, waters, and milk for the coffee."
The neighborhood was a little iffy,it was noisy even through the late hours with cars blaring music,people being generally noisy.  It was a manageable walk to the medical center areas which was the point of our visit.,,,
The listing was mostly accurate,some of the pictures seem outdated,"and we did feel comfortable. There was a little issue of cleanliness but all in all the stay fulfilled our needs!\"",,,
5025015,60674058,2016-01-25,17619062,Daniel,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5025015,62477771,2016-02-14,27581866,Zachary,Apartment was freazing cold and the wifi didn't work. But it was very cheap. You get what you pay for.
5025015,67365751,2016-03-29,598029,Bob,"Heriberto and Cathy, were very helpful and welcoming. Providing fruit, coffee, milk and breakfast pastries was a lovely touch."
It was cold in Boston in March,but the apartment warmed up nicely. Too warm at times and we had to turn the heat down.,,,,
Communication beforehand was excellent. The apartment was clean and comfortable. WiFi worked and was consistent. Jamaica Plain was an interesting neighbourhood,and we discovered Uber to get everywhere else.,,,,
The only downside,and really only a small thing,"the shower took some getting used to and you couldn't have hot and powerful first thing in the morning.\"",,,
5025015,68385647,2016-04-04,59614728,Amanda,"The apartment was large, clean, and very comfortable - overall much nicer than we expected from the photos! The host provided breakfast, and there was a full kitchen, a hair dryer, soap, shampoo, plenty of extra blankets, towels, and pillows, and lots of privacy. It was a short walk from the Green and Orange lines, and an easy commute in to our conference in downtown Boston."
The host was in good communication with us,checking in a few days before arrival,and then checking to make sure we didn't need anything else upon the day of our arrival. He was happy to give us extra keys,and was quick to respond to our messages. We had no problems with Wifi,the heaters,or any of the other amenities. It was a great deal for the price
5025015,70671457,2016-04-19,11237315,Micaela,"Our host was very kind, good at responding to messages quickly. He had juice, croissants, coffee pods  and other snacks waiting for us at the apartment, which was a lovely detail. Apartment was quite clean and spacious, and brand new towels were provided. We had no issues of any kind. Location was quite good, but it was about a 15 minutes walk to subway station/streetcar. Neighbourhood was pleasant."
5025015,71007320,2016-04-22,6227892,Dindy,He communicated with me the entire time.  I felt comfortable staying there.
5025015,72427491,2016-05-02,11527060,Krystin,"Heriberto was wonderful. He was always reachable, both before my stay and during. Periodically checking in to make sure everything was going well. He even provided us with coffee, milk, juice, and pastries upon apartment was great. Everything was clean and comfortable. I was staying for a week, and was able to unpack and feel at right at home. The neighborhood was nice. Whole Foods, Dunkin Donuts, and restaurants all walking distance."
5025015,72747659,2016-05-04,12554082,Gabriel,Excellent host. Apartment in great condition and very clean
5025015,73191705,2016-05-07,14581735,Rose,Heriberto was a great host. The apartment was pristine and very spacious. He left breakfast and coffee for us which was a very nice touch. Having parking was a huge plus in Boston and the location is close to public transit if you do not have a car. I would definitely recommend the place. Thanks again!
5025015,73574116,2016-05-08,25482205,Marcella,"Heriberto and Cathy were easy to communicate with. Access to the flat was simple. There was parking. There was plenty of sleeping space, as well as a full kitchen  (plus sitting room with tv and computer). Heriberto and Cathy sweetly left us pastries, milk, juice and fruit- as well as coffee and tea. They made our trip easy. Jamaica Plains is a hip diverse community. Just right for us! Our communications back and forth were human, playful and light."
5025015,73896130,2016-05-11,51756084,Leyun,Heriberto is a very nice host. The house is very beautiful and awesome! The location is very convenient! They provide food and drinks for us. The host is very quick to our questions. They even come to fix the printer for us. Even though the printer is still not working. But they let us to print everything in their sister's house. They are very helpful and I definitely will choose the place again when I go to Boston.
5025015,74365057,2016-05-15,43852258,Kihm,"In Boston for our daughter's graduation and were very pleased with the apartment.  Though we never got a chance to connect face to face, the communication was good and Heriberto was a great host.  Everything was as expected and made our stay relaxing and comfortable.  We would come back in a heartbeat.  Thanks so much for giving us place to call home while we were in town."
5025015,75261546,2016-05-20,4383725,Apollonia,The apartment was spacious and clean. Cathy and Heriberto were kind enough to leave a few breakfast items and fruit. We particularly appreciated the access to coffee. Off-street parking was convenient and the apartment was conveniently located to many different areas of interest.
5025015,76444174,2016-05-27,35064332,Dinna,"We stayed here for 4 nights. The place was clean and had ample room for all of us. Heriberto was even nice to have some pastries, milk, coffee and orange juice ready for us, it was very thoughtful. It was less than 5 miles from Harvard square which was perfect! We enjoyed our stay."
5025015,78597285,2016-06-07,17906311,Patricia,"Heriberto and Cathy were the most attentive and welcoming hosts! They checked in with me before, and many times during the trip, and what a kindness to have some delicious treats and drinks waiting for us when we got in that lasted through our three day stay. Thank you so much you two! We loved wandering through the neighborhood with it's cute houses and little gardens and its eclectic mix of cafes and restaurants. It's about a ten minute walk from the Orange Line or so. We loved eating at an Ethiopian restaurant a five minute walk away called The Nile. :) The apartment was perfect for us! Thank you so much, Heriberto and Cathy, and if I'm in Boston with a few friends again, I'll definitely look you up again, and meet up! :D"

Heriberto also had everything prepared really well for us,including muffins,milk and orange juice. His instructions to get to the place,getting keys,was clear and response time was really quick. He also checks on us to make sure we are ok. Heriberto really is a wonderful host.,
"I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston !\"",,,,,
5025015,80566386,2016-06-18,43015984,Eileen,"My colleagues and I stayed at Heriberto's place while attending a conference. Even though I didn't meet Heriberto personally everything was well organized and coordinated. It was also great to find some water bottles and banana's at our arrival - it was a nice welcome! The flat is nice, clean and well equipped. The only drawback was probably that 1 bedroom is linked to another bedroom meaning you have to walk through one bedroom to get to the other."
I also like the fact that there is a Whole Foods supermarket 5 min walk away.,,,,,

5025015,81739258,2016-06-24,22684453,Cheryl,"What an Airbnb treasure! This little apartment in a wonderful neighborhood in Boston was all the host promised and more.  The place was clean, comfy and cozy.  Our host provided all of the amenities of home - coffee, juice, muffin - as well as things you might need like off -street parking (a rare find in Boston)!  And it was walking distance from good public transportation to downtown. Heriberto was there to greet me and was so accommodating.  Thank you, Heriberto, for making my family's trip great and affordable!"

5025015,82534249,2016-06-28,6150833,Esme And Meg,We had a very comfortable stay at Heriberto's apartment. It was really lovely for him to leave cookies & fruit to make our stay more comfortable! Great location & the apartment wasn't noisy either.
5025015,84155933,2016-07-05,45632229,Sune,Good apartment. Approx. 500 m walking distance to the metro. Quit neibourghood. Good beds. All in all a good experience.

The apartment had everything we needed and was perfect for our trip. The location was also awesome! Very close to great restaurants and shops. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Boston.
5025015,86828734,2016-07-17,57773758,Karen,Host was excellent.  Property photographs newer than it is.  Some furniture is not the same as photos.  Twin beds bedroom is very tiny.  Beds are pretty hard.
5025015,87369759,2016-07-19,53721465,Matthias,Schneller Kontakt bei Ankunft und Problemen mit dem WLAN. Zuvorkommendes Verhalten bei Gepäckaufbewahrung am Abreisetag.

We didn't stay long,"but it was nice to have s little living room that wasn't a bedroom as many places do. Easily slept four grown men away from the wives and kids for a baseball trip to Boston.\"",,,,
5025015,88554812,2016-07-24,61246087,Natalie,"Heriberto was a fantastic host! My family and I enjoyed the apartment. It was clean, and we had everything we needed. We also loved the neighborhood. There's a Whole Foods nearby and a liquor store. Nights were very quiet. I regret not having tried the charming Ethiopian restaurant nearby.  This area seemed like the kind of place where I would like to live!"
Heriberto stopped by on the first night to bring us fresh fruit and milk,"which was very sweet. We also had some water bottles and orange juice waiting for us in the fridge.\"",,,,
5025015,89199636,2016-07-27,31233864,Aruna,"The hosts are great, very helpful and very responsive. The house is great, it is in the JP neighborhood. There are two queen beds and two single beds (2 big bedrooms and 1 little bedroom attached to one of the big bedrooms), so we were very comfortable. The place is walking distance to many restaurants. The Ethiopian place Blue Nile is fantastic. It is a 10 minute drive to BU and Museum of art, and a 30 minute drive to Cambridge and Quincy. Overall we had a very pleasant stay. Only issue is if you keep the windows open in the little room, it can get noisy at night."
5025015,89486109,2016-07-28,60732928,Peter,"Great apartment, very comfortable and easy to get into the heart of Boston,"

5025015,92936045,2016-08-10,13550788,Rachel,"Très bon contact avec l'hôte même si uniquement par téléphone, appartement idéal pour grande famille très bien équipé avec billard et machines à laver en partie commune au sous-sol. Quartier quelconque, un peu bruyant ! Personnes habitants au dessus et en dessous.Bonne expérience."
5025015,95636644,2016-08-20,50037755,Francesco,Heriberto's condo is spacious and nicely equipped. My family of 5 people had a lot of space to relax.
Train to downtown is walk distance,approx 10m.,,,,
You can also walk to a nice park,Jamaica,close by.,,,
So far so good.,,,,,
Neighborhood was a bit shabby.,,,,,

5025015,96533382,2016-08-23,3936398,Katerina,"It was easy to find, easy to park a car, the key was in the lockbox. The location is very good, short walk to metro station, few stations from Boston downtown. Heriberto prepared some pastry and fruits for breakfast, which was so nice from him. The only downside were the locks and doors. Main house door lock is so difficult to unlock, we arrived late night and I was worry we will not be able to enter the house. Appartment doors and lock are so weak, one kick could open it. But the neighbourhood was fine, we didn' t feel unsafe."
5025015,97173509,2016-08-26,72615254,Katharina,Cathy and Heriberto were very good hosts and did their best to make us feel comfortable. They offered drinks and snacks and when we had problems to enter the apartment on our first day they helped us very fast. The apartment was big enough and clean.
5025015,98610615,2016-08-31,65526818,Paul,"Very comfortable, lots of extras left for us from the host.  Great location.  Highly  recommend."
5025015,99085104,2016-09-03,9649869,Sarah,"This place is a great value! We had plenty of room for 5 adults and a child. As mentioned, the host left us pastries, fruit, milk, juice, and coffee, which was a lifesaver. Places to cook and do our laundry. The neighborhood was a little run down but we felt safe and it was a 10 minute walk to the subway. There's a parking spot and plenty of parking on the street, too. Host was very responsive."
The only thing is I would warn that it's on the second floor up a steepish couple of stairs. No problem for me,but might be a concern for some people. The bathroom is also small and the lock on the apartment wasn't the most secure (there is a main door to the apartment that is also locked). Otherwise,"so much better than a hotel!\"",,,
8189821,47299445,2015-09-17,5804119,Jacob,"The condo was spectacular. Not only very clean, but great views and a very comfortable home. It felt like I was at my own house, not someone else's."

13294824,81066767,2016-06-20,75318878,John,"My stay with Mike and Emily was wonderful.  They welcomed me to their home.  Mike and his friends took me on a short walking tour of the neighborhood and showed me great places to get food, the best way to walk to the convention center and the location of the post office.  The neighborhood is beautiful and the room was great.  It was immaculate and had a nice private bathroom and walk-in closet.  They have two nice friendly dogs who you see occasionally when they are being walked or played with.  Both Mike and Emily were very interesting and we had some terrific conversations.  I was able to enjoy the room and get work done which was also important to me.  I would highly recommend staying with them and would definitely come back when I am visiting Boston for work or pleasure."
13294824,86207802,2016-07-15,1217848,Susan,"Absolutely fantastic! A quiet, clean room with a private bath located in a friendly South Boston neighborhood! The harbor is just a short walk away, and there is a lovely jogging trail right on the ocean. There are tons of small cafes and breakfast joints on Broadway, and everything else is a short bus ride away!"

13294824,99029158,2016-09-03,55948936,Lynette,"We spent very little time at the accommodation as we were touring, but found walking through an untidy bedroom to our bedroom unpleasant. The hosts did not show us the amenities we could use eg the kitchen and laundry. Even though we tried to initiate conversation with our hosts, there was no response, generally an unfriendly atmosphere."
916123,4272335,2013-04-23,2269710,Melanie,"My two friends and I stayed at the Old North Parlor Flat on the Court in mid April, the weekend they caught the Boston Marathon bombing suspects.  So it was a particular time to be in this great city.  The location is perfect, walking distance from everything you need.   You are in the heart of the city.  The place could use a little bit more cleaning but all in all a great way to be in the action for a lot less then a downtown hotel."
916123,4979677,2013-06-05,5413427,Danny,Sean is a nice guy and helped us with our bags since we had to move to his other apartment on our last day. The location of the apartment is very good but the apartment is a bit old indeed.
916123,5240057,2013-06-20,5026474,Victoria,"We had a great stay in Boston! The apartment is cozy and very spacious. Located in the North End right at the Freedom Trail and near the harbor, it is a great starting point for exploring the city (by foot). Jose is a nice and easy-going host who made us feel welcome and who was very uncomplicated with checking in and out."
916123,5263010,2013-06-21,4339764,Kelly,"This place was in an amazing location and you couldn't beat the price for Boston. Jose was very accomodating and flexible with check in time. The bed was very comfortable and the the place was clean. Just an FYI on parking. We got a spot right on the street outside of Jose's place. We parked in the permit spots over night for free and didn't get a ticket. However, you have to take the chance. I heard sometimes people are ticketed and sometimes they are not. We looked it up and the ticket would have been $40 which is $10 more than parking in the $30 lot at the end of the street, so that is why we risked it."
916123,5315339,2013-06-24,6288362,Kate,"Apartment and host were great.  Apartment was clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed.  Jose was very responsive and helpful - when we noticed there wasn't an iron, he managed to get us one within about five minutes.  Whenever I had a question I got a quick response."
There was a little confusion because when we booked,the listing was with a different person,"so the first few communications (including one about early check-in) were with a different person.  This was pretty easily cleared up.\"",,,
916123,5359696,2013-06-26,5108727,Chris,"Although in a really good location, we had a couple of issues with this place.  Firstly the doors to the apartment aren't numbered so its difficult to know which one in the block it is."
Secondly the bed has to be the most uncomfortable I've ever slept in,complete with a waterproof bottom sheet.,,,,
The place is a decent size,but could do with a little tlc,"such as fixing the broken lamps.\"",,,
916123,5410761,2013-06-29,5748394,Antonietta,"The apartment couldn't be in a more central location if you want to see historical Boston, the front door is literally  yards from the freedom trail and north end church! It is about a 5min walk to either Haymarket or North T station so very easy to get around. No problems with the apartment in itself, clean when we arrived and no issues getting the keys.  Small flight of stairs up to the front door but only challenging if extremely unfit, a couple in their fifties were in the flat above ours and had no problems. If there are two of you in the double bed and one is a light sleeper beware, it's very squeaky! Would definitely recommend as a great place to stay whilst in Boston and hope to use it again."
916123,5447847,2013-07-01,1698781,Brian,Jose was a very accommodating host who made my visit to Boston a memorable one.  The instructions he left were clear and we had very open lines of communication.  The apartment is located in one of my favorite neighborhoods in the country within walking distance to some of Boston's best attractions and restaurants.  I highly recommend this apartment.
916123,5554226,2013-07-06,677131,Sharom,"Jose's North End apartment in Boston is in a great location. Right on the freedom trail across the street from the old church. We found it very convenient to explore Boston from there. Jose was very responsive to our questions and was very quick to resolve any problems. We had a very good time in Boston. Thanks for hosting us, Jose."
916123,5706824,2013-07-13,2043912,Maria,"The apartment is very cute, as seen in the photos. Jose was very friendly and was very easy to deal with. It's very good host and checkin was very smooth. THE location is great. The apartment is on an alley, which although not very glamorous, very well located: the Freedom Trail passes through the sidewalk in front. Thanks Jose for everything!"
916123,5745480,2013-07-14,3425468,Francisco,"Considering the great location and the rock bottom price, we guessed there would be some compromises in terms of the quality of the accommodation, and we were prepared for that."
What we weren't prepared for was spending the first ten minutes of our stay with our hands inside a toilet tank trying to fish out the mechanism to get the damn thing to flush. Or finding that it would be much better to keep our shoes on,as there was some weird/gross sticky crap on the super-shaggy Ikea carpet. Or that we couldn't give the baby a bath because there was no stop in the bathtub.,,,,
José seems like a really nice guy,and he did what he could to take care of us,but this apartment really is a bit of a. It's really baffling because the location is AMAZING and a lot of the things that marred our stay could be fixed with just a few minutes and a little bit of attention: a bath stopper,a new toilet mechanism...these things are not expensive! And throwing away the super-gnarly carpets is free!,,
José,amigo,can't you see that the apartment has a lot of potential? It's never going to have a lot of natural light,but if you spent just a few thousand dollars sanding the beautiful floors,redoing the frankenstein-style grouting around the tub and freshening up the tiny-but-functional kitchen,plus buying a couple of decent lamps and a couple of things to hang on the wall and you could easily rented for double the price. You'd get your investment back in no time!
As it stands,"we didn't think it was worth it even at this price. \"",,,,
916123,5822963,2013-07-18,5621327,Jason And Suzanne,I would like to start off by thanking the housekeeper and Jose for their honesty. I left a bag behind with a laptop and a tablet in it and they returned it without issue. I am so grateful.
The location of this place is amazing if you do not mind a bit of a walk,which we don't. Quiet and quaint in the north end. So many places to eat (only a block away) that we were busting at the seams.,,,,
The apartment is not as small as I thought it would be from the photos. I was under the impression that this was one large room with a kitchenette and a bathroom but I was incorrect. It is actually 2 rooms plus the kitch/bath. Quite nice and held a family of 3 just fine. We brought an air mattress for our son and had plenty of space to set it up.,,,,,
Updates are needed but overall,"staying here was a good choice and a great value.\"",,,,
916123,6145451,2013-08-01,5480423,Aunt,"We had a great time where we stayed.   Very safe, very close to many attractions.  We ate breakfast everyday down the street at Bread + Butter (best coffee and sandwiches).  Jose had us move to the upstairs unit as he is renovating the unit we were supposed to be in, they moved everything for us (including our pizza and beer!).  He got back to me via text with all my questions.  The place was clean and comfortable.  I would recommend staying there to everyone.  Thank you!"

C'est un appartement ancien avec les charmes et les inconvénients.,,,,,
L'appartement a besoin d'être remis à neuf dans l'ensemble. La salle de bain est particulièrement vieillotte et les boiseries en très mauvais état (moisissures).,,,,,
Le ménage n'était pas impeccable (sol collant dans la salle de bain et poussières).,,,,,

Easy to access by car and a parking garage is nearby.,,,,,

If you are coming for a quick trip to Boston and want a place to sleep then this is the place for you, however if you intend to spend any time in the condo this would not be the place.  It is very old, which was to be expected given the location, but what I wasn’t expecting was a leak that is in serious need of repair and has caused tons of mold to grow in the bathroom.  Some people won’t mind the mold and will love the bargain but in my opinion I wish I would have splurged a little and gotten a cleaner, more up to date condo."

Stairway leading up to the apartment was a bit cramped, but definitely added character to the place!  Within walking distance to restaurants, bars, coffee shops, gelaterias etc. and right by the Paul Revere statue. Bed is very comfortable too - would stay again!"

L'air climatisé et le Wifi ont été appréciés. Pas de buanderie dans l'immeuble mais une dans la rue adjacente. Si vous avez une auto, il est impossible de trouver une place de stationnement dans TOUTES les rues; prévoyez un stationnement payant dans le stationnement municipal à quelques coins de rue de là (25$ pour 24h).

"\"",,,,,
916123,7272059,2013-09-14,3961346,Katlie,"I agree with some other reviews, they can really do better with the place."
The location is spectacular,all the major attractions in the old town can be easily reached on foot. The flat is actually a studio,no door between the bedroom and sitting room,just a frame,but  is roomy for two or three person.,
The equipment and service could use some improvements though. I booked the place for three,but it was clearly setup for just two. No extra bedding available in the room. I slept on the sofa with only a bath towel for the first night,because we'd been arrived very late. They brought in the third set of bedding the next day when they received my complaint. Plus the sofa is really just a sofa,"not a sofa bed. The cushions \"\"placed\"\" on the sofa cannot be moved",which makes little room for sleeping in,even with me being on a smaller size
The key box really takes some time for figuring out,if you never saw and used one. I'll say a picture of the box can be helped a lot. It took me a while for realizing those are the key box I was looking for.,,,,
They have a full kitchen but little kitchenware,kind of a waste.,,,,
One more thing,the flat is on the third floor with narrow stairs,big luggage can be a challenging.,,,

It's a spacious place with a bedroom, living room, bathroom and small kitchen.  The bed was comfy but I needed better pillows. (just my preference)  The location is AMAZING!  Right outside is the Old North Church and there are a lot of restaurants and sights within walking distance. You're right on the Freedom Trail. :) Jose was always easily accessible and returned my queries within minutes.  So, the things that we weren't happy about...we could hear EVERYTHING from the people upstairs and downstairs.  We could hear the people upstairs snoring!!  Then they decide to wake up at 4am and walk around seriously for three hours straight.  We didn't get a good night's sleep the whole time we were there.  Then we left one morning to get breakfast and were going to come back to rest a little and two guys were there to fix the shower.  So we leave and go sightseeing and come back 5 1/2 hours later.  We walk in and there's a shower door in the living room, a radio blasting and the salt and pepper were out.  We sat waiting to see what was going on and one of the workers comes back and says he had used the kitchen to heat up his food and ate there while we were gone.  So we had to wait for him to finish fixing the shower then FINALLY got to relax.  Then he said not to use the shower until later in the evening.  The place is beautiful with exposed brick and chimney, but the floor heaters were away from the wall a little and there was paint peeling in places and there seemed to be water damage to the floorboards in the bathroom.  It's an old place so the floors were very creaky and loud.  The rooms could use some new paint and the whole place could use a little bit more love."

The neighborhood is absolutely stunning, day and night. Just a few steps from the flat there are many italian restaurants, bakeries and some stores. For those who arrive by car, there isn't any immediate parking at the flat, but there are a couple of parking at the beginning of Hull St. They cost around 30$ per day. The flat is cozy and very charming with all the old reddish bricks, the fireplace and the old floors and ceilings. The kitchen is very small, but with all the bare facilities for having a meal at home. The bedroom is big, with plenty of space for luggage. The only complain is that it wasn't very clean but considering the great location and the good price...I would highly recommend it anyway."

Retrieving the keys and getting into the flat was quite easy. The cost for what you are getting was quite fair. On the negative side, you can hear all conversations from the people above you like they are right next to you. The kitchen is less than even basically equipped. There is no can opener, the 2- pots are not really usable, you get the idea. It would be nice if there was one surface you could sit at at table height so you were not hunched over a coffee table to eat. The night table lamps are a little dim to read by. I think the noise factor would prevent me from renting this again as it would be hit or miss who else is staying in the building."

916123,12241091,2014-04-27,12726705,Markus,"We had a wonderful time at Jose's apartment! It's a very cosy place with an amazing neighbourhood...a lot of very good Italian restaurants around. The apartment is not very soundproof to the apartment on the upper floor, but that was no big deal. We did not meet Jose in person, everything was done via mail but we did not mind. We would stay at his place any time again."
916123,12601845,2014-05-06,7435377,Elizabeth,"Location, location!  This cute little flat is smack dab in the middle of North End.  10minutes'   walk from hay market station.  The bedroom is quite spacious hand the sofa is good for a second bed.  The flat is up two steep and narrow flights of stairs, and there is no TV.  Jose got us  extra sheets and extra pots and pans so we could cook a meal. And he made another trip with extra keys so we could go out separately"
916123,13208205,2014-05-22,2935915,Kelsey,"The apartment is as pictured, nothing too fancy, but the location can't be beat!  Jose was very responsive and we had no major issues.  Yes, you can hear others in the apartments above you (mainly just walking around), but it wasn't anything too major.  We took advantage of all the great restaurants around us..Cozy Corner for breakfast, Pizzeria Regina for great pizza and Al Dente for a dinner with huge portions, plus Mike's Pastries and Bova's Pasteries.  Very convenient for using public transportations, often we were able to just walk to our destination due to the great location!"
916123,13302911,2014-05-25,11482618,Marie,"I booked this place for my parents who were visiting me in Boston. It's a beautiful, comfy and clean apartment in a top location!! 5 minutes walk to the subway station, many restaurants and cafés around the corner. Everything was perfect, I would recommend this place without hesitation!"
"And it wasn't too noisy. \"",,,,,
916123,13421960,2014-05-27,14363938,Jake,"This place is awesome. It's in a great location and very cozy. Jose and Jason were great to rent from and very friendly. There was a slight mix up with the apartment number and I called Jose and he gave me the correct info right away. As others have mentioned, the noise in the hallway and upstairs is pretty noticeable but it's certainly not something that would cause me not to stay there again. I highly recommend this place and hope it's available if I'm in Boston again."
916123,13530711,2014-05-30,11482618,Marie,"My parents loved the apartment and the neighborhood! Yes, you can hear neighbors sometimes but for us it was an absolutely tolerable dose."
"We would love to stay at this place again soon. \"",,,,,
916123,13571893,2014-05-31,4793929,Steve,"The neighborhood is great-- it's right around the corner from Old North Church!  The hosts were good and communicative and helpful.  The spaces looked like they did in the pictures.  My only issue was that the bathroom, although clean, was a bit rough around the edges-- the mouldings need work etc."
916123,13734162,2014-06-03,11482618,Marie,"I booked the apartment three times for my parents and they loved it every time. The communication with the hosts was excellent and they were flexible with our special needs. The neighborhood is fantastic and the apartment is comfy. Yes, the bathroom is not fancy but it is absolutely appropiate for Boston´s standard."
"I recommend to stay in this apartment. \"",,,,,
916123,13808577,2014-06-04,3065564,Eric,"My whole experience was seamless. In this case, my girlfriend and I didn't have any special requests or needs, but everything went as planned. The instructions were clear and brief, the apartment was lovely, and the neighborhood was fantastic. We were in, out, easy. My only note is that the bathroom is a little less nice than the rest of the apartment, but it was clean and serviceable."
916123,13880335,2014-06-07,12133425,Crystal,"The hosts were great with communication, quick responses to questions and"
easy to deal with,even accommodating with no worry our late check out. The,,,,
location of the apartment was great,on the Freedom Trail and in the heart,,,,
"of Little Italy.\"",,,,,
916123,14228675,2014-06-15,10918054,Boe,"Excellent experience in a wonderful neighborhood.  Hands down, 500% better than a hotel experience.  If you are looking for an authentic experience in Boston, then be sure to check this place out!"
916123,14553374,2014-06-22,1325304,Ariana & Andrew,"Our hosts were friendly and available prior to our stay via email and phone and when I couldn't reach him directly, he responded very quickly.  He was clear and thorough about our reservations, and the pictures are true to form.  The apartment was easy to locate, clean, equipped with all that we needed for a half week in Boston, and WONDERFULLY LOCATED!! Amazing food nearby, great sightseeing, awesome north end park just a few blocks away, and at the same time a quiet apartment off the busy streets.  Thanks so much for renting this apartment, we are sure other folks/families would enjoy a stay at one of your apartments in this building.  (My parents were staying upstairs in another one of his apartments at the same time so we got to sneak a look into it, also gorgeous and well equipped.)"
916123,14803155,2014-06-26,17044811,Nick,I was in town for a solar convention and all of the hotels were booked.  Jose & Jason's apt was my first exploration into AirBNB - now I'm hooked.
Their place was awesome.  Better than described and the location is perfect for anything you want to do in Boston.  Communication was clear,quick and concise.,,,,
"Will definitely check the availability if I make it back to Boston.\"",,,,,
916123,14856831,2014-06-28,5270207,Anne,Arrangements for the stay were easy and the apartment was just as pictured.  Great neighborhood/location!  My only regret was no central air conditioning - first night we stayed it was really hot and window A/C unit in the bedroom was not quite sufficient to keep it cool.
916123,15106612,2014-07-02,6941646,Morgan And Samuel,"My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary and baby moon. It was a great spot in the BEST location (The North End was our favourite area of the whole city so we were thrilled that we were staying there). The apartment is nice, clean and has A/C which made all the difference for sleeping in the heat of the summer. Jose was kind and professional and provided all the information we needed before we got there."
916123,15161811,2014-07-03,10606950,Ellen,The location of this apartment is just perfect.   Jose provided all the information I needed in a timely manner.
The apartment was clean and the bedroom is large and comfortable,with nice light.  We didn't use the kitchen apart from the fridge,but it is minimally furnished.  However,the neighborhood restaurants can't be beat.,,
This is a great place to stay if you want an ideal location and don't want to pay Boston hotel prices!,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
916123,15281701,2014-07-06,16178269,Amanda,"I stayed here with two friends and we really enjoyed our stay. The location of this flat cannot be beat. The North end my favorite area of Boston, and in this flat we were walking distance to some great cafes, pubs and restaurants."
Jose and Jason answered our questions immediately and were very accommodating (our flight got in early and they let us check in early no questions asked).,,,,,
The bedroom was big and bright,and the bed was really comfortable,it was also air conditioned which was very appreciated in this heat wave. The rest of the flat was a little dark and the air conditioning didn't travel as well to the living room,so I'm not sure how comfortable it was for the 3rd person sleeping on the couch.,,
The bathroom was clean,but could use some fixing up. However the shower was great,and had nice water pressure. As for the kitchen the microwave and toaster were nice to have,but there were very few dishes in the apartment.,,
Overall we really liked our stay,and would definitely recommend staying here,,,,

916123,15483882,2014-07-10,13042810,Paul,"The parlor flat was great for our needs. It was very charming and a perfect location, just steps from the Old North Church and several world class restaurants. I would highly recommend it."
916123,15582803,2014-07-12,8241742,Kevin,"Checking in was a breeze, and the apartment was very quaint and comfortable! I absolutely loved all of the exposed brick. Towels were provided which was very nice. It was so nice to stay in this neighborhood of Boston, literally two buildings down from the Old North Church. If we end up traveling back to Boston I would definitely stay here again!"
916123,15822716,2014-07-16,3508500,Caitlin,"The space is lovely and in a great location. I had a couple of questions on arrival, and Jose was very responsive and helpful. Would definitely stay again!"

916123,16343758,2014-07-26,15357493,Tara,A+ location and alll-around great launch point for experiencing much of the city's history and one of the city's coolest neighborhoods.
916123,16509108,2014-07-28,17634613,Suzie,"Nous avons trouvé que l'appartement était bien situé par contre, la propreté de la salle de bain, particulièrement le bain, laissait vraiment a désirée.  Également, il serait bon de mentionner que l'appartement est au 3e étage sans ascenseur."
916123,16584715,2014-07-29,3828533,Jess,"Location, location, location. Very charming old-world Boston apartment in a perfectly located part of town. Hosts are very helpful and have terrific open communication. Entry and house rules are easy. Would return and recommend to family and friends."
916123,16668925,2014-07-31,17295715,Eric,"The location of this apartment was great, right downtown and with other airbnb'ers in the area. The apartment was spacious and very clean and Jose was accommodating.  I had a great rental experience."
916123,16745844,2014-08-01,18659814,Robert,"The place was great. It was what I expected and more. I knew it was in the heart of the north end, but had no idea it was a step from the Old North Church. That was very cool. There were tons of places to eat and drink within walking distance. Whenever I had a question or concern it was answered almost immediately, which can be very helpful when your new to an area. The apartment itself was perfect. It was air conditioned and had plenty of room. I ended up having some old friends come and visit me in the city, so it was nice to have a place to offer them to crash at. That being said the couch came in handy! On my next trip to Boston I will be contacting thee guys again. Great experience."
916123,17228953,2014-08-09,18350118,Dom,The location could not have been better. The apartment was very homey and the exposed wood was gorgeous. Everything we needed was provided to us. The only thing that was wrong was we could only stay one night.
916123,17494647,2014-08-13,10895739,Aymeric,"Nous avons trouvé facilement l'appartement. Celui-ci est situé dans un quartier sympa, animé sans être trop bruyant. beaucoup de restaurants et de petites supérettes."
Le quartier nous a beaucoup plus.,,,,,
seul bémol,il n'y a pas de métro pour le centre de Boston dans le North End. C'est pas grave on marche dans ces cas là.,,,,
L'appartement correspondait parfaitement aux photos.,,,,,
un seul regret le ménage ! l'appartement était sale !  j'ai du faire le ménage dans la cuisine,et les sols méritaient bien un coup d'aspirateur aussi mais il n'y en avait pas. j'ai retrouvé sur le sol dans la chambre une gélule de médicament ! ! ! ce qui est loin de m'avoir plus car nous étions avec une petite fille d'à peine 2 ans ! elle aurait pu l'avaler.,,,,
en terme de vaisselle,seulement 2 assiettes et pas de petites cuillères.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
916123,17603467,2014-08-14,8615170,Scott,"The description of the place is accurate. It is a great location, right in the middle of the north end. Both the building and the apartment are old and a bit run down. The apartment could use some updates; but it is quite functional. It's perfectly comfortable for someone who is using it to drop their stuff and go out and about, but not a place you'd want to hang  out in or any significant length of time."
916123,17759630,2014-08-17,13237105,Louise,"Ideally located for visitors wanting to experience the historic north end. Close to train station and city centre. Lots of places to eat nearby, a must if you're an Italian fan! No tv but this isn't a problem if you're on hols. Didn't use the kitchen etc but looked fairly well stocked."
Host was great at keeping in touch,"and giving me further details. \"",,,,
916123,17977368,2014-08-19,19784853,Giuseppe,Great location in the hearth of little Italy. Apartment is cozy and ideal for couples (third person get to sleep on a couch - rather confortabile - but no door dividing living room and bedroom).
"Keep in Mind that you need to walk up 2 floor (with tiny and steep steps).\"",,,,,
916123,18110223,2014-08-22,2632347,Ashley,"This is literally right in the heart of it all! Right in the middle of the freedom trail walk, which is a great activity to do while in Boston. Great food is all around. The space is neat, clean and comfortable. Be aware that if you plan on changing check out times to later in the day that they have a cleaning service at 11am. They accidentally threw out our food that we were bringing back to our family as a gift; however they did retrieve it and bring it back to us before we left.  Overall a great experience and I would stay there again."
916123,18425289,2014-08-26,18979798,Amanda,"Jose and Jason helped make my first time to Boston a great experience! The listing description and pictures were extremely accurate and the apartment was clean and quiet. Jose was quick to respond to my inquiries prior to arriving, gave clear instructions on checking in and out and provided linens, wi-fi, kitchenware, towels, etc as promised, so did not need to contact him at all while we were visiting. The location of the apartment was in a perfect location and we were able to walk to most of the attractions we wanted to see. Would be happy to stay here again! Thanks Jose and Jason!"
916123,18524166,2014-08-28,14008260,Anais,"L'appartement est très bien situé et le check-in et check-out sont très simples, José est arrangeant."
L'appartement est confortable mais nous étions 3 est le matériel disponible (draps,tasses etc.) ne l'était que pour deux personnes,ce qui était un peu embêtant!,,,
"Nous avons quand même passé un bon séjour grâce à cet appartement.\"",,,,,
916123,18799345,2014-09-01,1013656,Nathan,Comfortable flat in a great North End location. Steps away from the Freedom Trail and all the great food you could ask for. Recommended for anyone looking for a great Boston experience.
916123,19029249,2014-09-05,12433770,Amanda,"I've stayed in Jose's North End flats twice now, so suffice to say, I'm a fan. The building is very old, so you will hear your neighbours moving about, but it's not unbearable. The location is absolutely perfect and Jose is always available should you need anything. I would stay here again!"
916123,19192337,2014-09-08,16633753,Elizabeth,"Jose was an awesome host! Everything was as easy as could be, especially staying right in the city. Jose was easily reachable for questions. We would go back in a heartbeat!"
916123,19359784,2014-09-11,11380292,Carmen,"We didnt met jose personally but when we had a question he respond immediately by mail. The appartment is definetely on the best location to explore boston. It is old but reasonable clean. Because it is an old building, the wooden floors make it a litle bit noisy. But this didnt bother us too much. The bed was very good! I would definetly recommend this aparment!"
916123,19463125,2014-09-13,17996024,Valeria,"We stayed three days in this cozy apartment and we loved it! Downside, very thin walls (good hope in the hearts of your neighbors !!)."
Great location along the rail freedom in Northend,a famous Italian neighborhood.,,,,
Jose has always been present real time responding to e-mails,"giving the possibility to leave your luggage beyond the check-out!\"",,,,
916123,19723330,2014-09-17,5319493,Carly,"This was the second time I stayed at one of Jose's listings in the North End so I knew what to expect as far as location, amenities, etc.  Yet another great, seamless stay!  The location is perfect and while the stairs are always daunting (fortunately we were on the 3rd floor and not the 4th) I expected them this time!  The bed and pillows were very comfortable and both my mom and I slept unusually well for being away from home.  The bathroom is a bit run down but to be expected for an old building.  No TV, but free wifi."
The best part (which I mentioned above) is location.  You feel like a local in an old and culturally/historically significant area of town.   The Old North Church is literally right around the corner and Bova's Bakery is an additional block away (for all of your 24/7 pastry needs).,,,,,
Thanks for another great stay,"Jose!\"",,,,

916123,20515575,2014-09-30,11284265,Kate,"A quiet stay amidst the bustle of the historic North End. We didn't spend much time in the space except to sleep, but we appreciated that there was a hair dryer available and that there was no television (a useless distraction, especially when you are traveling in new places)."
916123,20685110,2014-10-04,12715713,Florian,After a long day of travelling we arrived at the appartement. I forgot the code for the key box and Jose helped me promptly.
The spacious appartement was exactly as it is shown in the pictures. It is located in an old house with wooden floors,sometimes you can hear the neighbours walking. At night it was very quiet.,,,,
The bed was quite comfortable,clean bed sheets and towels were provided.,,,,
Kitchen is well equipped,we made breakfast ourselves.,,,,

916123,21341597,2014-10-15,20604355,Caroline,Great central location and nice main bedroom. We didn't really use the kitchen facilities but being Brits would have appreciated a kettle perhaps. Good stock of towels.
916123,21459592,2014-10-18,18011912,Becky,We loved the location of this place though the 3 flights of narrow stairs were a bit of a challenge for large suitcases. The apt. was clean with basic supplies. Our intention was to sleep and shower so it definitely fulfilled our needs. I would return primarily because of the location.
916123,21587792,2014-10-20,19199913,Liz,Great location
916123,21720162,2014-10-22,22218622,Tricia,"We had a great time staying at Jose's place in the North End. This was our first time in Boston and our first time using Airbnb and we couldn't have asked for a better first experience. The apartment is in a great location, close to restaurants, bars, and sights on the freedom trail. This part of Boston is very walkable so it was easy and convenient to get where we needed to go each day. The apartment itself was great, simple, no frills, but very comfortable and perfect for our stay. It had all the basic amenities you would need on a trip and it was always nice coming back here after a long day of sightseeing!"
916123,21945936,2014-10-27,20336310,Jonathan,"\"I had a wonderful experience here. Jose was very helpful and flexible. The apartment was clean when I arrived. The bedroom is spacious, the bed was comfortable, the brick walls one either side with fireplace was also really nice. There is a small living room between the bedroom and the bathroom/kitchen area. The couch in the living room was really comfortable and almost long enough for me to stretch out (I'm 6'4\"\"). The bathroom is fine - nice new toilet. The kitchen is a really nice thing to have to. Almost a full sized fridge"
The neighborhood is also really great. There are a lot of tourists around and restaurants geared towards them,but you can also find a lot of amazing small spots. Very close to the apartment is a place called Theo's Cozy Corner,which is incredible. There is also a bakery that is open 24 hours and serves pizza and arancini (try one while you're in this neighborhood). This saved me as I arrived very late and needed to find food on a tuesday. Everything was closed except this place.,,,
"I would definitely recommend this place. It's not the fanciest apartment but it is wonderful nonetheless. Much better than a hotel.\"",,,,,
916123,22098241,2014-10-30,15533880,Florence,Great apartment very well located. We never met the owner but the keys are very easy to find. It was furnished with all the necessary basics.

916123,22592536,2014-11-10,11756830,Steven,My family and I were very satisfied with our stay in Boston. The accommodations were stellar and our hosts were very helpful. We didn't get the chance to meet Jason or Jose but the communication was prompt and most helpful. We would definitely use there services again.
916123,23123947,2014-11-23,275486,Carol,"The apt was clean, quiet, warm on a very cold winter weekend and comfortable. It is in a great location right near Old North Church and easy walk to many restaurants, shops etc. We spoke on the phone with Jose a couple of times regarding questions we had and he was very helpful.  We were also able to arrange for a parking pass from Jose (for a small additional fee) which was great."
916123,23178079,2014-11-24,346612,Laurie,"Couldn't have asked for a better experience.  The apartment was nicer than the pictures show, and the location is simply great."

916123,24612480,2014-12-31,24770692,Kathleen,"We love the neighborhood and the apartment was is an excellent location with public parking just up the street.  We were able to walk the North End totally.   The apartment was clean but not terribly well appointed with details that could be easily fixed.  There was no blanket for the third person, just a sleeping bag.  The 2 air mattresses were leaking, one had obviously been pushed up against the heating unit and had many holes, deflated instantly, needs to be removed.  The other had  a slow leak and could not be used over night.  The lay-flat couch was a joke;  back and seat different heights, and if you lay on the back it tipped you onto the floor. Ha Ha.  funny but a good sleep.   There were 3 guests scheduled and only 2 plates, inadequate glasses and silverware.   The hosts had asked us to be quiet, but the upstairs neighbors partied loudly until 2:00 am as if they were in our rooms.  It was happy noise and with our cell phone appts. we got to sleep."
916123,24713230,2015-01-02,18659814,Robert,"This was the second time we stayed here. It's in a great spot and we had a blast. It's our go to Boston place to stay. Jose is great, always answers questions and requests almost immediately. I recommend this spot for sure."

916123,26160723,2015-02-05,1970865,Desta,Awesome space.  This is the second time I've stayed here and it was just as great.  And I forgot my watch and Jose was nice enough to send it back to me express.  Can't recommend it enough!
916123,26493966,2015-02-14,26446640,Gina,"Amazing experience! Beautiful and convenient location. Jose was very efficient and prompt with any requests, and everything was picture perfect when we arrived! Definitely would stay here again."
916123,26700431,2015-02-17,1126274,Michelle,"Great place to stay. We were there during the copious amounts of snowfall and encountered another blizzard while there. Jose was extremely accommodating. The pathway to the apartment was shoveled and salted daily. Our flight was delayed for 2 extra days. Although the apartment we were in was already booked,he was able to move us to another apartment in the same building. The apartments are clean and well stocked. Best location we have stayed in Boston. We will definitely be back,and will stay with Jose."
916123,26892518,2015-02-21,17521686,Chris,Great experience at Jose's listing. Was exactly what I needed for my work trip in a super convenient location. Definitely booking again for my next work trip to Boston.
916123,27222318,2015-02-28,27603346,Cindy,"Great location, all basics provided, very comfortable bed.  Floors were a bit creaky, could hear the people above me walking around late into the night."

916123,27390420,2015-03-03,5894823,Pamela,"My daughter and I stayed in Jose's apartment for 4 days in late February. From first contact José was incredibly responsive, accommodating, and gracious, making many concessions in order to make our stay as stress free as possible. The apartment was perfect for 2, cosy, comfortable and a perfect location for us. We didn't have a lot of time for sightseeing, and because of this great location we just had to step out of the walkway and cross the street to visit the Old North Church. Being able to hear the church bells ring in the apartment was exciting and heavenly! This apartment is on the freedom trail, steps from where Paul Revere and other patriots are buried, and a few blocks from his house. Anything we needed was within a short (although chilly!) few blocks, and returning to our perfectly warm apartment was like coming home. We're looking forward to staying with him again in October. Thank you José for a memorable experience!"
916123,27861105,2015-03-13,18912718,Tiffany,"We had a great time at José's apartment! It was in a great location, close to everything you need. The apartment was clean and secure. Great value! We would definitely go back."
916123,28602873,2015-03-27,16487331,Ben,Lovely cosy apartment in fantastic location. Perfect for exploring the restaurants and sights in the north end. Warm and stocked with everything you could need for a short break.
916123,28718053,2015-03-29,17573220,Debbie,Jose was the prefect host.  He responded timely to all of my questions.  He provided directions well before our arrival.
916123,28927026,2015-04-01,25395113,Ellen,"My husband and I could not have been more pleased with the location.  As first time travelers to Boston, we found we were able to easily access everything we needed from the apartment.  If we were to return, I would definitely stay there again!  It had everything we needed to sustain our visit."
916123,29281113,2015-04-06,22382087,Emily,"An old historic flat in the historic north end. Jose's instructions were clear and easy, and he was very accommodating!"
916123,30015248,2015-04-16,26111554,Sarah,"The instructions on how to get in were easy to follow, and the apartment was as described.  The entrance to the (lit, safe-feeling) alley where the building entrance is is right across from Old North Church, which is really cool! It is steps from the Freedom Trail, blocks from amazing Italian food, and about a half mile from the nearest T station.  The bathroom could have been a little cleaner, but all in all, a great place to stay.  I would stay there again.  I also highly recommend Theo's Cozy Corner for breakfast, about a block away."
916123,30437570,2015-04-22,21873139,Shannon,"GREAT location surrounded by Italian restaurants and small shops, boutiques. Very clean apartment and a good size. We had one person in the bed and one person on the couch, and it worked out great with enough privacy between the rooms, without being shut off from each other. We had a small issue with finding towels and sheets for the third guest at the beginning, but I contacted Jose and he sent over what we needed within an hour."
916123,30551325,2015-04-24,28308862,John,The listing description was accurate.  The unit was nice and clean.  The location was fantastic!  We could not have been happier and our host was very obliging and helpful.  I would highly recommend this unit!
916123,30799550,2015-04-27,30240289,Juliet,"This was so central, we were walking distance from everything we wanted to do! Jose was very responsive with everything. The only cons were that the floors were creaky and loud and if there are people staying on other floors, you will hear them. It was half the price of a hotel, so a huge plus in my book!"
916123,31001580,2015-04-30,23978360,Kristin,"We very much enjoyed our stay in the Old North. The location was amazing, with historic sites and beautiful streets within walking distance. The listing was accurate, and the rooms even bigger than we expected. Everything was in order as promised."
916123,31124265,2015-05-02,2661077,Christine,"We had a wonderful stay in the North End flat. Loved the accommodations and the neighborhood. The little kitchen was great, bed and linens super comfy, separate sitting area perfect if someone wants to stay up later. Overall, great place and location!"
916123,31285109,2015-05-04,5137627,Michael,The apartment and Jose could not have been better for our needs. Being the north end and it's narrow streets gave the trip character. The apartment suited it's surroundings. The narrow stairs a bit of experience while taking luggage up but that's about it. Would go back in a flash!
916123,31709350,2015-05-09,29887725,Linda,"My husband and I stayed in the Old North Parlor apartment in early May 2015.  The reservation process was quick and easy and Jose responded to us the same day we emailed requesting to stay.  We received information a week in advance regarding accessing the key and entering the apartment.  Everything went well.  The location of this apartment was wonderful, in the North End, easily reached by T stop Haymarket and within walking distance to many sites and attractions.  The apartment was the perfect size for a couple.  When we arrived the cleaning person had not come yet so we went out for a couple hours so the cleaning could be taken care of.  When we returned we know that the cleaner had been there because there were fresh towels and the trash can had been emptied, but unfortunately nothing else was cleaned - the sheets were not changed, the floors were not swept or vacuumed, the bathroom was not cleaned and there was food containers in the fridge.  Contacted Jose who said he would take care of it and have someone there within the hour.  Within an hour someone came to clean the apartment.  Although a somewhat decent job of cleaning was done, a lot was missed and a more thorough cleaning would be a good idea.  We enjoyed our stay in Boston, the apartment is in a great location and made it easy to enjoy all of the sites and attractions."
916123,31841340,2015-05-10,31532049,William,"Served as the perfect spot for our stay in Boston. We were on a brewery tour up to Maine this past weekend and so the location is great to end your night at Cambridge Brewing Co and Lord Hobo(bar), if you have similar interests. Jason was quick to return my phone call when I had a question about parking/location of the apartment. Apartment was very clean and towels were laid out on the bed for us. Air mattresses in the closet in case you don't bring your own and have extra people. Good experience here."
916123,31936087,2015-05-12,10012756,Shea,Great place to stay; right in the city.
No complaints. We had a problem with the AC,"but Jose came over and took care of it very quickly. Highly recommend.\"",,,,
916123,32194794,2015-05-15,19868594,Travers,"Clean and convenient! Exactly as listed, the apartment was very clean and ready for guests. Very comfortable bed too. It is walking distance from a lot of great restaurants and close to transportation."
916123,32323843,2015-05-17,28179274,Nancy,"Jose was very responsive when it came to returning emails, answering questions, etc. prior to our stay and accommodated us when we needed to leave our luggage behind for a few hours before out plane left on check-out day."
916123,32958701,2015-05-24,2565242,Jordyn,"This was such a cozy spot in a great neighborhood. By the end of the week it felt like home! The apartment was clean, spacious, nice. Again, totally obsessed with the neighborhood. I'd 100% recommend this place to stay!"
916123,33651218,2015-05-31,27843729,Serguey,"Jose was very helpful in getting me and my girlfriend set up at his place for a week. We enjoyed the close proximity to the many great restaurants and attractions in the North End. We felt very safe as the alley was well-lit at night. The amenities were great and the window AC unit helped us get through some very hot and humid summer nights. If you are a light sleeper, be wary that you can hear what is going on in the apartment upstairs, as the floorboards creak and the sound insulation is not the best. However, we had no trouble sleeping. Thank you!"
916123,33820531,2015-06-01,2590883,Steven,"Everything was great.  Easy coordination, convenient location, comfy bed.  We will be back!"
916123,34543320,2015-06-09,20289144,Eletha,"Jason made sure we had all the instructions needed to get into the apartment. Check in and check out was very easy. The room was in excellent condition, very clean. The location was close to the old north church and walking distance to many fun things to do in the north end. I would definitely stay here again for my next trip to Boston."
916123,34647646,2015-06-10,4969765,Caitlin,"The location is fantastic, in the heart of the North End and an easy walk to the rest of the city. Checking in and out was a breeze and Jose was able to accommodate us with a late check out and storage for our luggage while we explored the city before our evening departure. Great, comfortable spot for a stay in Boston!"
916123,34728408,2015-06-11,11225063,Chris,"This place was great, the location was amazing and Jose was quick with communication and responding to questions. Everything was perfect. Walking to the water, or the Italian resturants is easy and its right in the middle of the freedom trail. Parking in the area is rough though (lots of residential only or 2 hour guest spots), so we had to use the $20 parking pass for our rental."
"Wish we could have stayed longer!\"",,,,,
916123,35365315,2015-06-18,26977755,Patrick,"The apartment was great! Comfortable place to rest after walking around Boston all day. We had three people so we used the bed, futon, and air mattress that was provided. Location couldn't have been better. Close and short walk to the Aquarium and HayMarket T stations.  Jose was great with directions and info. Thanks!"
916123,35476651,2015-06-19,33359614,Ashley,"This was a GREAT apartment to stay in. The location was ideal and within walking distance of so many restaurants, bars and sights. The host provided clear instructions to obtain the keys. The apartment was clean. The bathroom was very spacious. I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Boston!"
916123,35944864,2015-06-23,8237523,Zsofia,"The apartment was nice, pretty much matching the description. The little alley where it's located is quite dirty, but the area is nice, full of Italian restaurants. The apartment is perfect size for 2 people with a nice comfy bed. We didn't use the kitchen, but the bathroom was absolutely nice. The only problem, is that the walls are very thin, so during the day people were running around on the floor above us and it was really loud. You can pretty much hear all the neighbors. We had sheets, towels, everything was clean. Close to the apartment are shops and many restaurants. I would recommend the place for a few nights to look around Boston."
916123,36177805,2015-06-26,13642197,Andrea,"Awesome location!  Literally, LITERALLY, steps away from the old north church, in little Italy.  You can walk everywhere!  The bed is so incredibly comfortable!  We loved having the place all to ourselves!"
916123,36335096,2015-06-27,36236064,Jessica,"Just as described! Great location, clean apartment, great host!"
916123,36745753,2015-06-30,4273059,Regina,"Perfect location!! It wasn't my first time visiting Boston, but it felt like the first time I really got a feel for it. North End is beautiful, adorable and cozy. You walk out of the house and you're right in the middle of it all - restaurants, bars and cafes are everywhere. The apartment was clean, had everything we needed and Jason was easy to communicate with. Would recommend !"
916123,37001515,2015-07-03,36475686,Julie,This was my first Airbnb rental. It worked out great. I was very happy to stay in this apartment. Jose was attentive and helpful via text. The apartment was cozy and comfortable. I would certainly stay again if I had the opportunity.
916123,37295088,2015-07-06,5501119,Alan,"This place was perfect in every way. It is located on the Freedom Trail right across from the Old North Church. It is in easy walking distance to all the restaurants in Little Italy and if you need to use the subway it is very close to the T. Everything is exactly as pictured and the apartment is very clean. The bed is very comfortable and the bathroom is nice. Jose was very quick to respond and he was a great host. Check in and check out was very smooth because there is a lock box with the keys outside of the apartment. All in all, if you are coming to Boston to site see, this is the place to stay."
916123,37512264,2015-07-07,36653741,Pete,"Had a short and wonderful stay, the location was incredible and the room was exactly what I was looking for."
916123,37764624,2015-07-10,35171145,Eldridge,"Jose made us feel welcome. The North End has a great atmosphere and wonderful eating places--especially Nepture's Oyster Bar and Lo Conte Italian restaurant. Lots of history here, too."
916123,37953509,2015-07-12,1333600,Kathy,Great location.  The apt has character.
916123,38278282,2015-07-14,6474626,Raymond,"Jose's place was in a perfect spot in the north end by a ton of Italian food options. There is no elevator up and stairs are a bit narrow. The pics on airbnb are accurate of the place and the beams on the ceiling gives the place a cool, rustic look. The subway station is about an 8min walk which is not too bad. There was garage parking provided for a fee that was about 1.5 blocks away. Bed sheets were clean but the bed was not the most comfortable. Pretty good place overall for location!"
916123,38894720,2015-07-19,36645031,Mary Beth,"This apartment has the best location. There was a coffee shop steps away, great bakeries, bars and restaurants around the corner, and it was a five minute walk to the train station. We walked around a lot at night. There are all kinds of people out and about, so the neighborhood felt safe. We were there Saturday morning, so we walked right to the farmers market, which was really nice."
The bed is very comfortable. The place is clean,"and the air conditioner works well!  Jose's detailed directions made finding the location and getting the keys very easy and quick. It was a great experience. \"",,,,
916123,39286516,2015-07-22,31998925,Megan,"Jose was very receptive to my questions via email and text. The apartment was clean, cozy, and in the perfect location. We were right across the street from the Old North Church and close to many great North End restaurants.  We could not have asked for a better location, and the apartment and neighborhood had a lot of character. The neighborhood felt safe, and we were comfortable walking around late at night. I highly recommend this apartment were you to stay in Boston. If we return, we hope to stay here again."
916123,39740392,2015-07-26,30782361,Lou,"Very cozy. Great location. Felt like I was Paul Revere after my midnight ride, coming home to a welcoming bed and shower. Would definitely bring my wife next time (and not on a business trip), stay longer and see the many sights in a great neighborhood."
916123,40208010,2015-07-29,8130598,Liesel,Great Neighborhood.  We enjoyed our stay.
916123,40391426,2015-07-30,8881895,Lorie & Greg,Ideal location. We were right in the thick of the North End near tons of restaurants and bakeries. The place had almost everything we needed minus a counter surface in the kitchen or a place to eat. We ordered a pizza and had a hard time finding a place to set the box down much less a plate. It's a third floor walk up - a little challenging with a baby stroller and what not. But I would defintely reccommend this place for childless folks eating out - perfect!
916123,40521197,2015-07-31,1339613,Matt,"The flat was in a perfect location.  Very close to all of the historic sites in the North End, in the heart of Little Italy.  The apartment was as advertised - cozy, comfortable and in good shape.  Jose was very responsive and accommodating.  I would stay there again."
916123,40694364,2015-08-01,39866547,Kristin,"Four days later, we are still talking about what a wonderful experience we had. The host was excellent and clear with his communication.  We were in a beautiful spot in the North End and definitely one of the best spots in Boston. The flat was adorable. It was a 90 degree day in Boston, and when we arrived the air conditioning was on for us which was a nice touch. The building is steps from the Old North Church and you can feel the history in the neighborhood. We were lucky enough to be there during a feast which makes the North End even more exciting than usual. I would highly recommend staying here and hope to get the chance to stay again."
916123,40829577,2015-08-02,22680098,Tom,"Jose had the apartment in excellent shape for our arrival, and we really enjoyed the original brickwork and timbers that made for a unique experience."
And while it's not really geared for cooking and dining (even though there is sufficient equipment for it) that is not a drawback at all.  The location is incredible,with over 20 restaurants (and a small convenience store) located less than 1000 feet from the apartment.,,,,
We very much enjoyed our stay,"and would highly recommend others to do the same.\"",,,,
916123,41239482,2015-08-05,7504787,Joseph,Great location. Close to lots of great restaurants in Little Italy. The apartment was comfortable and spacious. No problems checking in or out. The host took care of that.
916123,41420399,2015-08-07,37642392,Ann,"Great place. Accomdating hosts. Had a host of travel issues from CA that they were reasonable in accomdating. Clean place, great neighborhood, a bit of a jaunt to the T. Overall great experience."
916123,42510558,2015-08-14,28825577,Raffaella,My husband and I spent 3 wonderful days in Jose's apartment.
The location,North End,is a beautiful and safe area,in which you can find all services: restaurants,coffee bar,pub
Check in and check out procedures have been perfect: easy,"fast and safe. Jose has been a smart host: he gave us very punctual information and he's been fast in responding to our needs!\"",,,,
916123,43765416,2015-08-22,18159559,Lindsay,"We really enjoyed our stay in the North end. The location was excellent and the neighbourhood was very safe, full of amazing places to eat and had some of the historical freedom trial sites."
The apartment itself was as advertised with a large bedroom and small but adequate living room and kitchen. It could have been a little cleaner but was fine.,,,,,
The apartment is tucked down a side street so there is little outside noise despite being in the heart of the North end. However,"there was a lot of noise from the apartment above (not antisocial just loud children and family) so I would definitely recommend earplugs! Even with them it was noisy. But overall a great experience.\"",,,,
916123,44029551,2015-08-23,41068361,Chelsey,"We had such a great experience staying here! The flat was just as pictured, the location couldn't be better, and Jose was kind enough to accommodate some changes to our check out time with no issues. I would highly recommend this flat if you're looking for a place to stay in Boston!"
916123,44449911,2015-08-26,39765175,Justin,Jason's place was amazing!  Jason made everything very easy for us and was very accommodating.  His place was in an excellent location right on the Freedom Trail and next to the famous Italian neighborhood in North End.  Couldn't have found a better place!
916123,45369023,2015-09-02,17131827,Ed,"Flat was cozy and had nice red brick walls. Getting keys to flat was easy. Flat was beside historic sites, great restaurants and the promenande. We enjoyed our stay."
916123,45668504,2015-09-05,7599776,Mette,"Quaint, clean and very central. We enjoyed the apartment and will be happy to come back at a future date."
916123,45989947,2015-09-07,19242679,Natalie,"We had a great time in Boston! Jason's place was perfect for our short trip.  The North End was a great location, so many great restaurants and history.  Jason was easy to work with and provided everything we needed.  The parking spot, which cost extra, was also great because parking was definitely limited in the area to North End Residents with permits, so I would recommend paying the extra $$ to get that to avoid parking frustrations."
"\"",,,,,
916123,46856109,2015-09-14,22356006,Jessica,"I had a wonderful time staying at Jose's place. Everything was as described and a perfect location , within easy walking distance of downtown. I highly recommend Bova's at the end of the street. The apartment is neat and AC was appreciated in very hot weather. Thank you for a wonderful first airbnb experience,"
916123,47245477,2015-09-17,34309501,Mary,"It was GREAT! Old North Church is just 1/4 block away! The Freedom Trail is just across the street! I give the accommodations a charm factor 10! Beam ceilings, some real old brick walls, fireplaces in bedroom and living room, creaky charter-rich wood floors. The place must be nearly as old as Paul Revere's home! Amenities clean, modern, nice and neighborhood peacefully quiet. Great bed, lovely warm but lightweight comforter. Couldn't be happier."
"We had confusion about location and didn't get that \"\"2\"\" was on first door","lock box was \"\"3\"\" and then keys got you in first through door number \"\"2\"\" and then door number \"\"3\"\" on second door (up 2 flights of stairs).  Figuring it out was a fun adventure. We could have texted Jason (he was quick and thorough with pre-trip text/email responses) but we had fun sorting it out on our own.)",,,,
My only caveat: Be ready for stairs! Otherwise,cool flat,and location proximity to restaurants,history,and Haymarket subway entrance was great. Thanks,Jason!
"\"",,,,,
916123,47460768,2015-09-19,15817989,Wendy,Jason answered my emails and phone call promptly. The location was terrific but some neighbors were noisy. Comfortable apartment.
916123,47720368,2015-09-21,1439773,Sharon,"Jason was always quick and professional with responding to my questions. The apartment was exactly as advertised. It was perfectly clean, well-appointed and felt very spacious. The bed was comfortable and the towels were very soft! Free wifi worked great without issue. The location was fantastic for exploring the North End and the rest of Boston."
916123,48266837,2015-09-25,17791502,Doug,"This apartment is in a great location in the North End.  Literally, it is steps away form the Old North Church.  The apartment is small but has a nice size bedroom and bathroom.  It has a kitchen but there is no  counter space so any cooking would be difficult.  Luckily, there are so many restaurants and bakeries in the area it is not an issue.  You do climb two flights of stairs to get to the apartment so if that is an issue be aware.  The entry to the building is down a narrow alley way but it was well lit at night and it seems like a very safe neighborhood."
916123,48389743,2015-09-26,32162329,Kristen,Quaint little flat in North End.  Enjoyed our stay even though it was short.  You just cant beat this location.  You are in the middle of everything but it is quiet at same time.  Jose was very helpful and accomodating of our schedule as well.  Thanks!
916123,48859048,2015-09-29,28134029,Lynda,"Fantastic location right on the freedom trail. Never met Jose but he was very helpful with instructions on getting to the apartment and also with parking. The apartment is very roomy, with a comfy bed, though has minimum kitchen utensils."
916123,49125434,2015-10-01,24774578,Gail,"\"This BnB was very \"\"old world\"\" and gorgeous"
916123,49440146,2015-10-04,17987366,Sandy,"Great location in the North End with lots of Italian restaurants nearby. We were easily able to see Boston with this as our home base by walking or taking the subway which was about 5 min away. As other reviewers have said, it is very noisy as we could hear people talking next to/below us and people walking around above us. Parking was expensive but that was expected. Apartment was small, fairly clean, and served its purpose. Also, Jose responded quickly to our questions via text."
916123,49872106,2015-10-07,12982629,Irmani,"Lovely apartment, very centrally located and comfortable. Huge bedroom. The kitchen is small and with no counter space, not that practical, but you are steps away from amazing dining options. Great communication with host, too."
916123,50024758,2015-10-08,6572666,Pat,Great location. Would return again when in Boston.
916123,50181246,2015-10-10,14634022,Jane,"My first airbnb experience, we had a great time. Jose communicated from the very beginning and everything went smoothly. The apartment was in a great location, steps from the freedom trail and restaurants galore! Thanks Jose"
916123,50615104,2015-10-13,7724614,Lee Ann,"The description was accurate.   The North End location was convenient, and it was in a quieter area than some, and  We appreciated that.  It was adequate space for 2 people.   The stairs are steep and narrow so people should take that into account if they might have difficulty with them."
916123,50938812,2015-10-16,43680033,Brendan,"Great location!!!!! I could not have asked better for my first experience with an Airbnb. Jose was quick to respond to emails and made everything super easy. I will definitely be staying here when I come back to visit Boston. The price is right and the location is what makes the stay so enjoyable. You basically have an apartment to yourself. Jose does not stay with you, so you have the whole place to yourself or the guest you brought with. It was more than enough space considering Hotels would not have the same amenities. Plus id be spending 3x the amount I paid. You can walk into downtown Boston within minutes. literally minutes. maybe 5-10min if you get distracted looking at all the great shops along the way. The apartment was clean and the bed was comfortable. Small kitchen but who comes to actually cook? I came for all the seafood! Besides, you have a kitchen if you need one. Couch and TV as well. But all those things were more than I needed."
Thanks Jose!!!,,,,,
I WILL BE BACK!!!,,,,,

916123,51531896,2015-10-21,37933830,Tina,"Jason was quick to respond to all emails and made the check in process very simple.  The location was just what we were looking for, convenient for walking to anything you might need.  The bed was very comfy.  We had a great time and would love to stay again!"
916123,51613345,2015-10-22,6715416,Carol,The location of this B&B was great!  It's in north Boston and within walking distance of lots of restaurants and shopping.
916123,51758536,2015-10-24,9133449,Serenity,"Great apartment, perfectly located. The check in/out process was super convenient. The floors are creaky so you'll definitely hear the people around you, but it's no big deal. Unless your a really like sleeper."
916123,51945391,2015-10-25,29047510,Stephanie,"Wonderful, authentic residence right on the middle of it all! Small local shops along with the Old Church & lots more!!!  Very snug & warm. Clean."
916123,52069506,2015-10-26,43000731,Rebecca,"The neighborhood is just perfect, the apartment was nice and clean, and the restaurants in the location are amazing!!"
916123,52821326,2015-11-02,33638605,Clare,"The listing was pretty much as described and was in an excellent location in the North End part of Boston, which is close to lots of lovely places to eat and see nearby.  I never met the host, but he was very quick to respond and give details of the lockbox which worked out well.   I agree with some previous reviews that you can hear some neighbours, but again, this isn't too bad and if you're a light sleeper, take some ear plugs. There wasn't much kitchen equipment etc, but that was not a problem as we were out alot anyway. We loved staying in Boston and would come back to this place like a shot!"
916123,53056130,2015-11-04,2548295,Jeremy,"Great location almost right across the street from the North Church! It was surprisingly quiet being right in the middle of the North End in Boston. We had a little trouble finding the place, but the Jose/Jason was quick to respond and provide us assistance. Would definitely stay there again!"
916123,53131590,2015-11-05,26446640,Gina,Loved it here!
916123,53609628,2015-11-10,8452475,Renee,"We had a lovely stay in this little apartment! Great location, very clean, and no problems communicating with Jose! We really enjoyed the nearby Italian bakeries."
We did have some trouble finding the place initially as the address shows up on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Maps as slightly farther up the street than it actually is.,,,,,
Also,this wasn't a problem for us,but if you are planning on cooking,you may find the kitchen lacking. There is no counter space at all and also no table to substitute for a counter and/or eat at.,,
"Thanks Jose!\"",,,,,
916123,53817209,2015-11-13,12086527,Michael,Communication was prompt and useful. Property very well furnished and in great location. All went smoothly.

916123,54816212,2015-11-23,7354595,Shannon,Great location in the North end.  Apartment is clean and well laid out.  Very nice experience!
916123,55688590,2015-12-04,49821014,Vlad,"Everything was as described, great spot in a nice neighborhood. Apartment was clean and larger than i expected. Great overall experience! Jose was very responsive and answered any questions i had quickly and fully. I needed to check in earlier than the usual time and he was very accommodating."
916123,56735518,2015-12-17,24496793,Anna,The house  was as described and we really enjoyed our stay. It did not appear to have been cleaned in between our visit and the last persons. The bed was nice and the sheets were new but the shower definitely needed to be cleaned.
916123,58535994,2016-01-03,46805043,Shannon,Great location which was probably my favorite part! I would stay here again :)
916123,59331571,2016-01-09,47776205,Minh,It was private and safe. There were enough spare blankets for a third person.
916123,59596982,2016-01-12,3928371,Jesse,"The location is prime and is literally a few yards away from the Old North Church! The apartment has all the necessities and Jose is a responsive host. One issue we had was the apartment was not clean when we arrived. Overall, it was a pleasant stay!"
916123,60186488,2016-01-19,36063070,Ed,"Small but comfortable apartment in fantastic location.  Communication was prompt and clear.  Bathroom had not been cleaned but towels and linens were fresh.  Bed and pillows very comfortable, and it was quiet during our stay."

916123,62635273,2016-02-15,17462465,Marc,"Great stay I had at Jose's flat. Very well located in the Italian village, on the freedom trail. Nice and comfortable location. Appreciable flexibility regarding the check out."
916123,62680066,2016-02-15,2051532,Kirk,Jose was fast to respond and really helpful.  The apartment was located perfectly in the North End and set up very nicely.  I will definitely look at Jose's places next time I'm in Boston.
916123,63050312,2016-02-19,17462465,Marc,"So far it was nice and convinient, I staid one more night when I come back to Boston. As mentioned in previous comment, nice, comfortable and well located on the freedomtrail. To be recommended."
916123,63566441,2016-02-24,52123718,Daniel,"Fantastic experience from start to finish. This was my first time using Airbnb and Jason was helpful and responsive throughout. The flat was clean and warm when I arrived (much appreciated as it was a cold night) and in a great location, right on the Freedom Trail. Jason also allowed me to check out late as I had an evening flight. Would definitely recommend this listing to others and would happily stay here again."
916123,63682947,2016-02-25,46711601,Frank,Great host.  Easy communication.  Fantastic location.  Highly recommended.
916123,64631084,2016-03-06,27648833,Zarah,Space was just as described and pictured.  Only negative thing was the walls were very thin and I could hear everyone above and below me quite clearly.
916123,64735281,2016-03-06,21216129,Molly,"An awesome listing, perfect for a weekend getaway!"
916123,65035289,2016-03-10,12970494,Sabrina,Quartier agréable. Hôte disponible.
916123,66442114,2016-03-22,1879029,Trish,"This is literally steps from the Old North Church, part of the Freedom Trail.  The Location could not be better.  Right in the heart of the North End but not on a noisy street.  Our host was wonderful with communication - clear instructions for check in and easy to get hold of with questions.  Small apartment with separate bedroom and living area.  Clean and comfortable."
Only caveat is that the floors squeak and the walls are somewhat thin.  Could hear the neighbors coming and going.  This was in no way a problem,but if you are dedicated to quiet space,maybe you keep looking.,,,
"I would DEFINITELY book again if (when?) I return to Boston.\"",,,,,
916123,67128946,2016-03-27,48694742,Jordan,"We loved our stay at this airbnb! It was a perfect location; walking distance to so many wonderful sites, and restaurants. It worked out really well to have a couple we went with be able to stay in the airbnb right below us. We didn't have anyone staying above us, we only noticed a couple staying there our last night because we could hear them talking and walking around. It wasn't a terrible inconvenience because we were hardly there but to sleep and shower. Needless to say we would gladly stay there again!"
916123,67948223,2016-04-01,19300336,Phil,"Great little place, right in the middle of north end, surrounded by loads of places to eat and on the freedom trail."
916123,68151419,2016-04-02,1283691,Phil,Cozy apartment in an amazing location! Everything was nice and clean and Jose was helpful and accommodating.
916123,68636669,2016-04-05,60291478,Renaud,Amazing location
916123,69106378,2016-04-09,61395346,Stacey,"Host quickly responded to all of our emails.  My husband and I LOVED staying here.  Enough room for the both of us with kitchen, living room, and bedroom.  Shower was hot and the pressure was great!  Amazing location to the North End restaurants and church.  Highly recommend, would stay here again!"
916123,70185523,2016-04-16,21113754,Michael,"Jose's apartment was as advertised. The apartment was clean, the location is great, and the bed is comfortable. Just make sure you pack earplugs for the night -- the building is older (as is standard in the North End), so you could hear neighbors talking and walking around which may disrupt sleep. Overall a great value."
916123,70753605,2016-04-20,9616547,Laura,"Jose was a wonderful host! This was only my second time using airbnb, so I had many questions, and he was always very prompt and helpful in his responses. The flat itself was a very good size for the cost, and included all of the amenities we needed; coffee maker, hair dryer, fridge, microwave, etc. The instructions and key lock-boxes were easy to follow and we felt right at home in the flat once we arrived. The location was wonderful - walking distance to the freedom trail, Back Bay shops, The Garden, great harbor walk area, and of course the food in the North End was amazing. Jose also allowed us to have a late check-out so we didn't have to cart our luggage around for hours before our flight departed. The only reason I gave 4 starts instead of 5 was because of the noise… the guests in the upstairs apartment were very loud and we could hear nearly every word of their late-night and early morning conversations, every step they took and each time they barreled down the stairs, slammed the lock-box closed, etc. There was also a significant amount of 2am, wandering-home-from-the-bars noise from the streets each night that kept us up for a couple hours here and there. No fault to Jose or the flat itself, and we just downloaded a white-noise app on our phone to drown out the sounds. We were there for the marathon, so a solid nights' sleep would have been nice… if you are a light sleeper or are traveling for something that requires a restful sleep, I would pack earlplugs :)"
But,other than that,it was a great,"cozy place to stay and we would stay there again when we come back to Boston!\"",,
916123,71186847,2016-04-24,58255863,Brittany,The apartment was exactly like the picture. It was great and Jason was such a great host to have and help us out.
916123,71743181,2016-04-28,63977474,Haysha,"Wonderful location! Walking distance to almost everything you can think of! Apartment was nice; the bed was very comfy, the water pressure and temp. were great which is what really mattered for our stay :) Jose answered all of our questions promptly; the only trouble we had was with the paper thin walls, you could hear the people upstairs as if they were in the next room. Overall, we had a great stay in Boston."
916123,71853231,2016-04-29,29809590,Aj,The place was just as described.  Getting into the apartment and locking up was very easy and hassle free.  Would definitely stay again.
916123,72087303,2016-05-01,34524826,Sarah,"We enjoyed our stay immensely. The apartment was cozy, clean, and in the best neighborhood in the City. Jose was responsive and the directions to get the hey we're easy to follow. We would love to come back!"
916123,72796951,2016-05-04,49021199,Isaac,"Great location and very clean. It was a little creaky and the walls were a bit thin, but overall a good experience"
916123,73273168,2016-05-07,54404934,Dianne,"Great location in the historical Italian area with easy access to coffee shops and eating places, Freedom Trail and Metro. Unit is spacious with 6 windows and good aircon. Up 2nd flight of narrow stairs and noise from above floorboards is what is expected and accepted from places in the area. Jason was helpful when I sent him a query on msg and I can recommend staying here."
916123,74376586,2016-05-15,2195039,Angela,"Jose provided good clear directions to locate and access the apartment. He was easy to reach and accommodating when we required a late check out and a place to store our bags due to a late flight back. The apartment was clean and had everything we required. It was on the 3rd level with no lift and neighbours can be heard through the walls/floors. Neither of these were a problem for us but we thought it was worth mentioning as it may be an issue for others. The location is amazing and is within walking distance of lots of restaurants, T stations and attractions. It was also only about $20 in a cab from the airport. Would definitely have no problems staying here in the future."
916123,74930973,2016-05-17,68737045,Catriona,Good apartment- perfect for a couple of nights stay in Boston. Good location and good proximity to all the sights in a lovely city. Jose responded quickly to any messages.
916123,75046244,2016-05-18,6737750,Atosa,"The place was in a great location, walking distance to pretty much everything in the North End, lots of restaurants right next the apartment since its pretty much in Little Italy."
The place was  clean upon arrival and Jose was quick to respond to any questions we had. The area also felt very safe. Only complaint would be how much you can hear the upstairs neighbors as they walked around,not that big of a deal though since we were in the apartment very minimally as were the people above us.,,,,
"The place was also a perfect size for two people. \"",,,,,
916123,75325794,2016-05-20,798558,Kristen,"This place is all about location- it's insane how well positioned this place is in the North End. After the location, the second best thing is the comfortable bed."
Like any old building,you should expect to be able to hear your neighbors from time time. This wasn't a major issue during my stay,but if you require complete quiet,you may want a more traditional hotel.  This felt similar to European Airbnb's I've stayed in.,,
"Beware that the food in the immediate vicinity will cause you to put on weight because it's so good. \"",,,,,
916123,75575834,2016-05-22,61095636,Matthew,We loved the apartment in the North End.  Jose was available to answer any questions we had.
This is a perfect spot for short trip to Boston. The apartment contains everything 1-2 people would need for a stay. The location is in a great neighborhood.  Two block walk from Hanover street and a 10 minute walk to the Quincy Market / Gov't Center area where you can access any part of Boston via the T.  Also,"we had no problem hailing a taxi or Uber from this neighborhood.\"",,,,
916123,76306320,2016-05-26,29655633,Allison,"What a perfect location -- we walked everywhere! The apt suited us perfectly: charming, clean, comfortable. And Jose was so responsive and accommodating. Thank you!"
916123,76527504,2016-05-28,73367300,Crystal,Great location! Clean Apartment with minimal amenities- perfect for 2 people looking for a place to sleep in the heart of the North End! Walking distance to everything! Paul Revere's house is footsteps away! (So cool!) The shower is great and the apartment was very clean! The hosts are very responsive and answered all of my questions. Be aware that if there are tenants above you can hear them - it can be loud. For us the noise didn't not last long at all. It is what it is -I still got a great nights sleep and I would recommend and stay at this location!
916123,77178446,2016-05-30,29190721,Katie,"Beautiful place, great location, and everything was as is in the photos! Very good at communicating directions/access. Worth every penny!"
"Thank you for a great first stay in Boston!\"",,,,,
916123,77821505,2016-06-03,57420791,Danna,Had a really nice time here. It was close to a lot of restaurants in North End and right in the middle of the freedom trail. The apartment was clean and cozy and the instructions were very straight forward. Thin walls but hardly bothersome. Would stay here again.
916123,78434598,2016-06-06,62035051,Elisse,"The location is perfect - right in the heart of the north end. The place, although small, was good for our weekend away.  The only downside is that the stairs and floors upstairs are a bit noisy."
916123,78715545,2016-06-08,48881948,Demi,My mom and me had a great time! The location was perfect right in the North End/Little Italy. I've been to Boston twice before and this area is one of my favorites! Jose was extremely accommodating to us. Letting us leave are luggage until our apartment was ready and again when we had time to kill before our flight and didn't want to carry out stuff.
916123,79468946,2016-06-12,17074609,Ileana,"Jose's place was great. The location could not be better - the apartment is only a block and a half away from the Old North Church on the North End and right on the Freedom Trail. The Haymarket T stop was only a few mins walking so it made transportation to other areas of town very easy. The only negative comment is the apartment and building are fairly old so being on the 3rd floor we could hear everything the upstairs neighbor was doing (walking, talking, moving furniture, etc). If you are a light sleeper, take this into consideration because it can get quite loud. Otherwise, we could not have asked for a better stay. We will definitely come back!"
916123,80092586,2016-06-16,9245606,Kasra,"Although we never met up with Jose or Jason, their apartment was very central.  Their instructions for directions and gaining access to the unit were clear and accurate."
916123,81306575,2016-06-22,77994314,Alejandro,The place was great and a perfect location!

916123,82875290,2016-06-30,78663696,Tayfun,Jason was very nice and replied in a very short time in a short notice.
916123,85929748,2016-07-14,17826997,Maxime,I had a wonderful 2 weeks in Boston. The apartment is comfortable and well located. There is no washing machine but a laundromat is 40meters away. Everything was perfectly clean when I arrived and a cleaner came after one week.
The apartment is in the oldest and nicest neighborhood of the city. You'll have the chance to enjoy American/Italian food at every corner.,,,,,
"Thank you Jose/Jason.\"",,,,,
916123,86232256,2016-07-15,1488094,Aubriane,"I very much enjoyed my stay at this place. The check-in process was easy, the apartment was more spacious than I expected, and the bed/bedding was super comfy. The location was perfect for casual exploring and good Italian eating during the day (Mike's Pastry in walking distance!). I noticed some other reviews mentioned noise issues, but I didn't have any problem with that and found it very quiet. I would definitely stay here again if/when I find myself back in Boston."
916123,88303754,2016-07-24,15482826,Christian,"I spent one week in Jason's nice apartment. The apartment is perfectly located in the heart of North End with lots of inviting (mainly Italian) restaurants close by. The Long Wharf, Whole Foods and the CambridgeSide mall are in walking distance of 30 minutes max. All information about the apartment was accurate. During my stay, I experienced the apartment as very quite and enjoyed the comfortable bed. The price-value ratio is very good. The only downside is that if you are a passionate cook, take into account that the place misses out on a few essential items such as pan lids, a salad bowl or a colander. Jason was very helpful and responded in general quickly to messages with clear instructions and solutions."
916123,88853467,2016-07-25,20663879,Charlotte,Our stay at the Old North Parlor Flat was wonderful.  The location was perfect for a first time visitor to Boston.  The Flat was located on the Freedom Trail and it made it so easy to see the historical sites of Boston.  The description of the flat was 100% accurate and perfect for our stay.  Jose/Jason's communication with us was always timely and helpful.  We had a slight problem in getting to Boston and Jose/Jason went out of his way to help us.  His communication with us was always very quick.
"We loved the living history that this flat provided.  I can highly recommend this flat and our host to anyone looking for a wonderful place to stay in Boston.  The location was close to the public transportation and walking areas of Boston.  We were steps away from wonderful restaurants and fabulous bakeries.    We had the best breakfast at the little restaurant around the corner from the flat and the Italian food in this area was the best I have had.\"",,,,,
916123,89431276,2016-07-28,29294531,Joe,Jason/Jose provided everything we needed. Wonderful communication and no surprises! This apartment couldn't have been in a better location in North End Boston. I would love to stay here again and would suggest to friends.
916123,90349937,2016-07-31,31919730,Priscilla,"This apartment is in an amazing location that really made all the difference for our trip. We loved stepping outside the building door and immediately being near so many restaurants and sites.  It was a very easy uber ride to the airport.

916123,96608980,2016-08-23,526703,Angela And David,"If you are interested in reliving your days as a struggling young adult, this is the place for you – stained tub, moldy grout, uneven floors with nails sticking out, broken blinds, and a baseboard heater falling off the wall that is full of dust. This place needs a very deep cleaning and home repairs. We definitely did not want to spend any time in this dark space other than to sleep."

And,no,we do not have high expectations,as we live in a 1908 building in the 3rd largest US city with a 1950s kitchen and bath. We understand and appreciate vintage. We enjoy camping and regularly stay in non-traditional accommodations throughout the world. This space is definitely on my list of,“what the...?!”,
The positives: The location was wonderful – on the Freedom Trail and in the North End. Jose/Jason was quick to respond and accommodated a late check-out.,,,,,

Even the bathroom is a sight to behold. As a host, she is very warm and welcoming and she definitely makes you feel comfortable and at home. If you value privacy, this is a perfect setting and if you would like enjoyable conversation with your host, this is also perfect. The neighborhood is wonderful, with resplendent houses and beautiful trees. And it's short walk to the train and an even shorter walk to Jamaica Plain's vibrant Centre Street, with many good restaurants and cafes. If you'd like to stay in JP, this is definitely the place to be."
8923817,68381487,2016-04-04,9840252,Marni,"Everyone super friendly. Wonderful space with architectural details and lots of art. Amazingly convenient to what we had planned. Center street, a block away, has great restaurants, cafes, hip stores and galleries. We'll definitely be back!"
8923817,70607636,2016-04-18,232712,Mike,Jil was very accommodating as our initial room was taken...Jil was there to give us the tour and everything was as we expected.  The location in Jamaica Plain was terrific with an easy walk to a great coffee spot - Cafe Nero.  It was also an easy walk to Jamaica Pond and a pleasant 1.5 mile walk about the pond.  Would certainly recommend Jil and this location to any of our friends.
8923817,73114918,2016-05-07,27494113,Sierra,"\"I rented this room for my parents' visit to meet my newborn baby.  They are 70 and one of the key reasons I rented in Jil's house was its listing as an \"\"entire place/ apartment.\"\"  In fact"
The listing also indicates that there is free parking on the premises.  In fact,there is no off-street parking and there were a number of nights where we could not find parking on Jil's street.,,,,
Aside from these inaccuracies,Jil is a gracious host,"her house is gorgeous and is located in one of the nicest neighborhoods in Jamaica Plain.  My parents definitely enjoyed their stay.  \"",,,

I stayed here for two weeks whilst travelling for work and the office is in downtown Boston which was only a 10 minute walk away. There are also lots of restaurants, convenience stores and a Wholefoods very near by which came in handy for nights when i didn't go out for food etc."

Elle s'est inquiétée au cours du séjour de savoir comment ça allait et si d'une façon ou d'une autre elle pouvait faire quelque chose pour moi. Elle m'a laissée avec plaisir rester quelques heures de plus le jour de mon départ, puisque cela lui était possible ce jour là."
Le quartier de Beacon Hill est vraiment adorable,propre et calme. La situation est incroyable avec le parc du Boston Common a trois minutes à pied. Le waterfront est tout proche,les magasins,les arrêts de métro,tout est très facilement accessible.,
Le logement correspond exactement aux photos. Il est très soigné et remarquablement propre. Il y a,à notre disposition,un petit bureau et une grande armoire. Le lit est confortable,la cuisine est fonctionnelle et propre,"le réfrigérateur est grand (à noter que cela vaut la peine de se munir de bouchons pour les oreilles pour dormir si vous êtes sensibles car le frigo fait un petit bruit continu).

Safe, clean, comfortable and practical for a single traveler. Friendly, quick response to some initial questions I had. Furthermore, the the location invites you to easily explore the beautiful architecture of Beacon Hill area."

They seemed very eager to make sure that everything was just right for us. The apartment itself is beautiful, and the location is perfect - right in the heart of Boston's historic Beacon Hill neighborhood, a short walk from downtown but quite lovely, quiet, and private. The private roof deck really sealed the deal - it's gorgeous."
9857049,60973937,2016-01-30,6559267,Bekkie,"The experience was super easy. No keys so no human interaction which sort of missed out on the air bnb community vibe but still no complaints. The place itself was really clean, beautiful location, quirky and exactly what I needed for a hassle free trip. Would definitely stay again."

The key pad entry was easy to use and the accommodations were just like the listing.  We had such a great time and really enjoyed our stay!"
9857049,75371271,2016-05-21,20658311,Mike,The location was great. Each morning I would walk to charles st for coffee and newspaper. Beacon hill is hard to beat.
I wish the hosts would have provided coffee service in the unit like many of my previous hosts have done. I think having a washer/dryer is senseless without a pod or two of detergent. For those like me who is only staying a few days I don't want to buy detergent which I will end up leaving in unit.,,,,,
The bed was great although the pillows could have been nicer. Lastly the soap,shampoo was awful,worse than what you'd find in a comfort inn.,,,
"I likely would stay a block away at the Beacon Hill Hotel next time for those reasons listed above. \"",,,,,
9857049,77809201,2016-06-03,71107143,Lori,I would highly recommend this location for anyone staying in the Boston area for work or pleasure. The whole apt was absolutely amazing! The staff made me feel incredibly welcome and even stored my luggage for me when I needed it.

9857049,85511244,2016-07-11,23485992,Gary&Barbara,Wonderful one bedroom apartment in Beacon Hill.  Nicely appointed with furniture and art.  Denon Stereo with built in ceiling speakers made watching tennis like being there. We felt ensconced and a part of Boston for a few days.  Our host was completely accommodating as we arrived with big luggage before check in and they were able to hold it for us until check in.  This apartment is on the third floor to get to the bedroom so you have to carry luggage upstairs would be my only concern in recommending to others.

You know it's kind of cold days cause the rainy day...but host sent the pajama to her"
7725279,53431411,2015-11-08,29982839,Glen,"Dimitry was very welcoming and communication was perfect. Room is simple, clean and comfortable. House has all the facilities you need and is safe and secure. Neighborhood is fine and transport to downtown is easy"

7725279,55646459,2015-12-03,28532578,Albert,"As always (my third time visit to Dimitri's hosted Airbnb) is was a pleasure. The home is comforting quiet and a great location). The other guests and longterm tenants are never felt. There is tranquility and the shared bathroom is always available. The commute to my job at AMAZON STOUGHTON is a breeze at 45mins. In addition there are plenty of food options on the commercial strip on Bluehill ave. The community is safe, i come home from work at 230-300 am most nights. The bed despite being a twin is very comfortable adequate space in room with plenty of heat and a closet two dressers and a huge window."
Highly recommend this place if u need to have Boston access. Bus lines and train very efficient and run late into night.,,,,,
Cant wait to visit in future. Six stars on my behalf. Thank you for reading my review and Dimitri thanks for hosting you are a true Gem in the Airbnb community.,,,,,

Walking distance access to restaurants, stores. Last but not least, DIMITRY is a very helpful host that is one text message, one phone call away to help. I recommend his house and I look forward to staying at this Dimitry's house again , next time I travel to Boston, Massachusetts."

He offered a ride from the airport for $20, which was well worth it because he showed me where the bus stops and train stations were in the neighborhood.

7725279,69556826,2016-04-11,37938604,Elizabeth,Thank you for my lovely welcome and experience.
The house is accurately described as half an hour from the centre of Boston by a train which runs once an hour outside of peak times. It was extremely easy to use and access. Despite being outside the area,it was an easy and affordable base for my short stay. The area,whilst not the best,is okay with a few shops and amenities near the station (Morton Street).,,
Communication was good at all times with entry and WiFi passwords being communicated efficiently and in a timely manner.,,,,,
The room does not have a proper light which was interesting on discovery but there is a lamp that is very effective. The place is shared with other AirBnB customers to my knowledge and I didn't meet any of them as I try to keep to myself when I'm travelling.,,,,,
"Overall I had a very nice stay here and would recommend it.\"",,,,,
7725279,70668394,2016-04-19,61697735,Christian,"Great place, and I enjoyed my stay. Little far from Boston than I wanted, but everything was fine!"
7725279,72331256,2016-05-02,66878269,Troy,This was my first Airbnb experience and I had no idea what to expect. I'm glad it was this place because it was exactly what I was hoping it would be.
I'm not one to enjoy the amenities of a hotel. Those kinds of things are lost on me. I didn't spend time making meals in the kitchen (similar to when I don't dine at the hotel restaurant) or have a long TV watching session (similar to how I don't lounge by the pool at a resort).,,,,,
I was given a great clean,safe,and comfortable room in a quiet area of town. It was located quite close to the Boston Subway's Red Line and not far from a major traffic artery. It was central enough to be convenient without the chaos and noise that accompanies it.,,,
"Frederique was even accommodating of my late arrival and that was something I appreciated. I can't say enough good things about this listing. I recommend it to anyone!\"",,,,,

7725279,91807881,2016-08-06,60292763,Eric,"I stayed at this place for around 11 weeks. Frederique provided me with everything I needed for my stay. He was very accessible despite not living in the same house. The bed is comfortable. The bathroom is clean with a warm shower + good water pressure. The neighborhood is great, quiet, and is very close to a couple bus stops."
The best part about the room is the price. It's far cheaper than many other rooms in the area,despite being just as comfortable. If I ever have to return to Boston,"Frederique's place will definitely be on the top of my list.\"",,,
7725279,94375962,2016-08-15,10054035,Rouzier,J'ai beaucoup apprécié mon séjour dans cette chambre. La description correspondait à la réalité. Le quartier est paisible et des restaurants se trouvent à proximité de l'appartement. Il a été très facile de se garer dans les rues avoisinantes. Il est aussi facile de se rendre à Boston en utilisant les stationnements  (7$) près des stations de métro.
La chambre était confortable,mais en période de chaleur un climatiseur ne sera pas de trop.,,,,

Went to the restaurant for dinner, and it was cute, quaint and very filling, in true American style :-)"
Location is near the airport but if you have a suitcase,it is best to call a cab. A number of companies work 247 and there is no need to book. there is a standard fare of $6 in East Boston so it only costs $8 incl tip.,,,,
The metro line to downtown is 7-10 min walk so it is easy to get into town during the day.,,,,,

543078,51185630,2015-10-18,43174889,Tiffany,"This was a great location and the living area, bedrooms and bathrooms were all much bigger than I anticipated.  We had plenty of room for the four of us with modern amenities, and yet the exposed brickwall gave it a sense of history, too.  The location was perfect and was within walking to distance or a short cab/uber ride to everything we wanted to do in Boston.  The keyless entry made entry and exit super simple!  The management office is right around the corner and was willing to store our luggage for us before our check in time so that we could see the city without wasting any time.  The management was very friendly and accommodating.  I would certainly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the Back Bay area of Boston."
543078,52979317,2015-11-03,42521823,Andy,Seamless have been excellent hosts and were very helpful in finding suitable accommodation for our Boston trip. The apartment that we stayed in was fantastic and was better than in the photos. The two bedrooms are equally as good however this was not clear at the time of our booking. The Back Bay area where the apartment is situated is very good and is ideal for visiting the city. The locality of the supermarket was especially useful. No complaints at all. I would definitely use Seamless again.

The bathroom is also stocked with anything you could need, such as toiletries, blow dryer, first aid kit."
Emily and Giuseppe have clearly taken every care to make guests comfortable. There is no place I would rather stay in Boston. Highly recommended,"10 stars!\"",,,,

Also very easy to get to from the airport (ideal after a long flight!). The apartment is very well equipped, and very tastefully furnished and the view from the bay window at night felt very Parisian! Oh - and Giuseppe's welcome cookies are worth visiting Boston for alone!! Many thanks for the perfect city stay!"
10542140,67144462,2016-03-27,3274266,Margot,"This gorgeous brownstone was exactly what my boyfriend and I needed for a brief getaway.  It is clear that Emily and Giuseppe have taken great care to keep the place immaculately clean and remarkably cozy.  For the coffee connoisseur, the kitchen has three different ways to make coffee (Nespresso, pour-over and drip) and, as an added bonus, break-and-bake cookies in the freezer.  The proximity to downtown Boston is fantastic-- just a short walk to restaurants, nightlife and Trader Joe's!  I can't say enough positive things about the apartment and the location, so do yourself a favor and stay here!  Ps: Love the art on the walls-- old subway and city maps!"
10542140,71041624,2016-04-23,24233057,Henri,"Emily was a great host, welcoming us upon our arrival. The apartment is in a great location in Back Bay close to trendy shops and restaurants. The apartment was spacious especially as there were just two of us."
10542140,71646525,2016-04-27,52341490,Ellen,This place is in a perfect location.  We were right around the corner from the Hynes Convention Center and T stop as well as Newbury Street.  The Boston Commons was a nice short walk away as was the Charles River and running trails.  The space was also immaculate; exceedingly well kept and had everything you would need.  Emily was lovely to work with; she was very responsive and even met us with warm chocolate cookies!  I would recommend this listing to anyone and hope to return some day.
10542140,72035716,2016-04-30,43540432,Élise,"\"La communication avant l'arrivée fut facile et je me suis sentie à l'aise de poser des questions et d'organiser l'arrivée. Le logement est très confortable, lumineux et très bien situé dans Back Bay. Nous y étions pour une conférence au Hilton et celui-ci était à 5 minutes à pied (le centre des congrès Hynes est encore plus près). Il y a dans le coin des stationnements à étage pour ceux qui voudraient s'y rendre en voiture (environ 40$/24h). L'appartement est très lumineux, confortable et les 2 chambres intimes (séparées par la salle de bain), idéal pour 2 couples ou une famille avec enfants/adolescents. La cuisine est très bien équipée avec de multiples petites attention (café excellent, verres en carton pour café à emporter, échantillons de produits pour la douche... tout y est pour notre confort). Ce fut pour moi une expérience de \"\"vivre à Boston\"\" pour quelques jours plutôt que de débarquer dans un hôtel standard nord américain comme celui qu'on voit partout (et pour moins cher). Je n'hésiterais aucune seconde à recommander cet appartement.\""
10542140,73484944,2016-05-08,54473363,Viola,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it was fantastic.  We were in Boston for 1 week to attend daughter's graduation.  Emily greeted us at the Brownstone, and was so friendly and helpful.  The apartment was beautiful, sparkling clean and well appointed.  The furnishings were quite comfortable, excellent beds, and lots of natural light.  We cook most of our meals and the kitchen was well stocked, cooking utensils and appliances were high quality.  The location is ideal for exploring Boston.  Easy to walk, or take transportation.  Thank you Emily and Giuseppe.  We will be back!"
10542140,74092148,2016-05-13,53607482,Lauren,"We had a wonderful stay at this brownstone apartment. The apartment is beautifully decorated, clean, and stocked with everything you need for a comfortable stay. The location was perfect for us, close to many restaurants, shops, and the T is a short walk away. We couldn't stop raving about this apartment and location throughout our stay. Emily was an excellent host from greeting us at the apartment with fresh baked goods to promptly replying to texts about dinner recommendations. Boston is a great city and this was the perfect place for our stay."

The place is immaculate, the decor is charming and the quick response time/seamless communication with our hosts was simply far more than anything we could have ever expected!  We've already suggested it to friends of ours who are traveling to Boston this summer!!"

10542140,75713271,2016-05-22,15662817,Antonio,"The apartment is very nice, situated in the best neighbourhood of Boston. The good thing about Back Bay is that you can easily walk to the city centre and to Cambridge. The house is well furnished, the rooms are very spacious, the kitchen has everything you need. Emily and Giuseppe were very kind as they left us city guides, maps and warm cookies!"
10542140,76628054,2016-05-28,9521438,Sandi,"Emily and Giuseppe are wonderful hosts and the apartment was perfect for our family of three. It's an elegant apartment, and very comfortable and well-stocked, including 3 coffee makers and coffee on hand when we arrived (so no need for a mad dash to the grocery store to stock up for our morning coffee - a wonderful bonus). The location was perfect for our Boston and Cambridge activities. We couldn't have asked for a better temporary home or more gracious hosts while we visited Boston."
10542140,77634775,2016-06-02,26262122,David,"Emily and Giuseppe were very easy to work with.  Their communication was fast and complete.  The apartment is well furnished and comfortable.  The cookies waiting upon arrival were a nice treat.  We really enjoyed staying here.  Very close to the T station, lots of food, and right in the heart of Boston.  Would definitely stay here again!"
10542140,78214635,2016-06-05,35486675,Travis,The listing was exactly as described and is located in one of best locations Boston has to offer.
Our Host made the booking/check in process effortless and even went above and beyond with fresh baked cookies and a bottle of champagne on the table in celebration of my Wife and I anniversary.,,,,,
"We will most definitely be contacting Emily and Giuseppe next time we need a place to stay in Boston!\"",,,,,
10542140,79893881,2016-06-14,27429537,Christine,"Stay here! Emily warmly greeted us upon arrival. Easy communication between us and host. There were fresh flowers, cookies and prosecco waiting for us. Location is perfect. Right off Newbury street with plenty of restaurants and shopping within blocks. If you're attending a convention at the Hynes convention center you can leave the apartment and be seated within your conference room in less than 10 minutes. Easy shuttle from the convention center back to airport running every 20 minutes for $7.50. The place was styled beautifully, stocked with all the incidentals you may have forgotten. All the fixings for coffee, toiletries, and the extras as above are included. Trader Joes nearby for groceries."
"Comfortable sleeping arrangements with plenty of room and privacy between the 2 bedrooms. Will be staying here next time for sure. \"",,,,,
10542140,81730210,2016-06-24,33190602,Chris,"Beautiful apartment, well equipped, great location.  I went for conference at Hynes center, only 3 blocks away.  Two 18 year old girls came with me and explored Boston, on foot and by the T-subway system.  Very close subway station.  Commonwealth Ave provides a nice green space in front of the apartment.  Nice touches on arrival to be greeted with some freshly baked cookies, and have a few basics in the fridge---eggs and fruit.  Beds were super comfortable.  Emily was very responsive to email inquiries as our rental time approached."
Unequivocally 5 stars!,,,,,

10542140,84087283,2016-07-05,30999451,Serena,"Emily allowed us to check in an hour earlier. The kitchen was well-stocked with coffee capsules and cereal. There were fresh flowers on the table together with cookies and clementines. There were ample towels in the bathroom, and supplies like washing detergent for the washing machine. Location was excellent for visiting the Esplanade for 4th July celebrations. Quieter than Newbury St, which is just a street away. We had front row seats to the 10 km Marathon and 4th July fireworks. We loved the greenery and tall trees and sculptures that lined Commonwealth Avenue. Great for walks."
10542140,86307096,2016-07-15,36090522,Lynda,A phenomenal stay in Boston! It really gave us a feel for what it is like to stay in the city. Beautiful front room with a great view of Commonwealth. Emily was quite accommodating and we will be looking forward to another stay!
10542140,87769360,2016-07-21,13672894,Gerald,"My wife and I plus another couple stayed here and found everything exactly as described.  Beautiful brownstone right on Commonwealth. Excellent location, walking distance to convention center, Fenway Park, public transportation and great eats and shopping on Newberry Street just a block away.  Very roomy, perfect for the 4 of us.  Big open living room, modern kitchen.  Washer and dryer a real plus.  Bedrooms are located away from street so we had very quiet and peaceful sleep.  Towels and hot water aplenty.  Would definitely stay again on travels to Boston."
10542140,88479294,2016-07-24,58037412,Tom,Great location for exploring an amazing city. So much to see within walking distance. The apartment was clean and well-appointed; Giuseppe let us drop our bags off early so we could start exploring right away. He gave us several restaurants to try that were very good. The mini heatwave - temps of 95 two days - didn't slow us any; thankfully the apartment had portable fans so we could sleep! A great vacation in a lovely home. Emily and Giuseppe's home was everything they said it would be.
10542140,90690430,2016-08-01,36765749,Stephen,"Emily and Giuseppe made us feel as if we were staying with friends. Our flight arrived very late from the UK, which meant we didn't reach the apartment until nearly midnight, but this didn't prevent Emily from cheerfully welcoming us."
10542140,91597426,2016-08-06,38752911,Ellie,"Excellent, comfortable, beautiful apartment in the heart of Boston Back Bay area. Really enjoyed our stay. Both bedrooms are pretty much the same size so ideal for two couples! Highly recommend you stay here!"

Not only was there plenty of space for my friend and me, but he left towels for us to use and we had access to a HUGE TV with Netflix and internet. We also were able to interact with his roommate, who was very hospitable (served us coffee in the morning and was very pleasant to converse with). The location ended up being only about 5-10 min walk from downtown Boston, which is incredible. I almost paid $300+ per night for that kind of location, but instead I paid significantly less. I highly recommend this listing."

The couch was surprisingly comfortable and the location is absolutely perfect. It is a 5 minute walk to the red line (the best line) but removed from street noise. Roger was also very helpful and flexible in helping me check in. You can feel totally comfortable with your booking!"
2862120,39787401,2015-07-26,14342541,Andrew,Roger was a great host.  Everything on his apartment description was accurate.  He gave me insightful tips on things to do in the city.

I will definitely stay with Roger when I visit Boston in the future.
2862120,41244370,2015-08-05,38242498,Slava,Roger was a phenominal host. The apartment was very clean and everything was prepared ahead of my arrival.

Also, he gave me an early check-in and a late check-out. The flexible arrangement gave me a huge convenience, even better than living in a hotel i think. The apt is tidy, clean, and cozy. Though I slept on the sofa bed in the living room, it didn't make me feel uncomfortable at all. It's quiet in the night. The air conditioning works well and made the room temperature comfortable. Roger offered some fruits and snacks on the table. He also gave me some advise on traveling in Boston, and he helped me check the tour and the time schedule. For me, this is really a nice airbnb experience, I would highly recommend Roger's apt if anyone wants to stay in Boston."

I was heading to Boston for a weekend and my booking was pretty last minute. Probably 1-2 days before arrival. Roger was very nice throughout the booking process. I appreciated his timely response to my booking request and our correspondence afterwards. Roger let me arrive to the apartment earlier than his listed check-in time which I really appreciated. I dropped off my bags and was able to explore comfortably. The couch is directly in front of the front door to the apartment which is important to note. I actually slept fabulously, it was really comfortable. Surprisingly, for being so out in the open I didn't see/meet Roger until my morning of check-out two nights later. He's very nice. I would recommend this listing. The location in Beacon Hill is pretty convenient, too."

We are aware of the fact that it is not Seans fault that he had to move out of the house but he could have communicated the fact earlier in order to give us a chance  to find an alternative. Sean was a very sympathetic and helpful host. Still the apartment in Fenway left some things to be desired: it could have been cleaner and without our predecessors garbage, the location was not as idyllic as it is in the North End (if you are not a Redsox-fan the vicinity to the Fenway parkstadium is not really an advantage). All in all Sean is a advisable host, the apartment has a lot of potential, but the location did not convince us entirely."
1695275,7791529,2013-10-03,8066245,Harry,We were switched to this location at the last minute after a problem with the apartment in North End. We stayed there one night and again for another night a week later.
Location was good,with the park,baseball stadium,transport links (from Kenmore) and museums within easy walking distance.,,
What did disappoint us was the general cleanliness of the apartment. It had obviously not been vacuumed either time,it was very dusty and a bit grimy. We did not feel like we could be comfortable amongst all the dust bunnies.,,,,
There were construction works happening right outside too,which were quite loud. This was obviously not Sean's fault but did not help.,,,,
Sean was a very flexible host,with both check-in and check-out made really easy. His communication via email and phone was fast and helpful,and for this we were very grateful.,,,
For a base,this apartment was fine for us. We were out during the days so pretty much only used it for sleeping. The location is great,"it could just do with a thorough clean.\"",,,
1695275,7868057,2013-10-07,1540164,Lisa,"There was a glitch with the rental location, but Sean did his best to accommodate us and worked with us.

1695275,8477841,2013-11-02,7125252,Kym,Had a great stay in Boston the apartment is easy walking distance to the back Bay Area and Sean was a good host picky up the keys was easy as was handing then back on leaving.
1695275,8534191,2013-11-04,6561685,Lauren,The apartment was adorable and clean. It had a great view of Fenway park and was in a fantastic location. It was a great place for us to spend the night but would not recommend for someone needing somewhere during the day. We had to leave our things in the apartment when it was not yet cleaned from the guests the night before.
1695275,8605067,2013-11-07,9429410,Kyle,"The apartment was perfect. It was in an amazing location across from the fens and close to different train stations. Shaw's, Whole Foods, and Trader Joes are all within walking distance, as well as lots of coffee shops and Newbury street (for shopping). The apartment itself was very large, bright, and clean. The bed was extremely comfortable, the best I've slept in through this site yet. I highly recommend this apartment. I would definitely stay here again."
1695275,8712276,2013-11-12,1601402,Stephanie,Sean was very accommodating to our last minute request. The apartment was clean and in a unique location. The apt is old but has a lot of character. It was a great experience staying at the apt and I recommend it to anyone in need of a last minute apt in Boston.
1695275,8790031,2013-11-18,2796261,Tina,"\"This was not the experience both Sean and I expected; what it came down to was that we both agreed to disagree on what we both found \"\"acceptable\"\" with cleanliness and preparedness (cleaning and setting up apartment at 12:30 am"
1695275,8840554,2013-11-20,9917178,Jaimee,"Sean is unbelievably accommodating! My schedule can be a bit hectic and he has always bent over backwards to help me fit in my stays. His places are clean, comfortable and it really feels like home away from home while staying there. Highly recommended! Hard to find a better host."
1695275,8861039,2013-11-22,9830155,Molly,"Sean's apartment was just what I was looking for. Good location, easy to get to from the T, and literally right outside Fenway park. The place was clean and had plenty of linens and dishes to use. My only complaint would be the construction happening outside which woke us up both days we stayed there. But if you are planning on getting up early to check out the city, it shouldn't be a problem. Sean was very easy going and made getting the key and staying here a very simple process. Thanks!"
1695275,9024814,2013-12-02,9214540,Grace,"Sean was very helpful and accommodating. We visited over Thanksgiving so were grateful he still devoted time to us. The apartment was spacious and clean, and in a perfect location at the back of Fenway Park. Would stay again!"
1695275,9132303,2013-12-09,1634847,Laetitia,"Sean's appartment is very nice and well situated. I was not incommoded by too much noise as read on other comments. The bed is very comfortable, convenient bathroom and kitchen. Sean was very flexible with check in and out time and helpfull. I am happy that I have found this location for my stay in Boston, I would definitely come back here if I have to come back to Boston and warmly recommend it. Just be sure to set the meeting point, because I thought  had to wait outside, while Sean was waiting for me inside."
1695275,9315142,2013-12-21,5570214,Tuyet,"This was a well-located apartment which we were switched to due to issues with the original apartment we had booked. If you are happy with a lived-in apartment, this will suit you. The apartment could have been a little cleaner but other than that, we had no issues. Sean was quick to respond to a power issue we had and contact with him was clear and responsive."
1695275,9369354,2013-12-24,5693360,Daphné,"Le location of the apartment was perfect, very close to the subway and any attraction in Boston. We had a very nice time in the bars 2 minutes walk from the apartment!  The kitchen is a bit little if you expect to cook, but still appreciated. Sean was very very quit (!) to respond to any question we had during the stay :)"
1695275,9435674,2013-12-28,7409660,Annie,"Nice, clean, cozy studio in a great location. Would stay here again."
1695275,9506745,2013-12-31,10663682,Christodoulos,"Host explained about the nearby attractions and shared his insight for good places to go. However, parking was really hard to find, and host was unsure if there was a 24h garage available around the block so I had to look for one and spend about an hour. Finally, I parked in the near gas station for 20 $ / per day. Other than that, the flat was as expected in a central location incredibly close to the Fenway Park."
1695275,9684823,2014-01-05,8753954,Malik,"Nice studio in Boston, in a nice area, Sean is very convenient about check in and check out, friendly and helpfull."
We were four during our stay,and it was more than enough for the four of us.,,,,
If you need a nice little place to stay a few days in Boston,"don't search anymore this place will be perfect for you.\"",,,,
1695275,9729887,2014-01-06,7138338,Juliana,Great apartment and location. We were able to walk to everywhere we needed to go. Host was wonderful and the apartment was clean. He was very accommodating and would recommend the place to everyone.
1695275,9815961,2014-01-12,3584687,Verónica,We´ve been in Sean´s apartment between january 7th and january 11th.
The apartment is very well located,luminous and spacious for 2 persons. It could have been a little cleaner. In the coldest days (we where there in the Hercules winter storm) the room was warm but the bathroom was freezing.,,,,
If you like to walk you can get practically to all most visited places in Boston within 25 min and one hour walking. There is also metro station,bus stop,supermarket,pharmacy,everything less than five or six blocks distance. However,the communication with Sean was a bit difficult to us.
Because we would be arriving after 1:30 pm,he would not wait for us,so he sent by mail some instructions about the keys. We had great difficulty to find them (we were going around for almost three hours),and it was no easy to find him on his mobile. We not have internet service in our mobile.,,
He was responsive by email,"but I think that maybe he should get a little more in the \"\"shoes of the host\"\". Specially on those occasions when there is no personal contact with them",to tell all the directions and rules of the apartment,or the building,things like wifi (we discovered by chance the wifi password in the upper right of sheet music on the piano) where to put the trash and recycling,that both locks of the apartment opened with the same key
Anyway,things that are important to know if you are staying there,"and only those who live there may know them.\"",,,
1695275,10203539,2014-02-06,8629986,Bethany,"Sean was such a fantastic host! The place was extremely clean and he was even flexible and able to accommodate last minute plans to change our original dates. Very responsive and friendly - would highly recommend this place or any of Sean's rentals in the Boston area! Thanks, Sean!"
1695275,10238301,2014-02-08,6327910,Fran,"Comfortable & clean. .3 to Fenway Park. About a mile walk from the T at Kenmore. Great location. Sean was very kind, caring + helpful."
1695275,10260003,2014-02-10,62506,Jericha,"We stayed at Sean's Feb. 7-9th and the place was perfect for what we needed. Location was super close to the Kenmore T-station and you can see the Fenway Stadium right behind his building. Place was older, which is very typical for a Boston apartment, but overall size was pretty spacious for a small studio. Both the queen bed and pullout couch bed were comfortable, and the 4 of us were able to stay there without stepping on each other. Please note that when we went, the service elevator was not working on our floor, so you may have to use the stairs, but it's only 1 flight of stairs since we were on the second floor. The only complaint I'd give was that there weren't any outlets in the bathroom, so I had to resort to doing my hair in the front hall area. =P (girl problems). Other than that, Sean was really helpful is directing us to different areas of the city. I didn't actually get to meet him in person, but he was quick to respond whenever I had a question via phone. If you are looking to visit Boston and are needing a place to rest your head, Sean's is the perfect spot. When we visit Boston again, we will be sure to come back to his place. Thanks Sean!"
1695275,10318820,2014-02-12,10420489,Jiri,"Great location, good apartment, helpful host. Everything was ok except man who was tunning piano almost 3 hours at night. We knew about that before because of our last minute ordering this place."
"Thank you!\"",,,,,
1695275,10534328,2014-02-24,803381,Peggy,"This location was perfect for our visit.  Sean was very accommodating with our early arrival.  The apartment had everything that we needed for our weekend stay.  My daughter thought the pull-out bed was very comfortable as well.  He was responsive to our communication before, during and after our stays.  And - his kids are adorable! ;)"
1695275,10594921,2014-02-26,10383854,Ali,"Location location location! This was a perfect private studio space within easy walking distance of Fenway (indeed you can see the park right through the window) and, in our case, the House of Blues music club right around the back. We were looking for an easy stay over spot for just one night while seeing Bob Weir and his band. Sean's place did the trick and was clean an presentable with everything we needed at hand. Many great place to eat around every corner and shopping on newbury street within a short walking distance was also great. Found a Swiss chocolatier that had amazing treats tucked off newbury, an over on Columbus we ate a hearty breakfast at Charlie's sandwich shoppe (recommended!) there since 1927. Thank you Sean for your attention to my needs and willingness to adjust out arrival and check out time as well. Will be looking forward to a future stay as we discussed when next in town for a musical adventure. -Ali and Mike"
1695275,10676692,2014-03-03,3221760,Angus,"Sean's place was perfect for what we were after. The location is sublime, literally around the corner from Fenway Park and a very short walk to the downtown area. We spent most of our time at a conference downtown, so it was nice to have the comfort of knowing that it was only a brief walk in the mornings to get there. The apartment is cosy/a modest size, and a bit aged, but it is amply furnished and ideal if you are looking for something conveniently positioned. I'd happily recommend Sean's apartment."
1695275,10795370,2014-03-08,1776013,Xavier,"Bad experience for a family of 4 adults. The description and photos let us think that the couch (queen/full pullout couch in the description) was in the living room but it happens to be in the bedroom since there is only one room! The couch is particularly uncomfortable for 2 adults. Only 2 chairs around the table, while the description states that the apartment can accommodate up to 4 persons. The bathroom was barely clean and the place is particularly noisy (just a few meters from the highway)."
1695275,10833099,2014-03-10,3222633,Andrea,"Excellent apartment and just what I needed for my one night stay-bed was comfy, bathroom/shower worked great. You do hear the usual Saturday night street noise, so be warned. I hope to stay here again! Great communication with Sean."
1695275,11044379,2014-03-18,10550022,Audriana,"The location was perfect and the apt provided just what we needed as far as a warm place to sleep and shower. We weren't too fond of the communication between us & Sean. I would have preferred he be there at our arrival and this was unfortunately not communicated with us beforehand. We had a hard time finding the keys and had to retrieve them in the cold rain, which is probably expected for Boston, but I wouldn't host a guest in that fashion. As another review mentioned, we had to figure out the ways of the apartment on our own or by a friendly neighbors help. You get what you pay for!"
The place could have been a little cleaner and the restroom has mold. We didn't bother with using the kitchen. It's very noisy at night. Pipes are constantly cracking,you can hear the neighbors conversations crystal clear and unfortunately someone decided to plumb the pipes one morning at 4am. There is also a lot of street noise in the early morning. Oh and the neighbors love to smoke pot.,,,,
On a lighter note,"it was close to the kenmore station and a 5 min walk to the hynes convention center. Perfect location for what we needed.\"",,,,
1695275,11134374,2014-03-22,2079064,Pat & Lauren,"Had a great stay, and loved loved loved the location! Internet was messed up when we got there but I contacted Sean and he fixed it right away."
1695275,11217001,2014-03-25,9486292,Anne-Sophie,"Sean's apartment is lovely and super well situated. Although we didn't meet, Sean was fast to answer us on every email and all directions were very clear."
This is definitely the best value you can have for your money in Boston. The apartment is really charming,but small. You should expect a minimum of noise. I mean,you're in an old building (so thin walls) facing a big street. We didn't mind this at all.,,,
The only thing I didn't expect is how hard it is to find some (free) parking. So if you're heading to Boston by car,expect about 20$ per day to park. For my part,I  found a gaz station right next to the apartment that charged 20$ per night. Definitely the best deal I found around.,,,
"Bottom line: This apartment is not a 5 star - but it is your best option if you're on a budget. I'd return to Sean's place anytime\"",,,,,
1695275,11280617,2014-03-28,11553534,Clara,"Sean department was what I expected. Very comfortable bed, the couch not so much. The only bad thing is that there are very few utensils for cooking and eating. Location is good, this means far from downtown, but there is a subway stop nearby. The heater worked great. I never met Sean, but we communicate by email and answered all the questions I had."
1695275,11625697,2014-04-09,13619202,Kristine,Sean's place was in a great location.  We easily walked to the Red Sox game.  It was a great value for Boston.  I would definitely stay again.
1695275,11790118,2014-04-15,11178596,Matthew,"I didn't meat Sean personally, but he was a great host - helpful, friendly, and responsive. We didn't spend much time in the apartment, mostly just used it as a place to crash in the evenings, and it served well for this. Couch bed was less than the pinnacle of comfort, but the price was great for our budget."
1695275,11984036,2014-04-21,7378899,Jeremy,"Great location and host! Apartment was right around the corner from Fenway Park, Kenmore T station, and many great bars and restaurants. Apartment had plenty of space for two people. Will stay there again if we head back to Boston!"
1695275,12204177,2014-04-26,7533136,Jeff,"Much closer to Fenway than the ad says!  We were there specifically for a game, so this was the perfect place.  To and from in less than 5 minutes, if you find the alley between the buildings and the construction."
The place was as expected - clean,cozy and affordable.  Let the water run a bit before drinking it,however,as it's an old building and seemed a bit cloudy coming out at first.  Cleared up and it was just fine.,,
"I'd stay here again no question.\"",,,,,
1695275,12326725,2014-04-29,9866372,Lorenzo,We spent a few days in Boston at the end of April and Sean's place caught our attention on screen and confirmed its good vibe once we arrived.
The location was great because it had the Fenway Victory Gardens right in front of it,plus the cool part of Boylston st was a few steps away as it was the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum,plus you could literally see from the living room the baseball games in Fenway Park.,,,
The building was nice from outside while the interior was just ok. The apartment,as someone wrote before me,"has its own \"\"character\"\". it was big enough for two people and clean enough (don't look under the bed). It could be restored",especially in the bathroom,but it and offered everything we needed: hot water,fast wireless connection and a comfortable soft bed.
Overall we are fully satisfied of this fascinating apartment and we would certainly stay here again if we come back to Boston. We have never met Sean,"but we liked the \"\"Mission Impossible secret agent style\"\" key management he came up with as we had to make a late check in. The instructions to retrieve it were clear enough.",,,,
"On a light note i just want to confirm that the banana spotted in the kitchen by another review had a few yellow spots at the end of April when we visited the apartment. We might consider this as a scientific experiment in which all guests must report the \"\"banana status\"\". No pun intended. We didn't dare to touch it","and my thoughts go to the upcoming guests! \"",,,,
1695275,12366438,2014-04-30,1416567,Kristin And Kiki,Great location. Easy arrival. Thanks.
1695275,12632572,2014-05-06,1201251,Sheryl,"Spent 1 night in the studio apartment. Location is very central and located near restaurants, shopping, and Fenway Park. Sean was easy to get a hold of and responsive to all inquiries.  Studio was adequate for my quick sleepover as I just needed a place to crash after a long drive from Georgia, however, the place has not been updated and in need of a renovation.  Basically you're getting what you pay for, and the price is good for the location."
1695275,12681337,2014-05-08,5088711,Marjorie,We did not meet the host in person.
"The black banana and the vase of dead flowers on the rickety black wooden table were a metaphor for our experience.\"",,,,,
1695275,12712487,2014-05-09,12264671,Donna,"\"The neighborhood was perfect .  We could walk to all our events, Red Sox game at Fenway, graduation at Prudential, Kenmore Square, Boylston St shopping. The apartment was adequate, a little more \"\" tired\"\" than I had anticipated"

"adequate.\"",,,,,
1695275,12941022,2014-05-15,9601213,Claudio,"El anfitrión ha sido muy comunicativo y amable. En el apartamento funcionaba todo muy bien, buena cama, buena ducha, pero encontramos al lugar muy sucio a nuestro arribo, (parecía como si nadie lo hubiese limpiado previamente) y una propiedad realmente descuidada."
1695275,13230633,2014-05-22,4706870,Inseok,"My first impression while getting the keys was not good, the instruction by the host was not clear and had to walk with my luggage to get them. Sean is responsive and replies back in a minute. The greatest thing is the location. I liked the tuned piano and the window in the bathroom too. The apartment is old and needs to be renovated as some previous guests mentioned. However, he put several decors and items such as old books and typewriter to look the apartment more classical and it was not bad. I can't recommend others but for me, I would stay again if I visit next time."
1695275,13405919,2014-05-27,3780853,Jessy,Unit was just as described/reviewed.
We ended up waiting over a half hour for Sean but once he got there he put clean sheets and showed us where to leave the key the next day.,,,,,
My biggest complaint would be the heat. Even with all windows open we found it very warm and were wishing for a fan. If it's a warm day/night I recommend asking him to provide a fan as some air movement would have allowed us to sleep better.,,,,,
"Location was superb and we even managed to find free street parking!\"",,,,,
1695275,13644860,2014-06-02,10622311,Henrike,"Nice host although we didn't meet, absolutely no problems with communication, ideal location for us in walking distance of Subway, Supermarket, Shopping. Student neighborhood/house."
1695275,13784273,2014-06-04,12481349,Alexane,"The apartment is just like the description and the photos. The location is perfect, the host is ready to help but it was pretty hard to find the key and our night was a bit noisy. However, we had wait a bit Sean to clean the room because when we arrived, there were the sheets of the one before us."
1695275,14336972,2014-06-17,121532,Vicky,"Good neighborhood, close to the train, stores, restaurants. Great view of Fenway out the window. Perfect for one or two people. Would stay here again!"
1695275,14769370,2014-06-26,9385669,Julien,"Nice host, we wait for him a few time, but then he answer quickly to our questions."
The apartmend is well located,10 minutes walking away from the subway.,,,,
But the big problem we met was the cleaness,he is not a cleanliness freak for sure ! I was laughing when i read the comment about the vase of dead flowers,then I didn't laugh when i saw this vase still there ! Sean changes the sheets of the one before us when we arrived,but he didn't clean the apartment,not even the shower,a lot of dust
So i could recommend if the problem of the cleaness is going on,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1695275,15128617,2014-07-03,11277133,Brandon,"Fantastic experience at an amazing location! Sean was helpful, and even provided me some tips and recommendations for my stay in Boston. The listing's location was even better than I expected, with Fenway Park one block away, and just a fairly short walk away from the Kenmore “T” station. Plenty of nightlife on Landsdown Street and in the surrounding area, which was a nice bonus. I'd highly recommend staying here!"
1695275,15177333,2014-07-04,15038311,Bobby,"Amazing ploace. Very central, super close to Fenway. I had everything I needed. Sean was very helpfull with all my questions."

For Red sox fans-Fenway park stadium just right behind the corner. There is enough room for 3 people. The bed is incredibly comfortable. In the kitchen we found everything we needed. The place is very cosy and nice. Supermarket is at 10min walk  from the house (to the right from the house).Sean is very helpful and kind."
1695275,15433277,2014-07-08,5929119,Sammie,Sean was responsive and let us bring our stuff a little earlier than check-in so we could get to the Red Sox game. We appreciated how accommodating he was.
The building is your typical old school Boston brownstone,so you are not going to be in the most memorable apartment of your life,but the location is great,the ac worked,"and the bed was comfortable. This was perfect for a one night stay. We dropped off our things early and then stayed out till midnight and left by 10am. \"",
1695275,15481525,2014-07-10,11089766,Manon,"Séjour de deux jours dans le studio de Sean. Contact par tph avec lui à notre arrivée sur Boston et récupération des clés dans un petit coffre-cadenas accroché à un grillage près de l'immeuble !! Le studio est sympa à conseiller pour maximum des couples avec enfants ou amis baroudeurs car la pièce pour dormir est petite. La salle de bains aurait besoin d'un bon rafraîchissement....Pour les personnes venant en voiture il y a des parkings payant proches à environ 25$ les 24 heures mais attention, le studio étant juste à côté du stade de l'équipe des Red Soxs, pendant la saison de base-ball, les parkings sont réservés pour les spectateurs pendant la durée du match à au moins 50$ dollars l !!! Un conseil donc: déposer ses affaires puis emmener la voiture au parking souterrain de Common Park puis retour par le métro. Une station est à max 10 mn du studio."
1695275,15812700,2014-07-16,5882080,Marie-Eve,"Location is very central and convenient. Apartment is charming and bed is comfortable. It is not spotless as the building has some age, but it was good for what we needed. The system for obtaining the key without having to meet the host was very convenient....we didn't have to worry about what time we got into town."
1695275,16059289,2014-07-21,7334334,Véronique,"C'est un petit studio qui se situe a 5 minutes de marche du Fenway Park! Un studio avec le strict nécessaire pour y passer la nuit. Nous étions 4 adulte, donc un lit double et un sofa-lit pas top-confo .Côté propreté c'est passable. Et on a eu besoin d'appeler l'hôte quand nous sommes arrivés sur place, car il avait nous n'avions aucune idée du numéro de porte rendu à l'intérieur du bâtiment...Un numéro de porte sur la clé aurait été plus simple et efficace..."
1695275,16286864,2014-07-25,10742889,Patricia,Nous avons occupé le studio de Sean avec nos 2 enfants durant 4 jours.
Points positifs :,,,,,
-  Studio très bien placé pour visiter les sites principaux de Boston à pied. 40/45 min de marche jusqu'au waterfront. 40/45 min de marche jusqu'à Harvard. Sinon,le métro est à moins de 5 min à pied.,,,,
- Sean s'est montré très réactif à nos appels (il s'est déplacé pour nous aider à trouver la lockbox,puis a réglé en quelques heures notre problème de connexion à Internet).,,,,
Points négatifs :,,,,,
- L'appartement n'était pas propre à notre arrivée (beaucoup de poussière). Ce point a déjà été signalé dans plusieurs commentaires et le ménage est pourtant compris dans le prix !,,,,,
- La cuisine manque d'équipements pour 4 personnes : grandes assiettes,fourchettes et grande poêle notamment permettraient de prendre un minimum de repas pendant 4 jours.,,,,
- Enfin,le studio est très bruyant : la 4 voies est très proche et de jour comme de nuit,la circulation ne s'arrête jamais ! Au bout de 4 jours,le bruit nous est devenu insupportable...,,
"Ces points négatifs ne nous ont pas empêchés de passer un très agréable séjour à Boston. Nous avons tout simplement adoré cette ville !\"",,,,,
1695275,16465479,2014-07-28,15653748,Jordan,Great small apartment.  It was well equipped and the location is the best.Thanks Sean for being such a great host.
1695275,16731154,2014-08-01,17687202,Eli,"Everything went flawlessly. Location of apartment is phenomenal, right in the center of it all. Walking distance to a ton of attractions. And host always responds in a reasonable amount of time."
1695275,17035106,2014-08-06,1711245,Carol,Getting the key to the apartment was very easy and convenient. Sean's instruction were clear and precise. The description of the apartment was accurate. The location was great! Better than I expected and the neighborhood was safe.
1695275,17141170,2014-08-08,5322197,Chris,"A rustic apartment, in a traditional, building. It's very well located, only a ten minute walk to a number of t-stations, and a few minutes further to the prudential centre. Good comfortable bed."
Good communication with the host prior to the stay,but it was a little difficult to contact Sean on our arrival.,,,,
Sadly,the apartment was let down by the cleanliness. We have stayed in a number of private rentals across the world,and sadly this one was not one of the best... we were really disappointed.,,,
The bathroom was dirty,and had not been cleaned after the previous guests. All surfaces  in the apartment were thick with dust. The kitchen was grubby,and the fridge (while a great bonus) was dirty,with mouldy food items from previous guests.,,
All in all it was a good price,and well located but could be so much better if the apartment was thoroughly cleaned.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1695275,17211676,2014-08-09,16943581,Colleen,Sean is great at communicating and responding to messages.  Key pick up was convenient and super easy.  Apartment is just as it looks in pictures.  Apartment was clean and ready when we arrived.
1695275,17495207,2014-08-13,3353552,Jenny,"Sean was helpful with our irregular scheduling.  The apartment is small for three people but we managed it.  If you're into luxury, then this place is not for you.  If you and some friends want a place to crash during a weekend in Boston, then you're probably good."
The location is very close to Fenway so if you're planning to go to a game,you can walk to the stadium,easily.  If there is a game going on,you will hear the crowd until late at night so bring earplugs if that bothers you.  I would not recommend bringing a car there as there is NO PLACE TO PARK in that neighborhood.,,
To get anywhere,you often have to pass over freeways on foot to get there.  On the upside,there is a really great community garden/park across the street.  Later in the evening,you can see bunnies and geese running around it and there are a couple hundred community gardens butted up in neat rows.  That was a highlight for us.,,
If you're planning to visit Fenway or Berkley College of Music,"then the apartment is very central to both.  \"",,,,
1695275,17575843,2014-08-14,13182954,Dylan,We had a great stay at this apartment. It is so conveniently located and the views of Fenway are really cool.
"The apartment was nothing fancy but very clean and the bed was really comfortable. Sean was easy to communicate with and getting the key was very simple. \"",,,,,
1695275,17622772,2014-08-15,6714724,Skot,"This thing doesn't have 1-10 number rating system but I'd EASILY give Sean, his place, and my experience there an 11! He was completely accessible/reachable, easy to deal with, such a gracious host, and full of helpful info."
The place itself was a dream. Wonderfully situated,impeccably clean,the exemplification of that charm and uniqueness that makes AirBNB what it is.,,,
"I can't wait to stay here again! \"",,,,,
1695275,17813680,2014-08-18,3353552,Jenny,We stayed in Sean's apartment on two different occasions in the same week.  Both times were satisfactory.
1695275,17927573,2014-08-19,6219303,Erik,"\"Reviewing this apartment is really a matter of what you expect from an apartment during a short stay in Boston. My personal experience comes down to a \"\"déja vu\"\" with respect to my own first year student apartment (now 30 years ago): basic"
1695275,18161504,2014-08-23,11604069,Florence,Boston is an incredible city!
"I had enjoyed the city and the Red Sox!!!!!\"",,,,,
1695275,18515869,2014-08-28,1764124,Maike,"Sean's apartment is very well located, it is easy to walk to the center and next to the building are supermarkets, restaurants and a metro-station."
To find the key was pretty easy.,,,,,
The apartment itself is perfect for 2 people to discover the city! The bed was nice and comfortable. Unfortunately we were three,so one had to sleep on the pull-out-couch and that was not very nice for the back. The mattres is very worn and not comfortable at all.,,,,
Another complaint is Sean did not really clean the apartment for us. He arrived when we were already there and just changed the sheets and towels.,,,,,
But all in all we would recommend this apartment for that price but only for two people.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1695275,18704608,2014-08-31,1795431,Catherine,Host:
Sean was amazing.  His communication could not have been better.  About a month before we were scheduled to come,I contacted him to see if he had access to a pack-n-play for my baby to sleep in.  He started working on it right away and now has one stowed in the closet for us and future guests. He allowed us to check in early (12:30pm) because our flight arrived early.   And he chatted with us a bit about architecture when he came to change the sheets/towels/clean.,,,,
Location:,,,,,
Could not have been better.  I think we paid a great rate to be in the middle of things.  Shopping,restaurants,history,the T all within walking distance.  I would not recommend a car while staying here...parking is very expensive.,,
Kid friendly:,,,,,
Yes for older kids.  Now with the pack-n-play there is a place for a baby/toddler to sleep.  My daughter found lots of things to play with that were not kid friendly...things I moved to a higher unreachable level.,,,,,
Apartment:,,,,,
It is definitely old.  It was fun to be a part of the history.  But the apartment was sparse on luxury.  If you are used to 5/4 star places and can't be flexible...this place is not for you.  But if you want to be in the middle of it all...then go for it....you will not regret it.,,,,,
For my first time in Boston,I had a great time.  I would stay here again.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1695275,19115203,2014-09-07,4726225,Sara,"Our stay at Sean's studio apartment couldn't have gone better. The apartment is very well situated within a 5 minute walk from a T station which made it very easy to get around the city and to and from the airport. The apartment itself had everything that is needed for a short city break, a full kitchen perfectly adequate bathroom and a large living /dining area."
The main highlight is the close proximity to Fenway Park,close enough that you can be at the stadium in under 5 minutes but far enough away that you don't get any of the noise if you are not a sports fan. Although we did not meet the host he was very  helpful over the phone and on email and even offered to hold our luggage on our day of departure as we weren't flying until  late that evening.,,,,
"Overall a great experience and fully recommended.\"",,,,,
1695275,19317940,2014-09-10,17463067,Slatomir,Sean was a good host ready to help me on all the steps necessary for checking-in and cheking-out .
Pics were adherent to the reality,but I have found the room a lot dirty.,,,,
"All the rest was as by host description.\"",,,,,
1695275,19355410,2014-09-11,5852449,Stephanie,"Sean was easily accessible and greeted us at the building upon our arrival in Boston.  We were only in town for one night (to catch a ball game however, should we return to Boston in the future, we would consider staying in this space again."
1695275,19525756,2014-09-14,18950073,Erin,"The listing was very accurate and affordable, and I was pleasantly surprised by how it was even larger than it appeared in the photos! The studio was well equipped with plenty of kitchen supplies. Very conveniently located in Fenway, but the neighborhood was a bit noisy at night. Probably not a great spot for light sleepers."
1695275,19661843,2014-09-15,8492099,Tommy,Amazing location and amazing view. Sean laid out everything for check in and it was flawless. I wish I could have stayed a few more nights. Recommend for sure. Close to everything Fenway.
1695275,20079366,2014-09-23,7802714,Sarah,"Sean has been really nice and understanding with our late check-in. The neighborhood was nice, not too far from the T and the restaurants. However, the place was a bit dusty and the bathroom could use some renovation works. The fold-out sofa was very uncomfortable so I wouldn't recommend the apartment for four people. Might be more suitable for a couple."
1695275,20436792,2014-09-29,20661039,Jennifer,"Great location! Walking distance to Back Bay and Fenway area, giving many options for dinner and drinks. Small but very clean apartment- nothing negative to say, great experience!"
1695275,20489317,2014-09-30,15734210,Emily,"\"This place was a perfect find for us!  Fresh clean sheets and towels, super comfortable bed, air conditioning!  When it says \"\"Fenway park in view\"\""
1695275,20732960,2014-10-05,12478779,Tom,"We didn't particularly feel welcomed. We were at least able to get into the apartment after tracking down the key. The place was not as described. ..old and dingy, smell of fried meat permeated the place, plaster coming loose in the bathroom, generally uncomfortable. No bed bugs, roaches or rats though. When we texted about wifi access, we got no response. The neighborhood was ok, but, after listening to one of the upstairs neighbors scream for an hour in the middle of the night, we decided we had enough and left a day early."
1695275,20812318,2014-10-06,12151831,Elena,La casa está bastante más vieja y descuidada de lo que se aprecia en las fotos.
No estaba limpia cuando llegamos (a las 3pm),aunque cuando regresamos por la tarde había cambiado las sábanas y limpiado algo la vivienda.,,,,
El cuarto de baño y especialmente la bañera están tan viejos que aunque estuvieran limpios parecen muy sucios.,,,,,
Lo mismo le ocurre a la cocina y en general a todos los muebles.,,,,,
Positivo: - La ubicación es buena.,,,,,
(URL HIDDEN) - La organización para entrega y recogida de llaves es eficaz.,,,,,
(URL HIDDEN) - Sean responde pronto y correctamente a los correos.,,,,,
"No recomiendo esta vivienda mientras no se reforme.\"",,,,,
1695275,20900086,2014-10-07,19564260,Ben,Communication was an issue for some reason. It could have been the app. I didn't receive the apartment number until after we arrived and had to wait a while for that information. I'm not sure the premed is allows for this type of service so that was a bit of a concern. The place was as described and in an excellent location.
1695275,21274512,2014-10-14,11163715,Leigh,"The apartment was very cute. I didn't realize the bed was a murphy bed, but it worked just fine. Great location. Very clean. Sean had very good email communication."
1695275,21378316,2014-10-16,19770047,Luke,"Sean was a good host, we met him briefly in person but was prompt in responding to communication via AirBNB messages (for example the wifi wasn't working and he immediately got the bill paid so it was up and running again). Instructions for collecting the keys were easy enough and although the apartment is kind of old and run down, it did the job :)"
1695275,21573157,2014-10-20,10793318,Federico,"Sean realmente fue un buen anfitrión, siempre nos trato muy amablemente.  Es mas,  el primer día que llegamos nos guardo el equipaje en su casa hasta que se desocupada el departamento que habiamos alquilado.  El departamento es similar a lo que se muestra en las fotos,  le faltaría un poco de mantenimiento. La ubicación es muy buena y es fácil de llegar a todos lados.  La única crítica que tenemos,  que me parece importante,  es que estaba todo bastante sucio y la verdad la limpieza dejaba mucho que desear. El día que llegamos las sábanas estaban sucias y el departamento no estaba muy limpio.  Ese es un punto a mejorar,  la verdad no era lindo llegar a un lugar en donde la limpieza no era buena."
1695275,21739469,2014-10-23,13939532,Justin,"Room and area was as described. Sean was very friendly and accommodating (we arrived early but he quickly cleaned up and let us in). The apartment was well appointed,  had all the necessary basic amenities. WiFi worked great, view of the ballpark was excellent. We especially enjoyed the piano."
My only criticism would be the bathroom,the tub/shower area is in serious need of refurbishing.,,,,
"Quick tip: To save quite a bit of walking use the rear basement entrace/exit...cuts off a considerable distance to the Kenmore area.\"",,,,,
1695275,21825630,2014-10-25,18414527,Becky,Sean was great to work with.  He responded quickly to all my messages and was very detailed in his explanation of key pick up and wifi.
"The apartment is in a great location and was bigger than I expected. It is an older apartment (very typical of Boston) but everything was in working order.  \"",,,,,
1695275,22445840,2014-11-06,656906,Brendan,"Absolutely perfect experience. The studio is indeed small (I mean.. it's a studio), but fit the three of us quite comfortably. The building and neighbourhood were perfect and we felt totally safe the entire time. We even lucked out and found free street parking overnight - which pretty much blew my mind considering we are right next to a damn sports stadium."
Plenty to do in the area (restaurants,bars,etc.),"and easy to commute around town. The host was also very good at giving detailed instructions on how to get to and inside the apartment. Guy's a pro. Thanks for having us.\"",,
1695275,22880585,2014-11-17,13425006,Andrew,"My wife and I had a great 2 nights here. The apartment is exactly as described and the pictures are accurate. Having the kitchen equipped with utensils, plates, cups, etc. was great to have. Everything was clean and meet our expectations. For anyone considering staying here keep in mind, if your expectations are that of a 4+ start hotel this is not for you. If you are looking to stay in a historic feeling building, are okay with hearing street noise, then this is the place for you. When we go back to Boston we will consider staying here again as the price and home are just right for our needs."
Sean was very responsive,"gave great parking recommendations and pointed us in the direction for a great massage. The location to Fenway was great as we ran in the Spartan Sprint and being able to get to and from the event in less than 5 minutes was perfect.\"",,,,
1695275,23138841,2014-11-23,21228496,Kevin,Great location. Sean made sure we had clean linens and accommodated an early arrival.
1695275,23152075,2014-11-24,21872986,Victoria,"Sean responded quickly to all inquiries. The instructions to enter the building were clear, and we had no problems finding and opening the lockbox for the keys."
The apartment wasn't (URL HIDDEN) was as described,though the bathroom and kitchen were a bit dingy. We were only there for one night,so we avoided using the kitchen. The bathroom could use some upgrades,but,since this is a rented apartment,the landlord would have to take care of that. We were unable to open the bed in the couch
The apartment is in a nice location,though there is no parking lot,so we had to pay to park at the gas station next door. The view of Fenway from the living room and kitchen is awesome.,,,
All in all,"not a horrible night...but I wouldn't stay there again.\"",,,,
1695275,23523737,2014-12-03,10032756,Lucile & Benjamin,Very clear instructions to get in.
Appartment is extremly well located for visiting Boston.,,,,,
Nice and cosy place,"perfect for a couple.\"",,,,
1695275,23564398,2014-12-04,22816566,Alan,"Great stay, place as described, Sean was very helpful. Close to T and public transit. I recommend to anyone."
1695275,23741398,2014-12-09,4314714,Lauren,"Check-in was fairly easy; the lock box was easy to find.  The apartment itself was comfortable and reasonably clean, with fresh towels and sheets.  The place has a lot of old-school charm, and the collection of foreign fashion magazines was kind of fun to flip through in the evenings.  The location is good - it's an easy walk to the Hynes Convention Center, and I felt safe enough walking alone at night."
1695275,23888786,2014-12-14,9913523,Tess,"Seans apartment is in a really nice location in Boston, we were able to get around very easily either by foot or by train. The apartment itself is a pretty reasonable size compared to other 1 bedroom/studios we have stayed in. Having said that Boston was recently announced as one of the most expensive cities for airbnb apartments and its clear that you get what you pay for. While the location was good the apartment is very old and is in desperate need of some love. While it was good for our first time in Boston I probably wouldn't recommend it to a friend or stay there again, instead pay a little bit more and stay somewhere cleaner."
While Sean's communication was good,"it was clear through this communication that the rest of his apartment block is not allowed to know about the fact he uses airbnb. This made us feel incredibly uncomfortable and as if we were doing something wrong by staying there. We were instructed not to speak to anyone/talk about airbnb in the hall/wait outside the building with luggage etc..this awful feeling is one of the major reasons we would not stay again aside from the cleanliness. We are on holiday and it is horrible to constantly feel on edge and as if you were doing something illegal when really airbnb is a great system that when it is allowed can be unforgettable. \"",,,,
1695275,24076790,2014-12-19,23303973,Olivia,"My thoughts on this listing are conflicted. Initially, my friends and I were thoroughly pleased with this choice because Sean was very accommodating, responded quickly to questions, and was even kind enough to let us store our luggage at his own home (for this we are extremely thankful)."
Our problems are not with Sean personally and I'm not sure if we caught him on a bad day,but the listing was sorely disappointing. We arranged with Sean in person to check in around 3:30 - 4 PM but we arrived to find the place still dirty from the last stay. By dirty,I mean dishes in the sink,old food in the kitchen,used towels strewn across the floor,and blankets in disarray on the bed. My friends and I had been travelling all day and were looking forward to resting for a while before heading out for the night. Sean messaged us to tell us that he would be coming in to clean and bring fresh linens around dinnertime
However,we were given new towels,clean sheets for the couch bed,and found the pictures to be fairly accurate. Location was convenient and his directions to the key box were clear. I liked Sean and he seems like a really nice guy,"but my friends and I will not be staying again. \"",
1695275,24134975,2014-12-21,13300476,Trang,"It was actually a nice place to stay, the apartment was a little bit dusty but we could live with that. However, we never met the Sean, he sent me an email with an instruction and others how to get into the apartment which went trouble-free. Besides, the wifi didn't work as promised, the provider stated that the bill hasn't been paid... as we aren't even from the US and depend on internet connection to look up certain things such as how to get where, checking in our flights, stay in touch with our families etc. I sent Sean a text message to fix this but never got a response. Even though it was a really nice neighborhood, we wouldn't have picked the apartment if we knew that before. We had so much trouble getting somewhere, like checking the public transportation or even call a taxi."
1695275,24360882,2014-12-27,22484550,Geysel,"The place is a little old but was cozy. It was equipped with a little kitchen with enough space to make a quick meal. It's location is nearby to train stations and bus stops (very easy to get around).  Everything was clean when we got in. The only thing was at the time we stayed the elevator wasn't working, it was a little hard to bring our luggage up the stairs. Overall it was a pleasant stay."
1695275,24627624,2014-12-31,12614753,Sean,"The apartment was exactly as described and is conveniently located to many subway stations, restaurants and parks. Even though I only stayed one night, it was a smooth, pleasant experience all the way."
1695275,24656873,2015-01-01,10836965,Maegen,"The neighborhood/location was absolutely awesome but the apartment did not meet our expectations - the size was what we anticipated but it felt like a real lack of consideration for cleanliness. The photos, in our opinion, show a very clean, well maintained space but what we found was a very dingy, somewhat dusty space with clumps of hair and dust bunnies on the bathroom and main room floors (we were told arrival anytime after noon would be fine and we arrived just before 4pm, when he states cleaning will be done by). A 2 minute broom job probably would have done the trick. Being from Boston, we're used to 'old charm' but the apartment, particularly the bathroom, needed some major love."
The heat also never really worked during the 22˚ night. Sean even came in (for something unrelated) & said it would heat up but we had to sleep in sweatshirts,sweatpants & socks - a really terrible way to spend a winter evening.,,,,
Honestly,"had the heat worked this review would have been a lot better. \"",,,,
1695275,25006219,2015-01-05,8347423,Stefan,"Sean's place by Fenway Park is very cute.  It was nice to meet him too.  The location is great, close to the MBTA stop Kenmore.  There are many shops, restaurants, and groceries on Boylston only several minutes walking.  The apartment is cozy, and warm in the winter months. Area is safe for walking day and night."
1695275,25126930,2015-01-07,7651072,Davide,"When we arrived we got an email with all the instructions to get the keys of the flat. The procedure is quite unusual, but at the end practical. The apartment is older than we thought, quite dusty and dirty. Sean provided us clean sheets and towells. When we arrived he quickly cleaned the bathroom and the kitchen but in general the rest of the flat remained as the previous guests left it."
The flat was warm while the heating was working,but the windows had huge draughts,so at night you might feel cold....,,,
"The position of the flat is good (4-5 \"\"T\"\" stops from the center)",but at the same price we paid,you can find a room closer to the center. We were fine for two nights,"but I don't feel to recommend this place to my friends...\"",,
1695275,25318019,2015-01-12,16189748,Sufei,"Cozy apartment in a great location. Everything was within walking distance, along with the green line T stations. We were able to find parking all weekend on the streets behind the building. Sean was very accommodating and cleaned the apartment for us when we arrived. His response rate to our questions was impeccably fast. Perfect place to stay for two people while in Boston."

1695275,25537738,2015-01-19,12817724,Daisy,My boyfriend and I had a great 6 night stay at the apartment. Check-in and out were easy.
We appreciated the size of the apartment,great price for how much room you have. Location was ideal (come and go via the basement to shave a few minutes off your walk). Mattress was very comfortable. Shame there was no baseball on,"it would be a prime location! We would recommend future guests to stay here.\"",,,
1695275,25724237,2015-01-24,23374847,Cindy,The apartment was perfect for what we were looking for. My husband and I had a great time with the night life. It was a quick walk to the T.
1695275,25868606,2015-01-27,26299995,Luiz & Daniel,I love the treasure hunting to get the keys! Great location but the apartment is not quiet what we expect.
It will probably do the trick for one or two person but not for 3 or more or you will have to walk on the top of the beds!!!,,,,,
Very flexible host but he should have learnt from the other feedbacks.,,,,,
The place needs loads of TLC!,,,,,
Otima localizacao mas muito pequeno para 3 ou mais pessoas. Nao recomendo!,,,,,

1695275,26201985,2015-02-06,27167878,Ryan,Sean was a good host. The apartment was exactly as described and perfect for my one night stay in Boston. Conveniently located near public transit and easy to find per Sean's directions.  I would definitely stay here again if I'm back in Boston.
1695275,26292585,2015-02-09,6195256,Julie,The apartment is as described and overall pretty clean. I was a little scared reading the reviews but we thought it was great. Location is amazing and has easy access. Sean's directions were easy to follow and besides a tough beginning our stay was good.

He knows the area well and it was nice to get some information about galleries and food. The kitchen is fully equipped, which came in handy when we were stuck in Boston another night after the blizzard. If you get stuck in the same situation and need groceries, there's a 24hr Shaws not too far from the apartment. I'm directionally challenged so finding the key was a bit of an adventure haha. Wifi included in the apartment. Overall, a good stay!"

We arrived just before 4pm and Sean came at 7.30pm to change the sheets and take out the previously left rubbish.  It was obvious there had been a dog in the apartment previously (not sure how recent), but there was white hair on the couch, and our black socks were covered in hair after walking on and around the rug."

1695275,27871540,2015-03-14,25582782,Alice,"Got off to a rocky start... Sean accidentally told us the wrong apartment so we were had to hang around a bit until it was sorted. Accidents happen - human error. The previous occupants sheets were changed at 8.30 which interfered with our plans a little. I'd agree with some of the other comments about cleanliness... The whole place could do with a dust and a vacuum, but the bed was clean and the bathroom usable. If you're looking for somewhere to crash at night and dump your stuff it's great - easy walk into centre of Boston and lots of nearby restaurants. Great communication with Sean."
1695275,27934980,2015-03-15,26724928,Erin,"The place exactly as listed. Convenient, by the ballpark. The apartment could use a good cleaning, but for short stays, or a tight budget, this place is great. The front door lock was tricky, but the area is nice and never felt unsafe."
Sean was more than helpful and willing to coach me thru the lockbox process. Never physically met him,but seemed like a nice guy.,,,,
Would definitely recommend to a solo traveller,"or Sox fan (proximity to park)!\"",,,,

1695275,28093477,2015-03-17,10333396,Rana,"Exactly how described.. Sean was very quick to reply with any inquiries even after we had checked in.  Location was perfect and though we only were in town for one night, it was definitely the best deal!"
1695275,28157248,2015-03-19,18411454,Richard,Very no frills in an excellent location
1695275,28227772,2015-03-20,11416691,Jamie,"The apartment could definitely use some attention. It wasn't a place we really wanted to spend time in, but for a place to sleep for one night it did the job perfectly."
1695275,28260610,2015-03-21,20315927,Hayley,"Our stay was great! The location of the apartment was awesome- right across the street from the house of blues (which was where we were hanging out for the night). We had no problems finding the keys for the apartment. Sean was friendly and accommodating. He showed up around 3 pm to clean the place up for us, and we chatted the entire time."
1695275,28643078,2015-03-28,23187181,Pınar,"Ben ve arkadaşım 6 gün boyunca bu güzel evde kaldık, evin konumu Ulaşımı çok iyiydi. Ev çok sıcak yeterli büyüklükte ve kaliteli bir internet ağına sahipti, yatak da oldukça rahat ve temizdi. Teşekkürler Sean..."
1695275,28721959,2015-03-29,27185100,Nick,"The apartment was in a great location for our needs and was fairly close to public transportation. Admittedly finding the key and getting into the place felt much like a choose-your-own-adventure, but in the end it was good fun and the place met our expectations. We never met the host in person but he was communicative over text and we had a short and perfectly pleasant stay."
1695275,28925907,2015-04-01,18396962,Winfrid,"The apartment was perfectly located for our purposes, in walking distance to the MFA. It provided a nice and comfortable refuge after our walks and trips around the city. Easily spacious enough for 3 people. Everything was provided for us, Sean proved very helpful on the phone. We had a nice time in Boston thanks to his apartment."
1695275,29192120,2015-04-05,2385382,Mary-Allegra,"Well, we never actually stayed at Sean's place because a family issue kept us from both arriving and canceling in time. So, all I can comment on really is Sean's communication and documentation sent prior to the planned stay. Sean was very direct, clear, and timely in his communications. (Except after I sent him a note about us not being able to make it...which was too late for the 24 hour cancellation...I haven't heard from him, which is fine, just hope he realizes we never came, so don't bother cleaning for the next guest.) anyhow, I am sad to lose out on $111, but am glad my family's trip was fairly smooth, with the exception of our last minute need for a change of plans."
1695275,29656259,2015-04-11,25101694,Damaris,Sean answered all emails in no time and was super helpful in all regards concerning the apartment. The apartment was as described and the area is quite nice - with a park across the road and several major sights in walking distance.
1695275,30013116,2015-04-16,11763350,Daniel,"Sean was very accommodating and communication was fantastic. The apt is exactly as described, it's a great spot to drop you bag and explore Boston.  If your going to a game at Fenway like we were there is not a better place to stay it couldn't have been more convienent.  Sean was great when it came to letting us check in early and check out late, I couldn't recommend this place more."
1695275,30773285,2015-04-27,28555268,Matt,I had a great stay. The apartment is in an absolutely fantastic location. The check-in directions were very clear and easy to follow. Sean was very responsive.
1695275,30889929,2015-04-28,5969862,Colleen,"This place was a nice budget friendly place to stay, though the apartment was a bit old and dusty. The whole key on the fence down the block thing was a bit strange and I would have had trouble finding it had Sean not been there."
1695275,30923875,2015-04-29,27187356,Mackenzie,Just stayed one night but the location was AMAZING next to Fenway. The instructions to get into the building were easy to follow and the place was very clean. I would defiantly recommend this place for anyone going to Fenway Park or the House of Blues.
1695275,31282843,2015-05-04,23165365,Lynn,"The host was fine, but the apartment was filthy and in my opinion, not fit to stay in, which we did not...we found a decent hotel for our stay even though it cost me another $900.00.  There were no sheets on the bed, just a fitted sheet and the comforter spread over it.  There was a couple towels, however, there was no way my wife or I was going to use the bathroom or shower, it was filthy as well.  (I seriously thought about letting one of the homeless people use it for a night, they couldn't have made it any worse)"
1695275,31630284,2015-05-08,27023929,Adam,"Great location for red sox game, awesome stay"
"Thanks \"",,,,,
1695275,31758995,2015-05-10,14800785,Nancy,"Location! Location! Location!  You can't beat this location if you're going to a Sox game or to something at one of the many nearby universities.  It's a close walk to the Green Line with easy access to the rest of Boston. The apartment is in a OLD building and it is run down although Sean has done his best to make it look nice.  Some people may not line the oldness of it, but the price and location make it all worthwhile.   Sean also made the check in process quite easy.  The window air conditioner wasn't installed and we were there on a warm May day.  I contacted Sean and the situation was remedied immediately."
1695275,32104590,2015-05-14,16852942,Gorka,"El apartamento está más viejo y sucio de lo que aparentan las fotos. De todos modos, se encuentra en una zona tranquila, muy cerca del centro, tiene un parque delante y el estadio de los Red Sox detrás. Sean no te recibe, te envía unas instrucciones para coger las llaves que están encerradas en una caja candado."
1695275,32750550,2015-05-21,2788646,Addison,Sean was great and went out of his way to let us check-in early.
The place was great,"was located in a great location and the price was definitely worth it.\"",,,,
1695275,33390770,2015-05-27,16476779,Kristin,"Very easy to coordinate with Sean and get into the apartment; great location, great space, very clean. No complaints!"
1695275,33682563,2015-05-31,31458240,Chris,"The description was accurate.  The key instructions were a bit confusing at first, but was easy to figure out after a second reading. Amazing view of Fenway!"
1695275,34396064,2015-06-08,24691034,Peter,"Great location close to the T. Clear instructions for retrieving the key and getting into the apartment. Would stay again, thanks Sean."
1695275,34854767,2015-06-13,28157412,Burak,"The apartment was in a good location near Back Bay and virtually across the street from Fenway park.  It was quite spacious for 2 people, but somewhat run-down.  OK for an overnight stay where we really wanted to be out and about rather than indoors, and it was very affordable."
1695275,35061691,2015-06-15,3863936,Scott,"Awesome location + fun, eclectic apartment = terrific spot to call home in Boston, especially for baseball fans. Everything as advertised."
1695275,35197299,2015-06-16,5657489,Brian,Great location about a 2 minute walk from Fenway Park
1695275,35543253,2015-06-20,5490925,Roxanne,"I booked this apartment because it was cheap and very close to the main parts of the city. In those aspects, the place was amazing. But upon getting there my family learned why the price was so cheap: the place is in a very old building and in due need of a renovation, especially in the bathroom. But my main complaint is that the apartment was not very clean. I had to buy cleaning supplies and clean the layers of dust and dirt off every surface in order to feel comfortable that my family could sleep and eat in there. But once I cleaned the thick layer of dirt off the window, we were able to see Fenway park and we were lucky enough to catch a Red Sox game."
"I will not recommend this apartment to anyone!\"",,,,,
1695275,35789868,2015-06-22,895556,Corbett And Grace,"Sean was very responsive to us, and a very nice guy. The apartment was as described and expected. Warning- there is a significant amount of noise at night, with Fenway right behind. They collect the trash on Saturday morning before dawn and the party animals are vocal. Earplugs recommended if you sleep with the windows open."
1695275,36258661,2015-06-27,26634848,Jamie,"The apartment was lovely and made our trip to Boston truly enjoyable.  It was the perfect size and location for the two of us!  Although we didn't get to meet Sean in person, he was always available, responsive and extremely friendly.  We would highly recommend this place to our friends and stay here if in Boston again!"
1695275,36510500,2015-06-29,14779283,Nicole,"Listing was accurate. Instructions to open lock box perfect. I had no trouble. Bed was comfortable for two and Sean brought an extra set of linen in case one of us wanted to sleep on couch. Location close to T (5 min walk), Starbucks, park. Noisy but just run the AC and it will be fine.  As noted in listing, Sean did come by at about 3 to bring fresh linen but no cleaning was done e.g. not sure who last used bathroom and it would have made sense to have it cleaned. Apartment could use a good cleaning e.g. sweep/dry mop floors and dust. Location is great: about 15 minute cab ride to airport on a Sunday morning. Sean was responsive to questions via email/text. He is a friendly guy and we chatted a bit when he stopped by. checkin and check out times were a good fit for us."
1695275,36760728,2015-07-01,28432017,Hatsumi,"Good location, good price, and charming room&view! We enjoyed our stay. Sean was quick and kind to respond my questions during the stay. The floor was not super clean like costly hotels, so I glad that I brought my slippers. My family was happy and felt at home ;-) Thank you Sean!"
1695275,37075513,2015-07-04,16858962,Suzi,Great experience staying at Sean's place in Boston. Perfect airbnb apartment. Great location and easy access. Just do it :)
1695275,37653974,2015-07-09,32913037,Adam,"The space was neat and clean.  The location was tremendous if you are looking for the Fenway area.  My son and I where able to go in, put down our stuff, walk around and go to the game.  Be advised there is no wireless internet, and no TV.  It says the pullout is a full, and it may be, but I would call it a very cozy one.  this would definitely work for a couple and child, but two children would be pushing it I think.  My only critic is small one, it would have been nice if there was an extra blanket or sheet in the closet, there was extra pillows.  The host was accurate in his instructions, the fresh towels where laid out, bed made, key where it needed to be.  We had a slight problem with the key and he responded to my text almost immediately.  All in all, I would absolutely use it again if I needed to be in Fenway."
1695275,37942273,2015-07-12,1740551,Joan,"this was our second reservation in the same trip in one of Sean's appartment. we reserve the other appartment thinking that maybe we dont like the first , better we have plan B. Bad idea."
this appartment was not so dirty like the other. more spacious and the bad is nicer,but we have the same problem with the second bed. it is terrible!!!nobody can sleep there. is not flat!!! we send Sean a message because he forget another time sheets and blankets for the second bed. He arrive this time very late and when we ask about this terrible bed,"he can't give us a solution. crazy!!! we pay and pay and the service was disappointed. we can't recommend any of the appartments of Sean. Read all the comments of this year and you will see that more people say the same like me.\"",,,
1695275,39479509,2015-07-24,6088581,Nick,Great neighborhood! Apartment is as pictured and described.
1695275,39735150,2015-07-26,29600353,Melissa,This was a fabulous apartment. Great for the baseball lover as Fenway is right there. Wonderful host. Great little area around the apartment as well. Everything is right there.
1695275,39943984,2015-07-27,5067665,Stephen,"Sean's apartment was in an ideal location Fenway, for access to a variety of activities, food, and public transport. He clearly communicated the check-in processes as he was not able to greet us at the apartment, and was very responsive."
1695275,40318121,2015-07-30,32574524,Callie,"Our experience was amazing.  Finding the key box was a little difficult at fist because we were a bit turned around, but after that our stay was amazing!  Location was in view of Fenway which was amazing!  You can briefly hear the game when taking a shower! Fun experience and I would be interested in booking with Sean on my next trip to Boston!"
1695275,40582390,2015-08-01,4071344,Kathleen,"Sean was a great host allowing us to drop our bags off early even though the apartment was cleaned and providing us guidance for subway and train use. He also allowed us to leave our bags in his laundry room as we explored before taking the overnight train home. The apartment was great. It had a great view overlooking the stadium and you could hear the cheers of the crowd which was relaxing! The apartment came complete w/ maps and guidebooks to help us plan out our visit and there were toiletry items there so we didn't have to buy any. It was a nice touch! Just be warned the bathroom shower isn't in the best condition, but I this is do to the apartment complex not Sean. It served our needs. All and all we had a great visit and it was perfect for our needs! Thanks. We would definitely stay again if we ever come back."
1695275,40889983,2015-08-03,29112119,Mariangela,La spiegazione dell'annuncio è stata molto precisa e il quartiere dove era ubicato l'appartamento era molto centrale.
1695275,41570554,2015-08-08,25214940,Dominic,"Die Lage der Wohnung ist gut, man erreicht die wichtigsten Sehenswürdigkeiten und die Subway (Hynes Convention Center) recht schnell. Auf dem Weg zur Metro gibt es einen 24/7-Späti und ein Stück weiter gibt es mit Trader Joe's (gehört zur Aldi-Gruppe) einen guten Supermarkt."
Die Wohnung ist sauber und ordentlich,könnte aber an einigen Stellen wieder mal renoviert werden. Sie hat aber den Charme einer Studentenbude und auch die meisten Bewohner des Hauses scheinen Studenten zu sein. Probleme hatten wir mit niemandem,auch wenn uns öfters Leute im Treppenhaus und im Flur begegnet sind. Die Klimaanlage ist amerikatypisch laut,das war auf unserer Reise aber auch in deutlich teureren Hotels nicht anders. Man kann von der Wohnung den Fenway Park sehen und hört dortige Veranstaltungen bei geöffnetem Fenster auch. Ansonsten ist die Geräuschkulisse großstadttypisch laut,uns hat es nicht gestört.,
Der Kontakt mit Sean war schnell und freundlich,seine Beschreibung der Schlüsselübergabe so gut,dass es dabei keine Probleme gab. Besonders aufmerksam und hilfreich war,dass Sean Karten von Boston und einen deutschsprachigen Reiseführer auf dem Küchentisch bereit gelegt hat.,,
Fazit: Wer eine günstige und gut gelegene Wohnung für eine Reise nach Boston sucht,findet hier das Richtige,sofern man mit dem Studentenbudencharme keine Probleme hat und man sich im Klaren ist,dass in einer Metropole wie Boston andere Geräusche vor dem Fenster sind als in einer Berghütte in Maine. Das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis war perfekt. Wir würden wiederkommen!,,

1695275,41726925,2015-08-09,14691180,Allison,"Safe neighborhood and safe building. Space was small but typical for this area of Boston, and worth it to be so close to Fenway park."
1695275,42503806,2015-08-14,17123228,Hannah,"The apartment was lovely for our four night stay and it is conveniently located to get in to town as well as Fenway opposite the flat! The instructions for check in and out were clear and easy to follow and even though we never met Sean he always responded promptly and was very helpful. The local neighbourhood is fantastic - lots of lovely places to eat, Star Market for groceries and a variety of shops. It's an excellent price and I would recommend it."

Keep in mind that this apartment is older, but that is what gives it so much character. Sean was great providing us with easy-to-follow instructions, and he came by to drop us off clean towels and sheets! We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Boston."
1695275,43601680,2015-08-21,5158470,Benedetto,Very kind host! Instructions for keys are very clear and easy to follow! Apartment is just as advertised and very close to Fenway park!
1695275,46463946,2015-09-11,17611338,Marika,"Great location, Sean was friendly and accommodating, the apartment and neighbourhood had character, awesome location if you are a baseball fan and are going to Red Sox games - Fenway park is super close by.  The neighbourhood is nice too - walking distance to BU, Northeastern, Berklee, T stations, grocery store (Star Market) drugstore (CVS).  A short T ride to downtown Boston.  Great location. The apartment also had a kitchen with toaster oven stove fridge dishes, etc. Sean was arriving back from a trip just as we were arriving to check in, which was fine we just chilled while he cleaned and replaced the bedding.  The place was a little dusty with a few crumbs here and there but nothing major.  The wifi also didn't work when we arrived and we worked with Sean to try and fix it over the course of our stay but by the time we left it still didn't work unfortunately.  Apparently there was a connection issue with the provider - coming from Canada the wifi was important as we have to pay extra for US cell and data services.  Otherwise a very nice stay - we found parking on the back streets, exiting down the back stairs to the back door is a great short cut to Fenway and the T station.  Thanks for the great time in Boston."

1695275,47033217,2015-09-15,27810699,Hily,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed staying at the Boston Studio by Fenway. Our first Airbnb experience was a great one with Sean as our host during 2 different night stays in Boston. The apartment had a lot of character and all the basic things we needed. We walked to Regina's Brick Oven Pizza down by Fenway and having a refrigerator and microwave made my day for leftovers! When we got to the apartment, Sean had towels out for us and the bed made up, which was super comfortable! We will definitely come back to Boston again and stay in Sean's apartments!"
1695275,47609972,2015-09-21,14671136,Isabel,We spent a very nice time in Boston.  The apartment is well located close
to the T station and a supermarket.  The building itself looks quite good and it seems to be in a kind of a student neighborhood.,,,,,
We had everything we needed in the apartment. For two people the appartment is really spacious.,,,,,
Sean answered very quickly and referred to the issues discussed but it's more a formal contact as a personal contact.,,,,,
In fact,the apartment has not been very clean and was not really in a good shape.  A lot of the equipment like lamps or the toaster didn't work.,,,,
"You can't expect the comfort of an expensive hotel for this fair price but you can normally expect an appartment which is cleaned regularly.\"",,,,,

Only a five minute walk to the ball park and all the cool bars around it. Pretty quiet building and neighbor hood so you feel safe and the place is quaint. Definitely recommend it."
1695275,50159186,2015-10-10,29694959,Catherine,Overall it is was fine. It was a place to sleep. I did find it a bit odd that there was no top sheet on the bed and there were no blinds like the picture shows on his site so I had to get changed in the corner so that where there were no windows. The shower had a window in it and instead of having a blind it had another shower curtain which was shoved up into the window that kept falling on me when I showered. There was a hole in the shower wall but at least the water was hot. It isn't an amazing place but it isn't terrible.  He was available to answer questions through text so that was nice.
1695275,50613762,2015-10-13,16983807,Alberto,"HOST - Non esiste contatto diretto con l'host, perchè per trovare la chiave occorre aprire un lucchetto appeso ad una rete in mezzo alla strada. Le istruzioni per trovare il lucchetto sono abbastanza chiare, ma il codice per aprirlo era stato aggiornato e non ci era stato comunicato quello nuovo. In caso di difficoltà (come nel nostro caso) l'host è reperibile telefonicamente, ma il suo gestore è africano ed il costo della chiamata è folle (spesi 67 € per 9 minuti di telefonata)."
APPARTAMENTO - L'unica caratteristica coerente con la descrizione dell'alloggio è che si trova in prossimità del centro.,,,,,
L'accesso all'appartamento è quanto mai scomodo. L'host consiglia,non essendoci l'ascensore,di passare da una porta sul retro. Questo significa entrare in uno scantinato e salire i due piani per arrivare all'appartamento usando una scala malconcia,ripida,stretta,poco sicura e sporchissima.
Contrariamente a quanto si vede nelle foto l'appartamento è in uno stato di manutenzione pessimo (soprattutto il bagno). Tutto è molto datato e malconcio. Ad esempio in bagno c'è una finestra,che da sulla doccia,che non si chiude; la serratura non funziona,la chiave spesso rimane incastrata. In aggiunta la pulizia lascia molto molto a desiderare. Lenzuola ed asciugamani sono pultimi ma tutto il resto assolutamente no (esempio: batuffoli di polvere svolazzano per tutto l'appartamento; le fodere del divano e della poltrona sono macchiate; sul pavimento del bagno ci sono pezzi di calce per via dei buchi nei muri,vicino alla doccia).,

1695275,53450379,2015-11-09,13425006,Andrew,Sean's apartment was exactly what we expected from our stay there a year ago. It is a great place to spend the night though the traffic noise was a little louder than what we remembered but nothing that woke us up in the night.
1695275,53832386,2015-11-13,20317552,Lais,"Positive: great location, good communication with host, Sean's always available. Easy access. Clean sheets"
Negative: the apartment is extremely dirty!!There's dust everywhere,it looks like it hasn't been clean in months! Also the apartment is in really bad shape,there's holes in the wall and the sofa-bed it's awful,he shouldn't even put that sofa as an option to sleep. The mattress was disgusting. I slept there and I woke up with pain all over my back,so if you are planning a trip for 3 people or more,"don't book this place. The price is pretty reasonable but even then you  would expect a clean place in good shape. I wouldn't recommend it! \""

It is a very small space and is really not appropriate for more than 2 people. The fold out couch is terrible - very uncomfortable and unstable. We ended up using the mattress off it on the floor. Decent place at a decent price for a short stay (for two people).

1695275,56110850,2015-12-09,42959160,Grant,Great stay in Boston. Awesome location
1695275,56657492,2015-12-16,41593621,Ryan,"It was a little hard to contact Sean however once we touched base with him, he was very hospitable. He was available to answer any questions. Despite being quite basic, considering the price of this apartment it is great value for money, perfect for travellers and in an ideal location."
1695275,56765186,2015-12-17,29462852,Lee,Sean was great and his place was exactly what we were looking for. Couldn't ask for a better location! Very clear directions and extremely timely in all our communications. Fantastic stay
1695275,57363064,2015-12-25,36383322,Cherleen,"For any Red Sox fans, this place is the perfect spot for you!!! Perfect location and perfect space. Very homey and yes there is a piano! There are a handful of bars just down the road where we shared some of the best times of our trip. Only a short uber ride to downtown, Harvard etc. but we didn't  need to go far to have a wonderful time. Great place, would definitely recommend."
1695275,58489022,2016-01-03,34775986,Brittany,This was my first Airbnb experience and due to my positive experience I will definitely be back! Sean was great at communication. I emailed him prior to arrival and was given the lock-box instructions. Upon arrival those instructions were spot on! My boyfriend and I did not have any issues getting into the apartment. We were actually able to meet Sean when we arrived because he was just finishing tidying up. He was warm and welcoming.
The apartment is perfect for two people. The pictures in the listing are accurate. Sean ensures the sheets are clean and leaves towels as well. The kitchen is equipped with a refrigerator,stove,microwave,cutlery,and utensils. Since my boyfriend and I stayed for 1 week it was great to have these resources at our disposal so we could cook breakfast in the morning. There is a Trader Joe's about a 15 minute walk down Bolyston Street to grab groceries at.,
I will say that there are a plethora of restaurants and activities surrounding this location. Understand that with so many things to do it will come with a little noise in the evening. Since my boyfriend and I walked around exploring most of the day we were tired at night and fell right asleep without any issues.,,,,,
After reading some of the reviews of this place,I was actually hesitant on staying here. I want to respond to that. Understand this is an apartment. It is NOT a hotel. What you put into this experience is what you will take away. I feel like some of these reviewers need to realize what they are signing up for. A maid will not be there to pick up after you on a daily basis. You need to be neat and tidy yourself and respect the property Sean is providing. This is your home for a short period of time. Also try and remember to pay it forward. My boyfriend and I left behind some things we couldn't use so we hope the next person who stays gets to use them (groceries,toiletries,candles,etc.).,
"Overall it is a great place! My boyfriend and I will definitely be back!\"",,,,,
1695275,58695053,2016-01-03,541486,Sophie,"The space is unbalanced, with the main living/bedroom surrounded by a small bathroom and a ridiculously small kitchen where the oven door and the refrigerator door can't be fully opened because of each other. Also the choice of adding a round table for 4 people in such a small space is questionable. The location is great if you want to attend baseball games at Fenway Park which is indeed a block away, but so is a large entertainment complex whose visitors can make some noise in the street on week-end evenings."
Sean was really helpful to meet our needs as we were travelling with a toddler and provided a pack-and-play crib and a wooden model train for us to use,but the kitchen lacked some utensils like a bread knife and we felt shortchanged on towels since we were provided only two bath towels,and no hand towels for the kitchen or the bathroom.,,,
On the whole,it was good enough for what we needed,"which was a quick stop on our way back to New York from Maine.\"",,,
1695275,59630123,2016-01-13,18422002,Astrid,Sean made it very easy to find the place and checkin in. He was very responsive and the place was neat and tidy when we arrived. Looks exactly like it does in the pictures
1695275,59714018,2016-01-14,42519629,Casey,"***Note: This was my first Airbnb experience, so I honestly was not sure what to expect."
I was visitng a friend in Boston and was looking for a place to rest my head at night,and could not justify paying full price at a hotel. I was a little anxious to use Airbnb,but after reading the reviews people left for Sean I figured this was a safe bet.,,,
When I arrived everthing looked as it did in the pictures that were posted. (Remember that this is an apartment not a hotel,so you cannot expect the same.) Even though I was only here for a night,"I liked the \"\"homey\"\" feel and seeing some of the artwork on the walls etc.",,,
Was clean,with easy to understand instructions/directions,"and if I ever visit Boston again I will be sure to check out this listing again. For my first Airbnb experience I was very very pleased. \"",,,
1695275,59789975,2016-01-15,5954061,Stephen,"This is a very simple apartment in a great location. Sean is a good communicator, sending all the instruction you need to find the keys and the apartment."
1695275,59993366,2016-01-18,36436843,Paige,"\"Cute, well-located studio that was perfect for 2 people. The keys were easy to find, the T was a short distance away, and lots of major sights were walkable. The apartment is older, which is where I think some people were seeing it as \"\"dirty"
1695275,60402622,2016-01-23,3985030,Desiree And Matthew,Great spot! Quiet enough to sleep at night but in an active part of town. Comfy bed- the piano was nice company.
1695275,60561146,2016-01-25,3528227,Adam,The apartment was in a great location and just a short walk from the nearest t stop on the green line. Getting the keys was easy and Sean provided me with extra info about the space and Internet which was great. My friends and I had no complaints about the space and it really was a great value for the location!
1695275,61129531,2016-01-31,14351044,Rubén,"Was a good experience. Place looks better in the pictures than real, but it is ok. Check in and check out is a little bit challenging. Is a good place to spend a night if you do not have too much aspiration. Price is really convenient. I'd like to suggest to better cleaning of the bathroom, especially bath tube. It works fine if you have a low budget. Location is very good."
"\"",,,,,
1695275,61475521,2016-02-05,17986161,David,"The location was great. Views of Fenway and Landsdowne from the apt window. Short walks to both the train and the subway. The apt works for those who don't plan to spend much time in it. Although it has a kitchen, we didn't cook just used the apt to have a place to lay our heads after spending the day downtown and visiting the breweries. There is some very apparent patchwork as well as areas of wear and tear; however, that was mostly expected based on description and reviews. Most everything appeared clean aside from the bathroom floor. The water in the shower only became luke warm, but we didn't shower until late in the morning. There was a strange knocking coming from the kitchen sink, perhaps it's old pipes and just something we weren't used to."
1695275,61770064,2016-02-08,35472848,Natasha,"Sean's studio was great. The windows made it beautiful and bright, and the flat felt very spacious. Sean was very helpful with everything we needed."
1695275,62014829,2016-02-10,21230121,Cassidy,Minimalist Heaven.
I was in Boston to take my level one sommelier exam,and my boyfriend decided to tag along and visit a close friend in the city. Since we are already a long distance affair we travel often,and do what we can to keep everything budget friendly. We stayed at 2 of Sean's places and both were exactly what we needed - which wasn't much.,,,
The 2 Fenway Park spots we stayed in were close to the areas we needed to be in,were affordable,and provided a nice view,a shower,a kitchen,a bed
For anyone planning to spend most of their time exploring,working,etc and just needing a place to crash at night,these spots are perfect. For anyone looking to spend quality time together and enjoy a new environment,I'd say check out Sean's other listings. He's great to work with and was very communicative - I even got a congratulatory email from him on receiving my pin from the court.,
Cheers,"Sean!\"",,,,
1695275,62314973,2016-02-13,57964740,Mary Kate,"Great apartment very close to Fenway. I had a view of the park that made my friends jealous and was very close to places I wanted to explore. Sean was easy to contact and the listing is very accurate to the apartment itself. The apartment was a little cold amid the harsh drop in temperature this weekend, but otherwise an ideal spot for a Boston visitor."
1695275,62700792,2016-02-16,51541327,Rachel,Sean's directions were very clear and very easy. The apartment was nice and cozy and in a great location. The little kitchen was perfect for a dinner for two.
1695275,62827216,2016-02-17,54377366,Nancy,"Sean was very quick to respond to all requests & questions.  However, he gave me incorrect information (lock box code) which led to a very traumatic experience for my daughter (16) and I who were freezing, out of batteries on all of our mobile devices and were in desperate need of shelter.  When we were eventually able to get some charge to our phone, we called and Sean responded immediately bringing the keys to us."
However,I never received an apology for this mistake which led to an experience that has totally changed my desire to rent an airbnb in the middle of a big city,where you need to figure out where to park your car.  If Sean had told me that I could have pulled up in front of the building,drop my stuff off,get the key & then park the car - this unfortunate situation would have been avoided.  I would have known before I parked my car a distance away and ventured out into the cold that I had the wrong code.,
Besides this situation,you get what you pay for.  The apartment was adequate but lacking in some very basic needs/comfort items such as paper towels,shampoo,wash cloths,top sheet on the bed & had old food in the fridge.  It's very run down and didn't seem super clean.,
"I NEVER give bad reviews and I don't feel fantastic about doing it  - but it's the truth and everyone considering this place should know.  If you go in the winter - DOUBLE CHECK WITH SEAN THAT YOU HAVE THE CURRENT LOCK BOX CODE.  \"",,,,,
1695275,63129815,2016-02-20,58582849,Marlena,Everything was fantastic! Super cute stutio in a great location! Great veiw and met all my expectations and more. Retriving the key was easy as well as finding the location itself. Sean gives excellent direction and is easy to contact. Can't wait for my next stay. Thank you Sean!
1695275,63855241,2016-02-27,4692262,Suraj,Amazing and clean..thank you man
1695275,63990749,2016-02-28,54671008,Daniela,It was one of the best AirBnb experiences I've ever had.
The location of the apt is excellent,you can walk anywhere and the apt is very comfy.. Made my Boston experience even better!,,,,
"Thanks Sean!\"",,,,,
1695275,64361105,2016-03-03,41387744,Alexandra,"Sean's first was great! The location is without a doubt the best thing about this appartment. 5 minutes away from a central T-Station, 5 minutes away from Fenway, 8 minutes away from Target, it was great! Sean was available all the time for all the questions we had. The check-in was also easy, which is always a good thing! I recommend this place, I would go back if I had to go to Boston!"
"\"",,,,,
1695275,64805760,2016-03-08,49303908,Paul,"Good communication with Sean.  Access directions are clear and simple.  The unit is one block from Fenway and has a view of it, which is so great.  The unit is older and in need of a cleaning.  The 'fridge had two week old expired food in it which I threw away.  The shelves in the dining area are cluttered and pretty dusty.  A section of the ceiling above the tub is falling in.  No paper towels.  I know the price of the unit is very competitive, but these are easy fixes for the owner to take care of for their guests.   What is not in control of the owner was the loud and pounding music coming from a neighbors unit.  It went from 8pm-9:30pm, then from midnight to 2:30 am and then started up again at 7:30am-8:30am.  I had a sleep machine which makes a white noise and the loud music easily drowned it out.  Safe to say I had a poor nights sleep for this one night stay."
1695275,64927603,2016-03-09,33662460,Chris,The only challenge was finding the lock box but that was because it was dark outside.   The instructions given by Sean were excellent.   I only stayed one night but it met my needs for travel.   I enjoyed the location which was close to a number of bars and restaurants near Fenway Park.   The bed was quite comfortable as well.
1695275,65154912,2016-03-11,56934273,Bryce,"It was our first time using Aribnb and Sean was super helpful! He walked us through the whole process and we had no issues from check in, to check out. If you're visiting Boston for a day or for a few weeks, I would definitely suggest Sean's Fenway apartment!"
1695275,65811853,2016-03-17,57405352,Thanya,My main attraction to Boston was Fenway Park of course and when looking for an Airbnb i was looking for something close and this did not disappoint! I could see Fenway park from the kitchen window!! It was great! There were a lot of good places to eat around the area. I loved the are. and very easy to walk and get to newbury st.
1695275,66063646,2016-03-19,58863865,Toni,"Sean's place was perfect, exactly what we were looking for. The studio was cozy, had everything we needed and we will definitely use Sean again when we are in Boston again!!"
1695275,69007883,2016-04-08,55994526,Carla,Sean was a great host. Everything was very clear about the lock box and trash procedure. This apartment is a cute studio apartment which was convenient for mine and my boyfriend's stay. Perfect location and nice neighborhood. Sean was very helpful with all of my questions and I would recommend this location to anyone who needs an easy booking/stay.
1695275,69580829,2016-04-11,51415038,Camilla,The location and nieghbourhood are very good.
1695275,69852484,2016-04-14,48034847,Phoebe+Tim,Straight forward instructions on checking in. Apartment was as described and shown in photos. Location is excellent for those thinking of going to a Red Sox game. Easy access to the train for exploring Boston further. Wi-Fi was also very useful.
1695275,70638210,2016-04-19,3852686,Abby,"Sean has wonderful communication and a very cozy apartment. The location was exactly what we needed while staying in Boston for the marathon. It was easy to find and the lockbox was simple. My friends arrived before I did and had to find the lockbox in the dark, and they said they had a bit of trouble, but it was definitely easy in the daytime. The lockbox was very convenient since the 4 of us weren't always together, so we didn't have to coordinate coming and going; we just left the keys in the box if we were the last to leave. The bed was comfortable and the kitchen and bath adequate for what we needed! The neighborhood was safe and it was neat to be right by Fenway AND a two minute walk from the Final Mile of the Boston Marathon. Quick return to the apartment after running and easy access to all T stops and marathon festivities, even the Mile 27 after party."
All of this being said,I will warn you that the listing says it can sleep 4 people since it has a pull-out couch. I would NOT do this. The pull-out couch is VERY uncomfortable. Luckily,one of my friends,brought a fold-out cot so we used that and the shortest person in our group slept on the couch,not the pull-out bed. Also,you will need earplugs and a sleep mask
"Sean is a very good host and you can tell he cares about making sure you have what you need while staying in his apartment! \"",,,,,
1695275,71313033,2016-04-24,39080517,Alysse,Our stay overall was very good. The location is ideal and is exactly as described (over looks Fenway park). There are plenty of bars and food options close. Exactly what we need for our stay!!
1695275,71584639,2016-04-26,9307222,Carolyn,"Great location and a very reasonable price! Everything went smoothly, and I enjoyed looking out at the Home of the Red Sox.... Lots of light and a view of a vibrant neighborhood."
Sean gave very clear instructions,"and he provided coffee! All good.\"",,,,

We had an issue with the keys, but Sean was quick to help us out and spent a few minutes chatting. We will definitely come back here if we wind up in Boston again!"
1695275,72419106,2016-05-02,26655812,Sharon,Had a great time hanging out on and around Fenway Park. For baseball enthusiasts this is an excellent location. Keys easy to locate. Did not have any contact with Sean but all was smooth running. good value and nice to have a place to ourselves.
1695275,72954342,2016-05-05,39534375,Karthik,"Sean's place is extremely convenient and is located fairly close to the T, which makes getting around Boston really easy. The apartment itself is nice and cozy, and the amenities helped simplify my stay considerably. Sean was also super helpful with a minor key related issue that I had, which got resolved in less than half an hour with his timely help. I'd definitely go back here while visiting Boston again."
1695275,73943321,2016-05-11,10764562,Dominique,"Buena ubicación, adecuado para una pareja. Sin embargo, no es como aparenta en las fotos. El edificio es muy antiguo, las paredes están con la pintura gastada. Encontramos el departamento limpio."
1695275,75068443,2016-05-18,37846365,Daniel,"This was our first airbnb experience and it was a positive one. We did not meet Sean, but he was available by phone to assist with our checking in procedures. My wife and I stayed for a week, visiting for our son's graduation from Boston University and to take in some sites as well. The apartment matched the description although the kitchen only has enough room for one person at a time. The bed was very comfortable, especially with the thick quilt. Two grown sons stayed with us, but only one of them was there for any particular overnight. Each preferred the sofa sleeper as a sofa rather than a folded out bed."
We enjoy walking tours,and this location was very good. The T metro train is nearby,as is Boston University,many restaurants,and a nice park across the street where residents have garden plots. I took a walk there nearly every day. There is also a nearby Target where we bought a few groceries to have on hand. The neighborhood didn't sleep until after 2:00 a.m. due to post-baseball game parties and a big to-do at Jillian's Lucky Strike in view from the apartment. This is not a criticism; it depends on what you like. I found the area vibrant and we never felt unsafe. I would not hesitate to stay there again.,

1695275,75304408,2016-05-20,4602562,Anna,"It was a good stay. The couch was a bit difficult to figure out and the door, despite the warning by the host, proved to be rather difficult to deal with. Otherwise absolutely great."
1695275,76123890,2016-05-24,43050991,Holly,"The apartment was as advertised, and I think it was appropriately priced for what it is and the area. I would stay here again myself, but I would warn others who are light sleepers this may not be the best option for you, beside fenway stadium there are very popular bars in the area, equals late night noise. It was nice to see that it had necessary amenities and the basics that a hotel room would have."
1695275,77515760,2016-06-01,27753056,Jimmy,"Sean provided clear instructions regarding check in. He was also very generous allowing us to check in early. The location is convenient and safe, it is relatively close to colleges so a lot of students around. It is close to transport and the city."

The building is a little bit old and so the apartment, but well furnished and has a great view to Fenway statium. The only concern is the keys to access the building and the apartment, which is very challenge to first time users like me and it should be improved. Overally, we are satisfied with the stay, and thanks Sean for the host."

Tried to open the door and bend the key.When I called him for a new key and help he didn't help us at all. He was very angry and said that I had to hurry to pick up the key from his  house because he was busy.,,,,,
Old building,dirty,the AC makes a lot of noise,"and the worst is that the host has no intention to recieve anyone or explain anything. \"",,

We actually had an issue with one of the keys, and he was extremely easy to work with, and we had a new key from the building management within a few hours. Sean offered to drop of a spare in the in between time. The apartment is perfect for two people. Any more would be a squeeze. You definitely trade luxury for location, but since we planned on being out and about it worked well. The central location makes many places walkable, and you're close to two T stops in case you need to go any further. Certainly can't beat the view, either!"
Thanks for all your help,"Sean! I'll definitely consider staying here next time we're in Boston!\"",,,,
1695275,80051982,2016-06-15,41612559,Felicia,Sean was willing to let us drop our luggage off earlier than check in time. We had problems accessing the keys to the apartment & sent messages to Sean. We eventually had to call Sean to come help us access the keys and then had to struggle on our own to get our luggage to the apartment. There was a lift but it didn't stop on the floor of the apartment. The neighbourhood was safe & in a great location. The apartment was roomy and comfortable.

1695275,81012304,2016-06-20,33168611,Trey,We were only there for a short stay and Sean worked with us to help us not only regarding the space but also around parking since we had a car and parking is difficult in the area.

1695275,81509319,2016-06-23,55600376,Shawn,Everything was as advertised. If you just need a place to crash when going to Fenway this fills the bill! Fenway in view from apartment window! 24 hour parking in garage under Target store a couple blocks away is more reasonable than other game day lots
1695275,82690793,2016-06-28,64107026,Amy,"We really enjoyed our stay. Apartment was exactly as advertised. Sean was very detailed in his directions and yes the front door was a little tricky, but nothing that interfered with our stay.  The pull out was quite comfortable.  We didn't stay during a game but I never heard any real street noise. Very convenient location. Would definitely  stay here again."
1695275,83000627,2016-06-30,34082959,Natalia,First off the location was great. We had problems with the keys to enter the apartment block (with no notification regarding this) which took hours to fix with very little help from Sean. The apartment wasn't clean. A couple of lights didn't work and the toilet has a container to catch water because it leaks.
1695275,84524984,2016-07-07,140527,Gregg,"We never met Sean in person, but we found the key with no problem and got into the apartment with only a little key-related hassle.  The many reviews that mention trouble with the keys are not off-target; both keys and locks are cranky, although I made both of them work after some hassle.  Sean would be well-served simply to invest in new locks and keys and eliminate this as a potential negative."
Upon arriving in the apartment,I have to say that we were a bit disappointed.  The pictures put the property in its best possible light,and don't show the downsides.  The biggest negative is the bathroom,which is,well,shabby

1695275,86286833,2016-07-15,13181963,Courtney,Sean gave us detailed instructions on how to access the apartment and how to get there from the airport. The doors are a little tricky but it only takes a few tries to get used to them.

The size and location of the apartment for me were great, so close to Fenway and the T but quiet area. The place was clean, it was clear it had been done, including laundry, prior to my stay. Others are right though that the place is very tired and needs some updating and minor repairs to bring it back to a high standard. It has everything needed for a great stay so with a little attention would be fantastic. I wanted somewhere to crash after busy days in a good location that didn't cost too much (which is a big ask in Boston) and that's what I got."
1695275,90896930,2016-08-02,39683679,Aurélie,Great house in a great place. Very quiet and safe.

1695275,92945177,2016-08-10,34597761,Brian,"This was a full, air-conditioned apartment with a great location -- walking distance to Comm Ave and Mass Ave, and even a partial view into the grandstands at Fenway. The bed was comfy. We were there on a game night against the Yankees, and besides the occasional roar from the stadium, were not disturbed at all."
1695275,93158790,2016-08-11,23316951,Ashley,Great spot for a short stay. If you're looking for somewhere cheap to stay near Fenway this is in an ideal location.

The location was perfect,we rented a car and left it on the street what was very safe,but we also had a metro stop in front of the building..,,,
The only small issue was the wifi... kind of slow!!!,,,,,
I would definitely like back to this place!!!,,,,,

9460898,82940850,2016-06-30,26538836,Carol,"Will's apartment was great and just what we needed for the week! Very clean. Access to the apartment was super easy. Location couldn't have been better for easy access to the city, short walk to southie hot spots on west Broadway and the Starbucks right downstairs was key! Wifi had great connection and I was able to work from the apartment a few days. Having central AC during the summer time in Boston was great! Had all the basic amenities we needed. I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Boston."
9460898,85648289,2016-07-12,3699063,Sophie,The host canceled this reservation 15 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
9460898,95362687,2016-08-19,85382547,Kim,"The apartment exceeded our expectations. It was clean and modern with a great kitchen area. My husband and I enjoyed the bedroom while the kids, ages 20 & 21, made use of the fold-out couch in the living/kitchen area.  The apartment was located on the fourth floor and there is no elevator.  It was very hot outside, but the AC kept us plenty cool. The bathroom is spacious and the shower roomy. I really can't think of anything negative to say. There is a Starbucks directly across the street, right next to the MBTA train station, and a Dunkin Donuts a couple of doors down. Though the building also had other guests, we rarely saw them.  I really liked the code system that opened the main door and our apartment door. It was very convenient and I felt very safe."
11940785,91320533,2016-08-04,38436584,Holly,"Stayed at Shawn & Javier's house for five nights for the Boston leg of our New England summer vacation. The apartment was absolutely lovely and we had a wonderful time. I was excited to see how big the unit was -- bigger than I thought from the pictures. Very cozy and nicely decorated was plenty of room for my mom and I. Loved having a fully stocked kitchen, which helped us save money by cooking a few meals ourselves. You simply can't beat the location - just a few blocks to Boston Public Gardens and the orange and the green lines and right across the street from a bus stop. Plus, a CVS was right around the corner for essentials. Most importantly, Shawn and Javier were super accommodating and responsive. I'd love to stay here again."
11940785,99671103,2016-09-05,59205431,Carmen,"We LOVED this place. Well located, very clean, even better than what you see in the pictures! Shawn was always available through mail to answer any questions and the apartment had everything we needed. Perfect for 2! Thank you Shawn and Javier!!!"

820073,4191964,2013-04-17,267636,Danielle,"Chris and Kelly were the most perfect hosts!  They were already on vacation when we arrived, but arranged for a friend to met us at the condo to give us the keys.  Seamless transaction and their friend was awesome and helpful.  The condo is beyond gorgeous.  Looks even better than the pictures.  Both beds were very comfortable, which was greatly appreciated by our sore legs on Monday night.  The location was perfect as well.  Right next to the Red & Orange T lines and 1 block from the Blue & Green T lines.  Getting around Boston couldn't have been any easier.  Hopefully Chris and Kelly will go on vacation during the Boston Marathon next year so we can rent their condo again!"
820073,4963464,2013-06-04,5291489,Clay,"We had a great time staying at Chris & Kelly's loft for our family vacation in Boston.  Their place is in a great place...central to much of the activity in downtown Boston.  Literally 1 block away from the commons.  The T stop was right downstairs but there wasn't any noise in the loft itself.  We had two young kids (6 & 4 yrs old) and they did great.  The place was clean, cool, and convenient."
Also,Chris and Kelly were super nice and waited to greet us late Friday despite the fact we were later than expected due to a delayed flight.  They had great instructions and their beautiful home was very nice. It was our first AirBnB stay and we'll definitely do it again given this experience.,,,,
Thanks again Chris & Kelly!,,,,,

820073,7505606,2013-09-23,2701723,Jana,SUPER FANTASTIC!!
This is a beautiful,yet comfortable home right in the heart of Boston. You can walk to many areas and hop on the Tor subway right next door to venture out farther.,,,,
Chris and Kelly were great to work with through the whole process.,,,,,
The beds are very comfortable,and there is so much space for everyone,and a kitchen you can make breakfast or a full course dinner. The amenities just go on and on.,,,

"\"",,,,,
820073,7871547,2013-10-07,7151347,Doug,Wow!  Two couples made Chris and Kelly's loft our home for an extra long weekend to experience Boston's history and walkability.  It was exquisite from the luxurious furnishings and cleanliness to the location.  The living space is large and comfortable.  The kitchen is well stocked because it is their home and top grade appliances.  It even has an easy to use espresso machine.  We used the kitchen to make our breakfast and cooked a few dinners also.
The loft is on the 5th floor of a pedestrian-only street so it is quiet.  Step outside and you are in the center of Downtown at the corner of Washington and Summer streets.  One block from Boston Common where you begin the Freedom Trail and an 8 minute walk to Faneuil Hall.,,,,,
Both bathrooms were very large and having a washer/dryer available was a plus.  We quickly got rid of our concern about a murphy bed and it is very comfortable.,,,,,
We had easy communication with Chris and Kelly who really wanted us to have a great experience in their home and their home town.  They laid out a touring book marked up with locations and a information page that answered FAQ's about nearby conveniences,such as grocery stores,"wine shops and sights.  We would easily stay here again and do not hesitate to recommend it.  The photos and description are very accurate.\"",,,
820073,8566013,2013-11-05,8510165,Suzi,This is one stunning apartment! If you're looking for a perfect central Boston location that oozes style then this is the apartment for you.
I genuinely cannot fault the way in which Chris and Kelly went out of their way to help ensure we had all we needed in the run up to our trip,as well as the little insider tips they left for us which really helped us make the most of our first weekend stay in Boston.,,,,
We were a party of 4 adults,and this apartment provided the perfect base for our 3 night November stay. The high standard of everything within the apartment made us all feel that we were staying in a high end hotel! A very welcome retreat to head back to after taking in everything Boston has to offer.,,,,

Chris took the time to answer all my questions before booking, and even gave me great restaurant recommendations in the area.  Kelly kindly met us and gave us a quick run down/tour of the apartment  when we got there.  She was SO chill and not nervous or crazy about leaving her apartment to us for the weekend. They wanted to make sure that we were all settled in, and checked in with us to make sure we had everything we needed.  Even though they were in a place with bad cell service for the weekend, Chris and Kelly made sure that there was a way we could get through to them if we needed anything!"

The beds were quite comfortable.  We were supplied plenty of linens as well.,,,,,
Also the location was terrific. We could easily access red line and green line trains for our plans for the weekend. It was an easy cab ride to/from the airport as well as South Station (on the red line) for our friend arriving by bus.,,,,,

The apartment is exactly as you see it on the pictures, but in real life even better: so spacious, comfortable and perfectly located in the centre of Boston. We walked many times to different attractions (Boston Common, Faneuil Hall, Beacon Hill, Cheers and the Freedom Trail), but the subway was also easy to access; right outside of the apt is the Downtown Crossing station. Every contact with Kelly and Chris was very friendly and helpful. They gave us great tips prior to our stay and also checked to see if we needed anything during our stay.

They were kind to leave some goodies in the fridge and even checked in with us throughout the weekend. Also,"they were very quick to respond to any questions we had. Check in and out was a synch so this is the place to stay if you're coming to Boston--I highly recommend it. \"",,,,
820073,32971015,2015-05-24,12946403,Cindy,"Chris and Kelly were perfect hosts. We had no issues checking in or out. Kelly left us much needed drinks after a day of travel. Their place was in a great location and looks exactly like the website. My family walked the whole city of Boston, the flat is centrally located to many attractions and the T. We felt like we lived in Boston by the time we left. We loved the coffee house suggestions as well. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to be in the heart of it all."
820073,34556162,2015-06-09,32859285,Lana,"Best apartment I've ever found on Airbnb. Perfect location, easy to walk around and take subways. The apartment is big, clean, tidy and fancy! Like all their artworks. Staying here definitely made our trip more enjoyable!"

820073,36446234,2015-06-28,9007251,Lori,"The listing doesn't do this apartment justice, it is even more beautiful in person and absolutely perfect for anyone wanting to stay in downtown Boston.  You cannot possibly find a more convenient location.  Very comfortable beds, spacious modern bathrooms, and every question we could have had was covered in a convenient info sheet provided at check in.  I would highly recommend it to anyone!"
820073,37410758,2015-07-06,36993500,Kevin,This is a beautiful and spacious loft in a great location with very accommodating hosts.
820073,38250887,2015-07-14,1545127,Joe,"Chris and Kelly were outstanding hosts, making us feel welcomed and comfortable for our stay.  Their lovely home was beautiful and extraordinarily well-maintained, and it was a fantastic base for our family to use to explore Boston.  We will definitely stay again!"
820073,40146972,2015-07-28,18021851,Michael,"This was my first time using AirBNB.  The place was perfect.  The location is ideal if you want to see Boston, but also, to live: the T the grocery are on the block, and the movies, shopping and historical monuments are a few blocks away."
Chris and Kelly were ideal hosts.  Their place was as comfortable as any top end hotel,and cooler than any of them.  for a downtown apartment,"it was quiet and felt safe.  Would love to come back.  \"",,,
820073,40778699,2015-08-02,37266038,Julie,The pictures don't accurately represent the loveliness of this loft! Very clean and modern but still comfortable.  Chris was on hand to greet us and show us around the loft.  He even thoughtfully provided fruit and beverages in the frig.  The location was perfect for exploring Boston.  We walked or took the tube everywhere! We really enjoyed our stay!
820073,43971724,2015-08-23,17414748,Maya,"Very beautiful home, perfect place to relax. The kitchen was fully stocked which was great because of all the cooking we wanted to do. The showers were amazing, and the whole apartment was so neat and tidy."
820073,46031804,2015-09-07,644910,Dave,"Chris was a great host.  He was very communicative both before and during the stay.  He was always willing to help out with any requests, etc."
The apartment itself is incredibly nice -- just as described in the pictures.  I was also blown away by the artwork in the apartment.  I want to hire Chris to select art for my place!,,,,,
The one potential drawback (it was a meaningful drawback for my girlfriend):  the neighborhood is definitely still gentrifying and it felt a bit sketchy at first.  In the end,it was completely fine,but not a quintessential Boston neighborhood as one might imagine.,,,
In the end,I would absolutely recommend the apartment for anyone visiting Boston who is open to staying outside of the more traditional neighborhoods (e.g.,Back Bay,Beacon Hill,"etc.).   \"",
820073,47904629,2015-09-21,1118146,Melinda,"Excellent home and hosts. They were responsive to all of our qns, thy checked in on us to make sure everything is fine. Overall, we had a great experience. Thank you"

820073,51441673,2015-10-20,35002971,Nicole,"Chris and Kelly were wonderful hosts!  Communication was always fast and helpful.  Once we arrived, we were given a quick tour and an opportunity to ask questions about the loft and Boston.  Chris and Kelly thoughtfully provided us with fresh fruit and drinks, as well as a few great guidebooks of the neighborhood and Boston.  I didn't think this was possible, but the loft is even more beautiful in person.  The layout is so well-planned and comfortable, and the showers and beds were amazing!  A truly relaxing stay!  The location couldn't be better.  Close to all T lines, Boston Common, and literally seems to be in the center of everything.  Great hosts, great location, great city!"
820073,52003411,2015-10-25,14758810,Arianna,Chris and Kelly have been fantastic hosts even if they were already oversea when we arrived. They sent a personal friend to great us and walk though the house. we found little post-it here and there to help us doing things inside. Ear plugs were left at the bed side table in case the trash pick up in the alley would have bother us. the home decor is modern and full of character. Bucks and art are throughout . perfect kitchen organization everything needed cook a full meal is at your disposal. very clean home away from home. really appreciated!!
820073,54757261,2015-11-23,4097752,Raquel And John,Chris was an awesome host. Everything was extremely easy. They left detailed guidelines and were super accommodating. Their place is SO amazing and is so close to everything. It is extremely well decorated and very modern and clean. I will definitely stay here any time I come back to Boston in the future.
820073,68279311,2016-04-04,37789575,Pamela,"This was my first time using Airbnb and I think I am lucky to have my first experience with this host, Chris. The booking process, now 8 months ago, was a good interchange of information so that we both felt comfortable with who he was and who we were. My questions re location and how his condo's location would compliment my reason for staying in Boston were answered. Prior to our arrival date, just the right amount of information arrived for us to plan. A detailed description of our lodging arrived and all that we could expect: media, coffee making, laundry, housekeeping etc. As well a very good overview of surrounding stores we'd be looking for to make our stay an easy one. As well Chris assured us the Condo was well located in Boston and we can confirm that. Boston is a great historic walking city. As well the Subway was at our door step. Upon arrival we had fresh fruit on the counter, fresh flowers on the buffet and more than enough yogurt, milk, juice, eggs and beer to get us started. The Miele coffee machine was a big hit with my crowd and we exhausted the coffee supply just before leaving."
There were lots of towels and we had access to more. Supplies were easy to find. Hand soap and cream were at the sink and in the bathrooms. I always bring my own shampoo but there seemed plenty in the showers. This condo is so well located for a visit to Boston - I highly recommend it to anyone. We felt very safe as the streets of Boston now have a reassuring police presence and also Ambassadors  that help with directions etc. The condo's location is perfect. You are a block from Boston Common and a short walk to the high end shopping . The condo itself is very spacious and comfortable with large sofas facing a media area,a dinning area,a well equipped kitchen,two full sized bathrooms. In  the master bedroom,Chris left us with a small hanging space,a suitcase rack and fairly cleared surfaces to allow us to set up our personal items. The second sleeping area is a murphy bed in the living room which is cleverly done. The door which hides the bed also
We were very appreciative of the efforts Chris made to assure that our stay would be pleasant and comfortable. The condo is very interesting with art,great books,"comfortable seating.  We enjoyed a wonderful four days.\"",,,
820073,70637703,2016-04-19,21480944,Allen,Chris and Kelly are incredibly gracious hosts and treat their guests like rock stars! They leave detailed instructions on the condo and the neighborhood and make you feel welcome and at home.
820073,73497782,2016-05-08,2834168,Jessica,"2nd time staying at Chris & Kelly's - everything was literally perfect. The apartment is beautiful and spacious, great location (right next to the park!), they were so kind and generous with leaving some fridge items and helping immediately via phone when we needed help with the tv. A+!"

820073,90236641,2016-07-31,17630329,Helen,"Kelly met us when we arrived, which was after a delayed flight. She was very informative, had some great info on the best places to see/eat go to in Boston. There were some provisions in the fridge and fruit -overall we were made to feel very welcome. The loft is just brilliant, really well appointed, in a contemporary very stylish design. The linen and toiletries were very high standard. The location is suberb, we literally walked everywhere, even with our kids, although the T subway is moments away. I would strongly recommend Chris and Kelly's home - they really went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and welcome."

The little apartment was on the top floor of the house and had its own separate entrance. My daughter and I had plenty of room! The house is located in a very nice and quirky neighbourhood, 3 minutes from restaurants and bus stop and less than 10 minutes from the T station, 15 minutes ride to downtown by T, very convenient. After the hustle and bustle of Boston downtown, it was really nice to go back to a quieter area. Dave and Christina were such lovely hosts (thank you again for the lovely bottle of wine) and I would not hesitate to stay there if I were to go back to Boston. Very nice first experience of Airbnb."

Had everything we needed for our stay. The location is amazing: a relaxing grove hidden away in Boston. Jamaica Plain is both good to explore, possessed of all facilities and enjoys excellent transport links into central Boston. Would recommend highly to anyone looking for a relaxing base to explore Boston and surrounds."

Plenty of places to walk to for breakfast, and the roomy house is a quiet, secluded retreat in the evening. Just a 20 minute train ride to downtown. Dave was responsive to our needs. Would definitely stay here again."
7495866,52487974,2015-10-30,42992319,Adam,"My friend and I spent a wonderful week at Dave's apartment in Jamaica Plain. It was comfortable, cosy and in a really nice spot, with a well-equipped kitchen. Dave was welcoming and accommodating especially when our train was over two hours late during our journey there. The local area has a fantastic array of shops and restaurants. A perfect place to explore Boston from and a great place to relax."

The apartment was perfect for our needs, clean, spacious, good kitchen  and the location was great. There are stores ( i.e., Whole Foods) and restaurants in the local area, all within walking distance. Quiet location on a private road but just off the main road of JP making everything very convenient. Good communication before and during. We definitely will stay here again when we return."

Steps from the main street with lots of shops and restaurants and easy transport via bus or the T line into downtown Boston.  We came for the marathon and it was nice to get away from the main bustle of downtown.  Thanks so much for a great week!"
7495866,71400507,2016-04-25,62390804,Heather,"I had an excellent stay at this property in JP.  The accommodations are fairly simple.  A small bedroom,  roomy bathroom  and living room with kitchenette.   The real appeal of the property is the excellent location, tucked away off a side street in the center of Jamaica Plain.  The location is quiet & beautiful,  while still offering quick access to JP Center as well as other parts of Boston  via public transportation.   Dave was welcoming, and picking up & dropping off keys was simple & friendly.   I would definitely recommend this  property."

7495866,81011809,2016-06-20,5187388,Gael,"This is a beautiful apartment on the 3rd floor of a beautiful house, in a beautiful neighborhood. The hosts are perfectly adequate.  The walk up from the train station is a bit much with bags, and in the heat, in hind sight an Uber would have been great. Jamaica Plain is a fun area, great recreation and restaurants. We ate at the Noodle House twice, loved The Sam Adams brew tour and lunch at Doyle's and the very nearby reservoir has a nice paved walking trail. Public transportation is nearby but the ride into Boston is about 45 minutes. An Uber is only about 10 minutes and was $11."

The unit is spacious with a modern kitchen and bath. It also has a  lovely garden and sitting porch.  It is very conveniently located  to Jamaica Pond, Centre street shops, markets and restaurants and to subway to downtown and bus to BackBay. The weather was very warm and the a/c was definitely a plus."
7495866,89340928,2016-07-28,50391734,Jenna,"The apartment is well appointed. The bathroom and  kitchen are nicely renovated. The bedroom is small but comfortable.

7495866,96997241,2016-08-25,12875705,Audrey,"L'appartement est très agréable et situé dans un quartier magnifique. Il faut marcher une dizaine de minutes pour atteindre le métro. Ensuite en quinze minutes on est au centre de Boston. Appartement calme, grand, propre et bien équipé. Je recommande! Les propriétaires sont très discrets, peut-être même un peu trop. L'accueil est un peu distant. Personnellement ça ne nous a pas dérangé mais pour ceux qui chercheraient à créer du contact avec les hôtes, passez votre chemin."

It was exactly as advertised and she made us feel very at home and relaxed. The location in Jamaica Plain is great and suited us down to the ground. A lovely part of Boston. The icing on the cake? The company of her two adorable cats! Would highly recommend."
10116429,59940339,2016-01-17,2383077,Zung,"Kara; and the rental company she works for were professional and responsive. The serviced building was great, in a good location, spacious, with quality interior. For a business trip, it's the best I could ask for."

Emery is very kind and he can even give you very good advices for tours and meals! Everything was perfect for me and I would definitely recommend this room when you want to visit Boston. He even made me a healing tea when I was sick. The location is excellent! Near to Prudential Center and Symphony Orchestra. Close to Berklee College, Boston College and Northeastern University."
11583581,71263146,2016-04-24,6165269,Nick,"Location was great and host was very pleasant and accommodating.   The place was not what I expected as it is a one bedroom apartment where the guest stays in the bedroom while the host stays in the living room behind a room divider. The room is literally just a bed and a tv, which doesn't have cable and a small personal collection of DVDs. Luckily we had things to do all day and were only there to sleep otherwise there is no place to sit, no place to eat food if you brought something back.  Nothing."
Also if you are a light sleeper this is close to college life so it's noisy until 1-2am on weekends.  Didn't bother me but may some.,,,,,
Emery did greet us and even walked us around the corner to show us where some decent restaurants were which was nice.,,,,,

11583581,75822200,2016-05-23,72515644,Mark,The room is exactly how it looks in the picture. Very basic and simple. Emery is super nice and makes for a great host!! He was provided a warm welcome and offered something to drink right upon arrival. He showed me around town and gave some good suggestions for places to eat. The bed is not the most comfortable in the world but good enough. The TV and small stack of movies is a nice touch but it didn't have basic channels nor an internet connection for Netflix or anything.
11583581,76604631,2016-05-28,6507307,Jan,Good service from the beginning to the end. Quick replies on my messages. I highly recommend to stay at Emerys place
11583581,77007648,2016-05-30,32855381,Yao,Emery's place locates right next to downtown yet is quiet. The room is neat and street parking is provided. My friend did enjoy that two nights' stay.
11583581,77351321,2016-05-31,32855381,Yao,As written in my other review Emery's place was great.
11583581,77837145,2016-06-03,63556805,Hsin-Fu,"My experience was good overall. The room was exactly what you would expect from the website. Emery was nice even we did not have chances to chat. The internet was not working during the time I stayed, which is the minus I would give."
11583581,79194410,2016-06-11,7010184,Daniel,The apartment was very clean and everything was set up by the time I arrived.  Emery was very understanding when my bus arrived 2 hours late to Boston.  He was very communicative and willing to be accommodating.
11583581,79955829,2016-06-15,72031993,Henry,"I was very confortable here. The apartment is near of everything. Very clean and quiet. I recommend it!!! Emery is a great host, very friendly. If you want to stay in Back bay, this is your place."
11583581,80649322,2016-06-19,4129854,Jon,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
11583581,81199644,2016-06-21,3226125,Monique,"very convenient location, generously sized room and lots of wardrobe space. a bit of noise from other apartments. the bed was 'crackly' thanks to a plastic cover but otherwise decently comfortable. clean bathroom, small but adequate kitchen. Emery was a very accommodating host!"
11583581,81657496,2016-06-24,67814350,Jessica,Emery was very accommodating with our crazy schedule. Room was as described and location was great!
11583581,91005774,2016-08-03,75649819,Alissa,"The room is basically just like the picture.  Nothing fancy, but you get a bed, desk, and TV and Emery was very accommodating.  I was visiting a college on the Fenway and the location was very convenient; I was able to walk everywhere I needed to go.  Everything was very clean and although the apartment is in a college area, I didn't have any issues with noise while staying there.  Definitely recommend!"
11583581,91314753,2016-08-04,6232427,Thurston,"Emery was a great host, very accommodating, hospitable and helpful; especially considering how busy he was."
11583581,92401495,2016-08-08,57015051,Shifaan,"The listing was exactly as described. The bathroom, room and the kitchen were all very clean. So were the bedding and towels provided. It was a great location for exploring this part of Boston. Although I didn't personally meet Emery, he made sure I was able to get into the apartment when I first arrived and also was responsive to all messages during my stay."
11583581,93164875,2016-08-11,80710017,Rafael,"Emery was very nice. The location is perfect and close to major key spots in Boston. I went mainly to watch the Red Sox and the apartment is a 10-15 minute walk to Fenway which was great. The only downsides were that the mattress was wrapped in plastic which made it very hot and there is no AC. However, I noticed that it is very common to have no AC in Boston."
11583581,97343347,2016-08-27,62013147,Hunter,"Emery was a good host and the room was as expected, however there did occur some miscommunication between us during our stay. We had asked if we could stay until the late afternoon the following day, and he confirmed, but called us the next morning claiming we needed to leave at that very moment. I feel that our experience was good, but better communication could have been had with our host."
6645010,35342784,2015-06-17,35224330,Ayush,"Liz is a very good host, the place is comfortable to stay and close to Jackson Square Station, so easy to get to Downtown and most of the places in Boston!"
6645010,35742406,2015-06-21,21960821,Christina,Liz was super nice! We had a long flight overnight and asked to check in earlier and she agreed and that was a life saver!
She provided towels and was in general really nice!,,,,,
Downtown Boston is a 15- minute walk to the Jackson station and a 20- minute subway ride.,,,,,
Her son Lucian is absolutely adorable. Friendly and nice!,,,,,

6645010,39182138,2015-07-21,34870144,Tuan,"Liz and Lucian were great hosts. They made me feel at home from the moment of arrival. They were very welcoming, and accommodating to all my needs. The room was spacious and well kept, no complaints from me. Liz provided towels, clean linens, and access to laundry whenever I needed it. I would recommend this airbnb to any one looking for a clean place and pleasant company. Bus stops and trains are within walking distance, so commuting to the city wasn't a big issue for me."
6645010,40404280,2015-07-30,3664362,John,"Liz and Lucian made us feel very welcome. Despite a minor misunderstanding with the check-in time she was there to greet us when we arrived. We slept very comfortably in the guest room and had no issues with street noise, etc. The neighborhood appeared at first to have a hard urban exterior but as we walked to the bus stop we were greeted by very friendly neighborhood residents. Proximity to city center via public transportation worked out great."
6645010,41970659,2015-08-10,33953416,HyunWoo,Cozy and clean room! Not far from metro station and easy to access to downtown. Liz and lucian were kind and welcomed us. I love this place
6645010,42479368,2015-08-13,40464617,Sophie,"Der Aufenthalt bei Liz und Lucian war unsere erste airbnb-Erfahrung und wir haben uns direkt Willkommen gefühlt. Bei unserer Ankunft hat Liz uns sofort Abendessen, welches sie gerade frisch zubereitet hatte, angeboten. Die Wohnung war genau wie beschrieben, das Zimmer war groß und gemütlich eingerichtet. Die Nachbarschaft war sehr multikulturell und die U-Bahn nach Boston war gut zu erreichen."
Liz war sehr hilfsbereit,hat bei Regen sofort einen Schirm angeboten und Tipps für den Aufenthalt gegeben.,,,,

6645010,44574985,2015-08-27,22853475,Katerina,Liz and Lucian were excellent hosts and the room is beautiful exactly as pictured. Great family! Would love to stay again should I get the opportunity to travel there once more.
6645010,45607314,2015-09-04,42108899,Mike,"Liz wasn't home when we got to town, however she left us instructions to get settled in. A bustling neighbourhood, yet quiet street. Our room was just what we were looking for. A short walk to the subway, and amenities. We didn't get much time to interact with Liz and Lucian but they were very gracious hosts and it was a pleasure to be able to stay with them"
6645010,46157413,2015-09-08,7125978,Kara And Austin,"Liz was very flexible and last minute let us come a day earlier than we had originally scheduled, which we really appreciated! The bed is very comfortable and the room clean, but not having a door took a little getting used to. Everything was exactly how it was represented in the description."
6645010,47037583,2015-09-15,33042870,Jonathan,"Pretty much as described. It was easy to find when driving and there was plentiful on street parking. The building appears to be a late 19th/early 20th century house, of which the apartment makes up the ground floor. The room is the former front room, the kitchen and bathroom are shared with Liz and Lucian. Liz and Lucian were very welcoming and understanding of our late arrival. The room is of reasonable size, probably best suited to a couple travelling although we fit three adults in there with little difficulty."
The building is about 10-15 minutes from the subway station,a further 20 minutes on the train to central Boston.,,,,
"We enjoyed our stay and the opportunity it gave to explore Boston.\"",,,,,
6645010,48108679,2015-09-23,43036787,Jerry,"The room was clean and comfortable, and the host, her son, and the neighbor were relaxed, friendly, and helpful.  The house and neighborhood are modest, but safe and close to large and beautiful Franklin Park."
6645010,49129124,2015-10-01,23228189,Luan,"Liz和Lucian Yahn,是非常好的房主,家里整洁而干净,生活健康而又规律,对客人非常友善,那个可爱的帅哥,后来非常健谈,与我们聊他的学习与生活,他们对中文和中国功夫都非常感兴趣!非常欢迎你们来中国!"
6645010,49641168,2015-10-05,27767921,Roland,"Liz received us very friendly. She was a very nice and helpful host. Her son Lucian is a cute young man. The room has the right size to feel good. The location is nearly perfect to explore Boston Downtown. The T-Line is close to reach by foot. We enjoyed the 3 days in Boston very much. Thanks to Liz an Lucian and greetings from Freistaat Bayern, Margit and Roland"

6645010,50665690,2015-10-13,41778869,Yan,"We stayed Liz's house for three days, leave at morning and  back at night. The location is close to a big park and ~ 15 mints walking distance to the subway station or take a bus , just 5 mints to the station.  The whole feeling for these three days is so comfortable and  like stay at own home.  Liz could provide the exact traveling information which  you need, but also leave you enough private space if you want to rest.  I like this house."
"Simon & Yan \"",,,,,
6645010,51448386,2015-10-20,41526692,Steffi,Nice room for a shorter stay in Boston.
6645010,51732362,2015-10-24,14163620,Jimmy,"Liz was a great host, she was vary patient of answering our questions."
The room and bathroom were also clean. Parking was easy on the street. Everything was good except no door of our room,"needed time to get used to it. \"",,,,
6645010,52849113,2015-11-02,41949044,Valentin,"We stayed four nights and even if we were out most of the time we really enjoyed our stay. The room is nice and the bed confortable. The area was pretty quiet, it is not far from the bus or the subway and it is incredibly easy to park. Liz was helpful and accomodate for our arrival. Liz and Lucian are definitely good hosts."
6645010,53499208,2015-11-09,10080345,Tara,"Clean, comfortable and cozy. Exactly what we needed for our business trip to Boston. We didn't interact much with them because we were gone for most of the day but Liz was very warm and hospitable when we did see her."
6645010,57601119,2015-12-27,9372563,Yuan,"Liz was really nice and welcomed us with clear information about her place. She was really patient helping us find the right place at night, since we got a wrong address at the first time. The community where Liz lives is quite and safe. We can find a parking space easily right outside the house. The only thing is that the house is a little bit far away from the subway station, but it is a walking-distance if you dont mind walking for about 15-20mins. We had great experience in Liz's house."
6645010,67533925,2016-03-30,45676760,Quan,I stayed at Liz's house over the spring break with my girlfriend. We loved staying at the house. It was a quirky vegan place that really inspired us to learn more about veganism. We definitely recommend the house to anyone who's looking for a great place to stay in Boston.
6645010,68880577,2016-04-07,36250089,Jimena,Tuvimos una muy buena estancia en la casa de Liz y Lucian!!
Las mejores cosas: los dueños de casa,el contacto con el veganismo,la experiencia  en un barrio multirracial.,,,
Cosas a tener en cuenta: la habitación no tiene puerta,sino un biombio,aunque ello no representó ningún problema,pues está ubicada en la entrada de la casa y los anfitriones son muy respetuosos.,,

1835533,8397897,2013-10-28,2637497,Cyndie,"We did not have the chance to meet David but his apartment was very well situated and quiet. Nothing fancy, the place was exactly what we needed: a place to sleep at night. It was simple to communicated with David."
1835533,14713283,2014-06-24,15551811,Alison,David's place is in a perfect location super close to restaurants and pubs ;) his place wasn't ready when we arrived but he was lovely and we just popped around the corner for a burger. felt very safe there it's within a secure building :) it's cosy and right near Newbury street and a small walk to the public gardens so awesome for a week of shopping and relaxing!
"\"",,,,,
1835533,15380163,2014-07-07,17596402,Ryan Gerald,"As this was our first time in Boston and wanted to see many parts of Boston, we couldn't have asked for a better location. David's apartment is situated in a centrally-located spot that gives you great access to Boston as well as easy access to places like Brookline or Cambridge."
We walked,biked,and bused to and from David's apartment. All were super easy options. The apartment is right next to both the Charles River Esplanade and the Commonwealth Avenue Mall and both provide great walks to and from the center of Boston. There's a bus stop nearby that can take you into the heart of Cambridge (via Massachusetts Ave) that was a smooth experience for us. And there's also multiple Hubway (Boston's bike share program) stations within a 3-block radius that make it easy to get just about anywhere.,,,
The apartment itself was great. Since our days were packed and we only came back to sleep and shower,we just wanted something comfortable and no-hassle—and it was. The king-size bed let us sleep like babies and the shower was hot and powerful. Also notable: the apartment is very quiet. There were no noise disturbances from the neighboring apartments nor from outside.,,,,
All things considered (the host,the apartment,"the experience): highly recommended!\"",,,
1835533,16162537,2014-07-22,16728408,Yini,Our stay at David's place is great. The studio itself is clean and cozy and had everything we need. The location is awesome. It's close to everything. We used mostly the public transportation which is just one block away to get around. Definitely recommend David's place :)
1835533,18020878,2014-08-20,18997284,Jeffrey,"Unpleasant. The dirty clothes stuffed under the chair, the overabundance of stuff pouring out of a closet, the profanity displayed on the walls, no top sheet under a quilt that, who knows if it was clean, the lack of bed pillows, the mis-matched and stained towels, the street construction not allowing me to park my car anywhere nearby, the mosquitos, it being more of a dorm room set-up extended into a rabbit warren of a dark underground basement. It sucked."
1835533,18487419,2014-08-27,19171562,Katherine,"David's place was great! It's located in a safe area+building, its cozy, and convenient. Located within walking distance to Fenway Park, and right across the street from a T, so it was very easy to get around. Also within comfortable walking distance to the shopping areas of Boylston and Newbury St. David himself is extremely helpful and easy to reach, and responds to questions very quickly. I highly recommend staying at his place!"

The apt is located It is a few minute walk from the Subway,Boston University and around lots of shops and restaurants.,,,,

1835533,20018345,2014-09-22,19565020,Loïc,I had a great time in Boston.
David's place was as described. Nothing particularly fancy,but if like me you just want a place for yourself to rest & sleep at,it's perfect. The location is really convenient,the neighborhood is pleasant. I found everything to be well within range of a walk,but you can always use the subway (kenmore station is what? 200m far maybe) as a cheap & convenient way to move around too.,

1835533,20439538,2014-09-29,16002985,David,David was very helpful and his apartment is very well located.
But for a couple as us we found some problems:,,,,,
1. It is a basement without too much light and the windows face to an alley with the garbage very near.,,,,,

1835533,22074708,2014-10-29,9024207,Azuria,"David's place was just as he described it to be. It wasn't ready when we arrived so we popped over to have a much needed cup of coffee across the street. The apartment was perfect for the 3 of us as we were there to just rest and sleep. The apartment is conveniently located near Kenmore station, Fenway Park as well as the Charles River Esplanade which was perfect for our morning runs. Plenty of nice restaurants around the area too. We rented a car and finding a parking overnight just outside the apartment building was easy (or it could just be our luck)."
David was responsive,quick at replying to any of our queries and also came up with suggestions for places to go in the area,"or possible day trips to do. I highly recommend his apartment for people who are looking for a conveniently located place to move around Boston and sleep.\"",,,

Had some troubles checking in and with keys, was a bit hard to coordinate with David as he was not in Boston so was left without a key to the main door to the building which was inconvenient. However David did try to help as much as possible and his neighbour was very helpful and friendly. Without the issue with the key it would have been a perfect experience."

David nos encontró en New York para darnos las llaves,pero cuando llegamos al departamento en Boston,no estaba listo. Todo sucio,la cama con sábanas usadas,toallas sucias,la heladera llena de comida vencida
Debimos ponernos a lavar sábanas y todo,limpiar antes de poder descansar.,,,,
Aparte de eso,es cierto que el lugar está muy bien ubicado,tiene lo necesario,la calefacción funciona bien.,,

I only heard back from him with instructions on how to get access a couple of hours prior to check in on day of arrival. It made me feel like  I should look at an emergency last minute hotel. The place was what I expected based on the description- a little dingy, but with the essentials.  The location and proximity to Fenway, rail and places of interest is great. Overall, I would rate the experience as a C-.  If communication was better it would have been a B. When I left, I forgot to return the key to the lockbox and had to leave it with a nearby shopowner.

However i would only suggest to stay here with 1 or 2 people as it was much too cramped and small for 3. Communication with David was not very good via email, however we didn't try ringing or texting. If you are after basic facilities and don't plan on being in the room too much then this place is fine. The location is fantastic and very close to a subway stop. It would have been nice for David to have some info about the area in the apartment as there wasn't any."

The apartment was adequately clean but the decor was low-budget--it lacked ambience.  Communications with the host were impersonal; this is obviously a business venture, not a traditional Airbnb."

At least for me. down the hall is a toilet and bath with everything necessary for me and opposite the kitchen where my two landladies tried to make me feel comfortable. And I did. Also because the apartment is very close to Boston University, where I had buisness to do and it is in a nice area in the western part of Boston with an ecological restaurant just opposite and the music club Paradise Music Club just up the road with the tram which was running right outside the main door. The only downside was that the landlord with the key wasn't around until 6 PM on the day I arrived (at 2 PM). But then I found that restaurant called Bee's Knees Supply Co where I had lunch my first whole weekend in Boston."

531552,1650331,2012-07-07,2622680,Natalia,The Victoria Condo 2 BR house and furnishings are great and it is an easy 15 minute drive to downtown Boston; 10 minute walk to the subway; the area is a bit dodgy though; check-in and check-out were easy and Swank Properties were responsive to questions.
531552,1936745,2012-08-09,2812203,Ryan,"We stayed at the mansion (its the only way to describe it!) on Peverell Street. I would highly recommend Lance's apartments. Shawn met us when we arrived, gave us his cell number and was there to say goodbye when we left. Its got three full bedrooms, dining room, tv salon, fully equipped kitchen., washer, dryer.... Great. You can book when them a feel assured that they will look after you."
531552,2053502,2012-08-21,1819684,Anna,Lance and Shawn were awesome!
We stayed at the Victoria Condo after the initial property we contacted Lance for,"was booked. My friends and I enjoyed the place a lot. More than enough room for six people. The neighborhood area we stayed in wasn't rated the best according to the locals but we differ. We met the neighbors and they were very friendly and the street is quite peaceful. Overall we had a nice time in Boston. The \"\"T\"\" is just walking distance into the city. \"",,,,
531552,2122469,2012-08-28,2642278,Riccardo,"Unfortunately, probably due to an error in communication, nobody was waiting for us on our arrival at the apartment and could not gain access to it. We had sent a mail to Mr. Lance the day before, confirming our arrival in the afternoon and we received an automatically generated answer. As nobody showed, we had to wait a long time and only thanks to some neighbours, who knew Mr. Lance and could therefore find a second key, we managed to get in. The day after we received a mail from Mr. Lance, saying that we should have received, months ago, a mail containing all instructions as to where we could find the key, ecc. We never received it, and when we asked him to re-send it with the original date, he could not find it. So something went wrong in the communication; anyway we solved the problem and Mr. Lance apologized for the inconvenient."
As far as the apartment concerns,we can say that it's very nice,clean,confortable and furnished with good taste. What annoyed us,anyway,was the sleeping accommotations. The apartment was said to have 6 sleeping accommotations. We had pointed out that we were 6 adults. Actually the sleeping accommodations are 5: there are two bedrooms with a Queenbed in each

531552,13413243,2014-05-27,13539694,Sarah,Lance replies promptly and the house is large with plenty of space.  The neighborhood is not the best but we had no problems.  You should be aware that the 3rd bed (futon) is in a room off the second bedroom and there is no door separating them.

The apartment was as described placed in the basement. We didn't use the kitchen at all. The bathroom was ok,but had no outlet at all for e.g. hairdryer - with two girls an issue.,,,,
In addition the electricity in the whole apartment looked quite self installed with cables hanging around,but everything worked.,,,,
It was great that we could store our luggage in the hallway after checking out.,,,,,
A big plus was the location of the apartment in the North End directly at the Freedom Trail and only a 5 min walk to the next subway station and just a short taxi ride to the airport. Luckily we gave back our rental car the day after our arrival as parking there is definitely an issue.,,,,,
As we were out the whole day and didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment,"it was fine for us.\"",,,,

1615033,7709619,2013-09-30,263410,Julie,"The LOCATION is the absolute best for a day or two in the North end of Boston.  However if you're a light-sleep (as I am) this might not be the best place for you.  The bed is beneath the stairwell that others use to enter & exit the building.  Additionally the recycling bin is located outside the one window to the basement efficiency.  Bring earplugs!!!  To reiterate, the location is absolutely perfect if you want to be in the heart of Boston's Italian district.  Waking up to the glorious sound of the church bells at the famous North Church was exhilarating.  Grab yourself a good cup of espresso and you can make up for the possible lack of sleep.  We appreciated being granted a slightly later check-out so we could grab a quick nap/shower before heading out for a day of walking on the Freedom trail.  If you have a small portable noise machine, BRING IT!"

For starters,it's a fair walk walk about 10-15 minutes from Haymarket,which is further than the owners suggested,and is a big deal when you're schlepping a suitcase through the narrow streets of the North End.,,
The apartment itself is in a lovely area,but it's in the basement and appears to have been built haphazardly as an extra space. You get to it by walking down an awkward narrow flight of stairs from a tiny entry way barely large enough to stand in. The space itself consists of a single room,with kitchenette,couch,bed,and dining table with two chairs.
It's dark and there is only one small window for natural light.,,,,,
The mattress is uncomfortable making sleeping difficult.,,,,,
The carpet on the stairs and the main room aren't the same,and the one in the main room has a huge crease where they put two remnants together to make it fit and save as much money as possible. The furniture is dormitory chic with a hodgepodge of cheap lamps,plastic tables and a Target couch. There's no TV.,,,
The apartment has lots of exposed wires and the bathroom walls consist of exposed drywall. It appears to have been built by some people over a weekend without attention to detail and with little talent for handiwork.,,,,,
The floors in the kitchen and bathroom are the cheapest grade vinyl you are likely to find.,,,,,
The toilet is jammed into a tiny space between the unfinished drywall and the shower. The bathroom lacks a shelf to place your toiletry kit,something that's easy to add.,,,,
There are exposed wires and the thermostat is broken.,,,,,
Overall,it's serviceable and the location was fantastic,but that's about all I can say about it. I wouldn't stay here again,nor would I recommend it unless you have extremely low standards.,,

I would reiterate what others have said about the noise from neighbors. The apartment has a thin ceiling so if you don't sleep deeply you do hear people coming and going into the building. Luckily I sleep very deeply so it wasn't an issue for me at all. Also a point of note is that the studio doesn't have much natural light as it's below sidewalk level. this was fine for me as I was only there at night,but you may want to take this into consideration.,,,,

1615033,10754308,2014-03-05,12111225,Frank,"Our one night stay was fine. While we wouldn’t have wanted to spend any more time in the apt. than necessary, it proved to be okay for our purposes, which essentially was a bed and bath for the night. The bed was fairly comfortable, but the futon/couch was far from it. My wife was a little put off by the sign near the entrance warning of rats in the alleyway, and the closet door that fell off when she touched it. I had to remind her that we were not at the Ritz, and our initial foray into Airbnb was an adventure of sorts.  My only word of caution is that people in the apt. above (this was a basement apt.) can be heard as if they are in the same room as you. This includes every footstep etc.  We were glad that we had remembered to bring along earplugs.  Overall, it was a pretty much Spartan, but adequate. Jose was very pleasant to deal with."
1615033,10841214,2014-03-10,11554894,Julie,"The apartment is as described by Jose and Jason.  It is an 8 minute walk to North Station and a two minute walk to all the best Italian restaurants!

The bed is very comfortable and the shower was surprisingly strong powered.  The check-in process is really easy and generally it was a no headache stay.
"As in other comments you do hear people coming and going out of the building but seriously if you are there to sightsee it's no problem as you tend not to be there too much anyway!  Also the spare futon is very uncomfortable.  Our third person ended up just sleeping on the floor as it was more comfortable.  They could use some kind of extra padding there but I am sure they will accommodate it if you ask.  They are responsive.\"",,,,,

1615033,12751880,2014-05-10,13752983,Traci,This apartment is truly in the best location in the whole of Boston! Surrounded by cafes restaurants and take outs! It's in the heart of Little Italy. It was clean and cosy. The downside is that if you spend time in the accommodation it is claustrophobic and dark. It is below ground(typical of many inner city apartments) the only natural light is one window one foot high which cannot be left open for safety! Convenience 10/10 ambience not so good.
1615033,12872280,2014-05-12,15198966,David,"Jose was very accommodating with our stay. Access to the apartment is very private just off the street. When you come out in the morning you are literally a stones throw away from the Old North Church (one of the features on the Freedom Trail). Bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was ample (good pressure in shower). There is a working fridge and basic kitchenette with limited appliances.The apartment itself only has one window but I have no idea why someone would want to spend a lot of time indoors when you have the Freedom Trial and the rest of Boston to explore during the day, and lots of good eats and bars in the North End at night. If you love seafood or Italian then you have come to the right place!! In terms of subway Haymarket and North Station both within easy walking distance. Note that we found subway was very easy to get around on and you can catch it to Haymarket from the airport with only one line change (n.b. free transfer bus from airport to airport subway station available) . To top it off, Jose was flexible (where he could be) with checkout so we could leave our bags slightly longer while we explored some more. If you are in Boston for exploring then I highly recommend this place as a cost effective base for operations."
1615033,13002846,2014-05-17,13560318,Emmy,"This place is very well located and is a small flat so you have a kitchen with microwave and stove, very convenient when you stay for a few days."
Unfortunately,there were inconvenients that didn't make this stay very enjoyable. The bed was nice but the folding couch was horrible to sleep on! I couldn't believe how uncomfortable that was! You could feel all the metal underneath,it was probably better to sleep on the ground. Also,"the place wasn't very clean: the fridge was empty but hadn't been cleaned and the bathroom was very dusty and there were still hairs in the sink. We never saw our host and there was barely any sightseeing information in the place. I admit I was hoping for something better when I made the reservation.\"",,

My friends and I had a flaky moment where we accidentally showed up a day early for the apartment and called him late at night. He was very helpful and actually set us up with one of his other properties that was great for one night before we can check into the Freedom Trail place. The location was perfect literally steps away from the Old North Church such a fun area. I'm not ashamed to say that my friends and I ate at Mike's pastry every morning because it was just a block away.  Our flight was late on monday and he let us keep our bags in the apartment hallway so that we didn't have to lug them around the city all day. The experience was awesome, I definitely recommend it!"

1615033,14426751,2014-06-19,5994061,Wendy,"Jason was very helpful as I planned for my trip; I appreciate his kindness. The apartment is in a great location and was clean and tidy. I had inquired if the apartment had a fan, and Jason graciously provided a small oscillating fan on the nightstand. Because the apartment is in the basement, this space may not be comfortable for tall guests, as the bathroom doorway and the sloped ceiling above the staircase are very low. Also, if you use more than 1 towel for showering or will be staying an extended period of time, you will want to request extra towels. While the temperature of the apartment was comfortable, I could find no thermostat or air vents for air conditioning. (The heat source is baseboard units.) I would recommend this apartment in light of the cost and convenience to the beautiful city of Boston as well as my positive interaction with the host."
1615033,14567971,2014-06-22,6092053,Leonel,Really nice neighborhood. Everything was as i expected. I recomend it
1615033,14805559,2014-06-26,1252196,Zac,"Amazing apartment in amazing location! Very clean, comfortable, with great lighting and exposed brick. Right across from old north church and down the street from best cannoli in Boston (bovas....I lived in Boston for 5 years). Super convenient to walk to everything, close to T train lines, and plus, north end is the best little Italy in North America! Super convenient and easy to check in and out and would definitely stay here again!"

I could even store my luggage on the day of my departure,as my flight was going out in the evening. That was perfect for me. Thank you!,,,,
The one-room-appartment was very cosy and had lots of flair with it's brick walls.,,,,,
It's in the basement,but has a window to Hull street court.,,,,
The area is indeed just perfect. Safe,quiet,and Little Italy just around the corner.,,,
"Definitely recommend it.\"",,,,,
1615033,15104093,2014-07-02,16136306,Adela,"A big thank you to Jason and Jose for making my stay in Boston wonderful. The apartment is very tidy. It is equipped to make small meals and has a decent size fridge to store groceries. Even in the hot humid summer the apartment remained nice and cool (there was also a fan available for use. The location was amazing. It is a 5 minute walk to North Station (the closest subway station) and located two minutes away from little Italy. Within a 10 minute walk you cam access multiple top rated restaurants and bakeries im Boston. You are located also on the Freedom Trail, right in front of the Old North Church."
"Jose and Jason were great hosts. The location of the apartments was convenient and accessible. \"",,,,,
1615033,15172842,2014-07-04,2639820,Preston,"The location of this basement apartment is superb. It's so close to all of the best Italian restaurants in Boston (in the North End), but it is about a 10-15  min walk to the nearest T station. I was a extremely disappointed, however, that I paid for  a place that advertised as being air conditioned, and upon arrival, there was no air conditioning. I would have liked a warning from the host about the lack of air conditioning, but only after I contacted the host did he apologize and said I would have it the next day. I did receive the air conditioning unit the next day, which was much needed since temperatures were in the high 90's and I couldn't go outside without sweating due to the humidity. Overall, a good bang-for-your-buck apartment in a good location."

Perfect location-  we were able to walk everywhere in the city from here with no issues. The North End is an adorable neighborhood. The apartment had everything we needed and was a comfortable stay.

While the apartment did not provide any special accommodations, the price for the location was unbeatable. We were able to walk out the door and be right on the Freedom Trail, and be walking distance to fantastic restaurants in the North End. I would stay at this apartment again, and highly recommend it."

1615033,17503681,2014-08-13,15920243,Marina,"First of all, the good points: location really is excellent, in the Italian neighborhood, lots of restaurants and cafés, and Freedom Trail very very close. And easy convenient check-in."
Then of course the not so good point,but for which we were prepared for: it is below street level,very dark,so not convenient for people who intend to stay inside (which was not our case,so we had no problem with that).,
Finally the not so good aspects,for which we were absolutely not prepared for: the place is very shabby,when we arrived the towels and some sheets had holes or (though probably freshly laundered) old stains. I have to admit that the owners immediately replaced with new clean ones when we mentioned that we would not use these. Very important point for future travellers which was really a detrimental issue for us: the sofa,announced as usable as 2nd bed for a 3rd person,"is honestly impossible to sleep on (huge iron bars poking in your whole body all night). \"",
1615033,17671632,2014-08-16,13869397,Teresa,"We loved the location and the place provided what we expected. We took in the city and used the place to sleep, enjoy breakfast and relax in the evening. Not a place of luxury but a great shower. Wifi provided the opportunity to watch movies on our iPads."
1615033,18026520,2014-08-20,19408423,David,This place was absolutely perfect for our needs. The location in the North End is convenient to the T and to get meals at great restaurants. It was great having a full apartment as we could cook breakfast or lunch if we felt like staying in. It was clean and quiet. I highly recommend this if you are a first time tourist or a Boston regular.
1615033,18099785,2014-08-21,18385848,Imogen,The apartment was great - just perfect for a one night stopover in Boston. It was a really good distance from the north station and there was some great Italian food on the doorstep. Definitely recommend for a short stay.
1615033,18239148,2014-08-24,16142363,Andrew,"Excellent location in the heart of the Italian quarter, great for walking to main places and not far to subways. Nice apartment, we were in the basement  so little natural light but good for 3 days"
1615033,18452822,2014-08-26,17952292,Helen,The studio is in a great location for exploring Boston. The freedom trail literally passes in front of the entrance. It is in little italy which is a cool neighbourhood. Its really easy to walk or get the metro anywhere else. The flat is a little more tired looking than in the photos. Also you should be aware that it is a basement flat with one small window so not the best choice if you are claustrophobic.
1615033,18556867,2014-08-28,19073976,Sarah,"The hosts gave us very clear instructions for our arrival and good restaurant recommendations in the neighbourhood. This a great little apartment. The location is AWESOME! It was the perfect base to explore Boston from. Great espresso and restaurants just down the street. The freedom trail is literally steps from your door. A few cons: when people walk around upstairs it is quite loud, and the mattress has a plastic cover that makes the sleep a bit uncomfortable. Overall though, great value for money. Very happy with our stay."
1615033,18745816,2014-08-31,14064711,Alexandre,"As described, this is a basement apertment, with a small window giving on the alley, so its not too luminous. But once you get over that small element, you can fully enjoy this amazing location. It is in the heart of lovely North End, a fun, young and vibrant part of the city. Old New-England Architecture and tons of historical locations at walking distance. It is clean, tough not necessarily furnished with new appliances, everything worked fine, ther is air conditioning and a clean bed.  Really, there is no reason not to rent this place, especially because of its fabulous location. Enjoy Boston!"

1615033,19036232,2014-09-05,10001471,Florence,"The location is perfect for travelers visiting Boston, right in the North End, near Faneuil Hall and steps from the old church. If you are planning to only sleep there, it is okay but you need to know it is a basement with almost no light and could smell like a basement. If you are looking for a place just to sleep and know what to expect the location is great and the studio clean and have everything you need. For me it was not meeting my expectations and needs, as I wanted to spend time in the apartment working, Jose was very understanding and very responsive to my concerns and kindly refunded me for the remaining days.  I did spent three days there and was okay but feel it is a bit overprice for a basement.  Would recommend it, as long you know what to expect, and want this location.  The host was very responsive all along prior to the trip which was very good."
1615033,19301148,2014-09-09,20537541,Cotton,Great level of detail provided on the apt and made getting keys very easy. Location and apt description was accurate.

It is in a perfect central location, we were able to walk everywhere, and coming from L.A. not renting a car, this was a huge plus for us. The room was really cool, a step back into history, but very very comfortable. Jason and Jose were very accommodating, we will be staying here for our next trip-- no doubt!"
1615033,19927756,2014-09-21,17188531,Judith,"The information and contact before our visit was efficient . We had no need to contact our hosts during our stay. The apartment had character and was in a great position. However, it felt a bit shabby,needed more reading lights and the plastic mattress cover was a big negative."

1615033,20549065,2014-10-01,17160092,Heather,"Please keep in mind that this apartment is a basement apartment. I reserved it for my mom and she did not feel comfortable so we had to book another accommodation for her. The stairs were difficult to navigate with luggage, they had to walk down a dark alley to get there and the only ventilation is a separate air conditioning unit with a hose going out the window. It gets a little drafty. I would not recommend this accommodation although the owners were incredibly nice."
1615033,20637424,2014-10-02,21972434,Deborah,"My boyfriend and I stayed here last minute due to a flight cancellation; the owners were very accommodating and provided all check-in information promptly. Couldn't ask for better location of Boston, less than 10 minutes from Logan, and walking distance to the best of Boston.  The apartment was very clean, comfortable bed and shower.   Great stay!"

1615033,21197508,2014-10-13,5784574,Thea,"Jose was very prompt in responding and very accommodating. The unit had towels and toiletries and was clean.  It is in the basement so understandably, all movements from the unit above and people going into and out of the complex and up the stairs are audible which made it a little difficult to sleep our first night. The location though was AWESOME. We loved stepping out into the heart of the north end to try the many great restaurants and to hop right on the freedom trail. Charming spacious unit in one of the best neighborhoods in Boston."

The location was excellent, that was the main reason I chose this place to stay, close to North Station and Haymarket T stop. Plus it's a cool neighbourhood. Other than that the apt was clean and had everything you'd need. Recommended."

Jose was very quick to respond to any questions and provided all the details well before my check-in, which went perfectly. He was also very accommodating with leaving luggage past check-out time which I really appreciated. The apartment was very clean and comfortable and had everything I needed."
The location is excellent - the apartment is steps away from the Old North Church of Paul Revere fame. *Almost* as importantly it's very close to Bova's Italian Bakery which has,I think,"the best canollis in the world. North End is a very cool and vibrant neighbourhood with lots of places to eat and drink.\"",,,

It's good to mention that,as we booked this place for 3,one of us had to sleep on an inflatable mattress because one of the couch's feet wasn't stable enough.,,,
Also it is a basement right underneath the entrance of the building and one apartment,which makes it a bit noisy.,,,,

The basement apartment was clean and comfortable--and extremely quiet, especially considering the nightlife nearby.  There were plenty of towels, a kitchenette I didn't use, and charm to spare.  It's not cheap for a little one bedroom apartment, but it's cheaper than most comparable places in Boston.  I hope to stay here again."

We were pleasantly surprised by the historic yet modern setup of the apartment.  Check-in was a breeze with a lock-box for the keys.  We then walked outside to find we were directly next to the Paul Revere church where he lit the lanterns to signal the British were coming.  We were right on the Freedom trail, so we quickly got a dose of American history.  There were also many bars, restaurants, and shops in very close walking distance.  We were able to quickly access the waterfront, financial district, and other neat areas of town by foot.  The bed was comfortable and the apartment was clean.  I would definitely recommend staying here if you're looking for a quick yet fulfilling dose of what Boston has to offer."
1615033,24671712,2015-01-01,24239303,Yingzhi,Very amazing basement. Like an old house of a castle. And the location is good though it took us a little time to find the apartment court.
1615033,24763023,2015-01-02,24624395,Marc,The place was as described and even nicer in person. Perfect for 1 or 2 people for a short stay in the north end and in boston in general.
1615033,25303214,2015-01-11,24988523,Michael,"This place was great, my kind of stay!  A little brick and stone style basement studio.  I can see how some people might have trouble finding the side street it is on, but we didn't. My girlfriend thought the place was cute and cozy.  It was a little chilly at first as the baseboard heating was slow, but the working wood stove more than made up for that.  There is enough cookware for a little cooking (we made breakfast), and a TV that gets premium channels.  All in all, I would highly recommend."
1615033,25375078,2015-01-13,16219805,Gabe,Great small and comfortable studio with many amenities while keeping the charm of North End. It was nice that a humidifier was constantly running as I have an issue with heaters running dry heat. I would rebook and recommend this studio to anyone looking for great deal and in a great location.
1615033,25479004,2015-01-17,1135112,Becca,The apartment was exactly what the description stated it would be. It was clean and in a great location. The directions from Jose for getting there and picking up the keys and such were excellent. Parking around there is a mess. The only complaint that I could make is that the kitchen isn't equipped to really cook (but you're staying in the North End for a reason i suppose) also there is zero counter space in the bathroom so if you have a lot of toiletries that you like to set up you are going to have problems.

1615033,27272152,2015-03-01,17828956,Leisa,"This efficiency apartment is definitely central to all of the great aspects of Boston's North End neighborhood.  If you are visiting the city for history and/or an event at the TD Garden, this is a great location.  The photos on this listing of a new, modern style bed and couch are accurate, but please know that all other aspects of this unit are not new: paint, flooring, plumbing, linens, etc - it's all about your expectations and whether that is important to you.  This efficiency is located in the basement of a multi-unit building with many others like it on all sides.  At the time of our visit there were issues with a smoke detector hanging from the ceiling in the entry hall and one missing from the apartment, and that, coupled with an unclear secondary exit from the apartment made us feel unsafe at the time.  However I'm sure that Jose/Jason has remedied these issues since our stay and very graciously reimbursed us for one night when we asked to shorten our stay from two nights to one."
1615033,27445330,2015-03-04,494454,Keena,"Jose/Jason's emails were quick, thorough and easy to follow.  I have been to Boston before, so I didn't really need any sightseeing/restaurant ideas.  The key box was convenient and easy...with no need to meet at a certain time, which was nice.  The neighborhood was great--a perfect location for walking out the door to explore.  The apartment is in the basement, so there is only one small window to the street.  We were there in a snowy winter, so the window was covered, but it still did not feel too cavernous and not at all damp.  Again, a perfect spot for exploring Boston!"

And the location is outstanding! We walked everywhere, and even on days we didn't want to trek too far had just about everything we could ever need within a block or two radius--one night was pouring down rain, so we ran to the corner to pick up a pizza and had a little picnic while watching SportsCenter highlights instead of goo out in the town. Everything is well kept and tidy, and this unit provided a space in which I, for probably the first time in my travel experience, didn't mind just \"\"hanging out\"\".\""
1615033,28524560,2015-03-25,25145307,Valerie,"The appeal of this rental is all about location and value.  Amazing location right across from the North Church, in the North End.  We went out for amazing food every day, 10 min walk to Fanueil Hall, 5 min walk down to a great spa on Battery Wharf and the water taxi stop.  The value is good and the space appealing (we stayed in the basement apartment).  However, you also need to know that being in an older building, noise carries down to this apartment and on a Friday or Saturday night, you may be kept up as residents come and go.  Also, there could be some improvement in kitchen/bath upkeep.  Overall, I recommend it.  Hosts were also good communicators."
1615033,29039469,2015-04-03,10323494,David,Jose's place was as described. Comfortable with everything you need. In a stunning part of town and easy to get to.
1615033,29384561,2015-04-07,15277650,Paavo,Great location in North End close to subway and walking distance to most of the main sights. Easy to miss the first time though as it is at the end of a narrow yet short alley (as described).
The place is nice and has character like shown in the pictures. Everything works and there's plenty of space.,,,,,
Jose was very helpful and quick with responses. The key logistics are well designed and efficient.,,,,,
"Would recommend!\"",,,,,
1615033,30015968,2015-04-16,24038763,Sid,"Great location. The apartment could have been cleaner and the curtains didn't fit the window, minor complaint but would take 2 mins to fix. Apartment just a bit rough round the edges."
1615033,30277855,2015-04-20,19191199,Katherine,"Jose was a great host! He was quick to respond to any questions, and helped make my visit to Boston an enjoyable one. The apartment is a cozy basement unit located under a block from The North End Church. It was clean and just what I needed."
"I loved staying in the North End! If you love history and food this is the place for you!\"",,,,,
1615033,30437508,2015-04-22,21749052,Matt,Jose was very responsive prior to our arrival and I had several questions that weren't directly related to the apartment that he helped with.  The apartment was located in a great spot and we walked all over the place.
1615033,30724468,2015-04-26,752113,Sarahi And Mayra,Jose was super helpful and even if we didn´t meet him in person he explained how to get the keys and get around the place. His place is perfectly located to explore the city walking. There's a ton of restaurants and interesting places to visit within walking distance. We really enjoyed our stay there.
1615033,31163790,2015-05-03,26064470,Richard,"This apartment is in a great location for exploring the Freedom Trail and the rest of Boston. It's a great size for two, and we really enjoyed our stay. Jose gave us all the details we needed before we arrived, and everything went very smoothly."
1615033,31346453,2015-05-04,2400598,Liz,"This apartment was great! Finding it & getting in was simple. There's not a lot of street parking around if you're driving in, but there are garages near by where you can park overnight."
The location is fantastic! Definitely the best part. The apartment was private and clean,"and everything appeared to be in good working order. The bed was also super comfortable. I would definitely stay here again!\"",,,,
1615033,31618014,2015-05-07,10338400,Marty,Charming little place. Jose was helpful. Wouldcertainly stay again .
1615033,31938259,2015-05-12,21465698,David,"We couldn't have asked for an apartment in a better location. So close to the train station, as well as everything the north end has to offer!! Jose was extremely hospitable, letting us check in early & made sure we had everything we needed. Would absolutely stay here again!!!"
1615033,32229496,2015-05-16,12270500,Brenda,"It was easy to find the Apt thanks to the great instruction Jose gave us, gaining entry was very easy as well.  The apt was very welcoming and clean with fresh towels laid out."
1615033,32376118,2015-05-17,31783442,Matt,"Location was great, right in the heart of north end boston. Place was very cozy and clean. Instructions were accurate for accessing the rental. Would stay here again and recommend."
1615033,32878867,2015-05-23,6930348,Carol,"\"Jose was always very prompt to answer email queries before (and during) our stay. The location simply can't be beat! All the tourist attractions are nearby, of course, but what really amazed us was the friendliness of the locals and the sense of community within those few blocks along Salem Street. We were there 4 nights, having flown across the Atlantic for the Crosby, Stills, & Nash concert. Since sightseeing wasn't our main priority, we pretty much stayed around the Hull St / Salem St area apart from the day of the concert. Shopkeepers started recognizing us within a couple of days and greeting us with \"\"welcome back! How are you today?\"\" We really felt at home there."
The flat has everything needed,even a kitchen,but with such great food just outside the doorstep,only the oven & microwave are needed (for reheating yummy takeaways.),,
The one thing we would do differently next time is try to book a first floor flat rather than the basement flat. The stairs down into the flat are fine for young,fit travellers,but when you're eligible for the senior citizens' discount at Denneys and not in ideal physical shape,the stairs are a bit steep.  :),,

1615033,33005167,2015-05-24,5251577,Cristias,"Jose was a great host, he handled everything in advance and facilitate all that he could for our stay. The place is in a very beautiful are in Boston and the apartment has a great charm of its own. Very grateful to him."
1615033,33350117,2015-05-27,24567741,Siobhan,"This apartment was fantastic, in a great location in the North End close to many many restaurants, bars and grocers. It was very cosy, clean and quite spacious. Jose responded to all our inquiries promptly and made the check in/out process really easy. We would definitely stay here again."
1615033,33465795,2015-05-28,18114769,Molly,The location of the space is fantastic. It was right in the heart of a historic and wonderful neighborhood. Great restaurants abound! The directions were very clear and check in/check out was seamless.
1615033,33645939,2015-05-31,26379930,John,"Absolutely great location, great neighborhood, centrally located, great if you wish to walk the Freedom Trail or get to historical Boston.  Jason is also a great host. We had an early arrival, before check in, and he graciously allowed us to drop off our luggage.  He was also great with communicating back to us."
1615033,34533605,2015-06-09,31012520,Hugo,"Jose detailed a very easy set of instructions, which made getting into and leaving the unit an easy experience.  He made himself available and was very helpful.  Location, location, location, excellent start and end to a day's exploration of Boston."
1615033,35064727,2015-06-15,27477468,Nick,"If you rent this airbnb for any reason, it's the location. You seriously cannot be in a better spot than right behind Old North Church. You also won't find this location for a better price. We were so happy to be in this area. Right on Freedom Trail, close to dining, shopping, and other historic sites."
That being said,the place isn't the Ritz. Know that going in so you aren't disappointed. You're in a basement apartment of an old building. It could use a coat of paint,the bathroom could use textured walls and paint along with new flooring,and they could also use some new flooring in the bedroom/living/dining area. It could use with a good dusting and having a few stray nails taken out of the walls.,,
The bedding and towels were clean and fresh. However,for two people,you get two towels and two wash cloths. I really could have used an extra towel. The pillows on the bed are very thin. There are extras in the opened closet but I wasn't comfortable using them.,,,
So,if you're like us and you leave early in the morning and come back late at night,this place will be ok for you. You sleep,you shower,you leave. If you're also a snob like I am,you won't overlook the minor issues in the look of the place.
I would book this place again,because of the location and price and because I would know what I'm getting.,,,,
The nice thing about the place (and the guys renting it) was that we arrived an hour early and we were able to get in early. So,thank you for that!,,,,
Downside is that checkout is quite early (10am),but had that been an issue,I'm sure that we could have worked that out as well.,,,
Thank you!,,,,,
"Kayla Gehringer and Nick Michalik\"",,,,,
1615033,35284467,2015-06-17,25240198,Katherine,"Our host, Jose, gave us clear instructions via email on how to find the apartment and enter via the lock system which worked easily.  We didn't meet Jose but he was available by phone, if needed.  We wanted lodging in the North End of Boston and this listing turned out to be a perfect location for that.  However, we were very disappointed by the apartment itself.  We didn't realize from the listing that it was a basement apartment and also very rustic.  The stairs going down were dark, steep and without a hand rail."
1615033,36698544,2015-06-30,34695902,Adrien,"The room is very well placed, and matches perfectly the description. A good place!"

1615033,37145524,2015-07-05,24413191,Lacey,Jose's apartment is in a primo location. We walked/biked everywhere around the city. It is within minutes walk to little Italy with some of the best pasta I've ever had. The bathroom could have been cleaner but overall wonderful stay!
1615033,37294364,2015-07-06,29953694,Joseph,"This room was exactly what I was looking for in Boston. Great location. Fantastic sites. The room was clean and cozy. All amenities worked perfectly, and I was able to enjoy the sights of the Freedom trail right outside the door!"
1615033,37678648,2015-07-09,33971463,Mike,Great location in the North End. Jose replied quickly to all communications. Would definitely recommend.
1615033,38424340,2015-07-15,11214717,Casey,"Such a wonderful location, right in the center of the North End. So close to all the Italian restaurants and shops. Such great food and history.  The building seems like it's one of the oldest buildings around, with brick walls and interesting architecture- definitely part of its charm."
Room was clean and all the necessities were ready to go.  Thanks for such a great experience,"Jose. \"",,,,
1615033,38689000,2015-07-18,26694218,Bob,My wife and I greatly enjoyed our stay in our Hull Court flat. It was absolutely one of the most convenient locations to explore Boston from. I would stay there again in a heart beat.
1615033,38987470,2015-07-20,20024295,Jordan,"Location Location Location. Right next to Salem St is by far the place to be. Jose was very accomodating, allowing us to drop our bags off in the morning. We managed to park overnight in Hull St instead of paid parking which was nice, but not expected."
1615033,39550749,2015-07-24,38210871,Steven,As described...decent room in a great location.  No problems with the room or host.  Parking lot nearby at reasonable rate (for Boston).
1615033,40562079,2015-08-01,27224921,Stefan,The apartment was as described. We enjoyed the location in Boston which is really perfect with walking distance to so many things you want to see. We used the Hubway bikes a lot as well. Jose was quick in responding to our questions. We really liked the place and recommend it.
1615033,41068897,2015-08-04,31598314,Gabriel,I had an amazing time at my stay in Boston. Prior to my vist Jason was very commutative and was very helpful in any concerns and needs that I might have during my stay. The location is perfect and easy to find once you explore area. By the first few hours I was there I felt like a local. I would like to definitely stay here again.
1615033,42121538,2015-08-11,4939660,Mary,"The apartment is in an absolutely perfect location for sightseeing. It is on the Freedom Trail in Little Italy.  It is a short walk to the waterfront, train station, markets and restaurants.  We purchased the parking pass which was conveniently located about 1 block away."
The apartment is cozy but was fine for the 3 of us.,,,,,
The problem was cleanliness.  The floors were dirty.  We had to wear our socks at all times. The clean sheets for the  futon was in the bottom of the closet with dirty socks from a previous guest. The bath mat for the bathroom was 1/2 of an old towel that was filthy from the floor by the end of the week.,,,,,
We had contacted the host in advance to assure that we had the towels and sheets for 3.  We had 3 bath towels and 1 wash cloth.  The kitchen was inadequately stocked.  We only wanted to prepare breakfast in the apartment.  We had to buy a skillet and a spatula to do that. No toaster.  The curtain wasn't long enough to completely cover the window.,,,,,
I did contact the host at the end of the week.  I asked to be compensated for the uncleanliness.  He credited me the cleaning fee of $40.,,,,,
"This apartment is in a fantastic location and with a little effort could be a fantastic apartment.\"",,,,,
1615033,42354506,2015-08-12,40745179,Jeannette,"Value in Boston. Location is about 10min walk to Haymarket T and 5 mins to the famous North End restaurants - Daily Catch, Mike's pastry and Neptune Oyster. Simple and adequate for 1 night in Boston. Communication was fuss-free and Jose was very responsive as a seasoned Airbnb host. Key pickup and bags drop off very covenant by using keycoded pickup box."
1615033,42760110,2015-08-15,40326285,Nate,Couldn't have asked for a better place to spend the night in Boston! Right in the heart of the North End this apartment had a great historic feel to it and was a fairly quick walk to numerous destinations in the city. Highly recommended!
1615033,43761484,2015-08-22,2731748,Steven,"\"A very smooth trip overall, and I would book with Jason again in a heartbeat.  Prior to arrival he answered all my questions via email (and promptly), especially those about parking.  The apartment offers garage parking (one block away, in/out privileges) for $20 per day - in Boston, this is practically free!  This was not a fancy rental, but everything was as described, clean, and worked.  If your goal is to eat Italian in Boston's North End, and modest accommodations will work for you, then you can't go wrong.  Even getting to the Boston Convention and Expo Center, while requiring two transfers on the \"\"T\"\""
1615033,44127610,2015-08-24,36580296,Amanda,The apartment looks just as the picture depicts.  Jose provides his guests with detailed information to make your check-in and stay as pleasant as possible.  The best aspect of this apartment is the location! You walk outside of the apartment and the Old North Church is at the end of the street! Historic area and walking distance to many attractions and T stops
1615033,44678793,2015-08-28,35646642,Carolina,"Very happy with our stay at the cozy apartment. Excellent location, we were able to walk everywhere, amazing restaurants and coffee shops in the area, we also felt very safe walking late at night.  The apartment was clean and private, Jose was quick to respond to all my messages and was very flexible with our check in time."
1615033,45380426,2015-09-02,37358339,Linda,The Host's were very attentive and made sure we had what we needed to get to the place.  The location is great - walking distance to lots of history and Little Italy cannot be beat for food and pastries!
Downsides - basement apartment - lots of noise from upstairs and side neighbors and the streets. Air conditioner requires open window hence the noise. Steep stairs to get up and down,if you are 6' you might hit your head. If you are older and value sleep,probably not the right place. Place was clean enough but definitely needs some TLC.,,,
Not a bad value for the money,"but we did expect it for ourselves to be a bit nicer at $190 a night.  \"",,,,
1615033,45693701,2015-09-05,33942505,Melissa,"A great place to stay in Boston! The apartment was in a great location and was very clean. Jason, the host, was very accommodating. Every time I reached out, he was extremely responsive. My plans changed last minute and I had to be at the airport 2 hours later than expected -- Jason was very understanding and flexible and worked with me to find a solution (we got to keep our bags at the apartment an extra couple hours). I would highly recommend this place for the price. I would stay here again if in Boston."
1615033,45919261,2015-09-07,5074606,Adam,"Stayed here over Labor Day weekend and highly recommend!  Great location, you feel like a local, and in my opinion the apartment pictures don't do it justice.  Old wooden beams, exposed brick, and architecture.  Will stay here again on future trips. No problem getting the key, everything was as described, air conditioning, great coffee shop on the corner to visit each morning, oh, and there happens to be this really famous church right outside your door.  Two thumbs way up!"
1615033,46153631,2015-09-08,13796774,Luke,"Jason sent us the details to access the property, which were relatively straightforward."
Our room was the basement room,which meant a rather quaint and cozy brick-walled room. The bed was comfy and nicely furnished while the apartment featured a kitchenette and bathroom,as one would expect. It's located in North End so it's pretty close to everything. I wouldn't say this is the perfect hangout apartment,"but if you're in the city to explore and will be out and about then this makes for a great base.\"",,
1615033,46473889,2015-09-11,35757798,James,Great location and the owner was very helpful. Would recommend.

1615033,47247163,2015-09-17,5055630,Deidrei,The  apartment has an amazing location  opposite the Old North church and right on the Freedom Trail. Within walking distance of so much we wanted to see or  10 minute walk to subway system. The apartment had everything we needed for our  4 night stay in Boston. Jason's communication was excellent and replies to my emails always very prompt. The apartment is quirky and may not suit everyone. It has rustic character and quite dark below ground level( one small window looking out to pavement level) look at the photos carefully. What you see is what you get. A Little noise from people entering the building but this never disturbed us at night.
1615033,47459605,2015-09-19,33460106,Linda,"Jason and Jose had our keys and parking pass waiting for us and had emailed us explicit instructions about how to acquire them.  We were even able to check in early. The apartment was clean and pleasant and was just as it had been described. We especially enjoyed its proximity to so many of the Freedom Trail sights and its location in the North End.  The fluffy towels and silky sheets were a nice touch, too!"
1615033,48160558,2015-09-24,28256441,Daniella,"We had an awesome stay in this cozy apartment in the charming North End neighborhood.  We couldn't have asked for a better location for our stay.  The area is within easy walking distance to downtown, the harbor or the T station to get anywhere you need.  It really is a great location.  We found the neighborhood delightful with it's restaurants & shops.  We felt like we were true Bostonians while staying in this area. The access to the apartment was an easy trip from the airport via T. The accommodations were clean & inviting.  We would undoubtedly stay here again if we return to Boston."
1615033,48492869,2015-09-27,5525635,Dee,"The charm of this place cannot go by unsaid. It was perfectly located, clean and very welcoming. Jose was attentive and was there for us when we couldn't access the wifi. The apartment had everything a young couple who want the bustle of the city life but quietness to relax, could want Highly recommend it :) Especially if you want to experience historical Boston. Try the cannoli in Modern Pastry, they were amazing!"

1615033,50162315,2015-10-10,19688938,Ailsa,We loved the apartment! Never being to Boston before we found the location perfect for history and walking around. We were able to eat great and get into the city with no hassle! A great home base for exploring the city.

We walked out our front door and it was just a short distance to the best part of the North end of Boston.  The only issue we had was that we were not aware of the \"\"many\"\" steep steps down to our room.  Actually we were aware but we didn't know it was that many steps.  We just left our luggage at the top of the steps and brought down our smaller carry on.  But all in all it was a great stay!!  \""

However, I did not like the wear and tear of the linens, towels,  and of the bathroom in general.  I think that this could be improved.  Otherwise, nice place to stay in Boston."
1615033,50857216,2015-10-15,6457807,Kimberly,"This apartment is in such a prime location, so close to many restaurants and steps from the freedom trail! The unit we stayed in was in the basement with a window in a window well, so not a whole lot of natural light, but that was fine since there was enough interior lighting. The brick wall and exposed beams in the ceiling gave the place good character. The bed was comfortable and the apartment was quiet, until someone would enter the building. The building's entrance is right above the bed and the ceiling isn't soundproofed, so when someone comes home late at night, it feels like they're stomping on top of you. Other than that, we had a nice stay and felt that it had good value for the location. Jose also made check-in really easy by emailing the instructions well before we arrived."
1615033,51267695,2015-10-19,27810724,Amy,"Always easy to communicate with Jason, fantastic location (don't think we could have been in a better spot!) really clean with all the amenities we needed."
1615033,51678368,2015-10-22,46874533,Saya,The apartment was definitely cozy and very charming.  The location was great. This was my first time to use Airbnb and my host was very helpful.
1615033,51694563,2015-10-24,12410214,Barbara,"We did not meet Uzi, but that was fine because all the correspondence prior to arriving was informative and accurate and the key was left in a key safe which worked very well and we did not have to worry about what time we got there.  Lots of maps and info were left in the apartment.  The apartment was a little oppressive being a basement with low ceilings and very dull lighting, but it was very clean and the location outweighed any negatives."
1615033,52474235,2015-10-30,5921164,Ed,Jose was prompt to reply to our questions and was very helpful.

1615033,52679704,2015-11-01,7386826,Andrew,"The location was great for access to the North End and many of the other more touristy spots in town. The apartment itself was quaint, cozy, and as described by the owner. While it was by no means the most luxurious of accommodations, it provided the basics for a stay in Boston while providing a great location for visiting the local attractions."
1615033,52837416,2015-11-02,701052,Sarah,We only stayed one night but my husband wouldn't shut up about how he would totally want to live in this apartment if we lived in Boston. It's in a really charming area of the city. It was our first time there and we really loved the neighborhood. The apartment had everything we needed and quirky details that made it different and more interesting than other airbnb's we have stayed in. Communication with these guys were really great. They let us drop our bags off before check in so we can get to exploring which was extremely helpful. Tip: the heaters are along the floor boards behind the couch and next to the bed. (It took me awhile to find.)
1615033,53042060,2015-11-04,36864581,Sarah,"The location was wonderful, and the bed was nice and comfortable. If you are a taller individual (six feet) you will have to be careful as the ceilings are a little low. Also, if you are a larger person, the toilet may be less than comfortable. While my husband and I enjoyed our stay and the basics were well covered (bed was very comfortable; location is one of the best; shower had plenty of nice, hot water; location is private), there was room for improvement. Even if the neighbors are quiet you can hear them walk around, but the host provided a nice heat/ac portable unit that effectively drowns out the noise. Overall, we would stay there again."
1615033,53257877,2015-11-07,20448388,Mayra,"Phenomenal location with easy access to all the historical sites. You are literally on the freedom trail. 10 min walk to the T if one doesn't want to enjoy the long walk to southern Boston sites. We ended up walking to Fenway anyways. The apartment is blocks from great restaurants. The apartment is older, but it has a historical charm about it. There is noise transfer from the first floor, as you are on the lower level. The bed is pretty firm, and can get uncomfortable. Despite the noise and the bed, we enjoyed our stay. Jose's instructions were easy to follow and exactly as described."
1615033,53443193,2015-11-08,30159242,Joshua,Unit was clean and tidy and the booking process/check in was very straightforward.  Great experience.
1615033,53813861,2015-11-13,23198372,Erick,"Room exactly as described, with really good location, close to historical sites and nice restaurants."
1615033,54324643,2015-11-18,46774321,Dennell,"We loved our experience in North Boston, and we loved staying in this cute little place in the heart of it. Our host was great, easy to contact, & quick to respond to my questions. Definitely worth staying here. I would not hesitate to come back."
1615033,54877004,2015-11-25,46759267,Akira,"That stay was awesome. I used his place for a career expo, and the district his place is located was perfect to attend the event. And the room was really comfortable and had everything I need ."
I will definitely reserve same one when I go to take a trip around Boston.,,,,,
Thank you so much,"Jose!\"",,,,
1615033,55151694,2015-11-28,27782364,Linda,Jose was great about communicating with me by email prior to our arrival.  The address was easy to find and everything was as described in listing.
1615033,56535200,2015-12-14,3637340,Hailley,"Parking is a bitch. BUT the airport is like :5 away. If you're renting a car, leave it at the airport and grab it when you need it. Because parking is also not convenient and is very expensive."
"Place is pretty dungeon-Y/cave-like and I s pretty basic. This area is expensive so I would say unless you care to be on the freedom trail it's not worth the expense. \"",,,,,
1615033,57404260,2015-12-25,34545176,Clint,"My wife and I booked a trip to Boston just before Christmas, because she has never been there before. She's a history teacher and was excited for the opportunity to stay right on the freedom Trail. The section of Boston is very cute, with lots ofshops restaurants nearby. It was easy to get anywhere we need to go.   We picked this because of the old-style feel it had from the pictures. It did not let us down. The bricks, wood beams, old style lighting and large bricked support beam made the room unique and interesting.  We got in to town very late, but not into going to the location. The host sent us information on how to gain access ahead of time once we found the little alley where the entranc and key boxes were, we were set.  Good communication from our host. This place is accurately described. There are several enlisted coast guard members living area and a cop drove somewhere in the area at night.  He never wants felt unsafe.  For anyone staying in this area for the history and wanting a non traditional place to call home for the trip. This is it."
1615033,57902708,2015-12-30,5091661,Ben,"Very cool apartment literally right off the Freedom Trail and in the shadow of the old North Church. It ain't the Ritz but that's not why you want to stay here. It's a clean, comfortable, cozy apartment and you basically feel apart of the history around it. So close to North End restaurants, we ate like royalty."
"Landlords are very responsive and responsible. We had all the info we needed. One of the best airbnb's we've ever had.\"",,,,,
1615033,58842921,2016-01-05,43813939,Ariel,"This basement apartment is exactly as described. No frills and no fluff. Great location in North Boston/Little Italy right on the freedom trail. Don't plan on doing much cooking. Mostly because there are so many great restaurants around, but the kitchen is little small."
1615033,59266338,2016-01-08,53485000,Sarah,I had such a lovely stay here. The location is so convenient and the apartment itself has everything you need. Jose was extremely accommodating. Would stay here again when traveling to Boston in a heartbeat. It might have been the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in!
1615033,60178523,2016-01-19,19810647,Cassie,"Jose's place is the perfect spot for a weekend getaway! The location couldn't be better. The neighborhood is safe and beautiful, and filled with several delicious places to eat all in walking distance. There is also a liquor store and convenience store right around the corner as well as an amazing 24/7 pastry wonderland :). North station and the T station are a short walk making it easy to get to any place in Boston  you want to go.  We did quite a bit of exploring, including well known bar scenes and breweries all over Boston, the most we spent on and uber back to Jose's place was 8 bucks! All in all we had a great time! The apartment had everything we needed and Jose was more than accommodating, definitely worth a stay. Rain, shine, or in our case snow, you will still have a great time and not be stuck in the apartment with so much to do at your fingertips."
1615033,60308358,2016-01-21,54810384,Makayla,Great location
1615033,61271731,2016-02-01,19753792,Nick,"Great location, cool apartment! Jose was very helpful."
1615033,62446118,2016-02-14,30179925,Joe,"Super convenient location to all of North End and easy to mass transit. Scary old basement apartment with frayed carpet and cracked plaster, but clean and set with modern furniture."
1615033,62599940,2016-02-15,8638503,Arthur,"I can be a very demanding renter. Jose/Jason was able to answer any questions or concerns I had. This basement studio apartment right off the Freedom Trail and a close walk to a majority of sites.  Luckily no one had reserved the day after we left, Jose/Jason were very flexible with our check out time.  Would definitely rent again.  Made my first trip to Boston as an adult an enjoyable one.  Thanks guys!"
1615033,63409157,2016-02-22,37082674,Joseph,The host was extremely helpful helping getting me the information before i arrived.  i had a question when i got there and he returned my call very quickly and was able to help me out.  this place was great and really really close to all the great stuff in north end.  because of this air bnb i now have a great prospective of Boston.  great city!!
1615033,64326965,2016-03-02,9681765,Drew,C minus.. It's better then being on the street..
1615033,64541586,2016-03-05,5845189,Leah,Jose is a lovely host. He was extremely flexible (and patient with my constantly shifting schedule). I look forward to staying at the best cozy freedom trail apartment in the future!
1615033,64885258,2016-03-08,16389655,Alicia,"We loved the cozy space! It was comfortable and comfortable and perfect for our stay! The are surrounding little italy was cute, we loved being close to public transportation and restaurants, coffee shops, etc."
1615033,64963639,2016-03-09,19652211,Noel,The location of this apartment just can't be beat - in the heart of the North End. I pretty much walked everywhere. The place is steeped in history. Communication from the owner was clear and effective.
I do need to point out some basic issues which can be easily addressed and absolutely should be.,,,,,
It's a basement apartment - with one flight of stairs leading down - in the event of a fire or other emergency - where the stair is blocked - the only other means of escape is through a window - problem is the only open to approx 12-14 inches wide - way to small for an average adult to pass through.,,,,,
The next issue is that the room is located right beside a boiler room - I found no visible signs of a carbon monoxide detector (there is a small smoke detector and small fire extinguisher).,,,,,
"These issues would have to be addressed before I would recommend staying there. \"",,,,,
1615033,65262394,2016-03-12,59484732,Serena,"Jose was extremely helpful and accommodating. The apartment itself is very nice and cosy, and located in such a great area. It is a basement studio though so not much light, but it didn't bother us!"
1615033,65728795,2016-03-16,14657678,Michelle,Jose was very flexible with our schedule and was helpful/responded quickly when we had questions. The spot is a tiny bit hard to find but is in the best imaginable location. We walked the entire city top to bottom- it was the best! A good place to crash for the weekend.
1615033,66066374,2016-03-19,57518227,Sarah,"This place was in the perfect location! It was steps from the Old North church and in a beautiful neighborhood. Everywhere was walkable. The space was small but cozy, and it was nice to have a full kitchen and a comfortable bed. You could hear footsteps from the upstairs neighbors but it wasn't anything that was too distracting."
1615033,68743873,2016-04-06,60141361,Vj,Very nice place. Good location.
1615033,69858967,2016-04-14,37527191,Wendy,This apartment is in a great location full of lots of local charm and character. The apartment wasn't exactly as depicted on Airbnb but was cosy and warm. Lots of noise from the apartment above made sleeping difficult at times.
1615033,70844286,2016-04-21,44511588,Jim,"I'm not kidding. The Old North Church is a few steps from The little cozy apartment. It was exactly as  described on the website. We used the stove and oven and they worked perfectly. As did the shower. It is very nice, clean and in a great location.  For 2 people this is the perfect place to stay and easily walk around the Freedom Trail, waterfront and downtown Boston. We loved it. Also convenient and a very low cost uber ride to the airport."
1615033,71619611,2016-04-26,53430258,Allison,"It's a nice little apartment, very clean. The neighborhood is great, right in the heart of North Boston with easy access to the rest of the city."
1615033,72161550,2016-05-01,58497492,Erica,My husband and I had a great trip to Boston and really enjoyed staying here. The location is great and close to many sights and so many great restaurants. The apartment was clean and well kept as described. We were also allowed to drop off our bags early before check in which helped us out a lot!
1615033,72634314,2016-05-04,16928139,Mehdi,Amazing stay. The place was very cozy and had an old Boston feel. Great neighborhood with great restaurant seconds away.
1615033,72920703,2016-05-05,8188674,Garrett,"Couldn't ask for a better location - right in the middle off it all, and walkable to most sight-seeing places around the city. Place was quaint, and historic. Does the job if you're not looking for anything too fancy. I wouldn't say the place was dirty - just old and no-frills. Need to duck down in places if you're tall, and the bed is right under the stairs, so you hear people going in and out of the building. Pretty darkly-lit and subterranean, but that didn't bother us too much."
1615033,73376829,2016-05-08,57574866,Stephanie,"This was the most perfect place! We had such a great time and the location couldn't have been better! Perfect walking distance to everything you could ever want. Safe streets, really nice neighbors. The apartment came with everything we needed and more. The full kitchen was a huge help since we kept buying food locally (which is also a bonus to this location, every place we tried was amazing). The apartment is clean, very roomy for the two of us, and we will definitely try to book this place again when we come back to visit."
1615033,73624718,2016-05-09,65281134,Katherine,Just as advertised! Perfect location and super cozy.
1615033,74224249,2016-05-14,57593335,Rob,"First time Airbnb, everything worked well, we found the key and let ourselves in. It is in a really central location and right there on the freedom trail, only a minutes walk from all of the Italian eating places, and about 10 minutes into the city centre, so there is no lack of things to do and you will not need a car. We were able to walk to the Amtrak station for our next leg of our tour. The apartment is mostly underground so unsurprisingly lacks much natural light. Everything worked OK although we only ate in for breakfast because eating out was so easy. It is a tradition Boston building with the exposed brickwork. The bed was comfortable and additional bedding was available. Hot showers. Clean and basic."
1615033,74598380,2016-05-16,21216129,Molly,This basement apartment was perfect for us!
1615033,75086595,2016-05-18,35389009,Tim,Great location in a fun part of town.  Property was as advertised and a good deal for the price.
1615033,76281985,2016-05-26,3023026,Adam & Ike,"Couldn't imagine a better spot to stay in Boston. We had a really quick trip, but Jose gave us all the info we needed to arrive without any trouble."
The place is quaint,comfortable and historic. It's literally across the street from the church where the lanterns were lit warning that the 'British Were Coming'... it's incredible.,,,,
Since it's in the heart of the North End,there are some great bakeries (with cannolis) right around the place,"one of which is open 24/7. We'd happily stay here again!\"",,,
1615033,76842283,2016-05-29,22894454,Jenna,"The apartment is in the PERFECT location in the North End (Little Italy).  Very close (a 1-2 minute walk) to many good restaurants, bakeries and site seeing locations.  The apartment is cute and clean and has everything you need. Our communications with Jose/Jason were excellent and the checking in and out instructions were simple.  I would definitely stay here again."
1615033,77559515,2016-06-01,64636273,Jeff,Great location and comfortable.
1615033,77974142,2016-06-04,11321756,Joey,Jose's place was perfect for our time in Boston. The space was just as charming as in the pictures. The neighborhood was most picturesque and nearby to many nice bars and restaurants.  I would definitely recommend a stay in this flat!
1615033,79181378,2016-06-11,53601058,Kendra,"Although we never came face to face with Jose, he was very accommodating when our flight was moved up and we were desperate to drop our things off before check in. Very quick response time made it easy/comfortable to sit back and know any issues (although there were none!) were addressed in a timely manner. My only tips to future travelers: the ceilings are a little low (mind your head coming down the steps and in the shower!), the neighbors' steps can create some noise (none too bothersome), and the bed can get firm and uncomfortable if you prefer softer mattresses, like I do. It was a great surprise to find towels, soap, shampoo, and all other amenities within the apartment and I would definitely stay here again if the opportunity arose. Incredible location for those first timers in the city and all history buffs, and a perfect place to relax in between events and outings during a trip."
1615033,79627276,2016-06-13,62427348,Cynthia,Jose and Jason were very responsive both before and during our stay.  The apartment location was great!  The apartment interior was as pictured.  A good apartment for the value!
1615033,82515120,2016-06-27,53233773,Virgil,"It was great, it served my needs for my stay."
1615033,84685887,2016-07-08,36815480,Melissa,"The apartment was completely charming.  It was located in the best place for sight seeing.  We would walk out the door, turn to the right and the Old North Church was 10 steps away.  Since it is a basement apartment, It was a little musty and a little dark.  We had to empty the dehumidifier twice a day."
1615033,86126203,2016-07-15,44301361,Lauren,"Location location location! Perfect for a weekend in Boston. Small and cozy, within walking distance of everything."
1615033,87554023,2016-07-20,44015365,Thomas,"Overall, my girlfriend and I had good experience. There are some pros and cons we believe should be shared to those who are considering this room. They are as follows:"
Pros:,,,,,
- Location,location,location!,,,
- A/C and humidifier in the room. I cannot stress how great these were!,,,,,
- Early check in and ability to drop off our luggage well ahead of check in time.,,,,,
- Jose was very responsive and accommodating.,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
- The bedding was not as nice as shown in the pictures.,,,,,
- It's a basement,expect spiders and no natural light.,,,,
- You can easily hear people walking around upstairs.,,,,,
"The room was everything we needed and you can't beat the neighborhood. Thanks Jose.\"",,,,,
1615033,88020485,2016-07-22,13717792,Mark,"Great location - just steps away from the Freedom Trail, and in the center of great restaurants in the North End. Apartment was well equipped and the A/C worked perfectly which was important in the 90+ heat. Jason/Jose let us drop off our luggage before check in so we wouldn't have to lug it around town."
1615033,88552779,2016-07-24,17107392,Kougen,"You really can't beat the location, and Jose/Jason was on top of things with regard to keeping me informed on directions, a entities, etc.  would recommend!"
1615033,88853352,2016-07-25,23054123,Carl,"Nice place, even tho I cant remember reading it being a basement."
Jason/Jose is a good host in the sense he contacted me weeks before coming with all the instructions.,,,,,
PARKING IS BASICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND.... Everything is for residents only and parking garage is really expensive.,,,,,
Back alley location is good as its quiet,but not very well kept,and its the first place ever I didnt feel 100% comfortable leaving the wallet on the kitchen table at night...,,,
Also bathroom is very very old/run down...,,,,,
"sums up: too expensive for what it is\"",,,,,
1615033,89118236,2016-07-26,40389485,Cecil,"The place was as described. The neighborhood is historic, bustling, and scenic. We had no real problems. The hosts communicated clearly."
1615033,89324827,2016-07-28,46342972,Ben,"Location, space and value are highly recommended. Only draw back was being there on a 95 degrees day, the portable aircon was possibly the loudest aircon unit I've ever heard and made sleeping an issue"
1615033,89431995,2016-07-28,6689013,Melissa,This place is in the perfect location. We had a quick stay but Jose made sure everything was smooth for our arrival. The neighborhood is stunning and short walking distance to the best restaurants. We loved it! Can't wait to be back in Boston!
1615033,90565252,2016-08-01,61450247,Jenna,"Amazing location!! love the ability to park overnight in the garage just around the corner, accessto the building was exceptionally easywith the key lock box option… short walk to the waterfront, just a few blocks away from great Italian food locations and Mike's Bakery ( amazing cannoli :-) Italian café this across the street"
1615033,91069317,2016-08-03,13977742,Leah,"awesome space, great location!"
"highly recommend.\"",,,,,
1615033,91294524,2016-08-04,16595846,Johnathon,Apartment is exactly as described and was very clean upon our arrival. Really cool part of the city and has everything you would need for a short stay. Jose was very responsive and made sure to give all information you would need. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!
1615033,92102542,2016-08-07,36165791,Philip,Location location location. We uber excited everywhere from this location and never paid more than seven bucks using uber pool. Great location and the guys were great on communications. Thanks. We loved it!
1615033,92564549,2016-08-09,30871665,Kevin,Jose was great about allowing us to show up early to drop our things off before a day of exploring in Boston.  The location is great as others have noted.
I'd be remiss if I didn't note a few of the cons that others have mentioned:,,,,,
The bed is not very comfortable and is located directly under the stairs (you can see them in the top right of the main photo) and main hallway into the building,which was noisy late at night and in the morning.,,,,
There were several burned out lights,and this being a basement apartment it can feel a bit creepy - that certainly didn't help.,,,,
There's an AC and dehumidifier.  They are both very loud.  The dehumidifier beeps when it's full - empty it before you go to bed so it doesn't wake you up.,,,,,
The cleaning and service fees brought the cost to over $200,which is a lot for a dark basement apartment.  I get that it's a location thing (historic Boston,summer,Sunday night) - but just offering a buyer beware comment.,,
All in all,"can't say I would recommend staying here unless you're looking at it solely for the location.  It's an old basement apartment that shows its age.\"",,,,
1615033,92884540,2016-08-10,58212106,Joe  And Jennifer,"Wonderful location in the North End.  Great AC and dehumidifier for the hot,humid night we were there."
1615033,94288508,2016-08-15,20626285,Julie,Jose's place did just the trick while we were visiting Boston for a wedding. You can't beat the price for the location - it was awesome stepping out every day and seeing the Old North Church and walking the streets of Little Italy. The ONLY downside was that you can hear the upstairs neighbor in the morning walking around but I would still stay here again!
1615033,94678079,2016-08-16,51375006,Will,EXCELLENT apt and great communication. Could live in this very intimate outstanding place. Lots of easy and great access to Boston
1615033,95465426,2016-08-19,55991657,Caitlyn,"Jose made myself and my partner feel very welcome. The room had a cosy feel to it, and was located in a great area which felt safe even at night!"
1615033,96807399,2016-08-24,32939397,Juan,Todo estuvo de lo mejor en todos los aspectos
1615033,98730199,2016-09-01,30222573,Michelle,"Great location and perfect for a short stay!  Loved having fridge and  stove available for leftovers from all the fabulous restaurants.  Very nice to have all the basic amenities/toiletries too, thank you!"
8521792,48260628,2015-09-24,7957193,Adam,"The neighborhood was beautiful, safe , & exactly what was described in the ad."
8521792,48482903,2015-09-26,8479265,Alejandro,What an amazing place! Located in a beautiful neighborhood and close to the train station. Larry was an amazing host offering suggestions for local restaurants and things to do  and making sure we had a good stay.
8521792,48652127,2015-09-27,44798382,Jonathan,Larry made me and my girlfriend feel extremely welcome in his lovely home! The neighborhood was safe and cozy and the house was extremely clean and had everything we needed. I would definitely stay at Larry's again next time I'm in the Boston area!
8521792,49282237,2015-10-02,41411912,Srinivasan,Larry is a great guy ! Made me very comfortable during the entire stay ! The place looks exactly as described in the listing. It is in a very convenient location just minutes to the orange line.
8521792,50149279,2015-10-09,45692722,Kristen,"Larry's home is beautiful! Very clean and comfy. The bed is amazing! We had such a great experience with Larry, his girlfriend, and their pup. They were so welcoming, answered any questions we had, and also gave us suggestions of places to go and things to do in Boston. They provided us with everything we could have needed and more! We had a wonderful time and are so happy we got to meet and stay with them. We will definitely return if we are ever in the Boston area again! Thank you so much for everything! :)"
8521792,50687469,2015-10-13,35126882,Connie,"It's definitely one of my best vacation experiences. Larry and Karen are super super nice, hospitable and helpful all the time. Their puppy Toby is a cutie and plays with us all the time!"
"The neighborhood is cozy and convenient for us to go to the city center. We enjoy our time both in Boston and in Larry's place:)\"",,,,,
8521792,51193973,2015-10-18,40185223,Katie,"Staying with Larry was wonderful! He was very accommodating, welcoming, and gave us some great recommendations for places to try and things to do while we were in town. His home is beautiful, very clean, and is conveniently located to get to the train/bus station when you want to get out and explore. We would definitely stay with Larry again! He is a fantastic host and made us feel right at home!"
8521792,52160195,2015-10-26,46778334,Kyle,"Larry and his girlfriend Karen were very warm and welcoming! Their home is beautiful, and kept very neat, so was the private room. Their place was conveniently located one block from the train station, which was very easy to navigate into and out of the city (way cheaper then renting a car). The city was beautiful, people were friendly, and the food was delicious! Definitely a great experience and will be returning! Larry recommended some great spots and was a huge help! :)"
8521792,53802960,2015-11-12,2239337,Mika,"Larry was great, super nice and welcoming, and he was flexible about checking in and out which helped out a lot. He really made a big effort to help us feel comfortable and enjoy the area!  The place is beautiful and comfortable too."
8521792,54742285,2015-11-23,30055453,Karen,Larry and Karen are nice; their apartment is clean; the listing is accurate; the place really is just a five minute walk from the subway station to go downtown.
8521792,71396204,2016-04-25,22297781,Penny,"The apartment is lovely and the bed is very comfortable; Larry and Karen are very friendly.  I hadn't done an AirBnB with a shared bathroom before, and don't think I will again--prefer to have more privacy.  There was some miscommunication about how to get into the apartment in the evening, which was inconvenient.  Guests coming by car should know that there is no convenient long-term free parking during the day on weekdays.  Wasn't a problem for us, except that we had to move the car by 8:00 a.m. on Monday morning."
8521792,74404568,2016-05-15,32543896,Michael,"Everything was as advertised. Larry was most accommodating and could not have been nicer. Also, he was very responsive as I had a crazy schedule while I was in Boston. Thanks again and I highly recommend the house."
8521792,77831780,2016-06-03,1964128,Norman,Larry was a great host and I liked staying at his place. I hope to come back some time.
8521792,80400622,2016-06-18,61036535,Chang,It's amazing clean and comfortable apartment. Larry and Karen are super nice and welcoming. The apartment just exactly like photo. We're glad have such as a beautiful experience in Boston.
8521792,80914050,2016-06-20,78068661,芸,"Larry is a very nice, warm-hearted host, always willing to help. Sharing the cozy and beautiful home with Karen and Larry surely is the most impressive experience in Boston."
8521792,81657359,2016-06-24,78068661,芸,Larry is a wonderful host!
8521792,81938260,2016-06-25,31104761,Kevin,Larry and Karen were awesome hosts. Made me feel right at home. Their place was clean and close to a subway with direct access to downtown. And their dog Toby was super friendly. Would look to stay here again if in Boston.
8521792,82942172,2016-06-30,60970572,Zegbeh,"I booked at the very last minute. Thankfully, Larry was very accommodating and I would certainly recommend him!"
8521792,83776092,2016-07-04,11153451,(Ashlee) Chang,"Although we didn't see Larry during the long weekend, we had a great time in Larry's bright and large apartment. It's conveniently located next to the end of orange line in a quiet and friendly neighborhood. It's easy to park on weekends or weekday evenings when resident parking is not effective. We slept really well, but if you're light sleeper, plz bring a eye mask as there's a skylight in the bedroom, too :)"
8521792,84091311,2016-07-05,56476428,Mohammed,Larry's place was great. Definitely recommend it :)
8521792,84600236,2016-07-08,20317436,Denise,Larry was a most gracious host and very accommodating as I had a last minute booking. His place was lovely and very close (within waking distance) to many restaurants.
8521792,85108667,2016-07-10,1812664,Barbara,Thanks for all the late and last minute support with my trip. Good luck with everything.
8521792,87213529,2016-07-19,24899085,Bruna,"Larry was very helpful and organized; he was also flexible with check in/out. His apartment is new and very close to the subway station. Thank you, Larry for excellent hosting!!"
8521792,89308250,2016-07-27,1512437,Heba,Excellent stay and perfect location next to the Forest Hill station that facilitates all transport.
"Communication was superb. \"",,,,,
8521792,90914574,2016-08-02,22373441,Ricardo,"Larry was very accommodating, gave clear and detailed directions before our arrival. The place was cute and spacious, $9 uber pool ride to downtown. However, it was not clean, not to our standards at least. The only suggestion I would give is that before guests arrive have the place cleaned. Being able to park right in front and for free during the weekend was great and incredibly convenient. Larry was quick at replying to all the questions that we had, which was great. We got to meet Karen and their little dog Toby who was absolutely adorable."
8521792,92110921,2016-08-07,8983545,Silvia,It was nice to be in Larry's appartment. Location is great since it is walking distance to underground station and green neigbherhoud. Larry was helpful with all what I needed. Really a nice apartment.
8521792,97595085,2016-08-28,55902003,Patrick,Our stay was excellent! Larry was very accommodating and friendly. His home had everything we needed to be comfortable and more. The neighborhood is cute and so close to the T! I'd likely stay again.
8521792,97773475,2016-08-28,86409371,Tim,"Larry has a beautiful apartment in a part of Boston (Jamaica Plain) that I'd never heard of, but turned out to be great. It was very easy to get around the entire city, as the apartment is just minutes from the T. Hosts were accessible the entire time by phone, very flexible with checking in and out, and totally personable and accommodating. Would recommend this place to anybody and can't wait to visit again."
8521792,99521477,2016-09-05,12099378,Deanna,Our host was very responsive and helpful.  Facilities were great.  Our stay was short but great.  We even enjoyed the company of his adorable dog.
6924700,37396319,2015-07-06,36659939,Lindsey,"Jeff was a great host. I never used Airbnb before so he walked me through the logistics of booking. He was very responsive. We arrived about 3-4 hours later then we expected because of traffic, Jeff was very accommodating and we were able to retrieve the keys when we arrived. The size of the apartment is perfect for 2 people, 4 may become a bit cramped. The cable was not working during our stay, but we did not spend much time in the apartment. Jeff was aware of the cable and offered us Amazon Fire. The furniture and atmosphere of the apartment was very modern and welcoming. The couch bed was extremely comfortable and we were left sheets and a comforter, which is important! The location of the apartment was perfect for everything we wanted to enjoy in Boston! All around - Great Stay! Also - Dunkin Donuts, 7-Eleven, and CVS were located right at the corner!"
6924700,38172187,2015-07-13,4375930,Erin,We had a wonderful time and Jeff was a great host.  The place was IMMACULATE and had all amenities.  Bed was more comfortable than even my bed at home.  Better than a hotel.
The neighbourhood is bustling - like the Times Square of Boston - and access to everything either on foot or walking is a breeze.  Because you will be in the middle of everything best to arrange a key pick up that's not during rush hour if you are arriving by car.  Also be sure to mention if you need parking.... the host helped us with parking arrangements that were significantly cheaper and more convenient than if we were left to our own devices.,,,,,
"Highly recommend this host.\"",,,,,
6924700,38559939,2015-07-16,38110404,Olivia,We had a great experience staying Boston. Jeff's apartment was perfect and right down town. We would definitely stay there again. Very clean and updated. The key exchange was very smooth and jeff was always prompt with replies.
6924700,38898773,2015-07-19,36660407,Alice,Jeff did a great job of communicating.  He responded to all of our questions promptly.  Planning our arrival was easy and he was proactive about making sure a plan was in place.  We were able to get a parking pass for a very reasonable additional fee.
This place is all about location!! It is centrally located and you can get everywhere you need to go in Boston by foot or an easy ride on the T.  We were visiting family in Beacon Hill and could easily walk through the Common to get there.,,,,,
The apartment itself was clean and it was what had been promised.  It's a tight squeeze for 4.  We were able to make it work,but make sure you really like who you are sharing your space with.  The sofa is in the kitchen space.  If guests are sleeping on the sofa bed they will need to come into the bedroom to use the restroom and the sofa bed makes for a tight squeeze entering and exiting the apartment when it is open.,,,,
I loved having shampoo and conditioner provided.  Had we wanted to do laundry,we could have done it easily in the basement and Jeff even provides quarters and detergent.,,,,
The building is very secure at night,"but is in the city.  I would recommend ear plugs if you are sensitive to city sounds.  \"",,,,
6924700,39118560,2015-07-20,5078334,Jill,"Jeff's apt was fantastic! Very clean, cozy and comfortable and to top it all, the apt it's in a GREAT location!!! We felt like we were at our own place! Jeff made us feel very at home, he was kind and positive and helped us finding a parking spot for our car, and how to get around. I can't say enough about this place and the host! :D"
6924700,39355608,2015-07-22,21607199,Duuk,Jeff's place is really downtown with a very good double bed. The kids slept good on the sleeping bench in the kitchen. Everything was very good taken care of and de key exchange with the professional service was very smooth. Jeff's answers were prompt and he helped me wonderfull with a reservation mistake I made. Tnx!
6924700,39792072,2015-07-26,36353722,Glen,"Communication from Jeff was prompt and clear. Loved renting from him. He got us a parking garage for an extra fee, which was much appreciated. Parking in Boston is an issue, and we did have difficulty when we first arrived even finding a spot to drop off our luggage in front of the building - we finally saw you could come through the alley next to the building so made a quick stop there.  The location of the apartment is perfect for sightseeing.  The apartment has central air which worked well and was appreciated, because many of the other places we were looking at did not.  We felt safe coming and going at night, and never even used the Metro even though it was very close by. We walked to the Aquarium, North End, ate at Fanieul Hall and walked the Freedom Trail, went to the movies one night, and never took our car out. There is an upscale grocery store around the corner, as well as a CVS right down the street if you need anything."
The apartment is extremely clean. It's close quarters for 4 people,the sofabed is in the same room as the kitchen,opening the sofabed fills up much of the room,and the bathroom is off the bedroom.  Jeff is very thoughtful,providing coffee,tea
6924700,40035867,2015-07-27,15543474,Jordan,"The apartment was exactly how it was described. Very good location, 5 minute walk from south station and it's right next to downtown crossing. Overall it was a good experience and I would recommend this apartment."
6924700,40991779,2015-08-03,1596426,Heather,I stayed here with my husband and two young children (ages 5 years and 6 months) and it was a great spot for us.  The location is fantastic and the apartment is really comfortable.  Jeff is a super host -- Very friendly and helpful.  Thanks for hosting us!
6924700,41657633,2015-08-08,9762023,Sasha,"This apartment is very comfortable. There's plenty of amenities (iron with ironing board, fully stocked kitchen, umbrellas and even canvas bags for grocery shopping) and Jeff left a lot of personal touches that made me feel very welcomed (snacks and water bottles). He also left a little informational packet that talked about the area and where to go and what to see."
"I highly recommend this listing.\"",,,,,
6924700,42060544,2015-08-10,12946828,Kady,"This was the perfect place for my three friends and I to stay. The location could not be more perfect/convenient and the host provided everything we needed plus more (water, snacks, etc.). The process of getting the keys was seamless and they even let us store our luggage in the storage unit as we had a flight late in the day. Highly recommended to any Boston visitor!"
6924700,42470694,2015-08-13,17592882,Olivier,"Well located in the heart of Boston. The studio was clean and functional. Slightly small for a family of four, but convenient for short stays."
6924700,43071847,2015-08-17,37157485,Arielle,"The apartment is very nice. A good sized, well-maintained, clean, one bedroom. We loved the location with its close access to so many T stops and walking distance to lots of different places too! Jeff was attentive to all details, including accommodating our request to drop off our luggage early and having a pack n play ready for us upon arrival. Logistics and accommodations were all great. The only downside is that the location can be a bit noisy. However, that's to be expected in the middle of a city, and you get the benefit of being in a great location!"
6924700,43400420,2015-08-19,6136664,Dan,Excellent host.  Good Communication.  Clean and comfortable apartment.  Conveniently located near the financial district.   I would definitely stay here again!
6924700,44006041,2015-08-23,29442949,Émilien,"Communication with Jeff was super easy, he quickly answered my many questions. Apartment was as seen on pictures and described by Jeff. Very clean. Easy check-in and check-out, even after my plane was delayed. Super fast wifi. Very efficient air conditioning. Brand new appliances. City sounds at night. I will come back without a doubt."
Communication très facile avec Jeff (en anglais),"il a répondu rapidement à mes nombreuses questions. L'appartement correspond aux photos et à la description. Très propre. Récupération des clefs très facile même après un retard d'avion. Internet wifi très rapide. Clim très efficace. Électroménager neuf. Bruits de la ville la nuit. Je reviendrais sans hésitation.\"",,,,
6924700,45442465,2015-09-02,6875290,Lucila,"Jeff was a life saver, our apartment rented through airbnb was cancelled a day before our arrival. We saw Jeff's place for the same amount of money, the apartment was much better and better located."
6924700,45910972,2015-09-06,42270582,Alyssa,"We met with Michael in order to be let into the apartment. He was great in maintaining communication as we were driving to Boston from NYC and where unsure of how long traffic conditions would delay us. He gave us a great deal of information about the apartment, how to get into and out of the building, and said we could call him any time if was had any questions."
The apartment itself was just as advertised - very cozy and perfectly great for 3-4 people to at least sleep comfortably (which is what we were looking for anyway),it is admittedly a little tight for that many otherwise. My only real complaint would be the garbage disposal which definitely needed to be cleaned as there was a little moldy smell that permeated the living area and kitchen,but it's a simple fix.,,,
All-in-all,a great stay if you're looking to explore downtown without a car. The area is absolutely surrounded by plenty to do and see! If you just want a comfortable place to lay your head at night and explore all day,this a great place for that. If you do drive,ask about the parking garage around the corner. The rates are pretty awesome for an overnight stay (disclaimer: I am from NYC,where parking rates are astronomical,so anything less is amazing to me. Thought I would say.)
"Definitely recommend. \"",,,,,
6924700,47053199,2015-09-15,20111167,Chris,"This place lived up to its billing.  Very clean, had nice amenities, and overall an easy place to stay.  Jeff was very responsive and patient with changes to my travel plans."
Once confirmed the service he uses was also responsive and flexible with my needs.,,,,,
I'd definitely stay here again.,,,,,
One last comment to future Airbnb'ers - neither positive nor negative - but it's worth noting that the location,although right in the thick of downtown,is pretty quiet at night during the week and over the weekends.  There were times it was difficult to find open restaurants in the immediate area during those times...but once I get the lay of the land,"I quickly found spots within a 10 minute walk in other neighborhoods.  That's one of the beauties of Boston - it's easy to walk from one area to another.  \"",,
6924700,47268292,2015-09-17,28512200,Tyler,"Place was great, one bedroom with a pull out couch, very clean, centrally located in the financial district, close to north end, definitely would recommend to a couple or small family."
6924700,47595053,2015-09-20,8707114,Katie,"My fiancé and I came into Boston to check out a potential wedding band. Coming in from CT on a late Friday afternoon was not the easiest in terms of traffic. Jeff's management company was beyond flexible as we were in contact throughout the ride up. Key exchange was seamless and my fiancé had no problem parking the car - there's a garage just down the street that was only $20 for our total stay (we got in at 7:30pm on Friday and left at 2pm on Saturday). The location of the unit is perfect for exploring the city on foot - our areas of activity were Faneuil Hall and the aquarium. The unit itself is modern and up to date - comfortable bed with linens and towels provided. We stayed for one night and would definitely choose this location if we were coming in for a weekend. Thanks, Jeff!"
6924700,47829291,2015-09-21,43610227,Mike,Jeff's place is in a perfect location for all the sites of Boston. The apartment was a lot larger than we expected and Jeff had provided all of the extras you could ever want. Checking in was really easy and if you're driving to Boston there's a great value place to park just around the corner. This place was truly a home away from home!
6924700,48224597,2015-09-24,5489706,Scott,"This was my first experience using Airbnb and it was excellent! Everything was as described by Jeff and the apartment was great.  Couldn't beat the location of this place either.  Easy to get around anywhere in Boston quickly from this location via the T, bus and or Uber cabs.  Apartment was very clean and a perfect amount of space for my partner and me.  Plus, a full bag of coffee w/ what looked like a brand new coffee maker.  Also, Jeff left really good recommendations on restaurants and things to do around the area, which came in handy.  He's also excellent at responding quickly to emails.  Would gladly stay here again on my next trip to Boston, without hesitation."
6924700,48337648,2015-09-25,28058083,Vanessa,Jeff's place was great!  The location was perfect and the apartment was very clean and just as described.  The company that handled check-in was very communicative and arrived to meet me as scheduled.
Only two concerns:  the garbage disposal reeked.  I mentioned it to the property manager and he said they've tried everything to deodorize to no avail and there are plans to replace it. Also,as a single woman traveler I wished there was a deadbolt on the door that was only operational from the inside.  I don't know who else has keys to the apartment and that made me slightly uncomfortable. These are the reasons that I stopped short of giving 5 stars.,,,,
"Will definitely rent again when I'm in the area.\"",,,,,
6924700,48883897,2015-09-29,37570260,Haley,"Jeff made our stay very welcoming! He was very attentive and checked in throughout our stay to see how our trip was going. The description of the Apartment was very accurate. It was very modern and we felt right at home. We did not spend much time in the apartment, but when we did we felt relaxed and comfortable. The location was very convenient and being around the different shopping locations was nice! We chose this place because it was handicap accessible. The elevator was a tight fit for our scooter that we had but it worked out just fine. The bathroom was on the smaller side but it was still manageable for my husband, who is paralyzed, to use. Everyone in the building was very friendly and was able to answer any questions that we had. We enjoyed our stay very much and would definitely look into the same place for our next travels to Boston!"
6924700,49117434,2015-10-01,7583086,Anna,Jeff's place was a great spot for our short stay in Boston. It is centrally located and just a short walk from South Station. The apartment is nicely furnished and had everything we needed when we arrived including toiletries and some chocolate. Jeff left some great recommendations for coffee and dining. The check-in and check-out was quick and smooth. I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to Boston. Highly recommended!
6924700,49368603,2015-10-03,16431356,Matt,"This is a great place to stay in the heart of downtown Boston. We really enjoyed the close proximity of the apartment to shopping, restaurants, and the Boston Opera House. Thanks, Jeff for a great stay!"
6924700,50644960,2015-10-13,42525172,Emma,"The place was in a great location. It was easy to get to historic sites, great places to eat, and to and from the airport. We enjoyed our stay."
6924700,50806254,2015-10-14,45946813,Dylan,"This room had an AirBNB service to get us keys, which was awesome. The place was perfectly neat, clean and had towels/sheets etc for everyone at our stay with soap and shampoo and such laid out. Awesome touch."
The neighborhood isn't the greatest during night,"but nothing overtly dangerous. Theres also a gigantic crucifix outside the bedroom window which was a very funny sight. All in all awesome place.\"",,,,
6924700,51122256,2015-10-18,40328964,Emily,Beautiful apartment.  The place is clean and modern.  Very convenient location right above the red and orange line metro station. The host went out of his way to make us feel welcome with goodies and water already waiting for us. Love to stay here again next time we visit Boston.  Highly recommended.
6924700,51713959,2015-10-24,42044737,Susan,"We found Jeff's apartment to be ideally situated for everything . The apartment was well equipped for all our needs and the bed was very comfortable .  The whole process of collecting the keys from Mike went smoothly .  During our time there we were asked if we minded that a plumber could come in to do a small job , it wasn't a problem , Jeff's partner accompanied them and I voiced my only minor issue with him , as that due to us staying 5 nights we would have liked extra towels . On our return there were extra towels laid out . Thoroughly enjoyed or stay and wouldn't hesitate to recommend"
6924700,52071614,2015-10-26,21354996,Nick,"Jeff was very prompt in his communication, and the apartment is located in a great location central to all of the local attractions."
6924700,53050737,2015-11-04,43628688,Marla,"We stayed in Jeff's apartment for three nights this week. The apartment listing was accurate. The location was terrific and the Airbnb representative met us on time to deliver the keys. The apartment was mostly great. Our only major complaint was the smell coming from the sink that several others mentioned in earlier reviews. There were a few deodorizers placed around the sink, but the entire kitchen/living area still smelled rather strongly of mold. The other smaller problem, was that the main light in the bathroom could not be used. When left on for more than a minute, the fan rumbled loudly. Other than that, the apartment was as advertised. We enjoyed the Kind bars, water and local chocolate left for us. The manual was very helpful and included local restaurants, sights to visit, etc. The apartment was pretty noisy at night (from street noises), but the central location made up for it. We enjoyed our stay."
6924700,53145469,2015-11-05,35130773,Bruce,Nice neat apartment in a great location.  I enjoyed staying here and I would recommend it to others.

Very close to major train stops, and a nice grocery store if you want to cook your own breakfast.  It was a little noisy at night - traffic outside was minimal, but there seemed to be a lot of truck noise. That could have just been bad luck on my part, but light sleepers might consider earplugs or a noise machine."

Nous étions 4 et mis à part le fait que les personnes dormant dans le salon/cuisine devaient passer par la chambre pour aller à la salle de bain, c'était très bien. Parmi les points plus problématiques, notons l'odeur nauséabonde se dégageant du broyeur qui  n'était pas un problème majeur mais un léger désagrément quant même. Globalement, je recommande cet appart pour 2 à 4 personnes qui désirent aller visiter Boston."

6924700,62252501,2016-02-13,1211417,Vered,"Overall this was a great apartment, everything was pretty much as advertised, it was clean, bed was comfortable, shower had great water pressure, plush towels, etc. Check in (and out) was easy and smooth. Location was fantastic, very close to my office and being around the corner from the Roche Bros. supermarket was really helpful. I'm a tea drinker and appreciated having a selection of teas to choose from."
Some other things to note for future guests: the heating seemed uneven to me,I found that even when the heat was up high,the bedroom was still very chilly while the kitchen/living area was warm. There was an unpleasant smell emanating from the sink/garbage disposal when I arrived,and Jeff responded promptly when I reached out and suggested that I open the window in the kitchen (which opens out onto an enclosed courtyard) to circulate some air. This did help a bit and I appreciated his concern and communication,"but I hope the issue with the smell can be resolved for future guests!\"",

6924700,66812009,2016-03-24,22379255,Greg,Great apartment in the center of the city. Very clean. There was a funky smell - smelled like neighbors cooked stinky food and the smell just lingered in the apartment - but became nose-blind after not too long. Bed was super comfy. Could've used a few more blankets for the sofa bed - but my 16 year old daughter slept ok on it.

Just a heads up,there is no cable,he has (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) TV. I wish that I would have brought our Amazon fire stick as we had issues running amazon through the (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) TV.,,,

We had a large group of people staying and we used every inch of the place!  It was a great relief to get a place that was close to transportation, close to food/supplies, clean, well stocked, and home-like!  We used the kitchen to cook and entertain. It was a respite in the busy city.   Thanks for making our trip to Boston very memorable."

And due to the interior design and the breeze (that you can create by opening the windows on both sides of the loft) it's almost like staying in a beach house. We felt extremely welcome and Bruce answered every question that we would send via text in less than 5min, even at 7 in the morning."

Everything in this small but spacey apartment was delightfully beautiful, to the point that we took 20 pictures, just so we can take its unique beauty with us when we go home. I wish we could have stayed longer. It was clean, private, and comfortable, and walking distance from a bustling young energetic streets of restaurants, bars, and shop. Thank you, Bruce, for this gem. Our only regret is that we didn't get to meet you. Judging by the style and books, we would have a lot in common."

While the place isn't in the centre of everything, it was well connected to the med school so it was convenient for me. The apartment is very well maintained and you'll instantly feel at home. The room and all the amenities were just as mentioned. I'd definitely recommend the place to others provided it works logistically."

Its locality is great as well, with a quick walk to the public transit system and a very nice grocery market right around the corner.

It was a nice touch to have a bottle of water, towel and wash cloth that was provided. Thanks, Brett!"

The location is very convenient to the Longwood medical area where I was visiting as well as to orange and green T lines.  The hosts were welcoming and engaging.

They even were kind enough to be awake at 130 am when I arrived in order to welcome me. Accommodations are advertised. The kitchen and bathroom are nice. The mattress is to die for.

What this means for guests is that there is incredibly reliable communication, and any questions or concerns are answered very quickly."

El apartamento está muy bien ubicado si necesitas ir al área médica (10min andando) y a 5 min de las paradas de autobús o tranvía ( a 20min del centro en transporte público). Además hay supermercados a 5 min. Aunque el barrio no me pareció muy seguro a primera vista, tengo que decir que jamás he tenido ningún problema independientemente de la hora a la que saliese por la mañana o regresase por la noche. El apartamento tiene 5 habitaciones (3 con huéspedes permanentes y 2 para invitados), inicialmente hubo una confusión con mi habitación y el día que llegué ocupe otra, ambas estaban muy limpias y provistas con agua, mapas, libros y revistas sobre la ciudad. La habitación era pequeña, pero confortable, aunque poco luminosa (da a un lateral de la casa) y algo ruidosa por los vecinos de arriba. La cocina está perfectamente equipada, aunque es cierto que el desorden iba creciendo a medida que pasaba la semana y era difícil tener un hueco en la nevera. Hay 2 baños, con acceso a lavadora y secadora, un poco desordenados, pero bien equipados. El salon es amplio, pero no tiene televisión. Carl fue estupendo dándome consejos sobre la ciudad, Jess hace unas galletas caseras buenísimas y Brett estuvo siempre disponible."

Room is small,(it does have a closet complete with clothes hangers for your use),but it's more than you need considering you have 2 full bathrooms,washer,dryer,full kitchen
Bed was a single but a very comfortable memory foam type.,,,,,
Brett was very friendly,and his girlfriend even walked with me down to the grocery store to show me around the area.,,,,

My room was small,but very cleaned and well equipped. I had a desk,a closet and very comfortable bed. The house has AC (Boston's summer is very hot so I'm sure you'll appreciate it!). There's also a washing machine and dryer what's really difficult to find in the US! However I have to say that the  house disorder was increasing while the week was going by; the kitchen and bathroom at the end of the week weren't very clean and I had little room in the fridge.,,,
The roommates,Lily,Jess and Brett,are very friendly and easygoing. I really appreciate their hospitality,it made me feel like home.,
The neighborhood,Mission Hill,"is very cute and next to the main public transportation (green line and principal bus lines). You can arrive to Boston downtown in 20mins! The apartment is also near several museums that are of obligatory stop!\"",,,

The pictures were an accurate portrayal of the listing. The appliances and furniture was brand new and clean. Konstantinos provided the necessities. The apartment was super cozy and located in a great neighborhood. We were in walking distance with so many famous local shops. The T was close by, so it was very convenient to get all around the city. The location of this spot was a plus. Sometimes there would be construction outside while we were staying there but it didn't start until 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning. Overall, our stay was wonderful and definitely worth another trip."

Furthermore, it was in the Italian neighborhood. The orange and green lines are at 10 minute on feet. The area is very nice and there are many restaurants, markets and bars ( we watched Italian football match too!)."
10106081,64800832,2016-03-08,13671191,David,"We stayed at Konstantinos' place for a few days in March. His listing almost doesn't do the place justice, as it was absolutely perfect. the location is right in the heart of the North End (little Italy), meaning we could have easily had a different Italian restaurant for every meal without leaving a half mile radius. Tons of amazing options. It's also about a 5 minute walk from the famous Mike's Pastry (as well as the way-better Modern Pastry across the street). The apartment is only a 5 minute walk from Haymarket station, so taking public transit around the city was a breeze."
Konstantinos was also really good about getting to us with instructions on how to check in/check out,as he was not in town when we stayed. His instructions were precise and simple,and he made check in a really smooth process. He was definitely an ideal host.,,,
Also,for anyone visiting to see historic sights,the apartment is RIGHT by Old North Church (one if by land,two if by sea,where they hung the lanterns to warn of British invasion),and very close to Paul Revere House
The apartment itself was perfect. When we arrived it was spotless. We had every amenity we could have needed for a trip. Towels were fresh,there were dishes and silverware should we need them,and the bed was neatly made (and also really comfortable). We spent most of our time out in the city,but when we had some down time between tours and activities,it was nice to come back to the cozy apartment and relax for a bit.,
I highly recommend Konstantinos' place. Whether you're coming to Boston to take in tourist sights,or looking to get away to a place with tons of amazing food close by,it's without a doubt the optimal location. If we come back to Boston anytime soon,"we will definitely try to stay here again.\"",,
10106081,65777211,2016-03-17,51256713,Bobby,We stayed for a week in this apartment and it was amazing. The view of the city is spectacular and you are right next door to the Old North Church. Everything in the apartment was clean and newly renovated. This would definitely be my go to place to stay next time I'm in Boston.
10106081,68874998,2016-04-07,51759659,Verónica,"The apartment it's just as it looks in the pictures, really modern, with all new appliances, although we didn't understand the kitchen but we didn't needed anyway. Konstantinos wasn't in town when we got to the apartment but a few days earlier he send us good and easy instructions so we could get in. The location is really great, a quiet neiberhoud, near to the aquarium, td garden, and Quincy market, five minute walk to the metro."
10106081,70693370,2016-04-19,16536271,Zack,"Fantastic place! We stayed here for 4 nights leading up to the Boston Marathon and it was amazing. Location was IDEAL right in the heart of the North End and literally steps away from the Freedom Trail, historic sites, amazing Italian restaurants and delis, bakeries, etc. Neighborhood was safe and people were friendly. Konstantinos was a great host and very timely on all of our communication. His place seemed brand new, was super clean, and just the right size for the two of us.  Hoping this place is available the next time we're in Boston... because we'll stay here again in a heartbeat!"
10106081,71128716,2016-04-23,57680924,Kala,Our host was very welcoming and kept in good contact the entire trip. The location was amazing and the place was perfect for my husband and i. Small but perfect size for two. . You could not beat the location and the place was spotless and very comfortable.
10106081,72069447,2016-04-30,6595979,Fiona,Konstantinos' flat was really lovely. Everything is brand new and clean and it gets lots of daylight. The views over Boston were lovely too.
The location was great,right on the Freedom Trail and near lots of good Italian restaurants.,,,,
There was some noise in the morning from the builders next door (i'm sure they'll be finished soon) but if you're getting up early to see the sights then it won't matter.,,,,,
"Thank you for a fantastic stay.\"",,,,,
10106081,73410784,2016-05-08,59909510,Leslie,Awesome location; condo building borders Old North Church of Paul Revere Fame.
10106081,74275681,2016-05-14,52612718,Darren,Myself and my boyfriend arrived from London and instantly loved the neighbourhood and location. It felt very safe.
The apartment was beautiful and super clean. The bed was very comfortable and the location could not been any better. The north end is a popular attraction in itself,the apartment is right next to the old church which is on the freedom trail. There is a shop just across the road from the apartment which is very handy.  Quincy Market/Faneuil Hall is 5 mins walk away from the apartment. The apartment is also close to Boston public market. The apartment is in the Italian neighbourhood and has loads of lovely restaurants,you cannot beat the location of this apartment.,,,
Konstantinos (The Host) was very responsive and assisted with all questions & queries I had prior to booking his apartment.,,,,,

"Will definitely use again when I return in a couple of months. \"",,,,,
10106081,75322539,2016-05-20,48807826,Phyo Htet,"Konstantinos gave us easy instructions to follow since he wasn't there to hand us the key. The place was a five story walk up, but it was fine for us because we only come back at night. The small apartment was very modern and cozy. There's a Nespresso machine and it was pretty cool. The neighborhood has a lot of good Italian restaurants. We had one of the best dessert experience from Modern Pastry (Mike's was excellent as well, just a different atmosphere). Try mussel spaghetti and chicken parmesan from Dino's, they are also very good. I can't believe I finished the whole plate plus the pastries from Modern for dinner! The subway station was like 9 mins from the place, but Boston is relatively small and you can walk to places. We definitely enjoyed Boston and would recommend you to stay at Konstantinos' place."

We were walking dos trance to almost everything which, in my experience, is amazing in an air bnb. The flat was very clean and nicely kept. My friend and I traded between the bed and the sofa bed so I can vouch for both being comfy! Ideal for a couple of pair visiting. We would definitely stay again. Communication was also great and we found our way in with ease thanks to helpful and detailed instructions."
10106081,83575356,2016-07-03,29891374,Caroline,"The reviews don't lie, Konstantinos' was a great place to stay, especially for two. The apartment is very true to the pictures and all the necessities were provided. Located in the North End, there are plenty of food options around us and and the subway was also a short walking distance away. Overall, the host was easy to communicate and we would definitely stay here again."

It's conveniently located adjacent to the Old North Church right along the Freedom Trail. There are many good restaurants nearby, and Konstantinos provided a generous list of recommendations. His instructions for getting the key and into the apartment were very clear and we had no problems. He was quick to respond to all communications and questions."

Very nice neighborhood,very comfortable walking around after dark.,,,,
Lots of good communication with Konstantinos,check in and out was simple.,,,,
Easy access to public transportation if you want to see more of Boston. That's not normally how I get around when I travel,but it works great in Boston. Used the subway and the ferry many times. Easy was to sightsee beyond the walking distance from the apartment.,,,,
"Would definitely recommend to anyone interested in staying in Boston. \"",,,,,
10106081,91829267,2016-08-06,12394108,Mike,"Apartment was comfortable and as shown in pictures. Neighborhood and location were great. You are just a block off Hannover, the main North End street with lots of great restaurant choices very close by.  10 minute walk to Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market.  A/C worked."
"One thing I was surprised by (but in fairness maybe it's in the listing and I just missed it) is this is up 4 flights of stairs with no elevator.\"",,,,,
10106081,93353679,2016-08-12,22787087,Mark,"This is a great little apartment which perfect for couples or singles. The location is excellent, everything very modern and exceptionally clean and well appointed.  Konstantinos was an excellent host also who'd stocked the fridge with beers.  Given how expensive hotels are in Boston this represents an excellent choice. Highly recommended."
10106081,96070985,2016-08-21,36070225,Julie,Konstantinos was a great host! His instructions were very clear on how to get in and what to do when we left. He was very polite when we communicated and readily available.
As far as the apartment,it is very cute. Everything is new and even tho it is small,there is a surprising amount of space with the layout. It is located in the heart of the north end which is an awesome location! It is near the old north church of you are interested in walking the Freedom Trail you can hop on right there. The neighborhood is amazing and very much a community. You are close enough to the tourist stuff on that part of town if you are interested but a couple blocks away so you aren't always around the hustle and bustle. Fairly easy access to the T if you are using it to get around town. Wonderful Italian bakeries and restaurants are right around the corner.,,,

9844242,62603203,2016-02-15,43670003,Chris,"Michael and Samantha did a great job making us feel comfortable! They answered all my questions before we arrived and were very accommodating with the check in and out times. The weekend we stayed was one of the coldest in Boston history, so Sam and Michael messaged us one night asking if everything is okay because they heard there were power outages throughout the city."
In addition,Michael and Sam made it a point to leave some suggestions about local eateries and bars to check out in the neighborhood,even though they already knew I'm familiar with Beacon Hill!,,,
Their apartment is very conveniently located in Beacon Hill (one of Boston's nicest neighborhoods) with a 5-10 minute walk to all T lines and a 5-10 minute walk to the Boston Common.,,,,,

9844242,64580431,2016-03-05,9072862,Terra,"Michael was quick to reply in all correspondence and the check in/out experience could not have been easier. Totally seamless. The apartment is surprisingly big, compared to other airbnb listings in the same neighbourhood and price range. It is exceptionally good value! The apartment is meticulously clean and Beacon Hill is a charming neighbourhood that invites exploration on foot. If you want to go a bit further afield, the transit station is only a 5 min. walk away. I would recommend Michael's place and would happily stay again!"
9844242,66263105,2016-03-20,43705183,Cristina,Michael and Samantha are a very great host. They confirmed my bookings right away and they kept in touch until the last day.

Their place was very neat and they made sure that everything we need is there. They also left a note on general stuff and suggested on places to eat. Tatte Bakery is so great!

We have a little one and she very helpfully offered up her little one's nursery and toys for our use, so we could leave the travel crib at home. The condo was beautiful and exactly as pictured, and the neighborhood was quiet and very handy for all the amenities on Centre Street in Jamaica Plain and the Orange Line T for a quick trip into downtown Boston. The perfect Airbnb stay and holiday for us, thank you Toyoko!"

The apartment is in a good location; it's about a 20 min. walk to Boston Common,a $5-6 Uber ride to the downtown area. In terms of location,"there's a hospital nearby so the street sirens can be loud at night. I recommend bringing ear plugs. \"",,,

5074924,36807616,2015-07-01,4416605,Brian,Nice little efficiency located in a great park of Boston.  Easy in/out with numeric keypads for building and apt access.  Clean accommodation.
5074924,37325460,2015-07-06,16970285,Maurice,"I never spoke to Brent but was given every coded need to access the unit.  It is a small place, the smallest place that I ever stayed in but sufficient space for my wife and I. The unit is clean in a wonderful location.  We had a late flight and we were allowed to leave our bags in the hallway at our on risk and had no problem."
"Would stay there again\"",,,,,
5074924,37883122,2015-07-11,1221544,Todd,"Cute place, it is small like other reviewers have mentioned (more like a hotel room) but it's still comfortable and on a really gorgeous block and in a pretty building. Lots of good restaurants and bars nearby but it's quiet at night. I felt very comfortable there. My only complaint is that the water pressure was almost non-existent in the shower. Not a huge deal and understandable because it's an old building."
5074924,39185373,2015-07-21,32538757,James,"Brent was very easy to work with. Although I never met him in person, he communicates all of the essential information needed for your stay prior to your check-in day. The apartment comes exactly as described on the listing. Yes, it is small, but my wife and I still had more than enough room for our 3 nights in Boston. This apartment is in a great area that is within walking distance many great locations. We would definitely stay again!"
5074924,39612723,2015-07-25,16013221,Gregory,Le logement se situe dans un quartier de calme de Boston. La procédure de prise de la chambre est très claire et simple.

5074924,43094929,2015-08-17,38697466,Andrew,"Brent's Back Bay studio is perfect for a trip to Boston.  It is a great way to avoid expensive hotels and in a perfect location. We walked everywhere, including Boston Commons, Fenway Park, Prudential Tower and more.  Really a nice find, very clean.  Our only criticism was that the towels were really poor and there wasn't any soap!  Minor details, but overall a good spot.  I'd go back."
5074924,44413487,2015-08-26,1567494,Tamas,"nice, clean, well managed unit at a great location. Recommended. Parking is difficult."

5074924,45773725,2015-09-06,25243013,지홍,The place was polished and clean and exactly as listed; minutes away from Prudential and great size for two.
5074924,46576661,2015-09-12,11973786,Tricia,"The location for us worked well and getting around the city was easy with the T a short walk away. There are plenty of good local restaurants. We went to Aquitaine in Tremont street and Petit Robert bistro in Columbus Avenue, the food and serve was excellent. We didn't have anything to do with Brent, all communication was done via the letting agency.  The agency was prompt with instructions of access.  The room was as pictured, and met all our needs. It was a very quiet neighbourhood. I would stay here again."
5074924,48264625,2015-09-25,29545249,Matt,Excellent location with a few shops and restaurants around and walking distance to a subway station. The neighbourhood is somewhere I'd be happy to live in. The system of access codes rather than keys is very handy.
5074924,48685666,2015-09-28,9348229,Jonathan,Very accommodating host.  Gave very quick responses and let us leave our luggage in the apartment while it was being cleaned.  Great location too!  Would stay again.
5074924,49208627,2015-10-02,6052746,Elise,My boyfriend and I had a fantastic three night stay here. The studio is exactly as shown in the pictures and it was all round in the great condition. We also really enjoyed being in this area with Prudential Center and restaurants on Tremont St very close by. Would definitely recommend!
5074924,50274065,2015-10-11,35944199,Marsha,"Studio apt on ground level, with small bathrm plus small alcove with bar fridge, microwave, hot plate. Queen bed was super comfortable. Unit small for 2 people but better than some teeny hotel rms. Told Brent when ceiling lightbulb blew, & it was promptly replaced. Free washer & dryer is a plus. Ceiling fan was good, plus there is an evaporative air-conditioner that some would find noisy."
Main negative was noise from apt above--people talking,walking around,maybe exercising,showering. Maybe we were unlucky that occupants above were active around midnight.,,
Great location in quiet street,close to eating places,convenience shops,& metro. Serious coffee shop down Columbus,called Render. (Although being asked if I had ever tried a cappuccino was amusing,given that I had lived in Sydney's 'little Italy'
Brent said apts are being refurbished. The building's hallways need a tidy up--old mail,tired carpet,"etc. \"",,,
5074924,50804853,2015-10-14,3757845,Perry,"A most excellent location, great SouthEnd neighborhood vibe, and very accessible to Back Bay and in/out on major highways.  I loved the keyless system - it made the check-in and continued use very simple, which is often a challenge w/AirBNB.  Unit was as photoed and described, comfortable bed and very quiet location."
You'll need to bring all toiletries and any supplies that may be important to you like coffee - it's fairly bare bones,"but there are lots of shops within a couple of blocks. \"",,,,

5074924,53270718,2015-11-07,46743678,Beverly,This apartment is located on an absolutely gorgeous street in a prime area of Boston. We walked to numerous different neighborhoods across the city and its also located close to the T! The apartment itself was perfect for us with a great view of the city and very comfortable. Thank you to Brent for having us!
5074924,53490806,2015-11-09,45835322,Anthony,Unit was as described. Very good communication and no hassle. Great location and would definitely rent again!

5074924,54697490,2015-11-23,5395690,Katherine,"Good value for money and great location. Keyless entry made coming and going very easy. We didn't meet or speak to Brent directly but with a property company, though the information and service was very good. Wifi was very quick and it was nice to have tv and microwave and other facilities. One disappointment was that we didn't get the studio pictured here, but another one without a bay window which felt a lot smaller than expected - the company had written to say they might do this, so we sort of understood, but we'd have preferred to have the one we booked all the same. Overall, though, we still had a good stay."
5074924,55776203,2015-12-06,25731045,Daniela,"The apartment is in a beautiful building in a beautiful neighbourhood. It is clean, secure and well-insulated. We had easy walking access everywhere we wanted to go, and the subway is just around the corner. We were really happy with our stay and highly recommend it!"
"\"",,,,,
5074924,56119244,2015-12-09,8602136,Siti Fadzilah,Instructions to enter the apartment were clear. Using number codes to enter the apartment is a bonus as I do not need to hold on to any keys.
Apartment is clean and lovely. Cozy for 2 people,though it feels smaller than what is pictured. Love the location as there are plenty of eateries along the main roads.,,,,
And most importantly,"I feel safe walking around the neighborhood. \"",,,,
5074924,56469937,2015-12-14,34091089,Sam,"Although we didnt get to meet Brent, the instructions left for us were more than adequate to find the studio and get in. We had a great time in Boston and would highly recommend this place to anyone else. It is in a great neighbourhood close to shops, bars and restaurants."
The studio is a perfect size for 2 people and the bed very comfortable.,,,,,

"Anything but great ! \"",,,,,
5074924,58525591,2016-01-03,15509587,Vicky,Good location and cute little studio with everything one can need. This is not a typical airbnb experience where you meet the host etc but communication still went well.
5074924,59377896,2016-01-10,18679097,Brian,"Great studio and even better location. The unit was exactly as described, and the rental process was easy. The room is a bit snug, smaller than a hotel room, but worked for us since we didn't spend much time there. Would definitely rent again."
5074924,59565212,2016-01-12,21183008,Michelle,"This is a bare bones and simple booking, I didn't speak to anyone as the whole thing is handled through a rental company. I was sent codes for getting into the house and room and provided with a list of instructions relating to wifi/clean-up/neighborhood gems. The room was fine, and everything was very clean. There are three rooms on each of the six floors - I believe all short term rentals. It's an old house and sound proofing is not exactly its strength. The couple next door to me tried their hardest to make a baby this weekend, meanwhile I was trying to sleep in between long days of work and meetings. Next time I'll bring a noise machine and stronger ear plugs."
5074924,60116598,2016-01-19,9430167,Catherine,"This was a nice little spot in the South End! We enjoyed being close to restaurants and bars in the back bay. The location was the best part, however, and we didn't love a few things. The entire building is short term rentals and the walls are very thin. It also seems as if the entire building was gutted to make these units several years ago; the furniture, carpeting and sheets/towels are dated and seeing some wear. There was no central heat source, either - we relied on the space heater for heat. Overall, it was a fine spot for a weekend, but it is not as nice as it looks in the photos."
5074924,60620017,2016-01-25,5146304,Jon,"Location, accessibility, furnishings, pricing were ideal for an upscale area of Boston."
5074924,60954052,2016-01-30,50097090,Taylor,"Such a beautiful area and building, easy walking distance to most of the major attractions and you'd want to be walking in such a lovely neighbourhood! The flat is simple, and there are a lot of stairs to climb with heavy luggage. As mentioned in other comments there isn't much privacy in terms of sound-proofing. Be careful to make very clear how many people are staying, there were two of us but were only provided with one towel. Overall, for the price it's a good option if you want to stay in a great neighbourhood and feel like a local."
5074924,61298399,2016-02-02,46501937,Faith,"The apartment was in a good area, very close to everything we needed. Short walk to the T. It is small, but not outrageously so."
I loved the look of the buildings and how close it was to the Prudential Center and the river!,,,,,
My one complaint would be that it was cold. I stayed in January,so that's to be expected,but the inside of the building was in the low 60's which didn't do much to warm us after we came in from the cold outdoors. We couldn't find the thermostat so we texted the building manager after hours and he replied quickly (which was awesome!!) he told us the thermostat was out in the hall,but unfortunately when we went to look it had a lock on it,so it didn't do much good.,
We later found a space heater that made things a little better.,,,,,
All in all I would stay again,"just probably not in the winter.\"",,,,
5074924,62806179,2016-02-17,49181663,Bayley,"We did not have any direct contact with Brent or anyone else, which was a new experience compared to staying in a traditional hotel. We were sent an email prior to our arrival with the door codes and check in/check out information. It was very easy to find the apartment complex and get up to the room. Be ready to climb some stairs!! The studio apartment was essentially just as shown on the listing. Was a bit smaller than we had expected, but definitely suited our needs (coming back after a long day of walking around town and getting some sleep). We did not use the kitchenette at all, so I cannot write much regarding what was available or working. We had great visit in Boston, despite the record cold temperatures while we were there. We can't wait to come back someday and do some more exploring of New England!"
5074924,63497848,2016-02-23,1113689,Patricia,Quiet and good location.
5074924,64283427,2016-03-02,50296804,Maddie,"\"The place was as described. Pretty small and good for a home base while exploring the city. I never talked to the \"\"host"
5074924,66361544,2016-03-22,34253470,Violette,"Le logement est très bien situé, très propre et très fonctionnel. Tout est comme sur les photos. Nous avons reçu les codes d'entrée et toutes les informations nécessaires quelques jours avant notre arrivée. Ainsi, nous avons pu être totalement indépendants. Grâce à ce petit studio, nous avons passé un excellent séjour à Boston. Si nous revenons dans cette ville, nous réserverons de nouveau cet appartement."
5074924,67124293,2016-03-27,47821426,Lucy,"A good location, 5-10 minute walk from 2 subway stops and good restaurants/grocery shops nearby. Apartment is managed through a company who seem to have a few rooms in the same block, so never met a host. Very thin walls! A decent sized room, plenty big enough for 2, though we didn't use the kitchen area as there was only a stove top and sink with no preparation room. The photos reflect the property- few personal touches, but fine to use as a base for the city."
5074924,68674498,2016-04-06,9315906,Carmen,"The location of the apartment is excellent, but the whole experience was the worst we have ever had using AirBnB. As soon as we arrived we had some issues. There were strong fresh paint fumes, the window blinds were impossible to operate, and Internet stopped working. Our request for help was not answered. The following day we found that the bed frame was in the brink of falling apart. That request was taken care quickly, but the person that fixed it leaved the apartment filthy, with screws and wood shavings all over the place. And then the boiler of the building broke down on a Friday morning, and we were without hot water and heating for the rest of our stay (4 full days and nights). This was in the middle of a snow storm. We were offered to use the shower of a different apartment building on Monday, three days after the problem began. And finally we got a partial refund of only 50% of the days we were without heating. A truly terrible experience."
5074924,69338735,2016-04-10,58526278,Ian,"Good place, communication, and location. Would stay again. However, would've have liked shampoo and bathing soap to be provided."
5074924,69526931,2016-04-11,49896095,Valeria,"El departamento es igual a las fotos publicadas. Es limpio, cómodo y tiene los elementos necesarios para una estadía en la ciudad. Tanto el departamento como el  barrio son divinos. Tiene comunicación inmediata con el subte además queda bastante próximo a los puntos de interés de la ciudad para poder ir caminando. Nos sentimos a gusto. Lo recomendamos."
5074924,70051050,2016-04-15,58263973,David,"Exactly as advertised: small, sunny, clean and no frills. Smaller than your average hotel room, but unless you want amenities, great value. Access was easy, and the location is great."
5074924,76315028,2016-05-26,30229614,Joanne,"The room we had was exactly as advertised on airbnb. We accessed the apartment via key-code, so had no interaction whatsoever with any of the owners/staff. The room and bathroom were both great, spacious and clean. The location was also great - near backbay. The building is on a beautiful street near lots of gardens and restaurants - would definitely recommend it."
5074924,77966133,2016-06-04,37234366,Jennifer,Communication with Brent was really easy. Getting access to the building and room was excellent. The room was smaller than I expected and just the basics are there.

4181530,21532611,2014-10-19,21263144,Dean,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Rachel and Marc's home while on a trip to Boston. Their home was easy to find and in a beautiful neighborhood just outside of downtown. The Green line was just a short 8 minute walk from their condo, and several local restaurants, pubs, and grocery stores were also within walking distance. Rachel provided us with very detailed instructions for getting into the home, taking care of their sweet cat (Hadley), and how to use their television.  The living space was as advertised; spacious, clean, and full of natural light. Caring for Hadley was very easy and it was nice to have something to come home to after a long day of sight-seeing. Although Rachel and Marc were not in town during our stay, they responded to our questions very quickly through email. They were even nice enough to mail us an item we left behind. Overall a very positive experience, we would definitely stay with them again in the future."
4181530,22542806,2014-11-09,22552285,Christi,"Definitely recommend staying here. Rachel was the sweetest host, was super helpful in finding cool things to do and see, and also with showing us the public transportation system. Super close to a bus station that takes you directly into downtown and about 10 minute walk to the T. Jamaica plain is a really cool artsy area, we really enjoyed staying here. All around a great first visit to Boston. Would most definitely stay here again."
4181530,26688386,2015-02-17,11339676,Jack,"This was a great home base for a college-visit trip with my daughter. The apartment is very spacious, clean, and bright, and I'd say it's even more attractive than the photos suggest. It was well stocked with everything we needed.  The location is great -- there were grocery stores, restaurants, coffee shops, etc., aplenty within a short walk -- even a library.  Rachel kept in close touch with us to make sure everything was going well.  Next time we revisit Boston, we'd like to come back."
4181530,27087393,2015-02-25,23719487,Gina,"Rachel's home is beautiful, clean and spacious. It has everything you need in it.  I believe it should take shorter walking time during warmer weather, but the house is only 12 min walk in the snow to the nearby Green Street MBTA station. Although Rachel and Marc were not in town during our stay, they responded to our questions very quickly through email.  After a few days of stay, we didn't want to leave."
"Highly recommended to anyone.  I will definitely stay here again if we come to Boston.\"",,,,,
4181530,27638231,2015-03-09,4051167,Nicholas,"If you're looking for an affordable, comfortable, no hassle stay in Boston, then I would highly recommend Rachel's apartment! It's only a 10 minute walk from the T, and Rachel was an awesome host. Both of the beds were very comfortable, the wifi was great, and the kitchen was a great alternative to eating out every day. Rachel was also kind enough to list a bunch of great spots to shop and eat around town. This was my first experience using airbnb, and Rachel made it very stress free and streamlined. Thanks Rachel!"
4181530,27945870,2015-03-15,4671726,Jennifer,"Rachel's place is fantastic! She is right near the main little strip in Jamaica Plain and it is a great and quiet part of Boston with so many good restaurants, cafes, shops, etc. It is super easy to get in and out of Boston proper on the T and you will be hard pressed to find a better deal in such a stellar apartment. Rachel is very communicative which makes the whole trip stress free."
4181530,28477410,2015-03-24,27963606,Stuart,"Rachel was an excellent host.  The information about the condo was clear and accurate.  Rachel was solicitous about our settling in, responded right away to our questions and was otherwise unobtrusive.  The condo itself is lovely, comfortable, relaxing, with lots of natural light and a well equipped kitchen.  The location is great.  Charming, convenient shops and restaurants a short walk away and a MTA subway stop close by for going farther afield."
4181530,28661514,2015-03-28,13074052,Mike,Everything was exactly as described!!  Great place - easy access to T.  Very comfortable.  This was our first AirBnb and Rachel made it easy.  Quaint neighborhood!  We would totally use again on another trip to Boston.

We appreciate how at home you made us feel, and your willingness to share! Lots of fun gadgets and appliances i've always wanted to check out too. Would definitely recommend"
4181530,46133053,2015-09-08,8109237,Janet,"We had a great visit. The flat was in a terrific location and just as advertised. Rachel was incredibly responsive and helpful. It was crazy hot in Boston that week and we really appreciated the AC! Only glitch for us was that I was recovering from a back injury so the third floor walk up aspect proved a bit challenging for me, but that's more about me than the place! Highly recommend."
4181530,48378010,2015-09-26,2373126,Lynne,"Rachel's  home was just as described on-line - in fact I think it was even better than the photos and description indicated.  The house is very quiet, the rooms are very bright and large and we were extremely comfortable.   We loved the big deck and enjoyed sitting there in the evenings after a day of sightseeing.   The apartment is sparkling clean and the beds very comfy.  My husband and I slept in the second  bedroom on the inflatable bed and I have to say that it was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in.  It was just like a cosy cocoon!"
Sadly we didn't meet Rachel as she was travelling but she responded immediately to any questions we had.   Checking in and checking out was super-straightforward.   The neighbourhood is lovely - very friendly and tranquil and with excellent public transport links to get downtown.  We had wonderful meals in the neighbourhood.   The very best was at Vee Vee's.   Delicious food and delightful attentive service.,,,,,

4181530,49877328,2015-10-07,25319250,Meredith,"We had the most wonderful time here. Jamaica Plain is a perfect location as is Rachel and Marks apartment. It was everything we wanted and we even managed to spend some time out on the verandah. We experienced everything on offer in the area - the restaurants, the walk around Jamaica Pond and strolling the streets - our particular favourites were Vee Vees, Ten Tables for dinner and 7 Ponds for a great cup of coffee. The ease of catching the train was a real bonus to the location taking us just where we wanted in Boston. A wonderful place enabling us to have a wonderful experience - thank you."
4181530,62534293,2016-02-15,1920539,Caitlin & Dan,"Our family stayed in Rachel's place for a reunion and said it was absolutely perfect! The location is fantastic and the apartment was clean, warm and very inviting."

Spotlessly clean, spacious, warm (excellent heating system- we stayed during a pretty cold weekend!), well equipped kitchen, brand new washer/dryer... and a short walking distance to the T (orange line) and to a variety of restaurants and cafes!"
"We could not have been happier!\"",,,,,
4181530,65338345,2016-03-13,16442614,Isabelle,"Rachel was very gracious and communicative throughout our stay. Before the trip, she sent a couple messages with additional detailed information about the condo. Everything in the house was clean and cozy; the four of us stayed there very comfortably without feeling cramped at all. Her downstairs neighbors are also very friendly and the neighborhood in general is pretty quiet and safe. We loved that the house was only a couple blocks away from Center Street, which is full of shops and restaurants, and less than half an hour from downtown Boston--just far enough so we weren't caught in the tourist rush every day, but just close enough so that sightseeing was a breeze. Everything about the stay was ideal...I only wish we could have spent more time there!"

4181530,97833868,2016-08-28,44285746,Bj,We both felt this had to be the best Airbnb stop yet. It made us feel like we were at home. Very impressed with the whole stay. Thank you Rachel and Marc.
4430821,24066103,2014-12-18,2668259,Shay,I spent a couple of nights in Jamaica plain. I had a great time!

4430821,24168138,2014-12-21,23188787,Tran,"Me and my boyfriend stayed at Nina's place for a night, and we definitely enjoyed it a lot. The room is exactly like in the photos, and the apartment in general is really cozy and clean. We had everything we need. Nina even provided us with some fruit and a free metro card! Nina's place is a 5 minute walk from the subway station, and it takes about 30 minutes to go to the downtown, which is quite accessible. We'll definitely come back here when we visit Boston again."
4430821,24284217,2014-12-24,24623607,Constanze,"My friend and I stayed 3 nights with Nina and Emily and their cats. It was really a great experience. They are both lovely hosts and we had a lot of fun together cooking, playing board games and talking."
They have a beautiful,cozy apartment with a lot of space where we could spent out evenings because it was so cold outside.,,,,
Nina and Emily gave us great tips about the beautiful places in Boston!,,,,,
"Thank you very much for your hospitality! We hope to see you again!\"",,,,,
4430821,25056371,2015-01-05,25128185,Kristin,"Nina and Emily are very laid back and really cool hosts. I spent 4 nights with them as my first airbnb experience and have to say if I visit Boston again without hesitation I will definitely be looking to stay at their place again. The room was really big with a relaxing feel and a verrry comfortable bed!! Their place is very cute and clean.  The area is really great with numerous food, bars and coffee options within walking distance. I loved it and wish that I never had to leave.. Thank you Nina and Emily, you guys are awesome!!"
4430821,25318500,2015-01-12,19105688,Caroline,"Nina was amazing! My husband and I were exploring the city in the bitter winter and since I was not prepared for the cold ( complete understatement), Nina let me borrow some of her clothes! She gave me great guidance on what neighborhoods to explore and a little history on the culture of the city and JP. Such a sweetheart, would totally stay with her again and again!"
4430821,25604872,2015-01-20,10079494,Sophia,"Nina was a great host!! Very welcoming, and she even offered to drive us from the bus station since she was nearby at the time of our arrival. The room and apartment was very cozy, perfect for our weekend getaway.  We felt very comfortable and would be happy to return. Location is close to the T so it was easy to get to and from downtown Boston. The cats we adorable, friendly, and very well behaved! They aren't allowed in the guest room though so it was still suitable if we didn't want to be around them."
4430821,25908992,2015-01-29,26030877,Claire,It was our first Airbnb experience ! And it was realy great ! Even if it was too quick !!
You will feel home at Nina's ! The room is big,clean and comfortable.,,,,
Her place is very well located: nearby the subway and closed by so many good restaurants !,,,,,
"We really recommend her place !  Thanks Nina !\"",,,,,
4430821,27005523,2015-02-23,10284784,Jessie,Nina was an amazing host and helped us settle into Boston. Her place is wonderful and a short walk to heaps of cafes and restaurants in cool JP. I'm not a cat person and I even loved the cats!
Super-flexible,"helpful and fun! I highly recommend staying with Nina.\"",,,,
4430821,27719461,2015-03-10,26626157,Eline,"The communication with Nina went very well and the place was very easy to find. The accomodation is close to the metro station, which makes it easy to travel between the city center and the accomodation. The room was clean and very spacious. Nina and Emily were very nice and the cats were very cute and cuddly. I would recommend people to stay here."
4430821,28253685,2015-03-21,11897340,Jytte,"Our stay at Nina's appartment was great. The appartemnt looks exactly as on the prictures, it is clean and cosy and as it is located next to a metro station you easily get into the city centre. Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend to spend some time at their neighboorhoo as well where you will find many cool shops and cafes. Thank you for all your hospitatlity and your insider-tips which enriched our stay in Boston. I would definitely recommend other guests to stay here."
4430821,29736132,2015-04-12,26049274,Adam,"As a first time Airbnb-er, I couldn't have hoped for a better experience than staying with Nina and Emily!"
Their apartment is beautiful - homely yet clean and modern,in a great part of JP with several decent options for coffee and a bite to eat,and with very easy access to central Boston (the T is a five minute walk,and there's a direct bus to the Longwood area).,,
As hosts,they went out of their way to be welcoming,but also seemed very happy to provide peace and quiet where desired. Excellent books,"conversation and two (very well behaved) cats made for a lovely week!\"",,
4430821,30271395,2015-04-19,18221965,Junbo,"Very nice host, kind and patient, very comfortable and clean room, cultural environment, it is really a good experience to live in this room which perfectly match the city it located."
4430821,30638932,2015-04-25,10957988,Rhys,Nina was very friendly and helpful during our stay. The room is a good size and bed was comfortable. Unfortunately the floor was quite dirty when we arrived and there was a lot of cat hair on the floor and on the bedspread/top pillows - that put us off using them right away.
"The house was in a great location and very close to public transport.\"",,,,,
4430821,30960991,2015-04-29,9247518,Scott,"Nina was a great host and the place is very comfortable! The communication with Nina was very good, and she gave us a lot of recommendations on forehand and when we arrived. Jamaica Plain is a very nice neighborhood, and there are tons of good bars, coffee places, parks and restaurants within walking distance. The T-line is also just a couple minutes away. Nina provides you with soft towels and fresh sheets, we had some good night's sleep! If you are looking for an affordable, friendly and comfi room in a good location: this is it!!"
4430821,31122373,2015-05-02,28774599,Michelle,"My short stay in Boston was wonderful thanks to Nina's hospitality. She is located conveniently near the subway station, the T. She was extremely welcoming and made me feel like her place was my home. My favorite part was their selection of teas and watching tv with them! If you are looking to stay at a home that is in a quaint part of town, I highly recommend staying here."
4430821,31375909,2015-05-04,31649491,Jason,Completely comfortable experience. Nina is great! I loved the apartment and really encourage anyone to book a stay her place. I used to live in the neighborhood many years ago so I had the opportunity to see how things have transformed. I love Jamaica Plain.
4430821,31893533,2015-05-11,16756215,Sofia,"Nina was an incredibly kind and gracious host! She was great about giving her time when we wanted to chat/seek advice, but also very respectful and courteous when we wanted private time. The room was comfortable and spacious, and the cats are adorable. JP also has a lot to give in terms of restaurants and sight-seeing (the Jamaica Pond is gorgeous!), but it's super close to the T so it's easy to go into Boston when you want. Highly recommend staying here!"
4430821,32183810,2015-05-15,31459962,Courtney,Nina was a great host with plentiful knowledge of the neighborhood. JP is definitely an awesome part of Boston and I am so happy that I got to enjoy it to the fullest. The Room was so clean and well kept - falling sleep under a sky light is also pretty great.
4430821,35040647,2015-06-14,6817025,Claire,"Nina and Emily were great hosts! Communication was easy beforehand, they gave us clear directions, and their place was lovely!  The apartment is really cool, nicely decorated, bright, comfortable, and quiet. Easy walking distance to the heart of JP!"
4430821,37556387,2015-07-08,4417101,Nicole,"We enjoyed our stay at Nina's and Emily's a lot. Both are very welcoming and helpful, they gave us many recommendations for places to eat and see. Their place was as described. Cool neighbourhood, many parks and cafes nearby, metro right around the corner. We'd definitely come back!"
4430821,57153109,2015-12-22,43378272,Wendy,Charming apartment in a great neighborhood. Nina was very helpful and accommodating.
4430821,57695204,2015-12-28,10846248,Janet,Very comfortable and spacious apartment in great neighborhood.  It was great for our teenage daughter to have her own room (with balcony) way at the other end of the apartment.  We enjoyed walking in the nearby arboretum and going to a couple of cafes nearby.  Very convenient to T station.  Communication was excellent throughout.  Appreciated Nina's tips about places to go.
1372816,8269511,2013-10-22,6310323,Jef,"The place was lovely and came well-stocked with basics (dishes, etc.), and everything went smoothly."
1372816,31013264,2015-04-30,1545313,Kalhan,Great place in a great neighborhood!
1372816,32709436,2015-05-20,28648541,Gisela,La descripcion del anuncio fue correcta. La unidad que me toco no tenia esa iluminacion. la ubicacion es perfecta!!!!!. A pasos de la calle mas bonita a mi criterio de Boston.
1372816,35481855,2015-06-19,6121216,Jim,The description was accurate and the neighborhood and place were both great! We only wish that the shower drain hadn't been slightly clogged and that the internet had been stronger.
1372816,38851265,2015-07-19,23245906,Amy,"Stayed in Unit #2 - which is shown in part in the listing along with another unit. The location is excellent, and it is definitely reflected in the price/night. The lodging, which is described as a condo - but is really more of a very small ~200 sq. ft. hotel room with a kitchenette - needed some TLC. The unit was generally clean, but the bed/bedding was worn and of poor quality. The bathroom was pretty dingy and could use some updating. Overall, we generally felt like the photos in the listing made the place look quite a bit nicer than it was in reality.  Positives were ease of check-in and checkout; the unit is managed by a company that manages short and long-term lodging in the city, so everything was handled professionally. Also - as mentioned - the location is fantastic. With a little attention and some updates, I feel like this listing would be a five star review."
1372816,75191565,2016-05-19,54194427,Alexander,"The location is fantastic. Half a block of Newberry, right next to the conference center and a quick walk to Cambridge. The space is simple and clean."
11686744,68504762,2016-04-05,55401340,Julia,"It was great how the apartment already had anything we could possibly need, especially in the kitchen.  We didn't have to worry about bringing paper towels, dishes, or dish soap.  That was all there - something we weren't expecting - and a really nice treat."
11686744,70791654,2016-04-20,58204922,Richard,"This apartment was immaculate and located conveniently above one of the Flagship Whole Foods.   The location to North End and South end Boston restaurants was great. My wife and I were running the Boston Marathon, the location to Boston Commons was a 8 minute walk.  Overall we will be using Flatbook on our next trip to Boston!"
11686744,75456122,2016-05-21,39940660,Kristen,Everything was great! Flat was very clean and comfortable.  Great little neighborhood and a quick walk to downtown Boston :)
11686744,80413534,2016-06-18,12547101,Meghan,The Flatbook team was very helpful.
3250739,15114263,2014-07-02,5347664,Thuy-Vi,"The room is clean and the location is really great, just a few minutes to the subway! Thanks!"
3250739,16633734,2014-07-30,18227059,Claudia,"Me and my sister stayed at the appartement 5min to Umass, 10 to City, 15 to MGH Boston for five nights. The location was great (very close to the T station (red line) so it took us 15 minutes to reach downtown Boston and a nice beach nearby). The room was nice for a couple of days. We had a new wardrobe, a large bed and even a desk. Unfortunately the shared kitchen and bathroom were quite unclean and could use some renovation or make-over."
"In total it was fine for a few days stay and and the great location made up for everything. \"",,,,,
3250739,17210677,2014-08-09,16619153,Sayan,Nice staying. Hosts are really friendly and caring...
3250739,18072280,2014-08-21,652191,Célia,Orchid was great host. She wasn't around but definitely replied to any of our texts. The flat is perfectly located next to the subway and it's very fast to the center. Lots of cool people in the house to talk to. I'd definitely recommand this place!
3250739,19362073,2014-09-11,15408636,Nikolay,Very good location. Close Red Line T and Umass. Orchid was very attentive and polite. The room was clean. I was very happy my stay.
3250739,19893188,2014-09-20,782476,Trevor,"Orchid was friendly and responsive to questions. She doesn't live at the apartment, though, so you won't see her much."
The place itself is rented solely for AirBnB use. There are dead-bolt locks on each room's door,so your stuff should be safe. I only saw the other people staying there once or twice in the entire week and a half I stayed. Everyone was reasonably quiet.,,,,
The room is what you'd expect at this price range. There was a desk,a bed and a closet with shelves for clothes. The Internet took a few minutes to get working,but after that,worked well.,,
The common areas were far less clean than the room itself. The bathroom had mold in the shower area and when I arrived,the place had an unpleasant smell. A cleaner comes by a few times a week,and the smell improved after being cleaned. But the common areas really need a deep clean and some remodeling.,,,
This is the first AirBnB I've stayed in that didn't provide towels. Remember to bring your own or plan to buy one when you arrive. I bought two and left them there,so maybe they'll still be there for future stays.,,,,
The location and the price are what makes this place. It is a few blocks from the JFK/UMass stop on the red line,"making it quick to get into the city.\"",,,,
3250739,20568371,2014-10-01,4060134,Leandro,I had a great time at the room Orchid has rented me. The description was correct. The apartment is very close to a red line subway station so it was easy to be in minutes in the downtown or Cambridge.
The young people living in the same apartment were friendly.,,,,,
The share bathroom was OK. The kitchen could be more clean,but it was algo OK.,,,,
Orchid is a very helpful person.,,,,,
"I think it is a very good place to stay a few days.\"",,,,,
3250739,21342319,2014-10-15,20675389,Jønathan,"Location and room is as stated. Very convenient and close to the Red T station. Since my friend and I both had to take Red Eye flights, we arrived very early. Orchid was very helpful by responding and arrange someone to open the door for me. Overall great experience! Only thing that i think can be improved a bit is the cleanliness of the bathroom."
3250739,22023161,2014-10-28,3474902,David,"\"The room and house were as described in the listing and previous reviews. I found it to be a very comfortable, quiet place to stay located right off the red line. Prior to my arrival, I did ask about the availability of parking and was told there is \"\"off-street\"\" parking - this is not the case. There is no off-street parking. Finding street parking around the house was reasonable. The street the house itself is on is resident permit parking only from 10 am to 6 pm during the week but there are nearby streets without this restriction.\""
3250739,22664019,2014-11-11,22631107,Hideki,"Good host, and the location is convenient for anything in the city."

3250739,34034778,2015-06-03,34443261,Ash,"Orchid was very welcoming, when we arrived to south station we called for directions and it was super easy to get there from where we were, the room was cozy and we were able to cook every night we were there and the JFK/UMASS station is 5 min walk an takes no time at all to get to downtown.. We would most definitely stay there again if we visit Boston again!"
3250739,39859404,2015-07-26,17048294,Morgane,"Le quartier est tranquille et très proche du métro ce qui est un atout majeur. Cependant le principe du air bnb n'est pas au rendez-vous. L'Hôte ne vie pas sur les lieux. Nous avons trouvé la chambre correcte, un peu poussiéreuse au sol (notamment des cheveux) et la surprise d'un cafard dans les draps (bien que ces derniers soient propres). Les parties communes (salle de bain et cuisine) ne sont pas prises en photo. Ceci démontre en effet qu'elles ne sont pas entretenues. Surtout concernant la salle de bain... Vraiment très sale. Un conseil, prenez vos tongues pour la douche !"
3250739,43853272,2015-08-22,36940147,Michael,"Great if you need a cheaper place to crash in Boston. Easy to park on the street overnight and close to the T. The bathroom isn't the cleanest, as others have mentioned, (there was a nondescript brown stain on the hand towel in the bathroom for the duration of the stay)."

1. Owner welcomed me on arrival and the good thing about housing is it is close to JFK station.,,,,,

2. Only one washroom for 8 people,when i was there,so if you want to go to job,you will have to wait a lot in the morning.,,
3. The internet is very slow and will not work after 9 PM and on weekends,as most of people in the housing will do internet surfing.,,,,

10247000,59533418,2016-01-11,52897466,Dan,The host was respectful and friendly. She had a board in the living area that outlined the most popular things to do in Boston and how to get their via the bus (which is located right across the street) or the subway line that can be accessed by bus. In a good location that seemed safe and room was clean.
10247000,69376746,2016-04-11,25217697,Grace,"For a weekend leisure trip, this worked perfectly. Excellent price, roommate was nice, apartment was adorable and safe. It had a young vibe, it definitely felt like we were staying in a grad student dorm."
10247000,70530787,2016-04-18,65986604,Talal,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
10247000,70567090,2016-04-18,65746722,Sunday,"Our stay with Andreina was short, but she made my husband and I feel welcome in her apartment. Her unit is located in an area that is easy to walk to Copley Square/Prudential Center and she gave us some great suggestions on where to go for dinner. Since we stayed over the weekend, we were able to park our car safely behind the building which was a huge plus for us. Anyone looking at the unit should note that it's medical student style housing, although we had zero issues of noise during our stay. We both agree that we would stay with her again."
10247000,76949967,2016-05-29,61622762,Tom,"Just a few days prior to arriving, we realised we would not be able to arrive during Andreina's check in times. We messaged her and she fortunately went out of her way to allow us into the property."
The room was nice and comfortable,however as it was the host's actual bedroom she was staying elsewhere within the building and not in the apartment - this wasn't actually a problem as she was quick to reply to our messages.,,,,
The main and only problem we had was that the card key to enter the building is shared between the host and the guest,Andreina always checked if we needed the card before taking it but this could leave you stuck in the building and not able to make last minute plans.,,,,
Overall,"she is a lovely host and the flat is clean and homely.\"",,,,
10247000,85715946,2016-07-12,74090125,Daniela,"Our stay  in Boston was very nice . Andreina said that we should check in to 5 pm, but we spent so much time in the passcontrol. So it was possible to get the key later. We were all the time alone in the apartment and had it completely to ourselves. If we had questions , Adreina was available and answered our questions ."
The only disadvantage was that  the apartment was not very clean. There were everywhere long black hair on the floor and in the bathroom . Although it is reported on the Internet that the area is not the safest,"but we always felt us there very safe and well.\"",,,,

5581575,87310708,2016-07-19,593232,Simeon,"We loved staying at this airbnb. We were given specific directions about how to get in prior to arrival, and when we arrived, the property manager was there to greet us and make sure that we got in ok. They also checked in and asked if we needed the pack and play, etc. We had water bottles ready for us in the fridge."
The location is in a great part of town. The neighborhood is quiet in a very lively part of town. It's right next to a park and within walking distance to several restaurants and grocery stores. The T is a couple blocks away at the Prudential Center. There's also an Enterprise rental car location at the Prudential Center which was very convenient for pick up/drop off.,,,,,
The space itself is amazing. Everything except the bathroom is newly remodeled,but the bathroom was clean and has a new vanity. The rooms are spacious and clean,with comfortable/big beds,"and extra pillows/sheets if needed. The futon was really comfortable. The kitchen has new appliances and everything you would need.

We enjoyed a few days of visiting Boston, walking everywhere  (except for a trip to Sullivan's at Castle Island) and enjoying the proximity of so many great stores and restaurants to our apartment. The beds were comfortable, the apartment was very clean, and communication with Kathy was excellent. Since we drove up from South Carolina, we parked in the Copley parking garage, which is just a few blocks from the apartment.  Overall, it was a wonderful stay!"
5581575,99649956,2016-09-05,75442323,Vicki,"Kathy is great to communicate with and responds quickly to any questions or correspondence about the apartment.  Kathy's apartment is so convo entry located.  We had a great weekend of walking the city and walked to Chinatown, Newbury St., Quincy Market, the Italian Neighborhood, and even the Aquarium!  We also browsed the Prudential center.  The two-bedroom was great for adults and kids, and the full kitchen was convenient, especially with a baby.  Kathy provided a pack and play too, so we had one less thing to pack.  The apartment is modern, but just FYI- there's only one bathroom and a mini fridge, and just one window AC unit for the summer so you need to keep the door to the bedrooms open to circulate air.  It's perfect for a long weekend trip though and we had a great time."

I can't stress enough how warm and cordial the welcome was (delicious homemade banana bread) and post-it to explain all important stuff you Need to know.  Jeff and Rachel were so helpful and flexible,although we unfortunately did not even meet them in Person.,,,,
Great place,if you want to be away from the city rumble and still be in the city in around 30 minutes.,,,,

It is in a convenient location and public transport is easily accessible (bus to Cambridge stops next to the house). The hosts made it really convenient for us to come in and leave at a time of our choosing. We also loved that fact that the hosts are environmentally conscious and live in a healthy, nature friendly manner. We felt really welcome and if we visit Boston again, we will definitely consider staying at their place again if that would be an option"

I did not meet Jeff in person but our phone and email interactions were friendly and informative and replies were always prompt.  Their house is lovely- the kitchen is well equipped, the living room is very cozy, the tea collection is impressive, and there are cute hand-written notes (ex. how to work the dishwasher and the coffee press) scattered around the place. There's no internet at the house which didn't bother us a bit but may be worth noting if you are planning a working vacation. We thoroughly enjoyed our relaxing weekend away and recommend it highly."

3457722,24483830,2014-12-29,10396014,Lindsey,"\"This giant, beautiful house in Allston was perfect for my sister's non-traditional bachelorette party! Jeffrey and his wife had a little welcoming gift, ample amounts of space, a perfectly clean home, with many charming touches, comfortable beds, and tips and instructions for just about everything needed (recycling, thermostat, etc.). This rental was so, so gorgeous and I would absolutely rent it again. We mostly just used the space to cook a few appetizers, get dressed, and drink a champagne toast before heading out for the night, but I am so appreciative for the big size of the home and that they were able to accommodate our big group without fearing the \"\"bachelorette\"\" connotation :)"
I would recommend this rental to anyone looking for a charming,"clean and comfortable home with lots of character! It was an ideal backdrop for our special night.\"",,,,
3457722,24740562,2015-01-02,2154238,Amy,"From the homemade banana bread to the basket of champagne and New Years glasses, Jeffrey made us feel like old friends. We were a large group of old college friends, now towing our preschool/elementary aged kids with us and this was the perfect place for our once-a-year get together. This place wasn't just kid-friendly; it was kid-PERFECT with Noise machines, little potty seat, lots of kids books, stools, etc. Also, lack of wifi meant that everyone HAD to be away from work! If we ever decide to re-unite again in Boston, this will be our first choice!"

The place was above and beyond our expectations. It was clean,spacious and felt like home away from home. We truly enjoyed kicking back in their beautiful kitchen,catching up- sharing lots of laughs.,

A short cab ride had us in Allston at O'BRIENS Pub where there is live music every night. The neighborhood was very nice and easy to get around. This rental will be first on my list as an option for family reunions!  We did not want to leave and neither will you."
3457722,30437556,2015-04-22,21887348,Ruth,"This was an upstairs of a duplex in a quiet yet active part of Boston. We never heard the downstairs residents. The home is open, warm, cozy and quaint. My two daughters, 1 son-in-law and I felt we were in their older sisters home. There was clear written information re. restaurants, transportation, things in the home (appliances, heat, etc), a basket of goodies, and of course the delicious signature banana bread (with choc. chips) noted in other reviews. The home was very clean, warm, and welcoming. They had made up 3 queen/king beds for us and we all slept well. They do not have WiFi  but gave us other options if it was needed. Our host was available via phone and responded in a reasonable timeframe."
We were there for the B Marathon so lots of people in town. They can park in any direction on these streets but we always managed to find a spot not far from the front door.,,,,,
Jeff is right the bus stop is right next to  the house but not on the bedroom side of the house. It was very quiet at night.,,,,,

We went back and forth a little until he felt comfortable with me and the bachelorette party I was bringing to his home. I assured him we wouldnt be crazy, just some drinks and crafts as well as a place to sleep. We were welcomed with banana bread (YUM!) and cute notes left all over the apartment. Our group all couldn't stop saying how we wanted to move in, that's how adorable the place is! Perfect for our group of 7-8. It was a relatively quick ride into town so it was definitely a great alternative to staying at a pricey hotel in the center of Boston. We also took advantage of their gorgeous kitchen, making a cute cocktail party on friday and breakfast saturday morning. All in all, if the occasion calls for it, we will definitely be back to Jeff and Rachel's wonderful home!!! :)"

We stayed at their place the night of our wedding and it couldn't have been a more perfect night. Jeffrey and Rachel not only were kind enough to share their beautiful home with us, but they also welcomed us with a basket of champagne and chocolate, home-made beer, and home-made banana walnut chocolate chip bread. At the end of a very long night, my fiancé and I headed back to their place, popped open the champagne and ate our first meal as husband and wife, splitting the banana bread. In a day running high with a mixed bag of emotions - anxiety, excitement, happiness, and some sadness, this lovely apartment was the much-needed sanctuary John and I needed to recenter ourselves once again and focus on what's really important - good champagne, good food, good company, and the love and kindness of strangers.

Hope more and more Chinese people can get this experience!我们入住了两晚Jeffery的家,房东Jeff是个非常负责人的人,非常抱歉之前一直没能及时回复你的邮件,直到最后时间才回复他,但他还是精心为我们准备了屋子。六个人入住唯一的不便就是厕所只有一间,但合理安排洗澡时间还是没问题的。房间都很干净,很喜欢主人的装饰,非常温馨,一看就是很会生活的主人。厨房里各种工具应有尽有,大胆去超售买材料准备丰盛的晚餐吧,Jeff的冰箱里也有很多食材,包括为我们准备了一个烤蛋糕,还有红酒,可惜我们没机会品尝了。最关键的是这块住宅区非常安全,都是local的美国人居住的,早上起来附近逛了一圈,非常漂亮!波士顿酒店太贵,所以强烈推荐自驾的朋友能体验这样的屋子!一定不会让你失望的!"

It's a good choice for those who are not familiar with Boston, and it's really convenient to go there by subway. The room is a little bit dark but Chuyang provided another lamp.

If you're thinking of choosing between here and any other bed and breakfast or hotel,don't. This is your answer!!,,,,
The charming building is very old (like all others in the area),and the building's heating system was pretty loud.

12750816,86009702,2016-07-14,79034044,Sarah,"Lisa was very responsive to any questions I had, and responded immediately by phone anytime I contacted her. The apartment was cozy and she made sure we had fresh towels and linens. The elevator broke down while we were there, and the parking was a little tricky, but we figured it out. Overall, Lisa was a wonderful host, and our experience was great."

12750816,89099122,2016-07-26,1928798,Adrian,Lisa was so nice and her apartment has everything you need.  Good location and nice building.  Would stay again.
12750816,90190910,2016-07-31,64238700,Julia,"Lisa's place was good. When we got there the hallway was smelling bad. The apartment has a lot of space, but it wasn't really clean and we even find a pill on the floor. The kitchen could have more things, there was only 4 forks and knifes. Small plates and A LOT of frying pans and all didn't look clean. The beds were comfortable but the sheets and the apartment were smelly. We spent most of our days out of the apartment, if that's what you are going to do, this is a good place for you."
2706986,34586422,2015-06-09,7324454,Jens,"The apartment is located in a really central location. Its basically walking distance to any place central in Boston. Jeff is a nice guy, and the apartment is nice and quiet."
2706986,38352280,2015-07-14,6968058,Morgan,"Jeff graciously handled a last minute booking and saved my weekend in Boston. Everything I needed was there, and the apartment is close to lots of fun neighborhoods."
2706986,46661471,2015-09-12,43297846,Andrew,"Jeff was exceptionally welcoming and ensured my co-worker and I felt right at home. Jeff was well connected in the Boston scene and helped us find all the right places to go out after our conference. The space was clean, had all the necessities and was in a nice area of town that felt very safe. Very convenient to hail a taxi, just a block away."
2706986,47887563,2015-09-21,29835419,Jiahao,Awesome apartment!
2706986,48946795,2015-09-29,44272571,David,"Jeff was extremely personable and helpful.  The location was ideal, being in the center of Boston.  I was able to walk to all my desired destinations.  The neighborhood is historic and charming.  I really appreciated the stay."

Jeff was there to great my husband and I upon arrival in Boston late Thursday night, and provided suggestions (where to eat, what to do, etc.).  He then left first thing Friday morning.  As it was our first AirBnB experience, and I must admit it took some getting used to \"\"sharing\"\" the apartment - but otherwise everything was great.  Jeff's roommate Antoine was charming and polite"
The apartment reminded me of my son's first apt (not sure that's a good thing ;-) but the bed was comfy,good internet access,"there was room in the fridge for our wine ... and we were walking distance from great restaurants (\"\"Wink and Nod\"\" and \"\"Barcelona\"\" are a MUST!).",,,
Overall a nice experience,and I would recommend the room (keeping in mind,you'll likely have a roommate ;-),,,
High point:  location,location,location ... Low point:  3 flights of stairs with all my luggage ;-),,,

2706986,51489385,2015-10-20,40754923,Marcos,Jeff was a great host. The flat has an excellent location. Thanks for everything.
2706986,54780400,2015-11-23,5436408,Robert,"Jeff was very prompt and responsive with communication and was at the apartment to meet me when I arrived. The place and the neighborhood are both really nice, and the walk to the Copley area (where I was attending a conference) is quite easy. Jeff is a great host with a great apartment - I would absolutely stay again."

2706986,74421614,2016-05-15,25567192,Abigail,"I've stayed in many AirBnBs and Jeff has definitely been one of the best hosts--great communicator with amazing recommendations. When he asked if I'd feel comfortable with other guests staying in his roommate's room I asked if there would be locks on the door (I had my work computer because was traveling for work), he installed locks on his bedroom door to accommodate my request. The apartment was clean and in the perfect location -- walkable to Boston Commons, North End, Fenway, etc. I never needed to take an Uber because everything was walkable. Jeff provided amazing recommendations to restaurants (Liquid Art House, Neptune, Mike and Patty's, Island Creek Oyster Bar). His roommate, Antoine, was also fantastic. I will definitely look to stay here again when I'm back in Boston."
2706986,76119917,2016-05-24,45243866,Claudia,"Jeff was very respectful and welcoming, even when he had company I felt very comfortable staying there and it was really easy for me to get around Boston."
His apartment is very well located,you are able to walk almost anywhere.,,,,
"It was a very great stay\"",,,,,
2706986,77319104,2016-05-31,1256864,Craig,Jeff's place was fantastic!  It was clean and conveniently located  to lots of things I wanted to see in Boston.  He and his roommate Antoinne were both very helpful and kind.  Their suggestions definitely made my trip better.  I would absolutely recommend their place to anyone who is looking for a place to stay in Boston!
2706986,80937783,2016-06-20,25567192,Abigail,"I was in Boston in May and stayed at Jeff's place and decided to return when I was back in Boston in June. Just as great as the first experience --clean and secure apartment, great recommendations of places to eat/drink, accommodating host, and perfect location for exploring the city. Another great weekend in Boston!!!"
2706986,92773852,2016-08-10,15432772,Thomas,"\"Jeff a été très accueillant à notre arrivée, il nous a même aidé à porter nos valises jusqu'au 3ème étage et nous a donné une carte de métro. Les deux autres personnes qui habitaient l'appartement étaient très sympathiques. On s'est senti comme \"\"à la maison\"\"."
Le seul réel problème était la propreté ! dormir avec de la poussière derrière et tout autour du lit est très désagréable. La taille de la chambre ne permettait pas de poser nos valises,de plus celle-ci était très mal rangé ! beaucoup de choses au sol,sous le lit et sur l'unique meuble qui permettrait aux voyageurs de poser des choses. La salle de bain n'était pas très propre non plus. Mais en dehors de ces choses concernant la propreté,"la localisation de l'appartement est très bien et nous avons été bien reçu malgré tout. \"",,

5146580,31716964,2015-05-09,14127060,Jacques,The place was clean and quiet. Exactly as described.
5146580,31850821,2015-05-10,7848781,Katherine,"I had a very comfortable stay in Sarah's lovely apartment.  The room was bigger than it looks in the photo and has its own private bath.  It's a private suite, really.  I was able to find on-street parking nearby, which can be tough in Boston!  Sarah made finding the key and checking in very easy.  The WiFi password is taped to the frame of the picture over the kitchen table."
5146580,32794054,2015-05-21,33506785,Torben,"I thoroughly enjoyed my experience airbnb-ing with Sarah, she is a very kind woman who really cares about the well-being of those staying in her apartment."
The apartment was exactly as advertised,and the bathroom was shared by myself and one other airbnb-er. There was no curfew and getting into the room was very non-invasive to the house life.,,,,
Also,I should mention that Sarah provides soaps and shampoos,a towel,and a store of FOOD for guests. I was pretty impressed.,,
The neighborhood around the apartment was less affluent than I was expecting,but I was never worried by the fact; I talked to some people around and they were all very nice. There is ample street parking in front of the property,it is listed as permit only,but I was assured by multiple neighborhood people that it was not enforced and I never got any trouble for parking there.,,
All in all,my experience exceeded my expectations and was well worth the money. For this price,Sarah could be largely negligent of her guests and still get away with it,"but instead her performance was far above average. \"",,
5146580,33005858,2015-05-24,31756400,Okichie,"A very standard room. Sarah made it very easy to access the room even though I came in too late for her to meet me personally. I definitely suggest coming in during the day, as finding the place at night was quite difficult for me (it was a bit of a walk from the bus station) and it's not the best/most well-lit neighborhood. Free wifi, towels, fan and thermostat in working order. Very large closet, though I didn't have much. Quiet area, with no disturbances from neighbors or other guests. I only had two minor issues, one being that the bed wasn't actually made up; the bare mattress was simply covered with the bed skirt and flat sheet, and then a comforter was provided. This made sleeping quite cold (I had to crank the thermostat) and a bit uncomfortable. My other issue was that I didn't feel so confident regarding the shower area; there were a lot of random half-used toiletries in there so I couldn't tell whether or not they were intended for my use and/or it had been cleaned. Overall, it's a good affordable place to crash for a weekend."
5146580,33595686,2015-05-30,14942744,Khaled,Sarah you are the best in Airbnb ...
God Bless You,"And Bless Your Child ...\"",,,,
5146580,34184560,2015-06-05,5847081,Malena,"I had a pretty pleasant stay in Sarah's room. Sarah was really responsive when I needed help with the WiFi password and instructions on getting in. The room was very clean and organized, as was the living room. It's a minute from the bus stop, which was convenient and easy to find, and there were fresh towels waiting for me on the bed. The WiFi worked great, and it's a fairly quiet area. Everything was pretty much in working order, but the sinks were a little misconfigured so you needed to put the handles in a certain position to turn them off, and shower pressure was pretty poor. The accommodations say there is food or breakfast included, but there wasn't very much in that way, and I just bought cereal. I was also bothered by the glue rat traps around the kitchen. Overall, though, the room was decent and comfortable."
5146580,34457999,2015-06-08,24289634,Tina Marie,"Sarah seemed to be a nice, friendly host when I met her... Unfortunately I encountered some issues with the apartment and my stay. My check-in time was agreed upon at 4pm. I arrived at 5 to a room with dirty towels, bedding, and dishes. Sarah did evenyually arrive and clean, I was finally in my room at 6:15pm, with no real apology, it seemed she had another commitment (no emergency) and didn't bother to call or contact me to let me know. The apartment room itself were disappointing and felt unsafe. My bedroom had a door with only a tiny doorknob lock -opening to an open alley. The room included one bright overhead light, a bed (with a plastic noisy cover over mattress), and a folding tray table with the plastic wrapping still on. The bathroom had a tiny stream of water and a broken shower door that didn't close. In the kitchen I saw rat traps... It just seemed like an unsafe area and uncomfortable room, that I would not recommend."
5146580,34681179,2015-06-10,27891498,Richard,Sarah was the most polite and hospitable host I've had so far. She really cares.
"The apartment is really beautiful. As she says \"\"you don't have to have money to have nice things\"\". I was overwhelmed.",,,,,
"The area is a little rough late at night but in the day time there's no problems and everyone's friendly.\"",,,,,
5146580,34783948,2015-06-12,16628777,Dana,"Sarah is wonderful and so friendly! And her place is lovely. At first you could think that it's a bit far off, but at the second thought it's not. You can easily reach everything (Fenway Park, South Station etc.) by bus within 20 minutes. Tipp: get yourself a free Charlie Card. The fares are cheaper with it."
5146580,35116519,2015-06-15,5049398,Geoff,"Getting into the apartment was very easy, and the setup was nice, and quiet. And very affordable, I would stay here again if in Boston!"

It has clean bedding ,the room was clean and it was very quiet. the woman next door to my room was incredibly nice and very sweet and in fact we've become friends. The room itself with big. there was a very big bathroom there was also a very nice kitchen and it was just me and the roommate and have all of this space to ourselves. I was so so surprised that this was the type of space  I had for for my first time with air B&B. She had the keys for my room and the keys to the door located in a very clear spot and gave clear directions to do and even had clean amenities and essentials for the bathroom which I appreciate. I think that Sara has a wonderful place it was great. we had a great price and I wouldn't trade it for the world. Thank you so much Sarah for making my first experience with this company the best I'll always come back to Boston as long as you have space for me. I highly advise everyone to go and stay with Sarah and stay in the lower floors because it is very very cool."

Sarah was very communicative and accommodated our special request for luggage drop-off. The location isn't super central, but not a problem with an Uber account.

5146580,43782092,2015-08-22,34439146,Ganesh,"Sarah is very humble , friendly and quite helping throughout my stay in Boston. House description mentioned on the site is absolutely true. The neighborhood was quite and calm. I lived there alone but also saw couples with children staying there as guests in other rooms of the house. I would recommend sarah's place for stay in boston to my friends and colleagues."
5146580,44019817,2015-08-23,19873715,Sergio,The place itself was exactly what my girlfriend and I were looking for - a modest place to lay our heads at night. The bed was comfy and the room was well kept. Only complaint about the room itself would be the bathroom - the shower door was hanging off and overall the bathroom could be spruced up a bit.
What really detracted from our experience was the lack of communication shown by the host. I sent a message a week before our trip to plan out meeting/key exchange details,but never got a reply back. I sent another message about 2 days before leaving,and did not get a reply back until my girlfriend and I were on our way to Boston via bus. This forced us to move around our plans for the day as we had to wait until 4 to check in (again,not a big deal if we could have planned for this).,,
There was also a mix up with the key in the lockbox. We had no idea that there would be other Air B n B'ers staying at the apartment at the same time as us,so we took the key with us while exploring the town. I get a message from the host while at the Red Sox game demanding us to open the door for the other guests and/or return the key ASAP or pay for the other room. She was somewhat aggressive over the phone,especially for the first time speaking to her guests. We told her we did not want to leave the game as we had just gotten there and it was the whole reason for our trip and that we would compensate her for the guests that she lost.,,,
I want to preface this by saying that we accept responsibility for the mix up,as she did note to return the keys immediately to the lockbox in the message she finally sent us back. However,we thought she meant AFTER our stay. Again,I accept responsibility for this but this all could have been avoiding by clearer communication.  Just a little frustrating that the only time we could easily get in contact with her was when she needed to reach us.,,

We had not made any arrangements for anyone to meet us. Because we were in such close proximity to other lodgers,it would have been nice to be greeted by Sarah,with an explanation of who else was in the house. We were left to make our own introductions to complete strangers,who changed constantly over our four day stay.,,
The shared living room/kitchen was pleasant and well equipped. But because our room led directly off it,it could easily have been very noisy. Luckily this wasn't the case.,,,,

We spent almost the entire day out walking around Boston and would come back around 6-7 and be completely fine just hanging in the room. It is just as it was advertised and was a nice place to stay. Sarah is wonderful and overall very good experience.
5146580,52504959,2015-10-30,25315985,Matthew,"The listing accurately described the room and apartment. It was easy to figure out the key situation and which room was which. The whole apartment was in good shape and clean. If you want to do any cooking the kitchen has some supplies and there is enough counter space for most of your needs. The room isn't very large, but it doesn't feel cramped. This room is nice since it has an on-suite bathroom (versus the other rooms in the house have to share a bathroom). The other door in the bedroom leads to the garden; I left it locked the whole time and had no need to go out back. The apartment is close to the Dudley station (bus stop) and I felt safe the whole time. You do get some noise, but it was quieter than a typical city apartment. It was a great deal for a place to stay in Boston and it met my needs perfectly."

I felt safe where I was staying and the room and common areas seemed clean and well kept. The room was private and locked and I had everything I needed. I had no difficulty getting there or getting the keys. It was a great place for a good price. I would definitely stay here in the future.

I would definitely stay at Sarah's again the next time I'm in Boston."
5146580,77320089,2016-05-31,33786459,James,I never met the host but was given clear instructions on how to access the house keys. Overall my stay was satisfactory.
5146580,78298903,2016-06-06,5354197,James,"Sarah's place is very clean,  I was in Room 1 and I really liked the ensuite bathroom and door to the backyard. The people in the neighbourhood are friendly,  as well as Maggie who is staying a bit longer term at the apartment,  she was very generous and welcoming.. if the place is available next time I'm in Boston I'll be booking it"
5146580,78764138,2016-06-09,3998474,Jessi,It is a good place of kindness.
5146580,80910682,2016-06-20,59408139,Eric Shu,"I disn have the chance to meet sarah but she was very kind and very informative about every little aspect of my staying in Boston, she has a beatiful home, very clean, confortable, and in a good neigborhood."
I would totally recommend her place!,,,,,
"Thank you very much\"",,,,,
5146580,84945817,2016-07-09,70173354,Mario And Fiona,Our room was comfortable and within 45 mins walk to Chinatown Boston and good choice of restaurants within 10mins walk. Wifi was a little irregular and a very basic breakfast was made available.
5146580,85805813,2016-07-13,76453754,Matt,"The space was very clean, and smelt great. The bed was very soft and easy to sleep in. The neighborhood is lovely and vibrant; definitely a nice area to stay in and be closer to Boston's rich culture."
Sarah was very accommodating and responsive to questions and changes.,,,,,
"Would book again in a heartbeat!\"",,,,,
5146580,86254344,2016-07-15,63600424,Mukesh,Sarah is very responsive to any questions and concerns for the stay. And she came over within minutes when I was unable to decipher her instructions to find the lock and keys when I arrived at her place.
5146580,92027743,2016-08-07,71283491,Robert,Had the whole appt to myself. Was easy to get to by car and plenty of parking on the streets unless you come in really late. Apartment 1 was nice and the room was private with private bath. the neighborhood is mixed and wouldn't feel to comfortable walking around but as a place just to sleep it was awesome. Thanx for the fan Sarah! Made the hot night comfortable.
5146580,92498771,2016-08-08,213176,Rich,"The apartment was in a convenient location as it was a short cab ride from South Station. The neighborhood felt a little unsafe though. Although Sarah was responsive by email and this was the main way of communicating, but it wasn't clear if there would be other guests, which there was. The place was not bad though for a night's stay."
5146580,92889819,2016-08-10,65144582,Frank,"Room was exactly as described, big plus for the private bathroom. The family that we shared the apartment with was very nice. The location is good and comfortable. Only downside was no air conditioning in the room, but Sarah provides a fan which does a fairly good job. We never got hot at night. Sarah's communication was very good and usually replied within 15 minutes."
5146580,94628153,2016-08-16,67119249,Jonas,"The listing is pretty much as pictured. The neighborhood is maybe up-and-coming, with panhandlers in close proximity. The room was clean/tidied, but the bedroom and bathroom showed signs of either blackened Grout or mold. There were no shades or curtains for the bathroom window. The apartment didn't have air conditioning, which was a challenge with 98 degrees heat. The whole apartment had a strong smell of fish all three days. And the owner's children or other family members were pretty loud in the room right outside the bedroom, early on Sunday morning and late on Sunday evening."
5146580,95350865,2016-08-19,66709186,Marcos,Good place to stay. The apartment is close to a bus station that can take you everywere.
The bathroom is really good and the kitchen has everything you need.,,,,,
One thing: I think is a bit expensive,but on the other hand there are no cheap plases in Boston...,,,,
Overall,"would stay again.\"",,,,
5146580,95879615,2016-08-21,12735198,Pedro,"The listing description is a bit misleading. The neighborhood was rougher than I expected particularly at night, so I suggest taking a cab to the apartment building. The back door to the garden from the bedroom did not have a deadbolt. The Windows do not lock. The shower is grimy and has very, very low water pressure. There was no top sheet on the bed, only a comforter. The bathroom window did not have blinds or curtains. The bathroom towel was provided hanging between the window panes of the bathroom, acting as a curtain. There was no other towel. Paper towels are provided as hand towels next to the sink. The bed is comfortable and the shared kitchen/living room is very nice. Sarah was very responsive and kind in her messages, although we never met."
5146580,96606414,2016-08-23,55947613,Joe,"Sarah was a great host. I was very tired from my work trip so my intention was to catch up with sleep in this room. The room was nice, the family living in the house was very nice to me. Although there are kids around so you will have to sit through some noise but other than that, I really enjoyed my stay here."
5146580,97016005,2016-08-25,86189318,Carlos,"Nice and roomy, room was exactly as described, private room, also private bathroom/shower, friendly people, relaxing atmosphere, definetely would recommend, close to transportation to get anywhere in the city, will be rebooking upon my return to Greater Boston Area"
14387692,94911053,2016-08-17,24425845,Amy,"The apartment was amazing: comfortable, clean, cozy. Perfect for a single person or couple. Molly is awesome. She was willing to wait for me to hand over the key despite my late arrival. Highly recommended!"
5899031,31081350,2015-05-01,26645636,Steve,"Michelle was prompt, clear, and complete with instructions about staying at her cozy little apartment on one of the most beautiful streets in Boston."
5899031,31811705,2015-05-10,27546595,Isabel,"El barrio magnifico y el apartamento muy bien para dos. Faltaría recibir algo de información sobre llaves,wifi,y saber exactamente cual es,pero hemos estado a gusto"
5899031,32523512,2015-05-19,9872375,Julien,"You will enjoy Michelle's apartment and particularly the location: 1 block from Charles river, 1 block ‎from the public garden and 200m from Newbury.‎"
The apartment is very well furnished and proposes a little garden on the front from where you will ‎appreciate the charm of Malborough street. ‎,,,,,

Communication was perfect. Michelle was extremely helpful before and throughout the stay. Also a very generous host,literally a home from home. Everything we needed and more.,,,,
If you come to Boston,stay here. The location is perfect. You will find no better.,,,,

5899031,34703111,2015-06-11,30515730,Sarah,"We can't thank Michelle enough for everything. Wonderful apartment, in a great location to explore the city, relax and shop! Michelle was extremely helpful. We had a fabulous time thanks to her recommendations. Literally a home away from home. Perfect."
5899031,36334675,2015-06-27,36214780,Oscar,"This place looked amazing and was very clean. I enjoyed my stay here in Back Bay. The only issue we had was the A/C was broken / being replaced. We did not know this when we signed up so we had to find out the hard way. We spent over an hour trying to figure out if we were configuring the A/C wrong. Waiting and hoping the cool air would start flow. After waiting for a reply from the host. We found out that the A/C was being replaced. It was a very hot and humid the first day in Boston. After that it cooled down so it wasn't that bad. But if we new the A/C was out, i would have book somewhere else. So other than the A/C issue it was a good stay."
5899031,38332086,2015-07-14,32245,Jay,Michelle was a great communicator and check in went very smoothly. The apartment was right in the middle of everything and walking distance to lots of restaurants . Michelle was also very helpful after we arrived and answered all our questions.
5899031,39763768,2015-07-26,31582449,David,This is a nice space in an excellent location. Michelle was helpful and responsive. I'd recommend this rental.
5899031,40573887,2015-08-01,31420717,Andrea,"Perfect Back Bay location, nicely appointed apartment and smooth communication with Michelle. It did feel like staying at a fashionable friend's place. We have enjoyed our time here, thank you, Michelle!"
Here are a few points to be aware of: there is only a coffee table,no dining table; the window AC unit cools down the living room nicely but not the bedrooms; the kitchen has all the basics but is not equipped for serious cooking. These points were no deal breakers for us,they are just mentioned to manage expectations.,,,
"\"",,,,,
5899031,47767290,2015-09-21,3703848,Claire,"The location could not have been better, and the garden is a great place to sit. We traveled with our toddler, and the space was ok for that, though I wish we had brought a monitor. I would stay here again."
5899031,48433762,2015-09-26,3546218,Leigh,The flat was perfectly located and maintained. Michelle was an excellent host and I would highly recommend anyone to stay there.
5899031,49115105,2015-10-01,35553394,El,"\"We found the apartment with no trouble ... Michele's instructions made it simple to access the apartment as well.  We had everything we needed during our 5 night stay.  The apartment is tiny (by Texas standards) but my son and girlfriend thought it was quite roomy by New York standards.  The apartment was clean and equipped with the essentials.  We did not cook at all while there, so I can't speak to that.  The location and neighborhood could NOT have been better! We loved being walking distance from everything. Boston is a beautiful city!   The second \"\"bedroom\"\" is actually quite small ... more appropriate for small children rather than two adults"
5899031,49658580,2015-10-05,43678361,Mary,Accessing Michelle's very nicely appointed and comfortable apartment was very easy and her communications with me were timely.  The location of this beautiful apartment was excellent.  The interior was immaculate and the master bedroom was very comfortable. I would recommend staying on the prettiest street in Back Bay.
5899031,50072358,2015-10-09,38083615,Mary,"We spent a great four days in Boston. Michele left precise instructions about access and details about the apartment. She responded immediately to my only query, the apartment was exactly as advertised, spacious, beautiful, clean and in a fantastic location. This was my first Air BnB holiday and I had some anxieties about safety and communication, but everything worked out so well-much, much nicer than a hotel. Thanks Michelle"
5899031,50863645,2015-10-15,34753870,Denise,"The apartment was lovely, and the location is fantastic. I really enjoyed my stay."
5899031,52920250,2015-11-02,44090073,Niraj,Was a wonderful stay for a week in this lovely little house . Definitely located on the prettiest street in Boston.
5899031,54144881,2015-11-16,33756995,Jeannie,Great location.  Pretty place.  Would stay again.
5899031,68408027,2016-04-04,60263016,Stephanie,We spent 4 nights at this lovely place which was perfect for us (2 adults and 1 teen).  The location was amazing and Michelle was responsive to our questions.  This was our first bnb experience and we were thrilled!
5899031,74719402,2016-05-16,55003363,Luca,"A five-star experience. We spent five days in this beautiful little house on a beautiful quiet street a few minutes' walking distance from Boston Commons and most of the city's main attractions, and enjoyed our stay completely. Plus, Michelle was extremely helpful in providing information and accommodating our needs. I hope to return."
5899031,78192189,2016-06-05,64142055,Fredrik,Flott leilighet i et flott område i Boston. Kan anbefales på det varmeste!
5899031,81146249,2016-06-21,70257766,Zhibin,Amazing room and amazing area! The apartment is super close to the famous Newbury street and the Marlborough Street is so pretty! The apartment is very clean and has everything we need. Michelle is a very nice host. Definitely recommend this!
5899031,82124452,2016-06-26,66257019,Michelle,"The location was perfect, the street so beautiful, and the apartment very comfortable. It was a great experience!"
5899031,88361621,2016-07-24,3157086,Lisabeth,"This was an amazing location, as many others have said. We were thrilled with kids to be so close to the Boston Garden, Boston Commons, the Esplanade, and the playground around the corner on Clarendon Street. It is a beautiful neighborhood offering the best of Boston. The apartment is spacious and has AC, a well appointed kitchen, great wifi, and flexible accommodations for those with kids who have family bed sleeping silliness they need to work around. Things that might be helpful to know in advance: the two twins in the second room are not full width, so do not make a full width king, if widths are important for avoiding flinging limbs of small children. Also, there is no eating area except the glass coffee table over a rug, so with small children it can take a little creativity to make in-home meals work. There is a small table with two chairs on the front patio, which worked in a pinch. Also, the keys can be a little tricky/sticky. With persistence and faith, they do work, along with expertise gained over the course of the rental. Michelle was incredibly accommodating and very available when needed, even when navigating some technical difficulties with fire alarms. Over all, this is an absolutely lovely Boston rental, with a little creativity required for children five and under, depending on your sleeping and eating needs.  We would absolutely love to rent it again, and look forward to the next time my husband has to be in Boston for work."
5899031,89990674,2016-07-30,64350867,Amanda,"We spent a week in Boston and stayed at Michelle's place.  The location was great; we had to be at Berklee College of Music everyday and it was about a mile walk.  There are lots of restaurants and shops nearby but the street that the apartment is on is pretty quiet.  The apartment is very nicely decorated; Michelle has a good eye!  We were myself, my husband and our teenaged daughter.  She stayed in the 2nd bedroom which is very small but adequate for one smallish person, as there is a daybed.  The only television is in that room as well but that wasn't an issue for us.  The living room is lovely but has 4 club chairs in lieu of a sofa.  The kitchen is small but has everything you'd need and everything seemed to work properly.  There is a combo washer/dryer in the kitchen...the washer worked well but we hung up clothes to finish drying them, as the dry cycle never seemed to get them quite dry...wasn't a big deal.  During our stay the apartment had a good supply of detergent, dishwashing liquid, soap & shampoo, which was nice.  The apartment is long and narrow, and the bathroom area is fairly narrow.  However, the tub/shower is in one room and toilet/extra sink in another, and the main vanity sink was across from those, so they made really good use of space.  The linens were really nice & comfortable.  The mattress in the main bedroom was a little soft for me, but that's probably just personal taste.  I actually loved the day bed that my daughter slept on.  The main bedroom is really lovely and relaxing.  There are a/c window units in that bedroom and the living room and they kept the apartment comfortable during the heat wave that Boston experienced during our visit.  The a/c in the main bedroom is a bit loud when it cycles but we were happy to have it.  We travel with a white noise machine anyway so that helped offset the a/c noises.  Overall, we thought this was a great visit, and the apartment was perfect for us.  I would definitely recommend for couples or couples with one slightly older child.  Michelle is a great host and made the whole process easy for this first-time Air B&B-er.  She recommended lots of great restaurants as well!"
5899031,92869403,2016-08-10,71012185,Sonya,"The location was great, the apt was fine for a family of four, with the kids being ok on the low bed in the second room."
5899031,94066478,2016-08-14,59629586,Evan,"Great location, close to all amenities. Was surprised there was only 1 bed (the other being a futon) and air conditioner in the main room needs to be tuned as it was quite loud. Otherwise we enjoyed our stay and would certainly visit boston again and stay with Michelle!"

4698487,25486230,2015-01-17,25465495,Kara,Katy was an awesome host with a gorgeous home! It was cozy and made you feel right at home. The cats were a nice touch as they are cute and playful. I also got the chance to meet Katy and she was kind and very informative.  I would definitely reccomend you book her home for a comfy stay in Boston!
4698487,40631777,2015-08-01,37362864,Gretyl,"Katy was such a wonderful host - from her early responsiveness by email, text and phone to a warm, welcoming note and cookies upon our arrival.  The house was just as listed and accomodated seven of us more than comfortably for a visit to Boston.  The neighborhood was quite nice and just a short drive from the nearest T - making it convenient for our large group to stay together close to the city.  She was so thoughtful and left out a little guide book of nearby restaurants and activities as well as cold drinks in the fridge.  Her home is just beautiful - well appointed and homey with two sweet kitties for us to play with!  We all felt at home, would absolutely stay again and would postitively recommend Katy to anyone looking to stay in a beautiful home near Boston!"

Tout était très propre, Katy nous avait accueillis très chaleureusement, elle a été très discrète et en même temps à notre disposition jusqu’à notre départ. Nous avons eu tout ce dont nous avions besoin – cuisine super bien équipée, divertissements pour les enfants, patio privé et très agréable. Si nous revenons à Boston, nous allons à nouveau rester chez Katy!"

Would you? So do not hesitate, book it and enjoy your time in Boston. Takes about 30 min (or less) to get to any sightseeing site in Boston if you go by car to Tee (orange ) line train.Leave your car at parking lot there for $7. Do not even bother to drive all the way to Boston (parking is expensive) . Did I mention decent size bowl of sweet cherry, cookies ( and we stayed just one day(night) on the way to vacation spot in in Cape Code. Enjoy of stay in wonderful city Boston. By the way this statement (about city) is from Yankees fan."

The place is great value. The trees give enough shadow,so the room does not get hot despite all the windows. It's a 10 to 15 min walk to the orange line,but bus line 39 is just around the corner and also gets you to Back Bay in a reasonable time.,,,
Being close to the Arboretum and Jamaica Pond is another bonus.,,,,,

Adorable friendly pets, the neighborhood is in walking distance from everything including the train station, restaurants and shops."
"Very welcoming. I'd definitely stay with Carmela again!\"",,,,,
9235198,53733984,2015-11-11,46855817,Sandra,She was kind and welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed.
9235198,54398628,2015-11-19,40333411,Jorge Luis,"Nos recibió a mitad de la noche, en un cuarto acogedor. Pudo ponernos la Televisión y el Bluray player. Carmela y Jared son buenos anfitriones, amables y reservado."
9235198,54548718,2015-11-21,28197439,Cassie,"Incredibly accommodating and the place was clean, safe, easy to get to and in a wonderful location!"
9235198,65919435,2016-03-18,2627839,Jon,"Interesting Beacon Hill room, cool neighborhood and building.  Felt safe walking at night, very close to everything.  Comfy bed and easy to use wifi, which is what I mostly look for."
"I will stay here again.\"",,,,,
9235198,66068546,2016-03-19,3911643,Sélim,The neighbourhood (Beacon Hill) was perfect. Carmela was there on time to welcome us but we felt like it lacked privacy a little.
The description says it is a shared space,meaning it is very disturbing when you want to go for your shower or anything else in the bathroom and you have Carmela and her husband just behind the door...,,,,
The room we rented was quite small,the bed not that comfortable : for that price,we could have rented a better place (compared to all my Airbnb bookings,it is one of the most disappointing),,
I can never live in that situation more than one night. But we were only there for one night,so it doesn't matter that much.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
9235198,67076928,2016-03-26,54119579,Daniela,"The stay in Carmela's house was really nice. She always showed a high commitment and willingness to help us, for example, allowing us leave our baggage in her home after the checked out. The place is warm and comfortable, and his Dog, Maison was a great companion during our stay. We really enjoyed our stay in Boston, and of course we would recommend this place to everyone who want to spend a good time in that city."
9235198,67230782,2016-03-27,21527958,Ran,She is a very nice and quite host. The room has a big TV set which we enjoyed a lot. The area is very central and have good restaurant nearby.
9235198,67908815,2016-04-01,1142591,Chiara,"The Beacon Hill area is absolutely lovely! Carmela was really accommodating with my arrival times, she made sure I could access the flat as soon as I arrived. The room is as in the pictures, is very quiet, the bathroom was spotless. I didn't use the kitchen as I only stayed for one night. The flat is walking distance from most of the things you'll see in Boston, perfect location!"
9235198,68799609,2016-04-06,30029225,Rebecca,"Carmela is a personable, accommodating, wonderful host.  Made me feel very welcome and gave me a run down on the neighborhood.  The room was just as described; clean and orderly.  The National Historic Landmark of the Beacon Hill neighborhood is absolutely charming with the row houses and brick sidewalks.  Great place to start my exploration of Boston."
9235198,68802069,2016-04-06,17814581,Daniel,1.  Show their dog some love.  2. Use the space heater you're provided. 3. Be friendly and courteous.
From my very comfortable,homey experience this is really all that was asked of me.,,,,
My trip to Boston was for a move-in and Carmela's Airbnb created a peaceful space for me to relax after a long day at work while work was being done on my apartment.  I stayed for 2 nights,and both were seamless.,,,,
You share the kitchen,bathroom,living room,and entrance.  The place isn't huge (welcome to Beacon Hill) so I would recommend leaving your wet shoes outside the apartment when you visit them.,,
"Thank You Carmela for the lovely introduction to Beacon Hill.  I will keep you in mind when I have a friend or family coming to visit!\"",,,,,
9235198,69698959,2016-04-12,20361563,Anne,"Carmela could not have been more welcoming. The atmosphere was  friendly and relaxed. Her home is very clean and very comfortable. The bed is awesome! I loved it. The bathroom looked like it had been updated very recently and was as clean as a whistle. Good place for anyone looking for a private room  but particularly convenient for people spending some  time at MGH. Thank you, Carmela."
9235198,69929710,2016-04-14,24647444,Emma,"Carmela was an outstanding host. Her place was really clean, with some great decorative touches. She left fresh towels and shampoos for me and showed me the way around the kitchen. The location is great if you're looking to explore Boston. Beautiful old streets not far away from the freedom trail or Charles Street which has some fab restaurants. Really recommend this place!"
9235198,71111658,2016-04-23,66083563,Laura,"Carmela was a wonderful host! When I arrived in Boston for the first time, I was a bit nervous about trying to find my way around. She sent instructions on how to get to the apartment and made it simple enough that even I couldn't mess it up (and I'm great at getting lost). The apartment was cozy and the location was perfect. She made sure I felt right at home. There were several great suggestions for restaurants and bars in my room, which I found helpful. I had an afternoon flight home and she let me leave my bags at the apartment while I walked around the city one last time. That made my day much more enjoyable."
Thank you,"Carmela. You truly are a Superhost!\"",,,,
9235198,71552346,2016-04-26,68432846,Jacob,Very accommodating. Could only arrive to their place very late and was totally understanding and helpful. Beautiful home in a beautiful location. Beacon hill has unmistakeable charm and I recommend Carmela's place to anyone who wants to stay in Boston!
9235198,71853164,2016-04-29,64186414,Cassidy,"Carmela, her husband and their dog were excellent hosts! A friend and I were there during the weekdays so we didn't run into them much, but when we did they were so gracious and helpful! Their apartment could not be in a better location (walking distance from the best restaurants, coffee shops and boutiques around)! Definitely recommend staying there if you're looking for a true Boston experience. Thanks you guys!"
9235198,73908262,2016-05-11,69298269,Ryan,Great place to stay. Perfect location for a quick trip allowing us to see a lot of the city in a short time.
9235198,74265659,2016-05-14,27907048,Jennifer,My husband and I had a layover in Boston. Carmela was very welcoming. Everything was easily accessible and as advertised. The apartment is in a wonderful location and near many restaurants. I would totally stay with Carmela again!

9235198,80073567,2016-06-16,77164521,Aaron,Carmela was great! Super helpful. Clear directions on where and how to find the apartment. Everything I needed was there. Clean. Great place to stay.

9235198,82777874,2016-06-29,38717891,Melanie,"Carmela was really nice. Overall, the place is clean, and the location is convenient. You get your own room which is semi-basement. It was a little hot but the fan provided by the host helps a lot. Also, the bathroom is upstairs."
9235198,83056524,2016-07-01,69870940,Yoshihiro,"My girlfriend and I spent a couple of days in Boston, and Carmela's apartment turned out to be a perfect spot for us. Located in the heart of Beacon Hill, we could simply walk to Boston Common, North End, Newbury Street, or Charles River Park in 10-15 minutes. Charles/MGH station is a block away which is also very convenient."
The room is one level underground,spacious enough for two people. We were initially worried because there is no AC,but we realized that the temperature drops enough in the evening that the fan in the room was enough to keep us cool.,,,
Finally,Carmela was a great host,"she was always available whenever we needed something. She was even willing to keep our bags after we checked out which was great for us to walk around Boston for half a day without baggage before catching the bus back to NYC. \"",,,

9235198,93597004,2016-08-13,87370200,Ashlee,My stay was excellent! The location was perfect and Carmela and her husband were very accommodating to my arrival and departure times. They helped make my first stay in Boston very enjoyable.
9235198,94908174,2016-08-17,24020319,Karen,"Our host Carmela did a fantastic job helping us find the location of the residence, the key, warning us about the wagging tail welcome of their sweet dog.  It really is a great/quiet location."
FYI-The bedroom is in the basement. It does have a door to an outside patio. It was a bit too warm --but then again it was August in Boston. They did have two fans.,,,,,
For us the room was nothing special,the full-size bed was small,"the pillows need replacing --but all things I think they will change in time. The bathroom is nice. The snacks they left out were thoughtful.  We would recommend this room for single people but maybe not for couples who like to stretch out when they sleep.\"",,,
9235198,98721973,2016-09-01,75793725,Charlie Woojin,It was such an amazing experience. She was like the most generous person in the world

"Thanks for the great stay. \"",,,,,
6598203,51795954,2015-10-24,13325521,Richard,"Nice, clean, spacious apartment in the Seaport district. Convenient for local businesses and a 15 min walk to downtown. It was well prepared when we moved in. Wifi was good. This is a corporate apartment so don't expect much character. Also bring hangers if you have a lot of hanging stuff since there are only a few hangers in the closets."
6598203,54352349,2015-11-18,626054,Dimitry,This was a great spot for a recent trip to Boston. It was a business trip and the host made us feel just like we were in a hotel. Thanks for the great service.
6598203,60733020,2016-01-26,3470644,Weston,"Went to Boston for a work trip. Booked an apartment right next to conference center where I was working. Got to Boston and I got an email saying that the apt I booked wasn't available and was rebooked about a block away. No problem. An hour later I get another email saying that this new apartment was also not available and I was re booked 3 miles away... Called to cancel full reservation but they said they cancellations were not allowed but they could offer me a $100 refund. Ok... Checked in and apartment was great, but the distance from where I was working was a huge issue as it was during the January 23 snow storm."
Overall: Apartment was nice and comfortable but the issues with moving me around put a huge damper on stay. If you need to move someone again this far from where they originally booked,"please let them cancel reservation. \"",,,,
6598203,65014635,2016-03-10,2969887,Emily & Will,"I travelled to the Seaport apartment with colleagues for a work trip. We were looking for somewhere close to the convention centre. The apartment was modern, clean and had good space. The on-site gym was well equipped for our short stay. The concierge at the building are especially friendly and helpful."
Our apartment number/block was changed at short notice before our trip; this was a small inconvenience but was reasonably well communicated and I was given a $50 rebate in compensation so overall there was no problem.,,,,,
Having booked I discovered the apartment is managed by a professional company who let it (and I think several others) via airBnB; while this meant the service I received was efficient it lacked the 'personal' feel I've experienced with AirBnB in the past and it felt quite corporate. This turned out great for a business trip with colleagues,"but if I was travelling for personal reasons I would have felt it wasn't a 'authentic airBnB' experience.\"",,,,
6598203,66687936,2016-03-24,11694885,Linda,"The facility was warm and welcoming and worked with me to hold my luggage in a safe area until the 4 pm check-in time. The location was perfect for walking to the Convention Center with access to many restaurants and the Silver Line train for visiting other parts of the city. Upon leaving, the staff cheerfully arranged transportation for me back to the airport. A couple of minor service issues, typical of those experienced in a new property, were resolved immediately and to my satisfaction. Unfortunately I did not have enough time to make use of all of the building's amenities."
6598203,71295856,2016-04-24,52003196,Michael,"This was an extremely accomodating choice. We were able to work it out to check in earlier and compared to any hotel in the area it absolutely blew them away. ACTUAL internet (not the terrible hotel internet we're all used to), a full kitchen, two bedrooms, AC in the rooms, bathrooms with the proper space...just everything was great. Worth any extra $s you may be spending."
6598203,83416332,2016-07-02,14986807,Kelin,"This is a beautiful apartment and a beautiful part of town. We were in town for a convention and it was an easy/short walk to the convention center. Easy walk to restaurants for meals, and nice area to run or walk in the mornings/evenings. Perfect location. The apartment is spotless and secure. Excellent for corporate use."

The home was a great fit for our party of 3 adults and 1 toddler, and could have accommodated more.  There were toys and books galore, and the owners provided a changing table and pack and play.  Speaking of the owners, they were responsive to my questions and when we had a minor issue at the house, they got back to me right away and followed up to make sure everything was ok.  They even stocked the fridge with breakfast food and a freshly baked pumpkin bread!"

14071446,88420277,2016-07-24,2835552,Olivier,Sandy was an amazing and flexible host. She made everything OK for our arrival at midnight. Much appreciated! Beds are confortables and perfect to rest after a day of visiting Boston. Would definitely recommend her stay!
12221012,74344590,2016-05-15,4722966,Kit,My family rented this beautiful home during a weekend in May to experience Boston's historic North End. We had an absolutely wonderful experience and would strongly recommend renting from Zachary to others looking for a home base from which to experience the charm of Boston.
The place itself was well-appointed,comfortable,and extremely family friendly. Hands-down our favorite feature of this rental was that it's so close to everything we wanted to see!,,,
Located in a neighborhood with a multitude of amazing Italian (Vesuvius,Regina Pizzeria) and Seafood (Neptune Oyster House) restaurants,we were able to walk to beautiful parks (Prince Street & Langone parks),stroll along Boston Harbor on the Harborwalk,and walk to amazing historic sites like the old North Church. It's also touching distance from other great historic Boston attractions like Faneuil Hall,Quincy Market
If you're looking for a great place to stay in Boston,"I strongly encourage you to reach out to Zach - you'll love this spot!\"",,,,
12221012,77315523,2016-05-31,43821343,Elda,"This traveler's unit is located in the beautiful north end and very close to many great Italian restaurants. It's in perfect walking distance to all the markets and many of the historical points on the Freedom Trail. The space was perfect for 4 people and we had no trouble finding it in walking distance as we came of the T (train/subway from the airport). The hosts were fantastic communicators during our stay and left a very informative packet that included everything you need to know about the place. They even had brochures of all the hot spots in historic Boston and some sweet surprises for us on their kitchen table. All of this added to our decision to make our visit and annual event. Beautiful stay, thank you!"

Kara was a good host and answered me back when I needed help with a few things.,,,,,
I don't want to be blunt,but the concierge service was very poor. They didnt seem to care at all. One of them even yelled at my wife because she used the restrooms inside the building where the réception is.....That is unacceptable.  Please remind them to stay polite. It's easier for everyone that way.,,,,
"One other problem: construction works in next building. Lots of noise. They woke me up at 7am on monday morning. I would certainly like to have known that.\"",,,,,

He provided us with thorough and accurate instructions, and he even wrote to alert us to a very minor problem ahead of time, offering to refund some of our money because of it (we did not need to take him up on that offer; it had no impact on our stay).  The apartment was lovely and in an ideal location.  It was clean and neat, and we had everything we needed.  We were able to walk to every place we wanted to go during our stay, and the T was nearby to make our travel to the airport easy.  A garage parking space for our daughter's car was an extra bonus.

Apartment is located in the FENWAY area, 10 minutes walk to reach the regional business center, life is very convenient. Matthew's apartment is located on the five floor, with an open field of view. Divided into upper and lower two floors, above is the two bedroom, the following is the living room and kitchen. It is very quiet at night. Matthew is a responsible owner, we are in Boston, he travels abroad. He arranged for other people to contact us, arrange check in and check out, and asked if we needed any help!

Actually, this place has nothing to do with the \"\"Airbnb experience\"\": you don't live here in someone else house or holiday apartment/room. It's just an house with the most minimum furniture with as target to get the most profit. You could stay here for 1-2 night but I would not recommend longer. The kitchen has barely equipment and in general it's not so clean. I would recommend to stay in a hostel"
So it has a bed and it's close to the metro stop Savin Hill,"that are the good points. \"",,,,
3303860,38220562,2015-07-13,12862529,Eric,I needed a short term place to stay for my 20 year old son.  It was close to his work and the red line Savin Hill Stop.

10809,22386764,2014-11-04,22502466,Mark,"The host was very welcoming, on time and efficient. They even gave us two sets of keys which was great. They offered us a space heater as we were on the top floor and it was slightly colder. The bathroom was shared as mentioned. The location was decent, close to the Harvard/ MIT area and there was a good space to leave my car. The only problem was the wifi was not strong enough to reach the room I was staying in unfortunately so I had to go down to the bottom floor to access it."
10809,23118407,2014-11-23,16323836,Nikka,"When we checked the room with the host, we found that the room slightly smelled of smoke. We requested to be transferred and he did that immediately. We had a private bathroom in the new room and it was also more spacious."
10809,28976342,2015-04-01,6742534,John,Exactly what we expected.  Great spot to crash for a one night trip.  The hosts were courteous and accommodating.   The room was clean and the location ideal.

Yes, the staff is helpful and always trying their best to accommodate your needs. The problem is with the overall quality of the apartments: they are old and run down, and very dirty. Location is nice, although I was expecting somewhat nearer to the city center (my mistake)."

The most important thing is that a room is in wonderful part of Boston. It's really close to Cambridge, right in the middle of an active student life! I recommend you this inn."
10809,66854594,2016-03-25,4102169,Thomas,"Wir haben nur eine Nacht in Boston verbracht. Das Farrington Inn ist ein tolles altes Haus, welches wir als sehr typisch für Boston emfanden. Das Haus verfügt über eine Lobby und diverse Räume, welche vermietet werden. Wir hatten ein Zimmer mit Küche, Bad und zwei großen Betten (Betten waren sehr gut). Das ganze Haus hatte einen gewissen Charme aber auch seine besten Zeiten schon hinter sich. In unserem Zimmer gab es große Wasserflecken ander Decke, welche von einem alten Wasserschaden stammten. Der Duschkopf fiel uns beim Duschen entgegen und auch das verschließen der alten Tür gestalltete sich mehr als schwierig, weil dass Schloss defekt war. Der Vermieter gab zwar sein bestes uns zu helfen aber auch er hatte seine Probleme :-)."
Abschließend kann ich sagen für eine Nacht ok aber für mehr leider nicht.,,,,,

One thing that is important to mention is the coffee place across the street. It should really be mentioned in the description of the experience, as it was a pleasure to have such amazing coffee and bagels in the morning. We are both from NY , one from NYC and the other from upstate, and we were so impressed. Incredibly peaceful and quiet as well."

210097,704711,2011-11-08,1156522,Richard & Jordana,"What a great place to stay while in Boston.  This was our first AirBNB experience and it was wonderful.  Maria is very helpful, thoughtful and approachable, without being overbearing.  The room is just how it looks and the fold-out bed is very comfortable.  The big bonus with Maria's place is the cafe/grocery store a few doors down.  It is on the way to the subway, and does the best coffee we have had in USA yet. plus wonderful muffins.  Jamaica Plains is a lovely suburb with a really trendy vibe.  The subway station is about a 5min walk, and the trains are really easy to follow. Thanks Maria, what a great introduction to AirBNB."
210097,723221,2011-11-15,1386496,Rebecca,"Maria Elena's place is great for a laid-back, relaxed stay.  Small and cozy with a nice balcony.  Very convenient to the T and to good coffee, in a great neighborhood.  Maria Elena is the perfect host - informative and helpful but in no way intrusive.  I look forward to staying with her on my next trip to Boston."

It's a nice neighbourhood and the metro station is just a 2 minute walk away. Getting there from the airport is straightforward and easy!"
The host is also very nice and communications before/during our stay was perfect.,,,,,
With that little balcony I want to come back again in summer,"so I can have my breakfast there!\"",,,,

210097,1093258,2012-04-07,1747058,R,"We really enjoyed our time with Maria Elena and family. The house is a bit creaky, but cozy and friendly and full of character. The kitchen and deck were great amenities. The neighborhood is very quaint and picturesque with many more Victorian houses (I hope that's the right term). It's quiet and a bit far from the center but access to public transportation is very convenient."
Maria Elena was very helpful,"even loaning my wife a warm coat.\"",,,,

210097,1136080,2012-04-16,570748,Susan,"If you want to be in the heart of a fascinating Boston neighborhood in an architecturally interesting house, this could be right for you. Maria and Martine's accommodations are simple and comfortable. Be prepared for a steep and winding stair to get to the third floor studio apt, but  the perch at the top is worth it.  Lovely hosts with a wealth of information about the area. Three houses away from one of the best  cappuccinos in Boston. Two short blocks from a T stop and near a whole foods market. What more could you want?"
210097,1153882,2012-04-20,1309818,Heather,"I absolutely loved staying at this little apartment. The place is quiet, clean and private. Maria and her partner are fabulous hosts, super sweet and very accommodating. The location is amazing: really close to the subway (2 blocks) and only 5 stops from downtown Boston. The neighborhood is fantastic too! Blocks away from one of the best coffee shops in Boston 'Ula's Cafe' and the 'Boston Brewing Co'. if you want to do a brewery tour. Also, there is a great health food store 'City Feed' a block from the apartment. Plus, there are two great restaurants in the neighborhood ('Grass Fed'....best burgers & 'The Haven'...Scottish pub w/ good micro brews & local food eatery). Highly recommend the stay......Thanks Maria! Cheers"
210097,1181106,2012-04-25,2118874,Patricia,"I enjoyed my stay with Maria Elena. She was flexible with the check in and check out times allowing me to get there early on my arrival date and leave later on my departure date. She greeted me with a pleasant smile and a friendly nature and spent some time with me right at the start, providing me with safety tips and advice on what to do and where to eat in downtown Boston as well as in her interesting neighbourhood of Jamaica Plain. Although it was a little out of the way from downtown, Boston's excellent subway system and the nearby Stony Brook Station (minutes away) brought me wherever I wanted to go quite easily. And do take some time to discover JP as I would most likely never had visited the beautiful and serene Jamaica Pond and Arnold Arboretum had I stayed in the downtown core."
Treetop Haven is a cozy,comfortable and clean place to stay equipped with my own little kitchen which,although I didn't spend a lot of time there and didn't cook my own meals,allowed me to stock up on Mike's Pastries and heat up my Calzone from Bova's which I discovered in Boston's fabulous North End! (Although a North Ender later told me that Modern Pastry is the best. Just a little tip!),,
Laslty,because I didn't bring my own computer and asked Maria if there were any internet cafes around,she offered me her laptop and left it with me for my entire 3 night stay. That was very generous and kind. She did not have to do that but I greatly appreciated it. Although I did not see her after that initial time together as it was a very private stay for me,she made it very clear that she would be available for me should I have required her assistance as she was just a flight of stairs away.,,

210097,1233891,2012-05-06,1858249,Patricia,"Our 5 night stay with Maria Elena was excellent in every way. The subway stop is close to their place and the neighbourhood is just gorgeous. Quiet, well kept streets and a 5 minute walk to two fabulous restaurants: Sorella's for breakfast and a cuban one for dinner. Maria Elena is friendly and very helpful. The self contained studio apartment is upstairs on the top floor and is a peaceful haven after a day of sight-seeing! The kitchen, bathroom and living/bedroom are are well stocked and clean as a whistle. The bed is super comfy and if it's nice weather, you can  pop out on the roof deck for a glass of wine (which we did often!). I highly recommend Maria Elena's terrific Treetop Haven!"

But now that we've found 'Treetop Haven' this is definitely where we'll be staying every time from now on. This sweet little attic studio with its sunny, private roof terrace is our perfect place! It's tiny but very comfortable, a real home from home and has everything we could possibly need. The location is brilliant, with public transport, stores, cafes, restaurants, parks and walking paths all within a few hundred yards and the best espresso I've had outside of Italy just half a block away. Maria Elena and her family are wonderful hosts and made us feel very welcome. I'm so happy to have found the ideal spot at last."
210097,1594597,2012-06-30,2466279,Katherine,"Treetop Haven was exactly what I needed for the week. Highly recommended, I will be suggesting this space to friends when they visit Boston. I drove into the city and easily found street parking, but the T was so close that not having a car would have been no problem. Favorite thing was the deck where I enjoyed a peaceful breakfast each morning. Maria Elena was welcoming and available. Great first Airbnb experience for me!"
210097,1751942,2012-07-20,1973418,Kathryn,"My stay with Maria Elena was nothing less than perfect!  She was the perfect host - she'd even put the air con on in time for my arrival... the room is exactly as pictured and perfect for someone looking for a taste of local life outside of the city centre.  The veranda with table & chairs is perfect for sitting outsite for breakfast in the mornings & the room is bigger than it appears on the photos.  The kitchen is well equipped with all that you could need, as is the bathroom... overall a fantastic stay - thank you!!"

The room was cozy with a wonderful balcony to eat breakfast on.  The kitchenette had all the utensils we needed to do meals and the air conditioning unit was a god send.  The provided towels were very nice too.,,,,,
Sadly,we didn`t get to meet Maria in person (we were never around at the same time) but we can assume from her wonderful partner and cordial messages on the message board that she is a wonderful person.,,,,

The fact that the studio was on top of the house gave privacy as well as proximity to the homeowners for any help I needed.

The space is wonderful and gives you a great retreat from the fast pace of the city. Easy to get into the heart of Boston from on the subway. Maria and her family were lovely and welcoming. Pablo the son was so friendly when welcoming us. Great places to eat and get breakfast from within easy walking distance. Fantastic stay and hope we can get back soon."
210097,2147198,2012-08-30,2053060,Axel,The Treetop Haven is a sweet and very cozy room for two under the roof of a beautiful historic family home in Jamaican Plain. Both our hosts were friendly and helpful beyond description and provided us with everything we needed including fresh towels and stacks of valueable info on the surroundings. When we arrived we found the place very clean and everything was arranged with love. The outside deck was an amazing place for breakfast or dinner making it unneccessary to eat out anywhere even though there are a couple of nice places near by.
The area is quiet and safe and there is a subway station just down the street so it is easy to access Boston downtown.,,,,,

Nothing was misrepresented and the pictures very accurately depicted the apartment.  The balcony was a wonderful bonus.  The communication with both Maria and Martine was excellent.  We ended up spending more time in the Jamaica Plain than we had originally intended since it is a unique community with many park areas.  Don't miss the Arboretum, there are more than 15,000 different trees including a bonsai exibit and it is free!  We also exclusively used the subway and the buses which were very close and well documented and with a weekly pass costing $18 the value cannot be beat."
We would definitely consider staying here again.,,,,,

210097,2469778,2012-10-01,1177057,Michelle,"A great place to stay! We were a party of two and stayed at Treetop Haven for 4 nights at the end of September.  The apartment is absolutely adorable.  It's comfortable, bright, clean and quiet.  There is a private entrance and private bathroom.   The bed is very comfortable.  The kitchen is fully equipped with small versions of all the basic appliances (range/oven, microwave, kettle, fridge) which allowed us to make meals in the apartment; we even baked store-bought cookies one night.  The private (and relatively large!) patio with outdoor seating is a huge plus.  It makes the apartment feel a little bit bigger, gives you access to the outdoors and is very pleasant to spend time on.  Cable TV and a fast wifi connection are available in the apartment.  We met Maria on the first day and then had complete privacy for the rest of our stay.   When we needed more toilet paper, it appeared immediately.  The location is superb in a charming and vibrant neighborhood of JP, close to great restaurants, bars and cafes.  The neighborhood is very safe; we didn't have any concerns even at night.  We had a rental car and parking was no problem.  Public transport (bus or subway) is a couple of blocks away if you need it.  It's not far to the center of Boston.   I will definitely stay here again when I return to Boston. It's a gem of a place.  I highly recommend it.  Take note that this is an upper apartment so there are stairs to climb to get to the entrance.  In our case, it was perfect as it added to the privacy.  Thanks Maria!"

Though we weren't able to meet Maria personally, she was an excellent host.  Our little apartment was cozy and truly felt like a home away from home.  We took the train the entirety of our trip, and the proximity to the stop was so convenient. Jamaica Plain is a fantastic little neighborhood, with so much character.  Make sure to take advantage of all that the locale has to offer!"
210097,2643842,2012-10-17,413177,Jon,"Treetop Haven was perfect for our stay in Boston. It's about 15 minute trip from downtown / touristy / historical area to the house via subway, but it was perfect and a great price."
The neighborhood is super cool and authentic feeling,with a nice little market where the locals go in the morning to get coffee. And there are a few restaurants up the street. It's not where you'd go to party from another area in the city,but totally an awesome jumping off point for a Boston adventure.,,,
Maria was great. Met us when we arrived,gave us lots of info,and then we were off to adventure. If we needed anything,here and her roomates were there to help. But otherwise,we had the entire studio apartment at the top of the house to ourselves.,

The location is super convenient: a few minutes from the subway and bus, a local organic food shop two minutes down the road, and a laundry and Wholefoods about a ten-minute walk away. This part of Jamaica Plain has a really warm neighbourhood feel, as well as some very nice restaurants - all within easy walking distance. It is also very easy to get into town."
Maria Elena was a great host - we didn't see very much of her,but check-in was a breeze and she was always very responsive whenever we had any questions.,,,,
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!\"",,,,,
210097,4885365,2013-05-31,4899215,Hilary,"Small yet well provided with all the necessities plus all sorts of thoughtful extras. Our hosts were friendly and helpful despite their busy schedules. Unsettled weather prevented us using the deck very much, which was a pity as it would have been a great extension to the studio. Altogether a very good stay."
210097,4959733,2013-06-04,1204651,Lea,"A warm welcome, a comfortable (and air-conditioned!) apartment... it was like home away from home. I loved it!"
210097,5768248,2013-07-15,7246340,Verity,"I had a great time staying here. Maria is lovely. The apartment is private, quiet, clean and comfortable. There is everything you need except a washing machine but there is a Laundrette just up on Centre Street (2 mins away)."
"Thanks again Maria.\"",,,,,
210097,6953521,2013-09-01,5008932,Zabur,"My stay in Maria's place was awesome. From the start till the day I left, she is very helpful and made me feel at home. She welcomed me with great smile and I felt really good. The apartment is a home away from home. Compact room with all the necessities you can ask for is there. She makes sure the room is clean and presentable before she hands it to you. The private entrance to your room is good. Does not make you feel awkward. Lots of privacy. Although didn't get to see Maria much, she was always reachable via e-mail. I would definitely recommend this place. Will definitely stay here if I come back to Boston again."
210097,7298271,2013-09-15,1428575,Marian,"We are a retired couple who go to Boston every year to visit our kids and grandkids. Once we found Treetop Haven and met Maria Elena and her family, we knew that we had found our own special Boston place. It's our perfect little home-from-home nest and we'll be back in it every year until we are too old to make the trip."
210097,8927648,2013-11-26,7027033,Joan,"A sweet little place and a very nice host.  Clean.  Location is great, just a couple of blocks from the T."
210097,9973685,2014-01-22,3642349,Cathy,"Maria Elena went out of her way to accommodate us when snowstorm Janus hit and we weren't sure we could fly out as scheduled...She connects with her guests on a very personal level.  We love staying in the private apartment in her home.  It's in a terrific location.  Judging by how often it is rented, we can see many other people feel the same.  Thank you, Maria Elena. ¡Hasta la próxima!"
210097,10544674,2014-02-24,98146,Jan,this is an excellent option for a Boston stay.  easily accessed from airport and/or downtown on orange line.  the accommodation was more than adequate.  would be even nicer in spring/summer when you can use the deck etc for relaxation.  only suggestion is that there needs to be somewhere to hang some clothes e.g. a business man or woman to be able to hang suits/work clothes etc.
210097,11791075,2014-04-15,11182811,Nikiforos,"I had an amazing stay at Treetop Haven! Location, house amenities, everything was perfect! Thank you Maria Elena for your hospitality!"
210097,12390904,2014-05-01,10847834,Christine,"Die kleine liebevoll eingerichtete Wohnung  (für 2 Personen völlig ausreichend), mit eigenem Bad und Küchenzeile war für uns der ideale Ausgangspunkt um Boston zu erkunden. Die Wohnung im Dachgeschoß ist über das seperate Treppenhaus erreichbar. Die wenigen Minuten zur U Bahn, der gegenüber liegende Bioladen mit stets frischem und vielfältigen Kaffeeausschank und sehr leckerem Baguette, die kleinen Lebensmittelgeschäfte und Restaurants,  die zu Fuß leicht erreichbar sind, machen Jamaica Plain mit seinen typischen Holzhäusern zu einem attraktiven freundlichen Viertel. Abends mussten wir teilweise zweimal um den Block fahren, um unser Auto parken zu können, für die Stadt braucht man kein Auto."
210097,12896844,2014-05-13,14302851,Jess,"This was such a wonderful spot. Maria has the perfect attributes of a host: welcoming, warm, informative and relaxed. The apartment is just perfect, it is indeed, a treetop haven. Fully equipped, birds singing in the morning, cosiest of beds and all the information you need at your fingertips in a handy folder compiled by Maria. I fell in immediately in love with the neighbourly neighbourhood of Jamaican Plains; Maria is right- it is a little village itself. Everything you need and more: lush food, smiley people, superb ice cream (I opted for FOMU rather than JP Licks for their coconut and almond based creams), stunning houses, yoga and a serene pond surrounded by greenery."
Thank you,"Maria. I will be straight back here when I return to Boston. x x x\"",,,,
210097,13212405,2014-05-22,6457311,Heath,Thanks so much Maria! This worked out perfectly--so convenient and just as described.
210097,13874213,2014-06-07,1131201,Christian,We had a great time in Maria Elena's treetop heaven!
She is a perfect host,very open minded and it was great meeting her and her family.,,,,
The little appartment offered anything we needed,was super clean,cosy and very close to the next subway stop (max. 4min away).,,,
In the other direction,about 8min walking distance there is a Whole Foods market,which was perfect for us. Close by are some really nice restaurants as well,so you should find anything you need within 10min walking time.,,
The porch is a great extra when its nice outside. It adds extra space and is perfect for a open air breakfast in the moring or a glas of wine in the evening.,,,,,
Parking in the area wasn't a problem at all,as long as you are aware about the street cleaning days. Maria Elena highlighted this to us straight after our arrival,so there shouldn't be any issues.,,,
We would definitely come back whenever we come close again to the Boston area and recommend Maria Elena as a host to anybody looking for a well located,clean and cosy home away from home in Boston!,,,,
Thanks for having us Maria Elena!,,,,,
"PS: Our personal food favorit was a little venezuelan restaurant in South End called Orinoco (477 Shawmut Ave).\"",,,,,
210097,14551299,2014-06-22,98146,Jan,My husband stayed here in February in the snow and said it was great.  This time I came without him and it was wonderful.  perfect.   It's up private up there with the birds.  I really loved the balcony with its quietness and privacy
210097,14700282,2014-06-24,12498840,Camille,"We only stayed 2 nights but we really enjoyed our stay , Maria Elena  was very nice and very friendly, Maria organized everything for the stay ( a lovely small book with activities restaurants maps etc... ). the room is great and clean , the bed very confortable  and the patio perfect for the breakfast and enjoy a lovely view, Boston is a great city lots of energy and very clean, the location is great too only few minutes to the train station and get to downtown in 10 min. Thank you Maria Elena and Martine for your hospitality."
210097,15391473,2014-07-08,13473074,Kristina,"\"We had a great stay at the Treetop Haven!  Maria and her family were all very welcoming and helpful.  The apartment felt very separate from the rest of the house, and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  It was really beneficial to have our own kitchen during our stay, and we were easily able to cook.  The location is excellent - easy walk to the \"\"T\"\" to get downtown"
210097,15962522,2014-07-19,9425152,Jane,I can't say enough good things about Jamaica plain and Maria Elena's treetop haven. The apartment is private and has everything you need to feel independent and enjoy your Boston visit. I highly recommend staying here and experiencing JP during your trip to Boston.
210097,17672957,2014-08-16,1695789,Wendy,"Maria made us feel welcome from the start and throughout our stay.  She was gracious and warm and the perfect combination of available and helpful and respectful of our privacy and independence.  Communication was clear and easy.  The Haven is exactly as described.  Bedroom, living area, kitchen, bath, deck - all there.  The house and apartment are charming.  The neighborhood is fun to walk around in and feels quite safe.  As described, the Haven is close to the T and to neighborhood stores and restaurants.  We loved our stay and can't imagine a more perfect setting."
210097,18441046,2014-08-26,1177057,Michelle,"This was my second stay at Treetop Haven with Maria Elena.  The studio is charmingly adorable and completely private.  The balcony is a lovely perk.  Parking is easy and free. The location can't be beat; it's steps from the subway and from the buzzing local neighborhood shops and restaurants.   Maria Elena is a fantastic host. She responds quickly to email and makes your stay comfortable without disturbing privacy.  We didn't see Maria Elena during this visit (she lives downstairs) but she was readily available if we needed anything.  5 stars, highly recommended.  Treetop Haven is my preferred accommodation in Boston. I'll be back."
210097,22576281,2014-11-10,1218447,Monica,"Maria was an excellent Host! She was available when needed, but you are very private in her Treetop Haven, and you can spend most of your stay without even noticing that there are other people in the home. The apartment was clean and tidy when I arrived, and the weather was nice for the first 2 weeks, so I could take advantage of the lovely rooftop area, which was like getting an additional room. The location is absolutely perfect for exploring Boston without a car, as the T is just two short blocks away. A few blocks in the other direction is Jamaica Pond, a gorgeous park with a walking path around Jamaica Pond. So beautiful for a walk! And the neighborhood is full of restaurants and convenient to both Whole Foods and a lower-priced grocery store. The only drawback is the size of the apartment. I stayed for several weeks, so I really missed having a full sized fridge and a real closet. But for the price and the location in a very expensive town, I'd totally recommend Treetop Haven for shorter stays."
210097,23202145,2014-11-25,1695789,Wendy,"Our hosts were extremely welcoming and gracious, being available for any questions or feedback about our accommodations, yet also gave us plenty of space and showed great respect for personal boundaries.  The accommodations were just as presented online, were just excellent, and truly felt like home.  The neighborhood is delightful with necessary amenities conveniently located nearby."
210097,25993722,2015-02-01,23699724,Jasmyn,"My roommate and I had a great time staying here. We both are college students and needed to find somewhere to live while doing a one month internship. Maria was very accommodating to our situation. Maria and the rest of her family were always in contact if we needed any help with anything. Everything was clean and orderly when we arrived and Maria even put a cot in the room so my roommate and I could have separate beds. The house is only a short walk to the T station, which made our daily commute very easy. The neighborhood is mostly made up of young professionals and some young families. In close walking distance is Centre Street, where you can find a CVS, Whole Foods, and Mom and Pop Shops. Overall, we had a great experience and I would recommend that you stay here if you're stopping by Boston."
210097,27249129,2015-03-01,14725936,Inês,"I stayed here for one month (feb 2015). This place is a small and cozy studio with everything you may need while staying in Boston. A full equipped kitchen, a private bathroom and a sleeping area with a table for eat/studio. It has a big deck that I was not able to use due to heavy snow during those month. I used to call this the Hobbit apartment because it is pretty and cosy has the hobbit house. Convenient located near the T and the Bus, you will be at Boston center in 10-20 minutes. The area has everything you may need: coffe shop, supermarket, restaurants, laundry...."
Maria Elena and his family were very friendly but have me all the privacy I needed.,,,,,
I would absolutely recommend this place to everyone going to Boston and I will definitely stay here if I return again to the city. Is inexpensive,"a good value for your money. \"",,,,
210097,29544517,2015-04-09,4924600,Johanna,Maria Elena is a great host that was always there to answer questions when we had them and has a very friendly nature to her. The place is just as it is described. It is a cozy studio on the third floor in a GREAT location of town. The studio was clean and had everything we needed. It has a full set of kitchen supplies. Maria Elena made sure to provide us with an extra heater since this winter was terrible in Boston. The unit is five minutes from the orange line and has lots of little restaurants in walking distance. This place is really great and I would recommend it to all my friends!
210097,30121070,2015-04-18,24520502,Axel,I've had a very enjoyable stay. Maria Elena and her family cared for all things well. A folder with a lot of valuable information about Jamaica Plain was very helpful for getting to know the JP area. A nearby Stop + Shop helped holding the costs low.
Getting around from there with the T and buses was easy,once you've known the best routes and connections. To the T it's a 2 minute walk downhill,to the bus 3 minutes uphill.,,,
The room was as described. To have several windows is great for fresh air when needed. The neighbourhood is quite,"you can hear the birds more often than anything else.\"",,,,
210097,30489585,2015-04-23,3720050,George Michael,"This was my third stay at Treetop Haven. As always, it was a joy. Maria Elena keeps the apartment clean and cozy, with all of the amenities required for a comfortable stay. Jamaica Plain is a great neighborhood to explore and has wonderful dining and shopping options. Plus, it's super easy to get to the downtown Boston sites on the orange line. Treetop Haven is my first choice when I visit Boston."
210097,33424505,2015-05-28,1695789,Wendy,"The accommodations are exactly as described and pictured and are very comfortable and homey. It's a great place.  The hosts are delightful, responsive, and give personal space and privacy.  The neighborhood and environs are great."
210097,33792755,2015-06-01,12580867,Nienke,"Comfortable and cosy appartement on the top floor of the house. Jamaica Plains is a pretty neighbourhood and very well located to downtown Boston through the subway system, which is just a few blocks away. Maria is very welcoming host and will provide you with necessary tips and guidelines. Would definitely recommend to stay here."

210097,37491707,2015-07-07,2985343,Rachel,"Maria Elena and her daughter were fantastic hosts! The place was perfect for what I needed; comfortable, small, and charming. The close proximity to the T and the wonderful neighborhood were just amazing bonuses. I look forward for another opportunity to visit Boston and stay at their place!"
210097,38979746,2015-07-20,27489119,Reiner,"I enjoyed my stay at Treetop Haven and Maria Elena was very helpful with valuable recommendations on shopping, public transportation and driving routes. It's a wonderful retreat after a busy conference or sightseeing day."

210097,40089233,2015-07-28,27825168,Gabrielle,We had a really good stay here! We only met Maria briefly but she was awesome! She made sure it was easy for us to check in and out even though we arrived really late. The location was also really close to public transport too which was really convenient.
210097,42381347,2015-08-13,1695789,Wendy,"We have stayed at the Haven several times and it always is excellent.  The accommodations are homey in the best sense of the word, immaculate, and well maintained.  The hosts are wonderful people and excellent and responsive stewards of their facility.  We love Boston, Jamaica Plain, and the Haven plays a central role in our wonderful trips to the area."
210097,44539560,2015-08-27,34978992,Meike,"Treetop Haven was the perfect little place to stay at during my research visit in Boston. The apt had all I needed (even including guides and maps for Boston), plus a splendid patio with a nice view of trees and gardens. It is situated in a beautiful and quiet neighbourhood, and yet it is very easy to go downtown by T. Maria was a very kind and considerate host, and even thought of a little something to eat and drink on my arrival and milk for the morning coffee. I can absolutely recommend to stay at Treetop Haven."
210097,48678168,2015-09-28,3901302,Kberg526,"Wonderful host and accommodations. Exactly as pictured, host was friendly and helpful but gave us our space. Loved the deck!"

210097,51270653,2015-10-19,38148922,Elynn,"Treetop Haven is a cozy, comfortable, private studio in a historic home. There is everything you might need, clean towels, coffee and a fully equipped kitchen. The neighborhood is convenient to the T and has some nice restaurants. Maria Elena is a friendly and kind host. I will certainly see if Treetop Haven is available to stay in the next time I am in Boston!"
210097,52681278,2015-11-01,21703161,Ian,"Lovely safe neighbourhood, listing was as described, if slightly smaller than expected. It was clean, quiet and equipped with everything we needed. Maria Elena was an excellent host, and took the time to show us a few maps of the area and suggest some restaurants.  Communicating with her was very easy once in the apartment, leaving notes checking that everything was ok via a whiteboard. Maria Elena was also very accommodating in allowing us to leave our bags for the day on check out day, since we didn't fly until the evening. Overall good value and very easy to get into the city on the subway. Wifi connection was ok but not great (struggled to load video)."
210097,53806874,2015-11-13,1428575,Marian,The neighbourhood is great. My favourite bit of Boston.
210097,55778658,2015-12-06,17061784,Martina,"Maria Elena and Martine were great hosts. They made sure everything was fine and communication was easy, also using the whiteboard since I was away often. The apartment is a very nice private space with a great view from the deck. Perfect for sunny mornings, and against the December cold in the apartment, the heaters provided were very efficient. It's close to the T and still out of the busy city which I enjoyed a lot. It allowed me to get some sleep as well as work done during a busy week of conference. Maria Elena was also kind enough to let me leave my luggage in the apartment on my last day and come back in the evening only, shortly before my flight. Would recommend!"
210097,60195549,2016-01-20,42291193,Jiho,Stay at Elena's house was really comfortable and good. She was easy to contact and very kind. I and my friend could stay comfortably. The room was a bit small but enough for two people and cozy. I liked it. The only thing that I was struggling with was heat. The heater was small and it took some time to heat the room up. But everyhting else overall was good.
210097,62685079,2016-02-16,25167370,Timothy,"We very much enjoyed our trip to Jamaica Plains! Both of our first times to Boston, and we explored via the subway. The location is great for visiting without a car, the subway goes right from the Air Port to the local stop (about a 5 min walk). Plus, the location is within easy walking distance to Downtown Jamaica Plains where there are a lot of great places to eat. Great accommodations, and friendly host!"
210097,66179340,2016-03-20,21514096,Krisztian,"Everything was fast, efficient and easy. Maria was really kind, explained everything during the first 10 mins we met, then we could have our own privacy for our whole vacation time. Apartment was clean and well equipped."
210097,67242384,2016-03-27,19332461,Jenny Xin,"Maria was very very nice and explained everything that we needed to know on the very first day. The room is in a pretty good condition with everything you need (from hair dryer, to utensils to cooking oil). More importantly, it was very clean! The location was very convenient, 5min walk to either subway or bus. We enjoyed our stay very much! Just the internet was kind of slow."

210097,68283493,2016-04-04,5382456,Louisa,"Wonderful in every way! Warm welcome while still totally private, cozy flat with everything you could need, and a fun safe neighbourhood with the T and shops in easy walking distance while still on a residential street. Getting there from the airport was a snap on the T (and only cost $2.65)."
Maria Elena describes it perfectly - it's like staying with family or friends rather than in a hotel. Lots of personal touches (books,nick-nacks in the bathroom,CDs),maps and recommendations for eating and sightseeing,and everything works great - shower,wifi
210097,68733822,2016-04-06,59749953,Daniel,"Maria Elena was very welcoming and helpful. The apartment was pleasant and cozy, plenty of space for one person (I was by myself) and satisfactory for two, I would guess."
The City Feed deli is only a few yards away,and there are plenty good restaurants in the neighbourhood as well as nearby parks and the arboretum.,,,,
I wasn't able to enjoy things as much as had hoped,because of the weather. It was snowing in early April. But even the best airbnb host cannot arrange suitable weather for guests.,,,,
Had I needed it,I would have been able to leave my packed cases past the official departure time.,,,,
My first airbnb experience,"and one that makes me happy to continue with airbnb should I need it.\"",,,,
210097,70756381,2016-04-20,3720050,George Michael,"This is my fourth stay at Treetop Haven. Maria Elena is an excellent host. The apartment is clean and cozy with attention to details that make it extremely comfortable. The location is fantastic - close to the Orange line and just minutes from downtown, but nestled in the heart of the charming neighborhood of Jamaica Plain. I love Treetop Haven and I will be back!"
210097,71127491,2016-04-23,54427864,Mark,"This was a perfect place to stay.  It was our first time visiting Boston, and Treetop Haven allowed us the perfect home base.  It is a 5 minute walk to the Orange line which takes you directly into the heart of the city (10 minute train ride).  The apartment is perfect for dropping stuff off, going to explore, and coming back to unwind - it even has a really nice third floor deck."
Maria is extremely nice,accommodating,and took the time to help us understand our surroundings as well as provide suggestions on what to visit/where to go.,,,
"We would most certainly come back if were visiting Boston again.  This place was a great find!\"",,,,,
210097,73223914,2016-05-07,13453331,Farhana,I connected with Maria Elena on behalf of my parents who were in town for my graduation. She welcomed them into the apartment with open arms and was very accommodating.
210097,74034763,2016-05-12,24979944,Marshall,"Maria was an excellent host! I stayed here in lieu of a very high-priced hotel room for a conference in Boston. The apartment is VERY conveniently located, easy walk to Stony Brook orange line train stop, quick trip to downtown. Nice food options nearby. The Arnold Arboretum is a must-see, and very close!"
210097,74478986,2016-05-15,3153531,David,The apartment is really characterful and a great place for our 2 nights in Boston. The hosts are extremely kind and welcoming. We enjoyed having tea out on the balcony with views of the trees and the other characterful triple deck houses of Jamaica Plain.
The apartment has a real cozy homely feel and was a lovely retreat after our busy days out and about exploring the local neighbourhood and Boston. Superbly convenient location for the T-line for getting quickly into downtown Boston.,,,,,
"The apartment is great value for money. Would recommend to anyone wanting a base to explore the city.\"",,,,,
210097,75088317,2016-05-18,68082690,Hannah,Very welcoming and accomdating. Only saw twice during stay so we had plenty of privacy. Great location for the price!
210097,75710837,2016-05-22,53310095,Katie,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Treetop Haven! When we arrived Maria and her family were so nice and inviting. It was a very easy process to check-in, she gave us the keys and showed us around. From there we were left with our privacy. The surrounding neighborhood was beautiful, lots of families and people walking their dogs. We saw two young boys playing catch on one of the side streets, it just seemed like a friendly and safe neighborhood. The house was close to a nice cafe and the T-station. Very convenient to get to downtown Boston. We also took an Uber a few times and the drivers were always at the house within minutes. The apartment itself was very clean and welcoming. We enjoyed having breakfast on the little deck that was connected to the apartment. The value of the apartment is unbeatable - we were able to take the extra money we saved on lodging and put it towards fun activities in the city! My concern before we showed up was that we would be too far removed from the city and it would be an inconvenience to stay that far out, but that was absolutely not the case. You are much closer than it seems and with such close proximity to public transit, it is very easy to get into the heart of Boston in 20-30 mins. We 100% recommend to anyone looking to visit the city and we hope to be back sometime in the future!"
210097,76295543,2016-05-26,7169988,Avril,We stayed with Maria for 3 nights in May 2016. She was a superb host. She could not do enough for us. The location of her house is fantastic... Approx 4 minute walk to the closest subway.
Thank you Maria for being an excellent host. We will be back.,,,,,

My husband and I found the location to be very  convenient to get around. The train station was just a few minutes walk. The neighborhood is very quiet and safe. I would highly recommend this location to anyone who wants to experience the craziness of Boston during the day and then go home and get a peaceful quiet sleep. I honestly could not have asked for a better experience!
210097,82709188,2016-06-29,39185850,Kevin,"\"I really enjoyed staying w/ Maria Elena. She welcomed me and showed me around the apartment and gave me recommendations on places to visit while I was in Boston. We didn't bump into each other during the rest of my stay, but we \"\"chatted\"\" by leaving notes and she checked in to see if I had any concerns or questions. The apartment is a studio apartment style but was private and cozy. Having a refrigerator and dishes was convenient for me. My only advice for future guests is to be aware the apartment is on the third floor of their house and that wi-fi connectivity can be spotty in older houses such as hers. (Maria mentions this in her listing and is working on improving their wi-fi.) I really enjoyed the neighborhood (Jamaica Plain); their house and the neighborhood has a lot of character! I enjoyed being able to walk to restaurants"
210097,84490881,2016-07-07,34076509,Emily,"Maria was very welcoming and informative and the apartment was clean and located in a gorgeous,  safe neighborhood.  Jamacia Plain is a place to see in itself!  Being our first visit to Boston -  (coming from Canada) - we spent much time seeing major sights in central Boston which were easily accessible by the subway (less than 5 mins walk). When we return we will defintely stay at the Treetop Haven again and spend more time exploring Jamacia Plains. Reflecting on the trip, upon arriving,  explore the local area more (Wonder Spice is an awesome Thai/Cambodian restaurant, Papercuts if your a book enthusiast) before venturing further into Boston.  Samuel Adams tour is very close (within 10 min walk) and worth the visit ($2 suggested charity donation), including LOTS of beer and a free trolly to Doyles (one of the oldest pubs which happens to be in Jamacia Plain). Overall, very much enjoyed Treetop Haven. All amenities included (towels, umbrella, maps, dishes, clean fridge, microwave, stove, oven, etc), clean, easily accessible to subway and out of the busy hustle of downtown boston.  Would recommend 100%"
210097,86487010,2016-07-16,46288530,Megan,Maria Elana was very welcoming! Everything was as described and the location is awesome! I emphatically reccommend Maria's place! Hope to come back!
210097,87988179,2016-07-22,70130458,Florian,"The neighbourhood was fantastic. We really enjoyed JP. Maria Elena was present on time at our arrival to welcome us. The room was amazingly well equipped, cozy and self-contained. It very quickly made us feel home. Our hosts have been both very discreet and helpful when needed, which is something we greatly appreciated."
210097,88843080,2016-07-25,29978607,Christoffer,"Maria and his family were great hosts. The location of the apartment is very good and all in all as described. However, we think that it could have been a little bit cleaner. We basically only stayed there for sleeping. Bearing this in mind we can recommend this apartment."

210097,89634954,2016-07-29,29192592,Jon,"Maria was a wonderful host! Gave us a brief tour of the room upon our arrival as well as made recommendations on how to get around and things to see in the surrounding area. She even went above and beyond to turn the A/C on for us each night so our room was nice and cool every night when we arrived! Would HIGHLY recommend staying with her, and would definitely stay again! Thank you Maria!!"
210097,91532942,2016-08-05,27900722,Jeremy,"Our stay at Treetop was really good, the studio is cozy and clean and is a great retreat each day when returning from Boston. Jamaica Plain is a wonderful and friendly neighbourhood. We enjoyed a meal at Wonder Spice which was very good but with portion sizes we are not too familiar with!! Great value though, we also had brunch at Robinwood Cafe which was really yummy. Thanks so much Maria Elena for sharing your home with us."
"\"",,,,,
210097,95172474,2016-08-18,62498719,Sandra,My godmother and I stayed at Maria Elenas place for 10 days. The flat was cozy and made you feel like home. I loved the area and the subway was nearby. Our hosts were really kind and caring. I would return anytime! Thank you again for your hospitality.
210097,96856708,2016-08-24,26674162,Florian,Maria Elena is a very caring and helpful host. She provided us with all informations we needed about the area and giving us insight tips of the hotspots in the wonderful neighborhood in Jamaica Plains (The Lake and the burgers at canary square restaurant for example). The apartment in her charming house is cozy and well equipped in a good location to explore Boston.  We would like to thank you again:)
210097,98772791,2016-09-01,25966281,Isaac,"Amazing stay in a fantastic location! Everything was great, comfortable, and exactly as described. I'd come back here again!"
5620496,38136611,2015-07-13,16549127,Kathy,We had a great visit and were able to enjoy time with our family. Carrie made sure we were settled and comfortable.
5620496,38831652,2015-07-19,13088898,Polly,Carrie was very welcoming and got in touch well in advance of our arrival and sent messages to check we were getting on OK.  Carrie's apartment was a great place to stay and we really enjoyed it.  Carrie even very kindly offered to send back some missed packing.  Thank you for a lovely stay.
5620496,40262060,2015-07-29,1985016,Katherine,"My friend and I had a wonderful stay at Carrie's apartment. She went out of her way to make things easy for us, especially since we were coming to Boston from two different places. Her apartment was spotless, cool (important for mid-summer in August!) and comfortable, especially the beds made up with crisp cotton sheets. Each of us left saying we would stay there again."
5620496,40919332,2015-08-03,34868191,Kevin,"We are very happy with our stay at Carrie's place. Everything was as described and we felt comfortable and secure. The location was great with a short walk to the grocery store, CVS, and the DD."
5620496,41777397,2015-08-09,36345263,Phil,We had such a great time at Carries hidden gem.  Carrie was there waiting for us when we arrived and showed us her apartment
Everything was spotless and very comfortable. Location was perfect for our stay and enjoyed our morning coffee on rooftop balcony. She kindly left coffe for us and provided info on area and phone numbers for taxis etc,,,,,
We will be back to Carries on place in the future,,,,,
"Thanks again Carrie\"",,,,,
5620496,43244423,2015-08-18,35516444,David,Beautiful apartment in a beautiful neighborhood.  Close to transportation.  Be wary of the parking on the street (residents only 8AM to 8Pm M-F); the parking garage near the Constitution might be a good alternative.
5620496,46533010,2015-09-11,20527736,Zach,Everything was great at Carrie's apartment! We were in a great location and I was able to get a small taste of living in Boston!
5620496,51716702,2015-10-24,18773147,Kimberly,"The apartment was very beautiful, comfortable, and clean. My friends and I were visiting Boston for a conference, so we were happy to find that the apartment was located in a very quiet and charming neighborhood. It was also nicely located just a short walk away from the orange line, a Whole Foods, CVS and several small restaurants."
Carrie was also very accommodating and always available by text. We never met her in person,but she made checking in and out of the apartment very easy.,,,,
We would highly recommend Carrie and would love to stay with her again.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
5620496,74419783,2016-05-15,35776662,Chris,"Carrie's place was great!  Located in a quiet neighborhood on Bunker Hill, the apartment had everything we needed for a comfortable and convenient stay.  Throughout the stay Carrie was proactive and clear in her communications and even provided us with information about the area to make our stay easier."
The apartment is in a great location and was a good hub for us on our trip.  We were easily able to walk to the North End and took Uber's if we needed to go a bit further.,,,,,
"I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a nice and clean place to stay while visiting Boston.\"",,,,,
5620496,89215268,2016-07-27,54035403,Alicia,"Carrie was an excellent host and her place was beautiful. Carrie was easy to reach and flexible when our plans changed slightly. Her home is conveniently located so we were able to walk to many places or catch a quick Uber. I would stay here again and would highly recommend it to anyone traveling to Boston. Thanks, Carrie!"
1141888,4693513,2013-05-20,5025589,Michael,"Everything was great!!!!  Our host was vey flexible with check-in and check-out..... the apartment is in a great location in Boston, we were able to walk to everything..... we highly recommend staying here if you are looking for a clean, nice, great location, and private place while visiting Boston....."
1141888,4776664,2013-05-25,6209438,Kalee,"I was in Boston for a conference, and basically needed a safe place to sleep, shower, and store my stuff.  The 'Charming Private Bedroom with Patio' was perfect.  The bed was so comfortable that I slept soundly throughout the nights.  The water stayed hot no matter how long my showers lasted.  And I had a key to the door, so I was not having to time my activities to the hosts schedule."
There is a Whole Foods just a block from the house,so the fridge and microwave came in handy - I was able to buy supplies at Whole Foods and take healthy lunches to the conference each day,and was not stuck eating the usual fast foods at the conference center.,,,
The location of the house was perfect - close enough to walk to most places I wanted to go,and just steps from one of my conference's shuttle bus stops.  I felt very safe.,,,,
The laundry room for the house was located through the bedroom,so the hosts did have to come through the space a couple of times while I was staying there - but they usually did so when I was out and about.  They were polite with directions and instructions,and I was told I could use the kitchen upstairs,although I did not have a need to do so.,,
This was my first time to use Airbnb,"so I was not quite sure what to expect - I was very pleased with my stay!\"",,,,
1141888,4894688,2013-05-31,6503948,Zach,"I stayed with Katie when I was in town for a job interview. This was my first experience with airbnb and I hope my future trips go just as smoothly as this. The place was immaculately clean, and Katie was very helpful in answering my questions and concerns. She responded quickly and was always professional and courteous."
As I said before,the room and the bathroom were both very clean and the bed,sheets,and towels were comfortable and nice. I did not make much use of the fenced in patio,as I was only in town for a day. Nevertheless,it seems like a good place for relaxing.
Overall,this was exactly perfect for my needs. It was centrally located,in a good area,and walking distance to Whole Foods,Starbucks,a wealth of eateries
In my opinion,"this was an A+ experience. Being able to come and go as you please and having a nice place to stay and relax was ideal. I would most definitely stay here again.\"",,,,
1141888,4911935,2013-06-01,6539661,Michelle,Perfect spot for conference in Copley! Convenient to walking to public transportation and lots around the location to see and eat! Truly everything I needed! Host was very gracious and accommodating!
1141888,5002945,2013-06-06,953781,Aaron,"This place was great for staying - the room is located on its own floor of the brownstone, with its own entrance. The apartment is very clean and well kept/like a hotel room."
Katie and her brother were also very personable and quick to help out. It was also very centrally located and easy to get around.,,,,,
"Will stay there again if I'm in town.\"",,,,,
1141888,5010283,2013-06-07,2577159,Alicia,"We stayed with Katie when we were in Boston for a Red Sox game.  My only regret is that we didn't stay longer than the one night.  The space was very clean and comfortable with amenities for all your needs and a fantastic king sized bed for a great night's sleep.  The neighborhood was beautiful, central and easily accessible by the subway.  Communication throughout the booking process and checking in was swift and helpful.  I would recommend staying here for any type of Boston adventure.  We certainly hope to make use of it again.  Thanks, Katie!"
1141888,5059706,2013-06-10,6337352,Kelly,"I had a great stay at Katie's apt. Its in a really nice location, a 2 minute walk to the green line T at symphony. The room is a totally separate basement apt with a private bathroom down the hall. Everything was clean and set up great for guests. She had Boston maps and books all ready for checking out the city. The house is close about a 15 min walk to the back bay, and easy place to catch the T from as well. Would recommend staying there to anyone!"
1141888,5184938,2013-06-17,6365729,Harald,"Perfect location for access to the Metro, Symphony Hall and New England Conservatory, which we enjoyed during our visit to the Boston Early Music Festival.  Convenient private entrance on ground level.  Host Katie was extremely friendly and ready to help when needed.  Comfortable bed, adequate bathroom down the hall, and good restaurants nearby."
1141888,5602680,2013-07-08,6234521,Elizabeth,We enjoyed our stay with Katie and her brothers. They were welcoming and provided useful advice about Boston. The room and facilities were comfortable. The apartment was well located and many interesting features in the city were within walking distance.
1141888,5964444,2013-07-24,6320725,Marcia,Katie and Brian made us feel very welcome during our stay. We loved our room/bathroom and would highly recommend staying here during a visit to Boston!
1141888,6005802,2013-07-26,6883183,Patricia,"Very nice room and location, directly behind Symphony Hall.  The host was very welcoming and helpful.  The room is downstairs with its own bath and private entrance.  There is a little patio. The ambiance is great and it is near cafes, restaurants,  and a small market .  It is a short block and a half to the green line and  two more short blocks to the orange line.  We walked to Fenway in less than 15 min and to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in less than 10."
I would go back any time.  Thanks,"Katie!\"",,,,
1141888,6060777,2013-07-28,7612394,Martin,We stayed with Katie and her brothers two nights and we had a very nice time. Very nice location in central Boston and the king bed is perfect for the whole family
1141888,6207313,2013-08-03,1425536,Barry/Ellen,Very comfortable accommodation.  Have private floor with bathroom and bedroom.  Well located  Were only there one night so we had minimal contact with Katie.  No real on street parking for more than a few hours.  Parked in nearby lot for $30 for 24 hours.  Would definitely stay here again.
1141888,6640064,2013-08-19,1418560,Emily,"Hey, this place was really great. My husband and I wanted to have more of a home stay experience as we introduced our two children to some favorite memories in Boston/Cambridge. It was perfect. There was a lot of privacy because basically the whole downstairs is yours (although there is access to the full kitchen and TV lounge upstairs). The best part was being able to put the kiddos to sleep and sit right outside the window to have a relaxing beer with the hubby on the patio. Whole Foods is right near by, easy access to the T, and the Christian Science Church across the street has an enormous, car-free courtyard with fountains and room to run. I kinda wish I had brought roller skates. The DVD player wasn't reliable but I'm sure it'll get fixed. Many thanks to Daniel and Katie for an awesome stay. Hope to return!"

1141888,52445890,2015-10-29,46502973,Paul,I was welcomed into the home and showed my space. It was very spacious and private. Love the private entrance and the ability to come and go without worrying about disturbing the owners. The only problem and disappointment was not TV.
1141888,53151401,2015-11-05,28647501,Lyda,"De ontavngst was prima door Katie en de wijk is ok. Ik heb de  verkeerde keuze gemaakt, want de studio bleek een slaapkamer in een studentenhuis te zijn. Dus delen van geluid, keuken, gebrkkige hygiene,etc. Het uitzicht op een achterplaats is nit geweldig. Het bed was prima en dat is dan plek om te eten, te lezen en alles want andere voorzieningen zijn er niet in de kamer. niet geschikt dus en veel te duur in relatie tot de kwaliteit"

1141888,71147464,2016-04-24,61655312,Ashley,I have nothing but positive feedback for both Katie and the accommodations. This was my first Air BNB and Boston experience. The suite is as pictured but even cozier in person. It was very nice to come back to a private floor in the evenings that felt more like a home than anything else. We were not in the suite for most of our time in Boston and ended up not utilizing a lot of the extra perks such as the patio/fridge. I easily could have spent the weekend staying in and relaxing in the suite.
The neighborhood is adorable and the trolley is just around the corner. There were several cafes,supermarkets and restaurants within walking distance as well. 10/10 would book again :),,,,

1141888,75176764,2016-05-19,63896968,Tendance,Notre hôte a une bonne communication. La chambre est conforme à la description. Ce que nous avons aimé:
- l'indépendance de la chambre avec son entrée individuelle,,,,,
- les prestations (possibilité de se faire un café le matin) et déco simple  et minimaliste,,,,,
- la situation géographique: située à proximité du centre (10 minutes en métro) le métro est juste à coté,des lignes de bus qui permettent d'atteindre d'autres quartiers directement (MIT,Harvard...),"d'autres peuvent se visiter directement à pieds (Back Bay...)\"",,

The location is also excellent - a very interesting neighborhood near Fenway Park, Northeaster University and with good access to public transit.   My only disappointment was that there wasn't a desk or chair where I could sit and work - I had to sit on the bed to do so, which was inconvenient.  All told, I was very satisfied with my stay."

1141888,92954669,2016-08-10,72882168,Melissa,Location is nice and close to Fenway! We were able to walk since the weather was so nice.
Unfortunately,the location is the only good thing about this property. The room and bathroom look just like the pictures,only there were some visible spider webs in the bathroom,and I found a small roach on the bed...NOT good!! There is also a very strong odor from the cats that surrounds the hallway by the bedroom. The bedroom has a stench but not as bad as the hallway,which is unfortunate since you have to walk through the hall to get to the bathroom. I would say if you're expecting a good nights sleep that this is not the choice for you. We could hear EVERYTHING going on upstairs at all hours. And it seems that the back door by the bedroom is used as the main entryway so you can hear whenever someone comes and goes. I was woken up around 12am and 7am...and this was on a weekday. The property is priced good,but as the saying goes
1141888,93887313,2016-08-14,67628574,Nicole,The place was nice and a great location. Only a short walk to Fenway park.

I think it actually is bigger than the pictures portray. Comfortable beds, brand new kitchen, giant bathroom and in the best location in the North End of Boston.  So many great things to do in walking distance.  Faneuil Hall, U.S.S. Constitution, the aquarium, Paul Revere's house, Boston Harbor, Duck Tours,Tea Party museum,  the BEST Italian food around is in the North End.  Fenway is about 3.5 miles away, so a quick Uber and we were there. It took as just minutes to get to Newbury street by Uber also to see St. Luke's.  Cole was great checking in on us and suggesting the pizza at Quattro just a couple blocks away.  Or the infamous Regina's pizza right out side his front door.  Get there early because I like forms around 11:30.  Our trip was amazing!  On top of it all our daughter left her tablet there and Cole notified us right away and offered to mail it home for her.

12683680,92030479,2016-08-07,16588093,Jade,"Perfecly located appartment - in the middle of Little Italy, next to many restaurants and close to Quincy market and the port -my favorite place in Boston!"
I highly recommend Cole's place : we were a family of 4 and the place was perfect,with 2 big rooms,comfy beds,the AC,3 tvs,a nice kitchen

4777111,26668960,2015-02-16,11544715,Maria Luz,"Paris was very accommodating and even though my flight arrived late at night, she was there to welcome us. She accommodated an extra space for my son by providing  an extra set of sheets and blanket."
The place was cozy and well located,just 5 blocks from Copley Plaza,an indoor shopping mall with a great variety of restaurants and stores. This was very helpful because we were there during the snow storm. The fact that we could walk to that mall and do some indoor walking and eating,protected from the very cold weather,was great.,
We had to stay two more nights because they closed the airport and cancelled all the flights due to the storm. Paris was very flexible and allowed us to stay,she came by and vacuumed and provided extra towels. We had a very good stay,it was like being at home. My son loved it!,,,
The studio doesn't have a closet or an area to hang clothes. So,you will need to travel with simple garments that don't require ironing or special care. This was a little bit of a challenge for me since I was there on a business trip and had to wear a more formal attire.  Other than that,we loved it! Internet worked,T.V worked,was warm in spite of the very low temperatures outside.,
Notice that this is a very old building with character and you have to go up to the 5th floor. We love this type of places but if you are not in good shape this could be a challenge.,,,,,
Overall,we loved it.,,,,

I think she would have moved in if she could.  :)  Everything was clean and comfortable, and the loft was in a perfect location.  Paris was a terrific host, and everything went smoothly from start to finish.  We would definitely book here again."
4777111,28607965,2015-03-27,12909423,Keith,Paris was so welcoming even after we had put her to the test of greeting us at midnight following our very late flight arrival. This was even more appreciated when we faced the four flights of stairs to her loft apartment.
4777111,30381615,2015-04-21,1782741,Melissa,"Paris was very helpful to us before the trip.  She provided information on transportation, neighborhood restaurants and shops.   We loved the neighborhood and we could walk everywhere.  The bed was comfortable and the loft had everything we needed.  My mom appreciated the coffee provided.  We would stay there again if we visited Boston.  The five flights of stairs were hard to navigate after the  marathon but it was worth it to stay in such a great neighborhood.  The price was reasonable and it was quiet."
4777111,31318975,2015-05-04,28093767,Emilia,"In the week leading up to our trip, Paris kept in touch with us and sent a nice little welcome packet listing information on the loft and nearby places we may need to know about (24-hour CVS, grocery stores, coffee shops, breakfast spots, etc.) On top of it, she sent an e-mail listing some additional restaurants, since I mentioned that my fiance and I are food aficionados. We ended up taking some of her suggestions and thoroughly enjoyed our meals around Boston."
The loft itself was tidy and as pictured in the Airbnb listing. It had everything we needed,including towels,shampoo,body wash,even a blow dryer! Outlets were a little tricky to find,but there was one opposite the kitchen space
"The Back Bay neighborhood is a great location for your Boston stay and I highly recommend staying at this loft. I wanted the true Bostonian experience and I really believe we got it. \"",,,,,
4777111,31767640,2015-05-10,26372811,Hannah,This couldn't have been a better place to stay. Close to the trail by the Charles river and a ton of shops. Your really can walk anywhere but uber is also another great choice. We went to a few places she recommended and they were our favorite!! She was accommodation to our flight times and was responsive when I had a few questions.
4777111,32466432,2015-05-18,19013364,Tatiana,The apartment was very cozy and charming. Perfect for two travelers who are in and out exploring. My mom and I felt like we were in a little Anthropologie apartment!

The neighborhood is beautiful! The pictures and description of the space is accurate. Paris has also left plenty of literature for travel information and local favorites."
4777111,34294625,2015-06-07,30912472,Terra,"Paris was an amazing hostess! She went out of her way to accommodate my schedule, was friendly and available for questions if I needed anything, and made me feel right at home! The loft was adorable and both it and the building had a ton of character.  It was perfect for two people who were out and about for most of the weekend. The view is incredible, and you couldn't ask for a better neighborhood to stay in. As a former Boston resident who was visiting for the first time since moving away, I was very happy with my decision to stay here, and would absolutely recommend Paris!"
4777111,35941299,2015-06-23,31072065,Kelly,"My husband and I loved Paris' Back Bay loft.  The location was ideal for us - we moved from Boston last year and were back visiting, so staying in the loft really made us feel at home.  This was our first airbnb experience and Paris was great to work with.  We really appreciated her communication before we arrived - it made everything so easy.  We would highly recommend the loft to those visiting Boston - it puts you right in the middle of a great neighborhood within easy distance to all the wonderful things the city has to offer!"
4777111,37887938,2015-07-11,15755779,Cathy,"This gorgeous loft in Boston is in a lovely safe neighbourhood that is the perfect base from which to explore the city. Paris gave us plenty of information about the area before our stay, and was there to meet us when we arrived to show us around the loft. As Paris herself says the walk up to the top floor is worth it for the view and it helped us work off some of the cannoli we indulged in during our stay. Take Paris's advice about where to shop and eat......she really knows Boston's hidden gems."
4777111,38623832,2015-07-17,9558159,Brigitte,"We had a perfect experience at Paris' loft and in Boston. Wonderful. Paris was very helpful and flexible with our arrival time. She met us for an early check-in so we could drop off our bags and enjoy the rest of the day. The loft is comfortable and has everything we needed. The walk up with suitcases can be a challenge, but Paris didn't hesitate to help. We ate only in restaurants Paris had suggested and loved them all. Flour was our favorite for breakfast. The location of the loft allowed us to walk anywhere. We wouldn't stay anywhere else next time. Thank you, Paris!"
4777111,39649552,2015-07-25,36565809,Greg,"I had a great time in Boston and Paris' flat was the perfect place to put my feet up after a long day of sightseeing! The pictures and description are accurate and the loft is located in classic old brownstone, in a beautiful part of Boston. The neighbourhood is also well located, with tons of great eating and shopping nearby as well as being close to the river and Boston common."
The loft was very clean,with all the basics provided and the air conditioning helped during the heatwave which occured when I was in Boston.,,,,
"Paris was very responsive in the reservation process and provided a helpful guide to local stores and restaurants prior to arrival and was very flexible with a request for a later checkhout. She's a great hostess!\"",,,,,
4777111,41021495,2015-08-03,1575627,Huda,"I stayed at Paris's loft on my first trip to Boston and loved it! Back Bay is the perfect neighborhood - it's minutes away from some of the best coffee shops, the Esplanade running trail and the Charles River. This apartment is a five-floor walk up, which is a detail that Paris specifically mentioned in her description that I totally missed."
Please be OK climbing lots of stairs if you're staying here! I stayed here on my own,and it was fine for one person,but I imagine it would be a little too cozy for two people. My flight was delayed coming in and Paris was really accommodating with the times and was there to greet me when I arrived. Check-in,"check-out was a breeze and the apartment had everything I needed for my stay. Thanks a for lovely stay in Boston!\"",,
11087657,68717262,2016-04-06,57891189,Mary Pat,"Fantastic choice!!  We were attending a conference at the Boston Convention Center.  This Airbnb is in a great neighborhood and only a 15 minute walk to the convention center.  There was another woman with me and both of us felt very safe walking back at night alone.  Met some great dogs (and their owners) taking night time walks.  There is parking at the condo so we never took the car out, either choosing to walk or taxi to restaurants."
The condo itself was so comfortable and homey.  It was nice to leave the convention center and go to a restful welcoming place and not a sterile hotel room.  Kitchen is outstanding and fully stocked.  I wish I had had time to cook.  The place is clean and updated with good bathrooms.,,,,,
I highly recommend this Airbnb if you are traveling to Boston.  It can easily fit 5-6 people and would be great for a family.  Put this choice high on your list.,,,,,
The only negative comment I have is there were no grab bars in the shower.  After all,the conference I attended included osteoporosis and the risk for falls!!  For most people doing Airbnb this is not an issue but for those who have a risk for falling,"showers are roomy and safe but lacking bars to help balance.\"",,,
11087657,70584725,2016-04-18,9423010,Andrew,"Kelly's place is awesome! The picture's don't do it justice. It is immaculately kept, comfortable and has a great homey feel to it. The neighborhood has a lot to do, and it's easy to get into the center of Boston. Highly recommended!"
11087657,90189351,2016-07-31,81141611,Jessica,Great spot in South Boston! Place was very clean and beautiful. Plenty of weekend street parking which was a plus and walking distance to some local bars and restaurants. Would highly recommend a visit!

The room is bright and roomy with ample closet space and a comfortable bed . The bathroom next to the room was clean and well laid out , I was the only guest I think it will be shared once the rental unit is finished . There is a fridge and microwave but little else in the alcove in front of the room . Overall a good quiet place to sleep with a nice location if your staying in the Allston area."
5870922,30708272,2015-04-26,27591612,Jeff,"Todd was a great host and even left me a map showing some local running spots since I mentioned I'd be going for a run a couple times while there.  The location is great, walking distance to Harvard Business School, and a little further walk to Harvard Square or a very cheap Uber/Lyft ride.  It's also very close to the river and there are some great running trails along side of it.  The place was spacious and very private, I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Boston."
5870922,31602138,2015-05-07,31699196,Apurv,Great host. He helped me find his apartment late at night and was also flexible on the checkout time. Would love to visit him again.

5870922,33672045,2015-05-31,128874,David,I agree with other reviewers. My stay at Todd's place was excellent.  Great location for HBS reunion visit. Room in perfect shape - very new.  Spacious.  Comfortable with good AC.  Todd was very accommodating - I asked if he provided an ironing board before I arrived and sure enough he had a brand new one for me (in original packaging) when I arrived!

Now, I could go on about how great it is, but Todd clearly has other great reviews that I must say are a good reflection of what I would say too. With that being said I rank the location 5 stars for ease, and state once more that this place had standards above my expectations. This place is definitely worth coming back."

5870922,79522559,2016-06-13,75046623,Hermie,This was my first Airbnb experience. I was heading to Boston for a conference and needed an affordable solution to stay for 3 days. I was VERY sceptical but Todd's place seemed nice when I viewed it online. Rest assured that the pictures describe the room to a tee: the room and bathroom were very clean and I am a neat freak. I only saw Todd once during my stay and he was very friendly. The neighbourhood is safe. Highly recommend this listing.

8055839,48222722,2015-09-24,43888294,Sandy,This was my first AirBnB experience; I think it was Kevin’s first hosting as well.
"Kevin’s condo was in the perfect location. It was 10 minutes from the Seaport Boston Conference Center where I attended a conference. I felt safe in the neighborhood and the neighbors were nice. It was super easy to get an Uber to the conference center. And the condo was close to the airport. It was so nice to come back to a \"\"home\"\" at the end of the day",order some takeout from GrubHub,and relax.,,,
Kevin’s condo is beautiful. Tall ceilings,crown molding,high baseboards,hardwood floors,granite countertops,stainless steel appliances
We had a bit of a snafu with the WIFI but Kevin was super responsive (from ½ way around the world! – Thanks for that!). TV and cable worked,might be helpful to make the remote situation a little easier to understand (but who doesn’t have that challenge in their own home!),,,,
Unfortunately,I wasn’t impressed with the cleanliness. In Kevin’s defense,he was called out of town for international travel before my trip. Kevin arranged for a friend to handle the key exchange,and his friend was super nice – BTW,Kevin is super nice too!,
In terms of cleanliness,I think it just needs a professional cleaning. The stove,hood fan,microwave and toaster oven were really greasy on the outside. The walls and doors were noticeably dirty. The bathroom had been cleaned but not well. Those beautiful baseboards in the bath had ¼” ledge that were really dirty – just needs a wipe down. I tried to clean some of these things as best I could.,,
I’d also recommend a few extra pillows of different types (I bought and left one – so he’s got one feather pillow now),and to upgrade the sheets and maybe even the bed(s) if he’s going to be an AirBnB regular host — but really the bed wasn't too bad (I used the regular bed,not the air mattress bed).,,,
Also recommend: coffee pot,bottled water in fridge,new cleaning supplies (including scented Febreeze),updating the welcome kit (with WIFI and fun restaurants and favorite hangouts in the area). Also put golf clubs,printer,etc in closet
None of these things are unfixable. And I hope this doesn't prevent someone from checking with Kevin about staying at his condo.,,,,,
"I’m sure Kevin will fix all this! He is seriously a nice person! I would definitely stay again if Kevin had it professionally cleaned.\"",,,,,

13265095,81333720,2016-06-22,26802413,Hantzley,"He was very friendly and the Airbnb is in a nice neighborhood. Right by the Green line, it provides quick transport into downtown Boston."

9862792,61343128,2016-02-02,17826640,Greg,Great place in great area. Modern and new. Very comfortable.
9862792,62205530,2016-02-12,57311461,Trevor,"There was a confusion on the unit, by Kyle answered his phone late at night, set things straight and the unit was a high quality, well located, well priced, giant apartment above a whole foods."
"Will definitely look to stay there again if I head back up to Boston\"",,,,,
9862792,62390647,2016-02-14,3345250,Steve,"Great neighborhood, lots of room.  Whole Foods in building.  Absolutely perfect for our needs.  Forgot a baby toy and they let us back in to pick it up.  Great rental."
9862792,63734651,2016-02-26,48626796,Russ,Place was great and Kyle was super easy to work with. Would/ will stay here again soon.
9862792,64093244,2016-02-29,11147426,Sam,"The apartment was very clean and spacious and a perfect fit for my group of 7 girls. Beds for everyone and lots of space to lounge around comfortably! The unit was very modern with a great kitchen, perfect for cooking meals together. And the building itself was very cool with a friendly concierge downstairs (and it's right on top of a huge Whole Foods!). Kyle was very responsive and happy to answer any questions we had."
9862792,64608710,2016-03-06,37161591,Ryan,"The apartment was very spacious, modern and clean. It was perfect for our group of 7 to hang at prior to exploring the city and great to come back to relax. The wholefoods at the complex was a huge plus, especially if you're staying with no vehicle. Short Uber rides to anywhere in the city. Modern/ Luxury living at its finest. Definitely recommend this listing!"
9862792,65500800,2016-03-15,50929817,Cameo,"Kyle was very responsive before and during our stay. The description of the listing is very accurate. We enjoyed the apartment very much because of the spaciousness and convience to train stops, stores, and food. The only negative for us was that we weren't sure if the dishes were clean since most of them were in the dishwasher when we arrived. The items on the counter seemed to need to be cleaned as well. This however did not effect our experience to Boston. I would recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a low key place to stay in Boston."
9862792,66174846,2016-03-20,56586495,Robert Colin,This place was excellent and we had a great stay! Looks exactly like the pictures. Really could not recommend it enough--everyone in our group was super impressed.
9862792,66415187,2016-03-22,21047536,Dolors,"Estuvimos un par de dias en el apartamento de Kyle, y disfrutamos muchísimo durante la estancia. bien situada para ver Boston, con un parking cerca, muy limpia y acogedora. Muy recomendable desde todos los puntos de vista."
9862792,67134497,2016-03-27,53301402,Rick,Great stay in the Ink Block building.  Very nice/new apartment in a very convenient location.  A quick walk to many great restaurants and you have Whole Foods and a Peet's coffee right there for everything to need to get through the weekend.  We were able to rent a parking spot in the building which was well worth it and made things even easier.  We were 6 in the room and very comfortable.  Easy in and easy out - good communication throughout.  Would definitely stay again!
9862792,67939661,2016-04-01,2812223,Salil,Luxurious 3-bedroom condo. Very clean and comfortable. Not too far from downtown. Easy check-in and check-out process.
9862792,68337789,2016-04-04,50167921,Tyler,Everything about this place was great! A good location in Boston. Loved the whole foods and coffee shop downstairs. There was 6 of us and they gave us plenty of keys so everyone had a way in and out of the room. The concierge was super nice and let us check our bags before and after check in and out. The residents were very nice. Great view of the city. Inside of the room was very clean and modern.  Loved every part of our stay here.
"- Tyler \"",,,,,
9862792,69207843,2016-04-10,55021793,Kristin,"Kyle contacted us shortly after arrival to make sure we didn't need anything.  The check-in process was really smooth, the location of the apartment was ideal and easy to get anywhere in the city, and the arrangement of bedrooms/bathrooms was perfect for the 6 of us.  All necessary amenities were included and the apartment building was very nice."
9862792,69851949,2016-04-14,5894155,Jason,Apartment was great and the instructions were perfect. Extremely easy experience in a really great building. Thanks Kyle!!!

9862792,71789760,2016-04-28,45445174,Heidi,This apartment was perfect for our stay.  We were minutes from all of our activities.  The apartment was clean and comfortable.  The door staff was friendly and helpful.  We look forward to booking again.
9862792,72238088,2016-05-01,55281565,Alec,"The apartment was excellent. Everybody had great things to say about the cleanliness and size of the place.  It was just as described, if not better. Kyle was very prompt to answer any questions, and the whole process from arrival to departure was very smooth."
9862792,72846776,2016-05-04,64070375,William,This was a very nice condo that has amenities in the surrounding area such ass a coffee shop and a whole foods. We were shocked at how quite the area was and we're at peace during the length of our stay.
9862792,74033119,2016-05-12,12159707,Katy,Kyle's home was lovely! Very spacious and great for a large group. The amenities were great and offered something for everyone.
9862792,74498168,2016-05-15,51428606,Julia,The Inkblock building our unit was in was perfect for our group of 6.  Kyle gave us easy instruction to get in and it was easy. We were in Boston for a wedding at the 4 Seasons so the location was fine.  3 of us took a spinning class Sat. AM in the brand new studio on the ground floor and the other 3 worked out in the fitness area. We used Whole Foods. All was good.
9862792,75350726,2016-05-20,18101369,Craig,"Fantastic place to stay. Great location, wonderful facilities and very friendly and helpful concierge. Kyle was also on hand to answer questions anytime. Would definitely stay again."
9862792,75913892,2016-05-23,53222262,Marilyn,Kyle was an excellent host who accommodated our early arrival and responded to every and all questions. The concierge was extremely helpful and welcoming. The space was absolutely beautiful and well-appointed.  We strongly recommend this space and would definitely refer family and friends.
9862792,76175294,2016-05-25,70131715,Eric,"Great location and very easy to get anywhere in the city from the apartment.  Four of us stayed while at a conference and the accommodations were perfect, plenty of room and comfort for everybody.  Highly recommend and we look forward to coming back again next year."
9862792,77652205,2016-06-02,56396854,Rashmi,Check in was very easy. The place is as nice as described.  The construction noise was a bit annoying but that is temporary and a sign of the improving neighborhood.  The building amenities are wonderful and I would definitely stay there again.
9862792,78193998,2016-06-05,54908124,Tim,"Great apartment to stay at in the Boston area, very clean new building with a very close walk to some bars and restaurants"
9862792,78876315,2016-06-09,20373603,Phil,"Kyle's apartment was exactly as described. It was clean, fully equipped, and very comfortable. We had long days attending a conference so did not get to take advantage of the pool, etc., so cannot comment on the extra's. Location was good, not far from the convention center, harbor, etc.  $8-9 Uber ride to most anything you would need or want to see. Whole Foods in lower level was awesome, could grab most anything needed there.  Would definitely rent again when in Boston."
The only thing I will mention is that there is construction going on across the street where they are currently driving pilings into the ground,"so very noise from 7 AM to 4 PM.  This should improve as construction moves into the next phases.\"",,,,
9862792,80260470,2016-06-17,45559124,Keiichi,新築したてのきれいなアパートでした。webで見たままの素敵なアパートでした。トイレ、バス、キッチン、ベットルームも完璧でした。ボストンに行くときはまた泊まりたいです。
9862792,80764210,2016-06-19,75400497,Stephanie,"Awesome place to stay in Boston. The apartment is really nice and very clean. 8 of us stayed there and it wasn't crowded at all. It's close to any place you would want to go to. Everything was less than ten minutes away (Fenway, Harpoon, etc). Having a grocery store so close was a big plus too. There's also a nice pool and area to grill. Kyle is very quick to answer any questions and made check in/out very easy with clear instructions. We all really enjoyed our stay."

9862792,86607125,2016-07-17,19199949,Theresa,"Kyle's place was wonderful; the neighborhood - which is growing and changing-- is anchored by the Whole Foods, which made arrival quite nice-- it's always good to be able to grab a few food items for the fridge right away. The amenities within the InkBlock building are second to none-- the workout room, the pool and outdoor garden/deck area were gorgeous, and within the apartment all of the appliances were brand new and in perfect working order. Plenty of fresh towels and linens, everything you need for a few days away to feel comfortable. We used it for a work trip, and so having wifi in the apartment and in the cool public spaces in the building were awesome. We all felt like we could be together in the unit or in other spaces around the building to get things done. A great option for our group!"
9862792,96457575,2016-08-22,76540849,Agostino,"Fantastic place, great location, and great host."
8326439,48628443,2015-09-27,31372595,Mathan,"I arrived few hours later than i expected but Bonnie has already arranged for the key. The house was spacious, quite, close to public transport. Bonnie was very helpful during this stay. I would love to come back to this place again."
8326439,52603587,2015-10-31,31087610,Shivani,I thoroughly had fun staying at Bonnie's place and I would recommend anyone else to stay if they are looking for place near to Boston downtown or in east Boston
8326439,58605898,2016-01-03,48338405,Serena,Our experience at Bonnie's house had both good and bad aspects. We stayed there 28 days.
Firstly,the neighborhood is very quite and safe,really next to the Blue line (5-6 min walk). We never met Bonnie,but she answered quickly to our questions by text messages. Internet Wi-Fi was very fast and it worked well. Negative aspects are that the picture on the website did not correspond of our room. Furthermore,she did not tell us the number of the house,and I had to call her to understand where to go. The house was very dirty. There was not the hydromassage
8326439,68677998,2016-04-06,50328173,Lizao,"I stayed there for 3 months for my postdoctoral data science training program in downtown Boston. Overall, it is an overpriced place with minimum accommodations. Recommend only for very short-time necessary stay on a severely constrained budget. I would not stay there myself if I am traveling for fun."
This is a 1bd within a very old 6 bd 2 ba rental property. The owner does not live on site. Other tenants are mostly students renting long-term (at a much lower rate,of course).,,,,
Pros:,,,,,
- Has the bare minimum: one room with a bed,a table,a chair,and even a closet.,,
"- Very convenient location. Close to Suffolk Downs and Oriental Heights station. It takes ~20 min from \"\"out of my room\"\" to \"\"out of the State station\"\" downtown during rush hour. The blue train performance is very consistent",even in the winter.,,,,
- Onsite laundry (free for the washer,$1.25 for the dryer).,,,,
- Mostly very quiet even with paper-thin walls,because most tenants are out most of the time. No partying was observed during my three-month stay.,,,,
- Almost no noticeable noise from the airport or the trains given its location.,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
- The shared bathroom is not cleaned regularly (never systematically cleaned,I suppose) and is FAIRLY GROSS with everything from copious amount of human hair everywhere to an abandoned electric toothbrush charger lying in a puddle of melted soap (which seemingly not touched by anyone for years). I had very nice bathroom and shower at my workplace so this did not bother me much. But for those who do not have alternatives,this conceivably can be a HUGE problem.,,,
- Bad WIFI. The owner added another router after my complaint but the WIFI is still bad. Both routers are on the second floor while this room is on the first. WIFI signal depends very strongly on your location.,,,,,
- New towels were given at the beginning. There was never room cleaning or any other service afterwards even though I was charged biweekly for it. This was not resolved even after my complaints.,,,,,
- Heat is globally controlled by a thermostat in the shared living room. Other long-term renters who pay the heat bill will not like you if you turn the heat up.,,,,,
- I had to leave early because my job search concluded earlier than expected. The owner and I initially agreed to settle this outside of AirBnB following AirBnB guideline for cancelling long-term contract with less than a month left. However,"the owner never answered my numerous phone calls and SMS messages after I left the house.\"",,,,
10995355,63534193,2016-02-23,42714138,Carlton,"I arrived a little bit late (9PM) Gael waited for me, he greeted me at the door and gave me a tour of the apartment. AMAZING location, 10 minutes away from Newbury St and 12 from copley square.  The apartment is spacious and the bed really confortable.  It is better than a hotel and i felt like home. The internet was fast and the Kitchen fully finished."

Il se trouve trés proche de luniversité Northeastern."
L'appartement est bien représenté par les images postées sur l'annonce. On peut y vivre facilement á deux pour un week-end. Gael a su se rendre disponible pour nous accueullir et venir faire le check-out en fin de journée le dimanche.,,,,,
La cuisine est bein équipé,le lit confortable,et  il se trouve des emplacements payants publics dans la rue derriére mais il y a des emplacements libres la plupart du temps.,,,
Wifi fonctionne trés bien.,,,,,

"The apartment is near the campus of Northeastern University.  There are lots of college students around and there is a MBTA green line stop a block away.  It was a convenient location as a home base to explore the city.\"",,,,,
10995355,66219500,2016-03-20,6671269,Thomas,"I had a great stay in Gael-Etienne's apartment. The apartment is large and comfortable - simple but pleasant. Windows let in a fair amount of light. It is slightly noisy due to a busy street and mostly student housing in the building, but it didn't bother me much. The location is great, right next to Northeastern, the Green T line, and plenty shops & restaurants; not to mention beautiful Fenway park and the surrounding museums and musical venues."
10995355,67221292,2016-03-27,17005772,Carter,"Gael was a great host! He was very accommodating to my travel schedule and his apartment was nice and tidy.  The location of his apartment was perfect! All in all, a great experience"
10995355,68250303,2016-04-03,21890228,Janet,"The studio was clean and comfortable - just as shown in the photos. It is an older building, with the accompanying quirkiness, as well as character and charm. The unit is conveniently located near eateries and the Northeastern campus. Our host made arrangements to accommodate our arrival and departure schedules. We would happily stay again."
10995355,68396375,2016-04-04,27922278,Bill,"Great location, superb value, and just as described. Some may care to note that it is a 4th floor walkup, but that is common in this area. Gaël-Etienne was a polite and responsive host."
I saw some comments about street and neighbor noise. I'm an old curmudgeon and may not have booked it if I had seen those first. DO NOT WORRY. I was there Friday to Monday,college kid party days if there ever were any,and no issues at all with the neighbors. Hemenway is just residential traffic,"not much city noise for being right in the thick of it.\"",,
10995355,70132825,2016-04-16,15418316,Victor,"The place was clean and as described, and although Gael-Etienne was not around, his friend gave us the keys and let us in. Its a bit expensive for what it is, but still cheaper than any hotels in the area. Easy walking distance to Fenway park."
10995355,70787918,2016-04-20,60068351,Edward,"\"Gael-Etienne was an excellent host. Any questions I had, he was able to answer them quickly. He was very accommodating to my schedule despite some last minute changes on arrival and departure. I found that the studio had plenty of space for myself and my wife. The location is fantastic. It's located next to a world-class art museum, 10 minute walk to the finish line of the Boston Marathon (which is why we were in town), 10 minute walk to Fenway Park, plus plenty of pubs and restaurants nearby. It is situated in the Northeastern University area, so weekends may have a few rowdy college kids passing by, but that really didn't bother me (I was one of those rowdy university kids once). This is the best \"\"bang for your buck\"\" that you'll find for the city of Boston on AirBnB. I highly recommend Gael-Etienne as a host and I look forward to having him as a host when I return for next year's Boston Marathon.\""
10995355,72688048,2016-05-04,43624117,Nyki,"Listing was accurate. Neighborhood was as expected (it's next to North Eastern University, so it's a little loud). Gael was very nice, he was very welcoming & communicative. He answered all my questions & was very informative about everything when getting the keys to me. He let us know where everything was & offered iron + ironing board, clean towels, etc."

10995355,76943702,2016-05-29,29576904,Sarah,"The apartment was in a great location, extremely accessible to the metro and walkable distance to Back Bay and the South End for tons of great restaurants. The apartment was clean and Gael was a great host, answering many of our questions and always with quick responses. One thing to note, however, while it is advertised with a TV and the physical TV is there, it does not get cable or any TV channels and only functions as a screen which you can hook up to a laptop with an HDMI port. Not a huge problem, but if you like hanging out watching TV, which we do, it was a tiny bummer."
10995355,81936767,2016-06-25,62471147,Audelia,"The apartment is even more spacious than it seems from the pictures. Everything was clean, and Gael-Etienne helped me with the luggage when I arrived, since there is no elevator in the building. Every time I needed something my request was answered within the same day (more towels, help with the keys etc...). I really recommend this apartment since it is in a nice, clean and safe area and Gael-Etienne is very attentive and patient and knows how to treat his guests."

You could walk everywhere including the T and many of the local attractions.  If you want to get closer to the harbor, it's about $12 if you use Uber.  Matt was great.  He gave suggestions for places to dine, worked it out so there was flexibility in both the arrival and departure time and made sure we had everything we needed.

4432035,60179114,2016-01-19,50151092,TuanTuan,"Matt was incredibly accommodating given the fact that we booked his place last minute just a few days in advance. He even held onto our luggage on our last day so we could explore the city without dragging around baggage. The apartment was quite spacious and located in a beautiful and centrally located neighborhood. In fact, if it wasn't walking distance away, every Uber ride was less than $10 to every part of the city we visited. Would definitely come back!"
4432035,60356995,2016-01-22,34618942,Caylee,"Very great location, Matt was very accommodating and easy to communicate with. Place is kept very clean and feels like a home away from home."
4432035,61951463,2016-02-09,3868638,Eric,"Matt made us feel very welcome, he met us upon our arrival by transport to Boston.  He brought us to his very nice Brownstone home.  Its a great location, one can walk to everything.  The Metro (T) is very close if you are not using taxis.  Beautiful street (Marlborough) very picturesque.  Matt was always available when we had any questions, very prompt.  Even when my sister said we  needed some more towels, Matt had them shipped over quickly.  The apartment is comfortable, and there are very nice windows looking out onto the street.  The kitchen is a very good size and the living room is comfortable with a very nice TV and entertainment center if you want to stay in and relax. Super location."
4432035,64232136,2016-03-01,26489291,Geri,The host canceled this reservation 72 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4432035,64676499,2016-03-06,15767346,Phong,"Matt's place is amazing! It's more than enough room for two people and has all the creature comforts you need. The location cannot be beat as your are within walking distance to so much. My wife and I only took a cab once to get around on our three day stay. The building is very secure and the neighborhood was very safe. Matt and Megan were very accommodating with check in and check out time. We didn't cook, but the kitchen has everything you need. Also, for the times you spend inside, the tv is huge and has all cable channels/Netflix. Megan and Matt were highly responsive and made sure we had everything we needed. I'd highly recommend."
4432035,65131162,2016-03-10,51105827,Dax,We enjoyed staying with Matt.  He and his property manager were excellent communicators and made us feel welcome upon our arrival.  The property was clean and organized.  The furniture was very comfortable.   It was a nice touch that they left drinks like orange juice in the firidge.     We would book here again.   Thank you.
4432035,65404221,2016-03-13,19014259,Morgan,"The location was great!!! Easy to walk over the bridge to Cambridge and to the downtown of Boston. Back Bay also had a ton of coffee shops, restaurants, and shopping. Such a walkable city! The place was perfect for me and my husband and the hosts were wonderful! Very responsive and accommodating. The bed was AMAZING! You will sleep well on this trip! Would absolutely stay here again."
4432035,66448423,2016-03-22,49124115,Cassie,"\"Matt's place was a fantastic place to call home base while we were visiting Boston for the week. The apartment was very clean when we arrived. The location is great and very easy to travel around the city via the Green Line and other trains after making a transfer. The 67\"\" TV with Netflix and cable is a welcomed perk as well.

We didn't actually meet Matt, we were met at the apartment by Megan, who was so nice and welcoming. We were allowed to check out slightly later (very helpful!), and we liked that there were several maps and a guide in the apartment. All in all we had a great time. Thanks for letting us stay!"
4432035,69830319,2016-04-13,56919582,Alheli,"This was the best AirBnB experience I've ever had. It is the best location on a beautiful street. Walking distance from lots of good restaurants, shopping and Fenway. Really close to airport also. We felt right at home. So clean and welcoming. The big windows bring in lots of light. The bed is ridiculously comfortable. Most quiet building and street. We liked it so much that the first night we arrived we decided to order in, relax and watch a movie. They have a Keurig, so it was great having coffee in the comfort of our home every morning. All in all I loved it and would stay here again!"

The apartment is spacious, quite comfortable and is in a great location. 5 stars all around!"
4432035,71730293,2016-04-28,20766550,Grant,One of the best Airbnb experiences I've had to date.
Matt has really has an attention to detail for this place,and we felt right at home.,,,,
The location is perfect (walking distance to boston's main shops),the couch is comfy,the bed is comfy,and the pictures are accurate.,,
"Thanks Matt.\"",,,,,
4432035,72151248,2016-05-01,36156898,Nicole,"Wonderful location, space, and hosts. Would definitely stay here again.  Quick walk to Fenway, several train lines, and boutique shopping!  Great experience."
4432035,72668617,2016-05-04,53055656,Jennifer,The location is terrific and the view from the apartment is fantastic. Very close to restaurants and shopping.
Matt was out of town during our visit but Megan was there to fill in. She was responsive to texts and extremely helpful. Easy check in and out.,,,,,
This is a no frills apartment but it was clean,"well outfitted and convenient to everything we wanted to do during our stay.\"",,,,
4432035,72760735,2016-05-04,30444798,Levon,The place was great and so was Matt. They were very accommodating with allowing us to leave our bags in the place until our flight home later that afternoon. Highly recommend this place!
4432035,73919729,2016-05-11,20983027,Chelsea,"Matt and Megan were perfect hosts! Communication was proactive, responsive and easy. Check in-check out was a breeze.

4432035,74272632,2016-05-14,67189465,Samantha,"Matt and Megan were AMAZING hosts from the very moment I booked the trip. They responded to every text message quickly and kept in touch from beginning to end. This was my first Airbnb experience and I will ALWAYS stay here when coming back to Boston, if possible. Matt's recommendations of places to eat and places to go were very helpful and he even gave directions for Airport travel to and from (which we used and worked perfectly! Saved a bunch of money!)  The apartment is absolutely gorgeous and even one of our uber drivers mentioned that there were famous people that lived in that area. (He was a real estate agent) This was also only a 12 minute walk from Fenway Park and a hop and skip from the popular Newbury street where you will find fun shops, restaurants and boutiques. The apartment was very clean and the TV was huge! I don't think we could have stayed in a better place in Boston. Thanks again!"
4432035,74912762,2016-05-17,66114289,Lisa,We enjoyed our stay at the apartment.  The neighborhood  was in a great location and Megan allowed us to check early.  It was an easy walk to Fenway and the Boston Commons.  We would stay here again.

4432035,78082919,2016-06-05,38277186,Greg,Excellent apartment in upper end of Back Bay Boston. The building is safe and well cared for. Couch and bed are very comfy. Coffee maker options are very welcome. Lovely stay.
4432035,78889708,2016-06-09,72199759,Erik,"Megan was great, and very responsive. We arrived late so she left the key for us, but the place is in great condition and Marlborough Street cannot be oversold. The couch is very comfy, and we loved the natural light coming in throughout the day."
My one word of warning is that Matt's place is not air conditioned,"so beware if traveling in the summer months. Luckily Corner Bar just around the corner can provide you refreshments adequate to usher you to sleep fairly easily. \"",,,,
4432035,79906527,2016-06-14,35013350,Sarthak,"Megan was highly responsive and left detailed instructions for everything. Not only was the apartment stocked with standard breakfast items (waffles, cereal, coffee, etc.), there were a ton of resources regarding exploring Boston. I would definitely like to come here when I am not doing a business trip. ;)"
4432035,80279653,2016-06-17,6545683,Mo,"There is literally NOTHING bad that I could say about my stay in Boston! Matt and Meagan were WONDERFUL and helped where they could!! Before I arrived in Boston they made sure I knew exactly how to get to and into their place! And once I was there I was pleasantly surprised how clean and spacy everything was! And the place is greatly situated, a short walk from everything you need! I'm gonna say this: If you plan a stay in Boston, you better stay at Matt's!!:-)"
4432035,80910077,2016-06-20,74814648,Kianna,"The listing description was accurate as well as the pictures. Even though we weren't able to meet up face to face, the exchange of the keys was easy as well as the check out process. The T was close by as well as many shopping areas and Megan made us feel very welcome by replying quickly to any questions we had!"
4432035,81209928,2016-06-21,28346063,Michelle,LOVED staying here! Would absolutely recommend and will definitely be back when we come for another baseball game or Cape visit.
Pros:,,,,,
- Location,location,location! Walking distance to Fenway,shopping,and all the tourist adventures you could want (1-2 miles tops).,
- New AC unit installed in bedroom in case you happen to get there on a hot summer night like we did,,,,,
- Easy accommodations for key exchange; Meghan (who helps run the property) left it in a lock box so we could arrive at our leisure,,,,,
- Bed was a memory foam (queen) mattress so we slept wonderfully!,,,,,
- Fully stocked kitchen for cooking and a Keurig for the morning,,,,,
- Safe neighborhood to walk around at night. Also,neighbors and neighborhood is quiet which was nice to come home and feel relaxed at night.,,,,
Cons (just more so in case you have other preferences),,,,,
- On the third story,no elevator access but not a terrible climb in my books,,,,
- AC is only in the bedroom,not throughout but not necessary with the great weather. Windows do not have screens but we did not have any bug issues when opening them at night for a breeze since we are on the 3rd floor.,,,,

4432035,82662173,2016-06-28,54408321,Kenneth,"We really enjoyed our stay at Matt's place. From start to finish the process was very easy. Megan was great at communicating and answering all questions we had. As far as location, it's really hard to beat in Boston. It is right by the Newbury st. shopping area and many other cool places in Back Bay. There's a T stop right near it as well, so you don't need to rent a car if you're wanting to explore other parts of the city. Our local friends were shocked we were able to stay in such a great neighborhood for the price we'd have paid at a hotel in a worse location. We felt like we were staying in our own place, not a hotel."
One thing to note: The living room/kitchen area does not have air conditioning. It has a large fan that helped cool down the room.  Even without A/C we were comfortable in the living area.  However,the bedroom has a window unit air conditioner that made sleeping very comfortable. The bed is super comfy as well. The living room has a large TV with premium cable channels,"so we could watch the Game of Thrones finale with no issues. I highly recommend Matt's place. It is in a great location to get to all Boston has to offer.  \"",,,

It is a light, bright 1 bedroom with a large living room area and very comfortable bed in the bedroom. We also used the inflatable mattress made available to us which worked out well set up in the large living room. The host was a great communicator before we arrived and instructions for access, wifi, etc were very clear. We will definitely keep this apartment in mind for the next time we visit Boston!"
4432035,85727940,2016-07-12,9526168,Clare,"Matt was extremely communicative and helpful before arrival and throughout my stay. The neighborhood is fantastic, beautiful, and safe.

4432035,86978638,2016-07-18,12989093,Dan,"Matt and Megan's place was exactly as described.  The location simply could not be beat.  We had a great time discovering the restaurants in the area, all within a short walk away.  The memory foam mattress/topper reminded me of home.  Matt and Megan were very accommodating and directions for entry were clearly laid out.  We did not need to consult them at all during our stay.  I would certainly stay here again on my next visit to Boston."
4432035,87838204,2016-07-22,39586330,Christina,"The booking process was super easy and checking in to the apartment was a breeze.

4432035,97278129,2016-08-26,12393226,Sami,What a fantastic place to stay. I'm so glad I chose to stay here over getting a hotel.
The location is unbeatable,in the heart of back bay,literally steps away from Newbury street and the Charles river.,,,
Not only did I think their check in process is genius and seamless,Megan and Matt let me in a little early which I appreciated very much.,,,,
The apartment is sunny,spotless,with everything you could possibly need and some more. High speed wifi,huge TV with an amazing selection of movies,clean sheets and towels,even Boston city guides with discounts
Bottom line,if you're in Boston,stay here. I know I will when I go back.,,,

2963419,13020196,2014-05-17,10364213,Lisa,First of all we want to thank Lucia for having us and being such a great host.
We could talk to her about everything and really hope that she will continue being a host for Airbnb,so we can come back!,,,,
We stayed with her and her lovely dog Angus for almost one week and loved it.,,,,,
The room and the house are like displayed on the pictures,just beautiful.,,,,
We walked around 15 min. to the nearest Subway Station in order to get downtown. You walk through a lovely,peaceful neighborhood with many shops and cool restaurants/bars around.,,,,
5 stars from us :),,,,,
"\"",,,,,
2963419,13446932,2014-05-27,3999235,Carolina,"Lucia is a very graceful host who welcomed us to her home with everything we needed for a perfect stay in Boston. She is really good company and we enjoyed talking to her and getting to know Angus, who's the most adorable dog you will ever meet. Her house is very nice and located in an incredible part of the city, which we most certainly would have missed if not staying there. There are several interesting spots to explore around the neighborhood: The Haven, Aurum and El Oriental de Cuba to name a few. Samuel Adams is about 15 minutes away, just by the nearest T Station, and offers a great tour for beer enthusiasts - also, the great Ula Cafe is a perfect pit stop to refuel your energies around there. It is very easy to get to the city center or other relevant places - a 20 min subway ride will get you anywhere, really. Boston is a great city that was made that much better because of Lucia. From our communication before arriving to getting keys and checking in, the process was smooth and easy. We highly recommend staying with her for the real Bostonian experience!"
2963419,14640733,2014-06-23,14132393,Sarah,Our stay at Lucia's home was wonderful. Lucia is very kind and sweet and promptly offered us some water and fruits at our arrival after our long journey from across the Atlantic.
The house is so cute and Lucia has a great eye for details and interior... the garden is amazing! And Angus - the dog - is always there for you if you need to cuddle.,,,,,
The house is a bit outside but we used the hubway system (city rental bikes) so we enjoyed the 20 minutes ride to the public library every day (where we had to drop off/change the bikes to stay in the 30 minutes limit). With the subway it is also fast and easy and the neighbourhood is safe and pretty.,,,,,
Only advice: a map for the guests would be so helpful. Without a map (and just a foreign cell phone) it is a bit difficult to find your way downtown the first time (until you reach the visitor's center to pick one up). But that's just a tiny little thing that would make the whole experience beyond perfect.,,,,,
"We'll be back for sure... one day!\"",,,,,
2963419,15180058,2014-07-04,15778086,Allison,Lucia is a dream host. She is so gentle and gracious and easygoing. And her guest room room and her house are elegantly welcoming and comfortable. And getting to spend time with Lucia and her sweet dog Angus before the birth of my first grandchild made my visit to Jamaica Plain even more epic.
"THANK YOU so much!!!\"",,,,,
2963419,15452550,2014-07-09,15531385,Philippe,"Near Jamaica pond, Lucia’s place is a truly charming house in a calm residential area with beautiful villas and pleasant gardens. A terrace and a back garden are inviting for a contempative moment among the flowers and bushes."
Our room was very comfortable and nicely furnished. Despite the fact that we had to share all the commodities,we always felt at home. For transport,we mostly used the bus 39 to Copley square passing by the MFA and Prudential Tower. Logan Airport is a short 15 min. bus ride from Copley Square.,,,
Lucia was a most welcoming host,discrete and attentive,always ready to help us in organizing our activities. She has given us precious advice on many subjects and we were happy to share our fresh impressions with her.,,,
We would definitely recommend her place for enjoying nature,Boston city as well as good company.,,,,

Natalia is a great person to occasionally hang out with, since she has been quite busy with her lab work during my stay. The bed is very comfortable, and there's plenty of space in the room. I really felt at home during my stay, where I get watch tons of TV and cook my own meals. If I ever come back to Boston, I'll try to stay with Lucia again :)"
2963419,49480302,2015-10-04,29661934,Connie,"Had a wonderful experience. Lucia's home was beautiful and charming. I loved the neighborhood, and it was an easy 10-minute walk to the Orange Line. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. I didn't get to meet Lucia as she was out of town, but her housemate Natalia was very kind and helpful. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends. My only word of advice to future renters is that the bedroom can get a little chilly, as it has two outside walls and probably not the best insulation, being an older home, so bring warm pajamas if you're not coming in the summer!"

The house has a lot of charm with pretty much everything you need and a wonderful garden. It is located in a quiet and safe neighborhood and going to the city center is really convenient and fast. There are also plenty of options to get some nature in the nearby parks.,,,,,
So all together,"you'll get an awesome package of host and place to stay. I highly recommend it and would not hesitate a second to stay with Lucia again! Merci. À Bientôt.\"",,,,

We definitely got a kick out of all the art installations in the loft. The apartment was very clean and bright. I also think it's a wonderful place in a great area. Right by the Orange line and walking distance to a lot of great restaurants in Jamaica Plain. I am definitely going to recommend this place for any friends that are going to stop by Boston."

The place was clean and really bright. The owner is easy to reach and really helpful. Nothing was complicated with him. Our family enjoyed the time we spend there and we would definitly go back!"
1187188,13760170,2014-06-03,15478581,Juniper,"Our stay at Kenji's was great! Kenji was a great host and quick to respond with any questions. His place is in a great location - walking distance from cafes, an organic market, and the Sam Adams brewery tour, as well as the T. There is one private room with a single bed and additional futons (they were really comfy), and an open loft with a double bed, so keep this mind if you have certain privacy needs. The place definitely has an artist vibe, and there's even a wall in the living room that you can decorate with your own art :) We'd definitely stay here again!"
1187188,13968353,2014-06-09,11379132,Hoai-Mi,"I stayed here with my husband and two friends for three nights. The four of us had a great time. The apartment is beautiful and perfectly located near the subway, parks, cafés, restaurants. We were able to travel around Boston easily, and had many pleasant evenings in the loft. Kenji was very accommodating and helpful. The beds were comfortable, the apartment was clean and open. I highly recommend this loft!"
1187188,18135267,2014-08-22,14982549,Teng Wah,"Spent five brilliant days in Boston with wife and mother at Kenji's place. Kenji was there to greet us when we arrived in the evening after a day's drive from Canada, and gave a short brief on the neighborhood. Also got to see his used bike collection the following morning. The loft itself is really beautiful, with plenty of intelligent installations. Spent my evenings listening to the radio, and admiring what he did. The loft is in the Jamaica Plains neighborhood with plenty of artists around for company, and is a short walk to the Jamaica Pond, and great restaurants/bakeries near by. Would return in a heart beat!"
1187188,18728196,2014-08-31,17567980,Nicholas,"This is a lovely apartment with some quirky interior design features which we loved. It was very clean. Kenji was a perfect host, he met us on arrival to explain the bits and pieces in the apartment and also gave us useful information about the local area. He kindly left some provisions for us including English tea - which was very thoughtful. During our stay he sorted out some bikes for us to ride which was great. The apartment is only a short walk from the orange line and the area is safe and has some nice open spaces close by (Arnold Arboretum is a bike ride away and Jamaica Pond is a 20 minute walk). Would highly recommend this as a base to visit Boston."

He helped us about everything: he told us and wrote a list of places where we  could eat (there are also good italian restaurant) or buy food near his loft; invited also us to go to local music concert, lended his fantastic bikes, and gave also some vegetables!!"
His loft has a good position; it's in a green neighborhood of Boston,with a lot of wanderful parks; it's near two subways station (but also the train station and buses stations are near the house) and in 15-20 minutes you can be in the town centre.  The apartament -wich has a private car parking - is  clean,very comfortable,(3/4 beds) and you find there all you can need (to cook,have a shower,listen to music

Kenji played Superman and helped us move things around and put up gates at either end of the stairs. His basic attitude was:\"\"  whatever you need"

336946,12111287,2014-04-23,11165737,David,"Our 10 day stay at Andree's JP Green House Apartment was fabulous. We found the suburban location perfect with an easy commute to the city. We love to walk, so the 15-20 minute walk to the subway or bus was a breeze. We loved the area as there were plenty of interesting things to do and see including the beautiful Arnold Arboretum. We could have spent another 10 days quite happily."
Andree is a friendly and accommodating host. She was available when we needed her,yet invisible most of the time,allowing us to enjoy our holiday with privacy. She helped us with all manner of things including a trip the the local store and a tour around in her car to help us get our bearings.,,,
It's fair to say that when we arrived,the apartment was still a bit of a work in progress. We're easy to get on with so this didn't bother us a bit. We had a few issues with new appliances not working but Andree addressed these promptly as best she could.,,,,
"We have absolutely no hesitation recommending Andree's and her apartment. \"",,,,,
336946,12459724,2014-05-03,1007951,Mallory,"We loved our stay at Andree's place in Jamaica Plain! It was a perfect size for 1-2 people, well appointed and cozy. It was also a quick 10-15 walk to the T that would take you anywhere into the city. And downtown Jamaica Plain is super charming with lots of great places to eat and shop (our favorites were Grass Fed for burgers and City Feed for gourmet sandwiches). Plenty of free street parking right next to the house as well."
Andree was a great host,"answered any questions we had quickly and generally left us to enjoy the city. Would highly recommend this place!\"",,,,
336946,12549693,2014-05-05,13444460,Valerie,"Fantastic apartment-brand new but already feels homey. Decorated with serene colors and Ikea furnishings including a very comfy bed with cozy, cozy soft linens. It is completely private and quiet, yet Andree is occasionally available to chat about sustainable design, urban gardening, etc. if you're interested. Andree even gave us a ride to the Arboreum. It's a very reasonable walk to the T station (there is a hill if you have walking difficulty). A great home base for exploring the Boston (and JP) area-we wish we could have stayed another night!"
Best features:  Andree,her homemade granola & yogurt,fantastic coffee,and a shower that is incredible!,,
Good wi-fi,"too-we each had to do some work on 2 computers with big downloads simultaneously-zipped along!\"",,,,

336946,13023972,2014-05-17,1316286,Jason,"We had a wonderful stay in Andree's garden apartment. She's done a great job creating a welcoming space with lots of nice little touches and conveniences. The space is on the small side, but laid out in a very thoughtful and aesthetically pleasing way such that we were always very comfortable. We enjoyed walking out and seeing the garden area, and the neighborhood was quiet, safe, and peaceful. We traveled mostly by car (parking is super easy), but the Forest Hills train stop is a short walk. Andree was very hospitable, stopping by with Canyon the family dog to say hello and make sure we had everything we needed. Overall, this is a top notch airbnb stay that hits all the marks. We would definitely stay here again."
336946,13081131,2014-05-19,11899501,Diane,"This apartment was everything I expected and more! It was perfect for three people. My husband and I and our 17 year old daughter were attending my older daughter's graduation- so hotels were full and expensive. This was our first experience with airbnb. I loved having a kitchen and  Andee was a perfect host. The apartment was private, clean and had little touches like a welcome message on the chalk board and breakfast in the fridge. I would highly recommend JP Green House and Jamaica Plains as a neighborhood. It was a  great community in which to walk."
336946,13891853,2014-06-07,13575082,Audrey,"The JP SOLAR Green House was very clean, neat and nicely furnished.  Both queen bed and futon were very comfortable.  The neighborhood is quiet and in a great location.  Andree was helpful, responsive and immediately provided us with an extension cord when requested.  Granola, milk, bread and jam awaited us in the refrigerator.  There's a great shower--big and with great water pressure.  Consider checking this one out!"
336946,13967258,2014-06-09,1601406,Andrea,"We had a great stay at the JP Green House in the garden apartment.  Andree was communicative and helpful, and the apartment was as described.  Everything went smoothly with our stay."

The house is kid friendly, my 5 year old daughter loves the vegetable garden and the small trampoline.  My sister and I love the hot shower and colorful and soft house slippers and soft white towels.  The place is clean, modern, and comfortable and gets a nod from my architect sister. Andree is kind and helpful and very responsive to my messages to get us settle in."
336946,14458958,2014-06-19,3052661,Heather,"Boston was the last stop on a road trip I took with my little brother and sister. We loved wrapping up our adventure at the Greenhouse. It has a beautiful garden and it’s in a safe neighborhood. My little brother is an avid hockey player and when he spotted the goal out back, Andree was generous enough to bring out some sticks and a puck for him. She told us to help ourselves to strawberries and peas from the garden, too!"
336946,15041762,2014-07-01,15033009,Jennifer,"We had a great time at the JP Green House! It was the perfect set up for myself and two my two children. We had all we needed-- bed, kitchenette, sitting area and bath, plus a wonderful outdoor area where they were able to play (and several toys available for them to use). We also loved looking at the community garden that was right there, as well."
In terms of location,"it was a bit of a walk to the Forest Hills station for two kids. We learned the quicker route to a local bus that took us to the station. \"",,,,

336946,21649846,2014-10-21,5611563,Ke,My parents had a very good time at green house. The place is very nice and cozy and Andree was very generous and offered them fresh fruits and vegetables from the garden.

The design and architecture of the place is a lot of fun…in a traditional neighborhood like Boston's forest hills this was a stand out house.  Andree, was so hospitable.  She dropped off milk, breakfast items etc."
336946,22170097,2014-10-31,17246916,Alexandra,The apartment was adorable and very clean. The neighborhood was really safe and we were relatively close to both the airport and downtown Boston. We ended up staying extra nights because we liked the apartment so much. Definitely would stay here again!
336946,22541368,2014-11-09,5676971,Lindsay,"We had a wonderful stay at the JP Green House! I would highly recommend it for couples or small families. It was our first time to Boston and we wanted to explore the city. Luckily, this house was tucked into a beautiful little neighborhood that we otherwise never would have known about. It was only a 3/4 of a mile walk to the Forest Hills Metro station, and if you ride the Orange line it will take you straight into the city. We got off at the North End stop and ate lots of amazing food, went shopping and did the Freedom Trail.  It was so nice having a quiet residence to come back to. The apartment itself was clean, bright, modern and just the right size. Even though we were only here for the weekend we had a great time and felt like we got a true sense of Boston."
336946,22802653,2014-11-15,15621547,Jeeyon,"Andree's preparation of her space was impeccable. My boyfriend and I immediately remarked on how clean, brightly lit, and lovely the interior was. He was especially delighted by the thoughtful touches in the kitchen area: there was oatmeal, jam, bread, coffee, tea, and milk, all laid out and ready to use in case we wanted to have a light meal or snack in between exploring the neighborhood. I was impressed by how well-designed everything was - the whole place felt so roomy and welcoming, in both layout and decoration!"
We had the pleasure of meeting Andree herself,albeit briefly,while the two of us crossed paths between errands. She was very kind and warm,and I felt very comfortable talking to her.,,
Andree definitely respected our request for discretion and privacy,"and I was charmed by all the little touches of her presence from the artful objects placed on the long mantelpiece to the sweet \"\"Welcome to Boston!\"\" note she wrote in chalk on the stylish blackboard above the sink.",,,,
All in all I adored her place,and I could not have asked for a better AirBnB experience. I'm very happy that my first AirBnB stay ever was such a satisfying and pleasant one. Thank you,"Andree!\"",,,

336946,23447450,2014-12-01,19576994,Berry,"This apartment was perfect for our Thanksgiving stay in Boston to visit relatives who couldn't accommodate our whole family.  We didn't spend a lot of time there and in fact didn't even meet Andree.  But she contacted us several times with helpful information and was quickly able to resolve a little crisis, when some family members locked themselves out.  The place was cozy and warm, equipped with coffee and granola.  We loved the sustainability aspect."
336946,23564995,2014-12-04,20689041,Rebecca,"This place is the cutest. Andree has done a great job of turning the small space into a home. Fresh towels, plenty of blankets, even pairs of slippers in a variety of sizes. She left milk, granola bars, tea, cereal, coffee, butter, peanutbutter, jam... plenty of shampoo, conditioner, soap... books, magazines, and information for travelers.  There are a lot of nice touches on this place!"
While my gf and I stayed at this house because our nearby apartment was temporarily under construction,"it felt like a nice little \"\"getaway","\"\" granted we were just a few miles from home. I'd even consider renting this space as a retreat in the future. And I'd definitely recommend it to friends.",,,
"I should also note that our landlord had put us up in 2 different luxury hotels in the center of Boston over the past week... and the house in JP was even better than either of them.  \"",,,,,
336946,24209915,2014-12-22,2484766,Geoffrey,"Excellent place and I love the solar power! The house is in a charming neighborhood and just a 15-minute walk from a T stop. Several nice restaurants, cafes, and an organic market are also nearby."

336946,24688479,2015-01-01,25116168,Erin,"The location was exactly what we wanted, only a short drive to the hustle & bustle and all the attractions! The place was overall very clean, warm, cutely decorated and although we never spoke to/saw Andree the instructions were clear and the breakfast was a cute gesture! However, if you need wifi for anything business related during your stay I would suggest (URL HIDDEN) the wifi was spotty and we couldn't stay connected for long."
336946,25566190,2015-01-19,21595691,Erich,"If you are traveling to Boston and looking for a place to stay other than the big chain hotels, this is it. This garden apartment is nicely situated in a quiet Boston neighborhood. Andree has done a great job at making this a very comfortable little retreat. The kitchenette has what you need to make an evening snack as well as fresh milk and granola, compliments of your host! Small selection of games and books for the small ones with you and a nice garden patio with picnic table outside the private entrance."
Next time I'm in Boston,"this will be my first choice for a place to stay!\"",,,,

A lovely little place as long as you have a car or bike (a local friend commented it wasn't true \"\"Jamaica Plains\"\" because it's not walkable to many restaurants). It's right near the arboretum and was a great spot for me to work out of for the week"
336946,26899083,2015-02-21,4239520,Pilar,"As Somerville residents, my boyfriend and I came to stay at Andree's place for a 'staycation' and explore a part of the city we don't often come to.  Andree's place was clean and looked newly renovated.  The decor and amenities were perfect.  The bed was comfy, shower warmed up very quickly and the kitchenette was great.  I would recommend Andree's place for anyone looking to explore JP.  My only regret was I wish that we had been there during nicer weather to see his garden!"
336946,28032120,2015-03-16,8479251,Michael,"Andree was both welcoming and responsive. When we were cold, she brought us a very helpful space-heater. The availability of coffee, tea, milk and other breakfast items was both welcome and appreciated."
The apartment is small but fine for two people,located in a quiet residential area,not far from transit. All in all,"a very pleasant place to stay in Jamaica Plain.\"",,
336946,29203415,2015-04-05,13140629,Lisa,"As you can see, the house itself is impressive and makes you want to learn more about energy conservation and ecological concerns."
The Garden apartment is clean and light,indebted to Ikea,spacious enough for us three,and has all the necessities,including breakfast necessities for those who are too tired to run out for some milk and cereal etc. Beds are comfortable,there's a lovely patio outside.
I would have liked a little (Ikea) table to sit and write or eat on,the couch table is too low for me. You control you temperature. Nice big shower. I took a picture of Andree's book titles in the apt,felt inspired by her telling us in our brief meeting that the  house is,,,
one of 25 in the US producing more energy than it uses. How cool is that?,,,,,
Definitely a place I would consider first when returning for a JP visit.,,,,,

336946,43988617,2015-08-23,14464910,Edgar,Overall it was great. I think the space could have been a bit cleaner. It was very stuffy at first and had a damp smell to it while we there.
336946,45777095,2015-09-06,34755786,Purandar,"This place is not far from MBTA bus and train routes. Bus stop and Forest Hills Orange Line train station are within walking range if the weather is not that bad. The locality is decent and quite. The interior amenities are acceptable. The proprietor is a good person, helpful and reachable. Logan International airport is nearby and within thirty minutes or less driving distance, including slow traffic. I-95 and or SR-128 is not at all far away from this place. One can feel at home once inside this studio apartment style place. Thank you!"
336946,46627920,2015-09-12,13871677,Rachel,"My stay at Andree's place was excellent. The neighborhood was quiet and felt very safe. My boyfriend and I walked home from the bus stop several times late at night, and never felt uncomfortable. The apartment itself is bright and cheery. Andree made our stay comfortable by providing essentials such as milk and bread, and allowed us to check in early so that we didn't have to find a place to store our luggage."
336946,46853667,2015-09-13,43220410,Kaveh,"Everything about this place was delightful. The space was colorful and bright, everything was very clean, and it comfortably slept 3, nice patio, easy parking, good shower. Andree was also very accommodating and pleasant."
336946,47541252,2015-09-20,43544688,Rick,"This apartment was exactly as described. It was small but comfortable, well equipped, clean and convenient. Everything was laid out, including soap, shampoo, and even several pairs of slippers. The 15-20 minute walk to the Forest Hills T stop was fine, and provided easy access to the city by either bus, subway or commuter rail. The apartment also has a heat pump/air conditioning system, which was fantastic on the 85 degree days! I was gone early in the morning and not typically back until late at night, so I never actually met my host, but she made it clear that she was available by cell phone if I needed anything. Overall a great experience."
336946,48201681,2015-09-24,39758820,Kristie,The place was pretty much just as described.  Andree was welcoming and available in case anything came up.
336946,48596555,2015-09-27,5626868,Sara,"Had a lovely stay in quiet JP! Andree was my favorite kind of host - very nice and helpful when I needed something, but otherwise hands off. The neighborhood is beautiful and it's a quick drive to lots of fun stuff."
336946,49015502,2015-09-30,35563457,Kristina,"The apartment was as described, small but big enough for comfortable staying of 3. Kitchen was fully equipped, with everything needed for breakfast. The closest metro station was 5-minute bus drive away, and it took as 30 minutes at the most to get to downtown Boston. We arrived in Boston early in the morning, and Andree allowed us to leave luggage in the apartment so we wouldn't loose any time for exploring Boston."
336946,51026439,2015-10-17,42697210,Wendy,"Andree definitely made us feel welcome.  Due to our travel schedule, we missed an e-mail from Andree asking us to check in after 4 instead of after 3, so we got there while she was still getting ready for us, but everything was just fine.  The Green House is exactly as pictured, and was very comfortable.  It's about a 10 minute walk to the T-line and buses, which with the purchase of a Charlie Pass ($20/7days!), will take anyone anywhere in Boston.  Andree provided maps of nearby attractions and recommendations about places to eat out, and that was really helpful.  With just three full days in Boston, we barely scratched the surface of things to do and see in this historic city.  So, we will be coming back sometime in the future, and  Andree's JP Green House will be our first choice in a place to stay."
336946,68579609,2016-04-05,19162430,Rafi,"Andree provided us with milk, cereal, jam, toast, and oatmeal so we didn't have to leave for breakfast.  The neighborhood was quiet with ample street parking in front of the apartment.  To get into downtown Boston, we drove a very short distance to get to the Forest Hills MTA station.  The house was comfortable with enough room for two, not to mention board games and WiFi."
336946,69319642,2016-04-10,27668299,Joe,"Had a very pleasant stay! Quiet, comfortable, lots of natural light and conveniently located in JP"
336946,70304680,2016-04-17,49750644,Auriane,We enjoyed our night. Andree is very nice with a good communication. The neighborhood is very calm. It's definetly a good place to stay!
336946,70706221,2016-04-19,15620814,Deb,"We stayed here for the Boston Marathon. It was only about 6 T stops from the Commons so that was convenient. It was a bit to get anywhere else in Boston, ie Fenway, Cambridge."
It was pretty clean and looked like its pictures.,,,,,
Andree was out of town but was very responsive to my texts for closest T station and grocery store.,,,,,
A few issues however:,,,,,
-it should say on the description very obviously that there is NO TV!!,,,,,
- the bathroom sink was backed up,,,,,
- the futon is VERY uncomfortable so altho it's an option if u need a 2nd bed,it's not comfy.,,,,
- the description says burners (plural) but it's a single burner- made cooking pasta and sauce the night before the race a chore.,,,,,
"All manageable and by no means a bad place... The biggest issue really was not knowing there wasn't a TV. \"",,,,,
336946,72896948,2016-05-05,46973635,Eileen,"JP Green House provided such a peaceful comfortable space in a beautiful neighborhood.  The apartment made us feel like we were actually in a European home, complete with a view of the Spring garden in progress.  We highly recommend this apartment for your next stay in Boston!"
"Thank you Andree!\"",,,,,
336946,74314369,2016-05-14,24951014,Audrey,"Had a great time, the space was bright and neat. The neighborhood was conveniently  located near the Forest Hill T station."
336946,75003226,2016-05-18,21052256,Colleen,"It was a great apartment! We were only in town for one night but I would have loved to spend more time there. Everything was convenient and charming. The neighborhood was quiet and there was plenty of parking. I'd love to book again, the next time I visit the area."
336946,76628580,2016-05-28,70239203,Cecile,"Quiet neighborhood.  Peaceful back patio.  Compact, but comfortable."
"Andree contacted us to let us know that she was available if we needed anything.  Close to the T for transportation is no car is available.  Lovely garden out back.\"",,,,,
336946,79480033,2016-06-13,24951014,Audrey,"Great experience, this was my second time booking with Andree."
336946,82273576,2016-06-27,16060306,Sara,"This is a great little apartment in a pleasant neighborhood, easy walk from the T.   Lots of light, and nice patio outside to sit, eat, relax"
336946,84072028,2016-07-05,36370057,Karina,"The host provided organic bread, jam, butter, cereal, coffee, tea, and milk/cream for us so we were able to have a breakfast on our first day. Andree was extremely welcoming and the apartment is very cozy! We loved the décor and we had our own outdoor patio and garden view to enjoy an iced coffee in the quiet neighborhood.  The internet had great connection and the air conditioning worked very well in the hot summer weather."
336946,85579590,2016-07-12,19375870,Angie,"JP Green House was fantastic. It was close to the T, had everything we needed, and had a beautiful yard with a table for outside dining. Andree was very helpful and responded quickly whenever we needed something. I would highly recommend this property."
336946,86010394,2016-07-14,61415809,Nora Patricia,"Great place.  Great price. Good location, especially if you require parking."
The host was incredibly generous and left breakfast supplies for us. There were also lots of books and board games to use,which is a fab touch especially if you have kids.,,,,
The location is a good 15-20 min walk to the train. There is a bus about a 2-3 minute walk away that takes you right to the station. Our 2 days in Boston were super hot so we got the bus (we're Irish and burn real easy!). We also had the good fortune that the people who stayed just before us had unexpired 7-day passes that they left for whoever came next. So there was no hesitancy in using public transport (thank you to whoever you guys were! Super generous!!).,,,,,
All in all I highly recommend Green House. Fab place,"generous host and good price.\"",,,,
336946,86747912,2016-07-17,44741453,Katie,"Andree was very accommodating, making sure my husband and son could get settled in early after a long drive up from VA. The space was as advertised, just like an off grid tiny house. We love JP, and the neighborhood was just as we remembered!"
336946,87839478,2016-07-22,31794932,Katie,"Great time in JP, everything was as expected. Clean and very comfortable! Would recommend"
336946,89430702,2016-07-28,84091027,Catherine,"The apartment was exactly what we were looking for. It was private, convenient, clean, and comfortable."
336946,93360560,2016-08-12,18281293,Erwin,Great place in a nice neighbourhood. Easy to reach and plenty of space.
336946,94146240,2016-08-14,14787735,Tilden,An accurate listing. Felt welcomed. A quiet neighborhood.
336946,96236735,2016-08-22,88134603,Joe,"Andree was great, location in JP was cool, and the space it self had a warm feeling"
12425501,79724697,2016-06-13,55554840,Jorge,"We had a great time staying in the North End. Location was perfect as everything we needed was a 15 minute walk away, at most. Paige was great and quickly responded to any questions/requests we had right away. Will definitely contact her again when I return to Boston!"
12425501,81464487,2016-06-23,41571118,Steven,"We had an amazing time!  The North End location was perfect.  The apartment was extremely clean and pleasant. Paige was a lovely, helpful and accessible host who went out of her way to make sure we had the best experience possible.  Thanks so much, Paige!!"
12425501,82399674,2016-06-27,8237256,Alexandre,"The apartment is well located. The keys are dropped in a lock box, which makes the arrival process very convenient, especially at night. We did not have to communicate much with Paige, which is a good sign. As smooth as can be!"
12425501,84164909,2016-07-05,67391448,Barb,Not applicable
12425501,84829998,2016-07-09,78414540,Holly,Our stay in the north end apartment was great. It was comfortable for the six of us because we were only staying one night and we were very interested in seeing the city so we were not there very much. Everything was clean and was well stocked. I recommend this apartment for its quaint proximity to many of the beautiful neighborhoods in Boston!
12425501,85820886,2016-07-13,33060490,Majd,The apartment location is perfect... Just on the borders of downtown... All the restaurants and bars are a 5 min walk away.
We were 5 adults in the apartment and it was comfortable for all of us.,,,,,
Paige is a really good hots and helped us out with anything we needed.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
12425501,88718076,2016-07-25,69970159,William,Had a very good stay at this 3 bedroom apartment last weekend. The great north end location was perfect for a long weekend in Boston with my cousins.
12425501,89138298,2016-07-27,14367566,Myrthe,"Very nice neighborhood, relatively quiet street near a very nice lively neighborhood. Appt is clean, with 3 good beds"
12425501,89295166,2016-07-27,49974154,Sheena,"The description and photos of the rental were accurate. The place was clean and in the perfect location for what we were looking for. The apartment is on the 4th floor for those that need to know about stairs beforehand, but this was not an issue for our group. Paige was very helpful and responsive, making our check-in, check-out and overall experience smooth and enjoyable."
12425501,90164657,2016-07-31,77682312,Simon,great place and price. no complaints at all
12425501,91436004,2016-08-05,56733131,Catherine,"Lockbox makes key retrieval easy. Perfect location for Quincy Market, Boston Garden, fabulous Italian neighborhood and North Station. Do not expect amenities beyond minimal, what is seen in photo: utensils, beds, towels. Four-flights up. No parking."
12425501,92156530,2016-08-07,11402800,Eric,"Listing was just as advertised. Great location in the heart of the north end and steps away from the boston garden and fanueil hall. All three beds were quite comfortable, and large air mattress in the kitchen allowed us to sleep 8 without issue. Two window a/c units kept the entire apt cool in the August heat. Bathroom is small and has no ventilation (strange), but that was the only issue we had with the apartment."
12425501,93071429,2016-08-11,68227675,Katie,Great location! Wish the space had a TV.
12425501,93942356,2016-08-14,7494357,Philip,"Perfect Area, 3 bedrooms"
12425501,94959642,2016-08-17,84916694,Shufei,"love to live here, clean apartment and environment, especially because of the neighborhood. Italian style construction and very quiet. Metro is near here."
4632511,23872889,2014-12-13,10654349,Alejandro,"We really enjoyed our stay here!  The apartment is just like it was described and the location is superb.  Public transportation very close by, lots of restaurants, pharmacies & market make it very convenient.  Lucy was insistent about our consideration for the spiral staircase (bedrooms are downstairs), which is not suitable for people with mobility issues.  It did not turned out to be a problem for us.  But please consider if this would be your case.  One thing to note is that there is a significative temperature difference between the two bedrooms (the main is colder and the second warmer).  Also, the heating makes noise on the second bedroom.  If you a light sleeper this could be a problem.  This apartment would be perfect for a couple looking to spend a few days experiencing the city of Boston."
4632511,30438307,2015-04-22,1652836,Kristin,"Staying at Lucy's duplex marathon weekend was a nice change from a standard hotel.  The Beacon Hill location was ideal!  The previous two years, I stayed at the Marriott Long Wharf during the marathon.  I found Lucy's Beacon Hill location was better, due to the proximity to Boston Commons, North End,  and the finish line at Copley.  There is also a Whole Foods within a few blocks.  We appreciated the quaint and quiet street.  The townhouse is very well suited for 3 - 4 people.  Both bedrooms had very comfortable queen beds.  If you're a light sleeper, I recommend bringing ear plugs. or sleeping in the master bedroom.  I slept in the master bedroom, which was quiet.  But my cousin was kept awake in the other bedroom from the loud banging noises from the heating pipes.  However, my sister slept in there one night with ear plugs and didn't hear a thing.  Lucy advised me in advance about the pipe noise.  So we were not surprised at all.  It just comes with the history of an old building.  I can understand, since I own a vintage condo in Chicago that was built in 1929.  We didn't watch much TV over the weekend, but a few times we would have liked to tune into ESPN, CNN, etc.  There seemed to be just basic channels, and premium movie channels, like HBO.  But no other cable channels.  It didn't negatively affect our stay, but it might for guests who are big TV watchers.  Thanks Lucy for a wonderful stay in Boston!"
4632511,31073718,2015-05-01,20731013,Johanna,"Great place! Prefect location, very comfortable! Would definitely stay here again!"
4632511,31767762,2015-05-10,27172509,Alex,"Great place, exactly as described. Location is fantastic for getting to public transport, shops restaurants etc. The duplex has everything you would need for a comfortable week in Boston - loved it."
4632511,32177768,2015-05-15,1716920,Mikaël,"We had a wonderful stay at Lucy's. The location could not have been better, we did all activities either walking or taking public transportations that are nearby. Upon arriving in Boston, we left our car in public garage a few minutes away. Very convenient."
Groceries,pharmacie,restaurants: plenty of choice within a few minute walks as well.,,,
Lucy's place is charming,in a historic building. It's fully equipped and very comfortable.,,,,
"I definitely recommend it!\"",,,,,
4632511,36508982,2015-06-29,28688439,Kelly,"Lucy was a great host, quick to answer questions and to work with us to solve a potential problem right away. Her home is well appointed, with easy internet access and nice touches in the kitchen and bathroom. The duplex is also well located - our family, including hound kids, easily walked to the Boston Common, Faneuil Hall, and the Freedom Trail. Large suitcases will probably need to stay upstairs, as the spiral staircase is somewhat narrow, but there is plenty of space both up and downstairs, so this was no problem for us. Overall, we would recommend Lucy's home."
4632511,37291887,2015-07-06,3564380,Carolyn,The location of this place was perfect for us during our stay in Boston.  Lucy has made a effort to make the place inviting and there were a few nice touches like extra umbrellas and shaving razors available in case you forget yours.  We (including my 70+ year old parents) had no problems with the spiral staircase but I wouldn't want to carry a large (non-carry on) suitcase up and down it.
4632511,38584562,2015-07-17,7262473,Samantha,"The place was lovely, exactly as described in the pictures. The location is really convenient and Lucy was easily contactable during our stay. The place fits 4 comfortably, but it was a challenge attempting to get our luggages to the lower level bedrooms because of the narrow staircase (we didn't in the end). The house was also rather dusty. But overall a very comfortable stay!"
4632511,44892769,2015-08-30,17264427,Shaelene,"Lucy's unit was comfortable and well positioned to discover Boston by foot or public transport. When we had a question about the air-con Lucy attended to our concerns promptly. More than ample room for four and very homely, and found a fantastic Italian restaurant very close."
4632511,46368221,2015-09-10,25741363,Beth,"Lucy was great, provided detailed instructions well in advance of our trip. The apartment was great, homely and provided a great location for our trip to Boston."
4632511,55370087,2015-12-01,44594915,Rainer,"Lucy had everything well organized: we directly found the location, knew where to find the keys, where to go shopping and grab something to eat the night we arrived. The appartment is awesome and just the way Lucy described it. We felt very welcome from the moment we stepped through the door."
4632511,68378800,2016-04-04,49818428,Hilary,"Fantastic location for a base in Boston for a family of 4.  Well-equipped condo, very close to Whole Foods for shopping and the Transit station to let you get around the city easily (although walking around Downtown and the Common is very easy).  Lots of close local restaurants - Zen for sushi, Tip Tap Tavern literally at the end of the street for great beer and pub food - and a good location to stretch your legs along the Common or the shoreline.  We all had a really great week and were glad that we chose Lucy's apartment."
4632511,72577494,2016-05-03,1733218,Amanda,"Overall everything was good! The apartment is as pictured. The kitchen is well stocked for cooking and both beds are quite comfortable. Lucy was very responsive and easy to communicate with. The street is pretty quiet, too."
A couple of things to be aware of: the pipes are pretty noisy in the second bedroom. If you're there when the heater is in use,we recommend bringing ear plugs and a sound machine app. Also,all toilet paper has to go in the trash cans,none can be flushed. Not a huge deal,just something to know going in.,
Oh,"definitely eat at the Tip Tap Room around the corner!!\"",,,,
4632511,74924389,2016-05-17,44681128,Ben,Perfect location for a Boston city break.
Very close to the T and right in the middle of the gorgeous Beacon Hill.,,,,,
Everything you could wish to do in Boston is nearby or a short T journey away. Lucy is the perfect host. She left clear concise instructions on how to get in when we arrived,"left a comprehensive house manual for us to read whilst staying there. And even took the time to speak to us on the phone after our departure regarding items we thought we had left in her property. Could not have been happier.\"",,,,
4632511,75680704,2016-05-22,29072004,Sara,"Good stay at Lucy's. Photos are accurate - the place is just how it looks. Plenty of space for a family of 4, and the kitchen was well stocked. Location so convenient we mostly walked to the tourist sites on both sides of the river. Taking the Blue line from/to the airport was a snap. Lucy's communications were fine, the key transfer was the easiest AirBNB yet for me, and she was excellent in making sure there were foam pillows for us allergic types. The biggest caveats are not within Lucy's control but worth knowing: 1) the plumbing/toilet paper situation turned out to be more disturbing than we expected, and that 2) for such a tiny street, the noise level was high. With some noise due to early-morning construction and some due to neighbors, the street-facing bedroom meant disrupted sleep. We put the kids in the back bedroom, which was definitely quieter."
4632511,76795800,2016-05-29,52757177,Muna,"We enjoyed our stay at Lucy's apt. It was very cozy and clean. The location is great and close to many destinations as well as the T. It's good to keep in mind that this is a historic area and the buildings are old. There's a ticking sound in one of the bedrooms that may be from plumbing, so it's a good idea to use earplugs when sleeping there. My son used them the second night there and was able to sleep through the night."
4632511,78495307,2016-06-07,26214959,Katya,"Foram dias maravilhosos e nossa experiência foi fantástica. O apartamento é muito confortável, amplo, limpo e seguro. Sua localização é excelente, em um bairro histórico e muito bonito. Próximo a ele temos supermercado, bares e restaurantes, estação de metrô, além de vários pontos turísticos importantes em Boston. O MGH é ao lado do imóvel. Lucy foi atenciosa, gentil e paciente conosco. Recomendo o imóvel sem restrições."
4632511,78966264,2016-06-10,1109839,Jf,"Everything was as described, the neighbourhood is pretty amazing and you're right in the center of the action!"

4632511,82490070,2016-06-27,62950093,Jennifer,"It was an awesome neighborhood. Close to everything we wanted. Convenient to bars, restaurants, grocery stores, shopping and historic sites. For being only a few blocks up from a main street, the condo was quiet at night. We loved it."
4632511,87536237,2016-07-20,53637054,Patty,"Lucy has a beautiful home, just like in the pictures. The neighborhood has everything you need within walking distance. Mass transit is also very close. Convenient to restaurants, shopping, and sites."
4632511,88193856,2016-07-23,10946773,Anna,"Lucy's apartment is absolutely gorgeous and superbly located to access all of Boston. We had to cut short our stay in Boston due to my son being ill, but managed to fit in lots of sightseeing in the short time we were there. It really gives you a feel for the 'real' Boston. And there were some lovely touches such as shampoo/shower gel & coffee there, which helped with our late arrival. I would most definitely recommend."
4632511,93181660,2016-08-11,50073957,Jeanette,"We had a great stay!  Lucy was very accommodating.  The location was ideal for travel on the T throughout Boston.  We would definitely stay again, upon returning."
4190704,20538187,2014-09-30,8501316,Marcus,Can't beat the neighborhood - right near Boston Commons and central to everything. Kim met me when I checked in and provided me with all the information I needed. She was incredibly communicative leading up to the experience and during as well. I highly recommend staying at this apartment if you want to be in the thick of it.
4190704,20589288,2014-10-01,5804119,Jacob,"Kimberly met me at the door and took me on a quick tour of the apartment.  It is centrally located in Downtown Crossing, right near the Boston Common.  It was perfect for my needs."
4190704,20671503,2014-10-03,21748312,Dave,"The studio was extremely well located in the heart of Downtown Boston. It's  less that a block away from Boston Common, the T-line and a plethora of bars, restaurants and other attractions. The interior was modern, clean and well equipped to suit our needs. The host, Kim, even left water, fruit, and candy for us on our arrival. She was extremely easy to work with and very prompt in responding to any questions we had. Overall this was a very enjoyable and convenient stay for us. We would definitely stay here again the next time we come to Boston."
4190704,20969296,2014-10-08,20608663,Chloé,Kim was really welcoming and attentive. She agreed to adapt to our late arriving hours and was available for any question we had while preparing our trip.
The apartment is really nice and very well situated in the heart of Boston,close to everything. However,I don't think 4 people could fit in it as there are only the bed and the couch (as shown on the picture). One should not plan to sleep before 2AM on Friday and Saturday as there is a night club on the 2nd floor.,,,

It is also newly renovated and very clean, with new towels and linen etc. As it is in the middle of commercial, rather than other residential units, it was very noisy until about 8pm, but it was quiet during the night."
There are lots of restaurants etc nearby,and it would be good for anyone wanting to be right in the heart of downtown Boston. Kimberly was very efficient with the booking process,and left water and fruit in the fridge for me.,,,

4190704,21050678,2014-10-10,21783653,Logan,"Great spot - much bigger than it looks in the pictures, and in the perfect location in downtown Boston. Less than a block from two T stops, clean, and quiet. Kim was super helpful and very communicative - left work to come show us the place, left detailed instructions for entry and night access, and even left out some candy, fruit, and water (highly appreciated after a night in Boston). Hard to beat this place for a centrally-located, clean, nice apartment right in the heart of the city. Thanks, Kim!"
4190704,21158886,2014-10-12,21230424,Alice,The location is perfect !!
You can't be more at the center of Boston. The appartment was really satisfying,very clean and modern. Kimberly is really nice and did her best to improve the quality of our trip. Soap and Shampoo were available. She even let fruits and bottle of water for us!,,,,
We were a group of students and it was maybe the best deal we could have found for our trip in October. The only negative points of this appartment would be the window you can't open nor cover (for the night),which wasn't a problem for us. Also,there is a latino club at the first floor,on week-ends,so that it is noisy until 2 am. But again,it didn't borrow us a lot. Even if we could feel the basses under our feets
"I would clearly recommend this appartment if you are looking for a cheap and well located place to stay at for your trip in Boston.\"",,,,,
4190704,21270818,2014-10-13,8738274,Sayantan,"The apartment is as described. A spacious studio with the latest appliances and furnishings located right in the heart of Boston with easy access to multiple T lines. Brilliant location, pretty apartment. Host herself was extremely helpful and very accommodating. She was fine with our late departure. Only drawback is the nightclub on 2nd floor which kept on blasting loud music till 2 in the night on Sunday. So, be prepared for not getting any sleep on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights before 2am. However, I must stress upon Kim's helpfulness with this issue. I called upon Kim at 11 in the night and for next 2 hours she constantly kept on trying to negotiate with the night club to soften the music and keeping me posted on the developments. She was able to get the club to soften the music which helped us in sleeping."
4190704,21365954,2014-10-15,7052992,Mary,"Kimberly was at the apt to meet me and familiarize me with the everything.  She also told me about a restaurant, 49social nearby...the food and service were good.  The apt was exactly as shown (clean and neat) and was in a great location near state street with easy access to mbta, (red,green,blue lines). thanks for a great stay."
4190704,21404213,2014-10-16,11497498,Jeremy,Kelly's studio is pretty good. Nice location
4190704,21477332,2014-10-18,21756349,보미,"Kimberly was so nice to us for 3 days. The room was so awesome. When we got in the house, we were so surprised. Simply speaking, it was great. All in the room were clean. The location was also very good. I really really recommend this room. Thanks, Kim :)"
4190704,21895554,2014-10-26,21972517,Eilidh,Kimberly was great and really accommodating around arrival time. She showed me to the apartment and gave me all the info I needed for my stay.
The apartment was great,"very clean and all the facilities needed for my stay. I would definitely recommend to anyone needing central accommodation in Boston!\"",,,,
4190704,22247329,2014-11-02,8156272,Natalie,We had a nice stay at Kim's place. The location of the flat is perfect for visiting the city and going out at night. Everything is close by! The apartment is well appointed. Kim is very nice and helping. We had a great time in Boston!
4190704,22528824,2014-11-09,21465673,Kit,The apartment is newly renovated and everything is new and tidy. The kitchen is well equipped and the bed is comfortable. The host was readily available whenever I needed anything. One issue is there is a nightclub downstairs so it is quite noisy on Fridays and weekends from 9pm to 2am. Ear plugs are provided.
4190704,22769954,2014-11-14,10499757,Barbara,Everything was good. The host was very nice and the apartment new. We didn't hear any music from the club in the same building. Kimberly was also very helpful wirh our luggage. And the lication is very central. For us it was perfect
4190704,23571225,2014-12-05,18398500,Jennifer,"Kimberly's apartment is small, as described, but very nicely decorated.  The location is excellent, just steps from the green line T at Park Street, the Common, and myriad places to eat and shop.  It's easy to get anywhere in the city from here...the one thing I would note is that if you are coming by car, there is no way to unload your things before parking as the street is a pedestrian mall.  We overpacked as always and had a time of it, dragging everything 3 long blocks to the parking garage!  However, we stayed here as a family (figuring that a tiny apartment is as good as a hotel room) and were pleased that not only did Kimberly have no problem with that, she had an air bed all ready for our kids.  The regular bed in the picture is very comfortable, as well."
4190704,23944175,2014-12-15,12270923,Marianne,"Kimberly is attentive and straight forward.  The apartment is in a fabulous location, is clean and adorable."
4190704,24224095,2014-12-23,1600533,Jorge,"The location CANNOT BE BEATEN! It is right there where you must be if you are visiting Boston for the first time. Literally just a few steps to Boston Common and the train station if needed. And I say if needed because Boston is a city for you to walk. Everything is at walking distance. Back to the apartment, it is exactly as advertised and Kimberly was there for us as agreed to meet us and take us to the apartment. Clear directions given and no trouble at all during our stay. It can get loud on Fridays and Saturdays because of the bar downstairs, but I stayed with my parents (senior citizens) and they had very little trouble to sleep and besides, we were provided with ear plugs in case we needed them. In short, I would absolutely stay there again and totally recommend this place."
4190704,24514828,2014-12-29,11913368,Bethany,Had a great time in this apartment. Amazingly close to everything and right across from the park street station. Communication with Kimberly was very simple and easy. The interior of the apartment was comfortable and modern. The only downside is the noise from the club downstairs on Saturday night. I would definitely recommend staying here.
4190704,25145517,2015-01-07,24768486,Kaela,"Staying in Kimberly's studio was fantastic. The place was clean and had everything we needed for a two day stay (modern kitchen, a cozy couch and a fantastic bathroom). Best part was that the apartment was walking distance to everything imaginable in Boston. It was cold when we stayed, so a $7 uber ride was all it took to see any of the sights nearby."
"Kimberly was very friendly and was only a text away. \"",,,,,
4190704,27146224,2015-02-26,17081497,Stephen,"Kimberly's studio apartment was in an excellent, neat and clean condition, being newly renovated.  It was very convenient for my stay in Boston, and I was very satisfied with my stay."
4190704,27638669,2015-03-09,5008178,Lael,Kimberly was very receptive and helpful with all of our accommodations and requests and made us feel at home. The place was wonderful and very convenient for all of the things we needed to get to in Boston.
A suggestion for anyone who is a light sleeper: do not stay here on Friday or Saturday nights! There is a nightclub downstairs from 10 PM-2 AM on those nights. I did not have this issue (being a heavy sleeper),"but any potential guests should be aware of this before making a reservation.\"",,,,
4190704,27930561,2015-03-15,1984817,Rebekah,"The apartment was very nice and extremely clean. Sheets, extra blankets, towels, hair dryer and even coffee is provided. Check in went smoothly and Kim responds quickly in all communication. There is a night club on the floor below and it is quite loud on Friday night and even worse on Saturday night, however, the host was very up-front and honest about this issue. She even provided ear plugs. Location is perfect! Just steps away from Boston Commons and the Park Street T."
4190704,28204206,2015-03-20,26194673,Gloria,The apartment is in PERFECT location and very comfortable and spacious for 3.
BUT... the instructions to get there could have been clearer and the communication with the hostess better. The apartment is inside a place with some food places,and then you have to buzz to a tailor studio(3f),who opened us the door,but didn't know anything about Kimberly's place. We felt quite lost at that point. We decided to knock on another door before leaving,and the previous guests were still there,but no news about Kimberly
4190704,28652262,2015-03-28,9691872,Jimmy,"Kimberly's place worked great for our trip! It is an ideal location, right across from the beautiful Boston Commons and a great T stop. We also used the kitchen and had everything we needed there."
We unfortunately never met Kim,but she had a friend take care of us. He was responsive and helpful.,,,,
The building itself is honestly a bit unorthodox. The shops on the first floor,club on the second floor,etc. make for a very interesting environment. It worked out for us because we're flexible and the studio itself was nice,"but it might not be for everyone.\"",,
4190704,28866785,2015-03-31,2728776,Clemence & Guillaume,"Great place to stay in Boston, near all the subways you will take and at the beginning of the freedom trail!"
Very nice flat,"just noisy on the saturday (but Kimberly told us before we reserved).\"",,,,
4190704,28983653,2015-04-02,24525209,Giovanni,Nice flat in the centre of Boston. Minor drawbacks: the windows on the street can't be opened (aircon works perfectly though) and the building is a but run down (but the flat is very nice).
"Kimberly was quite responsive and the check-in and check-out were super easy.\"",,,,,
4190704,29595611,2015-04-10,23333988,Mary,"The apartment is clean,modern and convenient.  The owner was very accommodating. Will definitely stay here again."
4190704,29652556,2015-04-10,2937068,Katie,The reservation was canceled 187 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4190704,29906986,2015-04-14,25693983,Catherine (Cathy),We did not meet Kimberley but were met as arranged by a friend.  The apartment was in an ideal location and the interior as described.
The apartment itself is not easy to locate within the building and we found it difficult to obtain precise details from Kimberly prior to our arrival. Although inside the premises is OK,we found the building entrance felt unsafe and the approach dirty and smelly - particularly the elevator at the weekend after the nightclub.,,,,
Unfortunately soundproofing within the apartment is poor and it was noisy each night - not just due to the nightclub (about which we had been warned) but also the trains,neighbours,street noise etc.  Additionally there is no covering to the glass blocks at the front (there are no true windows) and bright street lights outside.,,,
The kitchen and bathroom are modern and well appointed and the apartment feels spacious.  Fine if location is your main criterion.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
4190704,30542469,2015-04-24,24993332,James,"Well the pictures matched what you get so that very good & Kimberly was very helpful with the check in process. Also the location was great, right off the Common and a short walk to South Station which was perfect for the Airport."
One thing for future people to know would be the noises and if you're a light sleeper it might be a tough stay. You know there is a niteclub when booking but the music is loud enough that it feels like it's right in the room with you (lucky I was wrecked so was able to easily get back to sleep). The fridge freezer and air conditioning are very loud (I think I read about these going in as well). One thing I didn't know is there is a business in the room next door (Tailoring/Alterations) and with the very thin walls you can hear literally everything from him blaring music and talking from his early starts & late finishes (even on weekends).,,,,,
I was happy here overall though so if you're out for the weekend and aren't planning on sleeping in each morning then the noises shouldn't matter.,,,,,
Enjoy,"I did.\"",,,,
4190704,30682364,2015-04-26,13454990,Heather,"Studio was in a wonderful location, right downtown, and was decorated perfectly. We had a slight snafoo getting ahold of each other to exchange keys, but other than that our stay was nice."
4190704,31867525,2015-05-11,12379368,Bjarni,"It took a little time to get used to the house where the first floor are small restaurant that sell food out and elevator in the house is dirty. But the apartment is still nice and clean, as shown in the pictures on airbnb. The bathroom was very good. It is not possible to open the windows in the apartment. I was there for four days over the weekend there was no disturbance of the club below but on Saturday night there was a loud noise to at 2 am. Very good location."
4190704,32310385,2015-05-17,25281264,David,"The only positive feeling from our stay was check-in and out process.  Kimberly was very efficient at check-in and the owner’s son was really nice at checkout.  There are no windows; just glass blocks, in order to find out what to wear you have to go outside of the building and see what is the weather like.  The tailor next door is very loud and you can hear all his conversations and he whistles all day long.  The nightclub on the second floor (which operates on Saturday and Sunday) is a real nightmare.    It is not bearable from 9 PM through 2 AM.  The music was so loud from downstairs and because of that, entire apartment was shaking like in an earthquake (I am from California and I know what is that like), it was just unbearable.  The location is nice, but on the street you will find lots of homeless people who sleep outside, and you can hear their fights at nights.  There are some fast food businesses on the first floor and it smells really bad on the first floor and in the elevator."
4190704,33647848,2015-05-31,13858119,Catie,"Kim was very easy to communicate with. The apartment is exactly as pictured.  We stayed for a week, and anything we needed fixed or extra of, she provided.  Except the elevator which broke before we arrived, but it was a holiday weekend and of course it would be hard to find someone!"
The location is great,"but it is a bummer that there are no real window.    It never truly gets dark in the room.  This is a great short term place to stay at outside of Friday and Saturday night which is of course mentioned in the apartment description.\"",,,,
4190704,34118616,2015-06-05,6034382,Allison,"This was a great, convenient studio right in downtown crossing/park street in Boston.  The listing and the reviews describe the unit appropriately.  My stay was during the week - Wednesday and Thursday nights.  There is quite a bit of ambient noise during the day from 9am to 6pm from the building and the neighborhood.  I was still able to take several work calls in the evening while in the unit without any problem. Advice: bring earplugs if you are sensitive to noise when you sleep.  Also, bring an eyemask if you are sensitive to light in the mornings."
The kitchen is great as is the bathroom. The Wifi is also solid.  They were easy to meet to get into the building,"and they brought clean towels when I got there.  \"",,,,
4190704,34518373,2015-06-09,27387934,Jordanna,I echo what David in May 2015 said. We stayed over a weekend and earplugs were not enough to drown out the noise from the night club below.
The apartment was clean and exactly as was represented in the pictures.  Kimberly was helpful with the check in process and when our internet stopped working.,,,,,
Great location and certainly less expensive than any downtown hotels,"however the downstairs doors would not always lock and I wouldn't recommend walking in the area alone at night as a female.\"",,,,
4190704,34842468,2015-06-13,16524169,Wendy,"Kim contacted me a few days before our stay to let me know she would not be in Boston to meet us and gave me the details of the person who would meet us at the apartment.  Check in was very efficient and seamless and check out was the same.  The location is extremely central and close to everything.  A new supermarket Roche Bros. has opened up on the corner of Washington Street, with a great selection.  Yes, there was a lot of light in the room, yes it was a little noisy from the nightclub on Friday night, however Kim makes note of that in her description.  Her bed was clean and comfortable (a bit hard to make being up so close to the wall), her towels were lovely and soft, so if you don't mind light coming into the room and noise doesn't bother you, this is a great location.  The building property, especially the elevator could all do with a good clean, but that is probably out of Kim's control.  Thank you Kim"
4190704,36257482,2015-06-27,24833035,Stefan,Beschreibung der Unterkunft hat sehr gut gepasst. Die Lage ist mitten im Herzen von Bosten.
"#Umgebung",,,,,
Alle wichtigen Orten sind fußläufig gut erreichbar und Möglichkeiten zum Einkaufen von Lebensmitteln und Drogerie (Roche Bros + CVS) und Shoppen gibt es diverse.,,,,,
"#Internet",,,,,
Das WLAN ist leider etwas schwach auf der Brust. Ich schätze mal das es sich um eine 1000er Verbindung handelt. Egal in welchem Teil in der Wohnung ich mich aufgehalten habe,kam es gelegentlich zu aussetzern.  Reaktionszeit auf eine Suchanfrage bei (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) war dadurch schon auch mal im Bereich von 1-2 Minuten :(,,,,
Ich bin dann für wichtige Sachen oder zum surfen in einen der vielen Umgebenen Starbucks gegangen (Empfehlenswert in der Schoolstreet,da kann man sich gescheit hinsetzen),,,,
"#Ausstattung / Wohnung",,,,,
Die Küche ist relativ groß,allerdings nur mit dem nötigsten ausgestattet. Wer groß Kochen will,sollte sich spezielles Küchenwerkzeug organisieren oder mitbringen.,,,
Bett ist eine einzelne Matraze - Kingsize - hier sollte man sich darauf einstellen,dass man jede Bewegung des Partners in der Nacht spürt. :),,,,
Eine zweites Set an Kopfkissen/Decke waren ebenfalls im Schrank vorhanden. Bettwäsche war bezogen,hatten trotzdem eigene zur Vorsicht mit und diese auch genutzt.,,,,
Es sind KEINE Fenster vorhanden,somit kann man auch nicht direkt lüften. Einzige Lösung ist die sehr gut funktionierende Klimaanlage die im Winter wohl auch als Heizung dient. Ist zwar relativ laut,hatten damit aber keine Probleme.,,,
Apropo laut - wie in der Beschreibung steht finden Freitags und Samstags im Mojitos Partys statt (Musikrichtung Salsa/Latein). Die Musik läuft bis ca 2 Uhr Nachts und ist sehr gut zu hören und zu spüren. ;-),,,,,
"#Sauberkeit",,,,,
Die Wohnung war größtensteils sauber.,,,,,
"#Service",,,,,
Wir wurden stellvertretend sehr nett von Rami empfangen,der sich auch Zeit genommen hat um uns alle Fragen zu beantworten und draußen in der Straße die wichtigsten Orte zu zeigen oder den Weg zu erklären.,,,,
Außerdem wurden uns ebenfalls ein Bestand an Handtücher für die Zeit der Anwesenheit zur Verfügung gestellt.,,,,,
"#Fazit",,,,,
Unsere Erwartungen wurden erfüllt und die Location ist sehr gut um eine zentral Ausgangslage in Bosten zu haben.,,,,,
Als Gesamtnote würde ich 90% bewerten,da dass leider nicht geht,,,,
1 Stern Abzug.,,,,,
"Ich empfehle die Location auf jeden Fall weiter und würde selbst auch wieder kommen.\"",,,,,
4190704,37940047,2015-07-12,22655338,Michael,"Kimberly and I communicated via text message while we were on the train, and she met us at the address within 5 minutes of when we arrived. The building from the outside is kind of old, but so are 80% of the buildings in Boston. Once you take the elevator up to the apartment you will find yourself in a modern, clean and well equipped studio. My wife and I were seeing a concert at the Garden, so this was the perfect place for a 3-night vacation."
The kitchen has utensils,plates,mugs a coffee maker with coffee pods (a nice touch - not all apartments with a coffee maker actually include coffee). There is a beautiful Roche Bros. grocery store 1 block away with many prepared foods - we used the oven and microwave to heat up food and saved a lot on food vs.  restaurants. The bathroom was clean with nice quality towels,soap,shampoo and conditioner and a hair dryer.,
There is a closet with hangers,extra sheets and pillows for the sofa bed or for the regular bed. The bed is quite comfy as are the pillows. There is no dining table,so if you are eating you sit on the couch.,,,
There is not an actual window,but rather a wall of glass bricks which lets in plenty of daylight and some light at night also. Not a big deal - Boston is noisy so opening a window is not necessarily important.,,,,
There is a night club one floor below,and on Saturday night it is extremely loud. You should consider going to the club yourself or go to a late movie. The music stops at 2am. Not a deal breaker,because everything else is great,especially the location.,,
The apartment is steps away from a major hub of the T (subway lines) and a 2 minute walk gives you easy access to all of Boston. From the apartment to the Garden was a 5 min ride,and you can get anywhere else in about 5-10 min. A Charlie Card is $2.65 for one entry to the subway system,and you can add money as you need it.,,,
If you like to walk,then you will be in the center of everything - Freedom Trail,State House,burying grounds are close,Long Wharf,Aquarium
If you are driving,park your car at Riverside,Quincy or another station and take the T. Downtown parking is very expensive. If flying in,there is a water taxi from the airport,then a quick walk to the T,or Taxi/Uber.
Overall the location is great,"amenities are also excellent and cheaper than a downtown hotel.\"",,,,
4190704,38670698,2015-07-17,3893848,Scott,"Great stay at Kimberly's apartment.  Check in was a breeze and they were very accommodating.  The location is fantastic, right in the heart of Boston Common with easy access to everything.  Unit was as described in the listing and spartan but comfortable.  Would definitely recommend for both price and location."
4190704,38817146,2015-07-19,27134786,상윤,"Everything was great and as described and expected. We had a great time and enjoyable stay. However , It was very loud on Fri&Sat night."
4190704,39156285,2015-07-21,31370830,Matthew,"Location is unbeatable, just steps from the Common. The unit is bigger than a typical hotel room. There are some minor layout issues (no outlets or lamps near the bed) and we had intermittent wi-fi and there's no cable."
It wasn't perfectly clean,though the housekeeper had mixed up which unit we were in,so that may have been why.,,,
Entrance is through a small indoor market that smelled a little of grease. But if you can live with that for a cheap place in a great location,"it's a minor issue. \"",,,,
4190704,39594299,2015-07-25,26792119,Lionel,The location is really a strong advantage of the apartment – also considering the price compared to hotels in the surrounding area. The apartment was as described.
The bathroom wasn't perfectly clean but the bed was. Although we arrived quite late 6:30PM,the cleaning lady was still there and we felt that she had to run out of time.,,,,
We did not meet with Kimberly but with his fiancé who was really nice and explain us how to connect to Wi-Fi and how to manage the different keys for the building and the apartment.,,,,,
Wi-Fi is not always working properly as you have to connect to the one of the night club located one floor below.,,,,,
Easy check in and check out!,,,,,
The main drawback is not the noise – of course,it is not completely quiet but Kimberly warned us personally via text messages and also in her description – but the entrance of the building and the elevator. It really smells bad – we can even sometimes say that it reeks.,,,,
Fortunately no bad odor inside the apartment.,,,,,
If you are looking for an ideally located place to stay to visit Boston on foot,"Kimberly’s apartment is a good option.\"",,,,
4190704,42251121,2015-08-12,29810796,Caitlin,"You cannot get an apartment closer to the T or Boston Common. :) Yes, Friday and Saturday nights are ungodly loud. We planned on staying out late those nights to avoid the noise and I'm glad we did.  I am pretty sure that the Internet used for the apartment is that from the night club downstairs and we had no luck with it. Loved having HBO. The apartment itself is cozy, but could have used a better cleaning job before our arrival.  I would not stay here alone as a female if ever coming back late at night, as the location is a little odd. Reviewers who have said this place is too light at night or in the morning must be spoiled with blackout shades. We did not find the light a problem. Thank you Kimberly."
4190704,45458247,2015-09-03,24974299,Mike,"\"Wohnung ist genauso, wie es auf den Bildern aussieht, sogar noch etwas grösser. Saubere und zweckmässige Einrichtung. Im Eingang des Gebäudes befinden sich noch mehrere Take-Away-Läden und es sieht alles etwas schäbig aus. Ist man dann allerdings in der Wohnung, vergisst man dies schnell. Wände sind sehr hellhörig. Die Lage ist grossartig, sehr zentral gelegen, hervorragend! WLAN ist so gut wie gar nicht vorhanden, die Logindaten für das Netzwerk sind zwar verfügbar, aber es konnte keine Verbindung hergestellt werden. Zeitweise kein warmes Wasser in der Wohnung. Kimberly lotste uns telefonisch zur Wohnung. Sie vermietet wohl noch andere Wohnungen und wirkte nicht wirklich gut organisiert. So erhielt ich nach der Abreise - ein eigentliches Check-Out gab es nicht - eine Reihe von SMS und Anrufen, dass wir doch hätten abreisen müssen und sie nun unser Gepäck wegwerfen werde. Es stellte sich dann heraus, dass sie wohl die Wohnung verwechselt hatte. Eine Entschuldigung, abgesehen von einem \"\"Sorry\"\" gab es nicht. FAZIT: Eine bessere Lage bekommt man für diesen Preis wohl nicht. Zum Übernachten ok"
4190704,47340881,2015-09-18,9017276,Sandra,"\"The location is good but the apartment is in a derelict building and surrounded by derelict people. The smell on the ground floor is unbearable and I saw RATS scurrying around. We were continually accosted by homeless/drug-affected people. The apartment was not clean. The shower floor had \"\"person debris\"\" on it and is moldy. The kitchen bench was greasy and there is dust/grime in corners. The towel rack fell apart when touched. There are power points that are not fitted securely to walls.\""
4190704,48377894,2015-09-26,18686396,Derek,"Kimberly was very helpful and the location was absolutely perfect. Saturday nights are LOUD due to the club a few floors below (but we were forewarned). Bring ear plugs for Saturdays. The building itself isn't the cleanest, but the location more than makes up for it. The apartment is small as advertised, but it is a perfect studio for a couple."
4190704,49206820,2015-10-02,26475843,Iuval,Hello.
Nice apartment and the most important thing is location,location,location.,,,
The apartment clean and fun to be there.,,,,,

4190704,49431009,2015-10-04,4754687,Michael,"Was a great location, very central. I never felt unsafe in the neighborhood.  Getting into the apartment is a little unique, but I never had a problem.  Apartment is cute and the perfect place to rest your head when visiting Boston."
"Kimberly and her landlord were easy to work with and the check-in / check-out was very streamlined. \"",,,,,
4190704,51612127,2015-10-22,38097425,Sonia,"perfect location, perfect size. it is a strange building, that being said i never felt unsafe."
4190704,51934385,2015-10-25,43712306,Mollie,"We loved the location and the apartment looked exactly like the photos. The owner met us to give us the keys. He was very nice, and was available to meet right when we arrived. It does get very loud on Saturday night, but if you are staying out until 2, it will be over by the time you get home. Overall great experience!"
4190704,52394607,2015-10-29,2612008,Laura & Rolo,"Photographs of apartment are accurate. It was clean for us and plenty spacious for a studio. From description and prior reviews,  I was prepared for noisy Fri-Sun nights. The apartment is on the third floor of a building that is a run-down mini mall with food stands and you walk through it to get to the elevator/stairs. If the basement club is open, you also walk through the bouncers and club goers entering the building. The location is great-- across the street from the Boston Commons, close to the Freedom trail, Beacon Hill, North End, etc. Particularly if arriving by car, be aware that the building is located on a pedestrian street so you will not be able to pull up. There are garages within a few block radius (~$40/day) versus Chinatown garages (~$25/day). We would return to this studio when in Boston again."
4190704,64809348,2016-03-08,55946057,Juan,"It was an spectacular experience, excellent service and customer care, one of the most satisfying experiences with air Bnb, great location and the host very considerate with the special needs."
"Very very pleased with our trip\"",,,,,
4190704,65369026,2016-03-13,40656772,Ashley,"The apartment was in a great location!!! Right across the street from Boston Common and Massachusetts State House. There's lots of great things to do within walking distance and public transit is easily accessible. The club below can be heard at night but isn't outrageously loud. However, there is a tailor shop right next door where you can hear 2 men talking loudly starting around 8-9am. As for our host, Rebecca really cared about us and our experience. She insured the place was ready for us even though there was a miscommunication with her cleaning service. Rebecca came in and did all the cleaning herself and made sure we had everything we needed. Overall the place was great for the weekend and is just as described and pictured."
4190704,66400699,2016-03-22,10131922,Samantha,"We did not meet Rebecca, but she gave excellent instructions on how to retrieve the keys and get into the apartment. The apartment is exactly as pictured, with the exception of a pull out couch instead of the sectional pictured. The space is very cozy and has extra towels, blankets, blow dryer, etc. Everything we needed."
The entrance to the apartment is tucked away in a food court right in downtown Boston. It is on the third floor next to a fairly noisy tailor. There is also a Latin club in the basement of this building that blasts music on Friday & Saturday nights. We didn't mind the noise as we were out most of the day and checked out the Latin club ourselves in the evening,but this would not be a good place for a quiet weekend or traveling with a baby. The location was absolutely perfect,"central to everything and adjacent to a subway station. We would certainly stay here again if we return to Boston. \"",,,
4190704,68293426,2016-04-04,10073377,Ilya,"Rebecca was very responsive, so communication wasn't an issue at all. We were able to into the apartment on our own."
The place itself is located smack right in Downtown Crossing,which is as central as you can possibly be in Boston. It offers great access to all but Blue Line trains and you can walk from there to many places to eat and whatnot. Being central,though,it's also not the quietest place; it's located above a night club and Friday through Sunday you'll be hearing loud music and drunk people until about 2AM in the morning. The area can get kinda shady as it gets late but during the day it's great.,,
The apartment itself is small but nice enough. It has a TV with Apple TV so you get Netflix and other stuff. We visited during the winter and we had some issues with heat (it wasn't working) but Rebecca provided us with a space heater.,,,,,
Overall,"a good place.\"",,,,
4190704,69209851,2016-04-10,38860800,Eion,"Rebecca allowed me to check in early and was very helpful throughout the process. When the keys didn't work to get into the building (it locks at night), she drove a good bit out of her way (at nearly midnight, no less) to come unlock it for me. The space was lovely and a perfect fit for a weekend stay in Boston."
4190704,70664956,2016-04-19,44442662,Flavia,"We came into town for the Boston Marathon. Rebecca was very easy to get a hold of the entire stay. She gave great directions on how to get into the building. The studio was perfect size for 2 people. It looks exactly like in the pictures and everything inside was clean. Best of all - It was literally across the street from where the buses picked runners up on Marathon Monday to drive them to the starting line, so I didn't have to stress out about logistics to get on a bus in time and was able to sleep in till about 6am to catch a bus for Wave 1 runners. The nightclub in the basement was bumping on Friday and Saturday night, but we were out till about 1:30am both nights so it was done by the time we got ready for bed. The entryway to get into the building stairwell is a little sketchy looking, but we had no issues and the business owners pretty much know why you're there so they don't say much. The elevator was out of service when we stayed there - it was about 3 flights of stairs to the studio. I live in a 3 story condo so it wasn't an issue for us. I will say that walking down them after running 26.2 miles was not the highlight of my day, but I got through it! Lol! All in all, we had a good experience. I would stay here again next time I run the marathon."
4190704,72862215,2016-05-05,11100934,Eugénie,The flat was clean and Rebecca provided precise and correct information. It was really helpfull. The flat was a little bit noisy with the subway and neigborhood.
4190704,73254417,2016-05-07,17391642,Robert,Awesome place in the center of Boston! Would definitely come back :-)
4190704,73836634,2016-05-10,51841432,Paula,"El departamento estaba muy bien ubicado, limpio , bien equipado, tal cual lo que vimos en las fotos."
Lo único inesperado fue que el ascensor no funcionaba y está en un tercer piso.,,,,,
Por otro lado la entrada al edificio honestamente no es linda,la primera impresión no fue para nada agradable pero nos dimos cuenta q era una galería tranquila.,,,,

4190704,74487319,2016-05-15,21326118,Stephanie,"The location of the apartment is great and close to the T. Overall, the experience was great. It does get a bit loud with the club but it wasn't too loud since the club is in the basement and the apartment is on the third floor. I really enjoyed my stay"
4190704,74932209,2016-05-17,18512051,Siran,"Rebecca's place was in a very good location. Very close to metro stations, shops, South Station, and restaurants. The hallway was kinda smelly, but it could be due to the undergoing construction of the building. The apartment had a queen size bed, as well as a sofa bed. It has everything as described. Rebecca was very responsive; the Wi-Fi connection was not successful at first, and she came to the apartment in late evening to fix the problem. I recommend it to anyone who wants to have a short stay in Boston!"
4190704,75268635,2016-05-20,52561998,Aasri,"The location of this Air BnB is great, right across the street from Boston Common and within walking distance of plenty of places you would want to go. Despite the convenience, the apartment building was a little sketchy but I never felt unsafe in the location. It is located within a building with a night club in the basement and few businesses on the bottom floor. The door to the stairwell is locked with a key code. The stairwell smelled pretty strong of urine and was a walk up to the third floor. The apartment was next to a tailor who talks pretty loud and whistles while he works, the walls are pretty thin. The apartment was decent but I felt like it could've been cleaned a little bit better. The floors are wooden and appear to have molded. The rugs were a little dirty and while the television has Direct TV it did not work during my stay. It was livable for the three nights and the location was worth it."
4190704,76437879,2016-05-27,57465698,Giselle,"Perfect place to stay! Right in the middle of everything. Boston Commons Park and Boston Public Gardens is across the street, you can walk to the Cheers bar, and there are plenty of restaurants and stores around. Studio was bigger than expected, very clean and set up perfectly. Rebecca was a great host, she even came over to say hello to us."
4190704,77573456,2016-06-01,13444622,Kim,"We've stayed at Rebecca's apartment for three nights and if you've never been in Boston before, this place is perfect. Many cool things are in walking distance, for anything else there's two T stations right around the corner."
Unfortunately the elevator was broken so we had to walk to the 3rd floor and to be honest,the staircase is a little shady.,,,,
The apartment itself is mostly clean,if you're sentitive with hygiene,you'll be a little freaked out by the mold in the shower. But don't worry,it's not too bad.,,
Although we knew before arrival,it sucked to not have a proper window because you'd have to go downstairs to see what the weather's like.,,,,
Also,the wifi doesn't properly work - I couldn't even watch Netflix on my iPad even with having every other device on airplane mode.,,,,
Communication with Rebecca was very easy,she always responded pretty fast.,,,,

Rebecca is very precise and keen to help.  music during friday and Saturday evening was not insanely loud, but still a bit annoying when you want to catch some sleep. Building a bit old, elevator not working."
4190704,78685202,2016-06-08,20510791,Pablo,"El departamento está muy bien ubicado, es lindo y está bien equipado, el único problema es que la entrada al edificio no es muy bonita. Rebeca nos atendió muy bien y respondió siempre muy rápido. Realmente es un lugar muy recomendable para alojarse en Boston."
4190704,80655888,2016-06-19,30293918,Altera,"Rebecca's place was perfect for our short stay in Boston! The check in was easy even as our bus was delayed an hour. The location was perfect, right in the center of Boston we didn't need any public transport. The apartment was very large and looked just like the pictures. It was clean and comfortable with a fully stocked kitchen. We were there for Friday and Saturday night when the downstairs club was open and the music was loud but we were forewarned by Rebecca in the description so we weren't surprised. Overall a great place and would highly recommend."
4190704,81399028,2016-06-22,34444204,Jennifer,"Loved staying here! Like other reviews have said, the building and stairs are a little sketchy but the apartment was nice and clean and we never felt unsafe in it. You could hear the subway go by, but at night we turned the fan on and weren't bothered by it at all. we stayed during the week and didn't have any noise from the club like some people did on the weekend. we got back late one night and the lock on the building door was sticking but I was able to get ahold of Rebecca and she walked us through getting back in. This place is right in the middle of everything and was exactly what we were looking for for a couple nights. I would stay here again in a heartbeat"
4190704,81704488,2016-06-24,11307454,Jeni,Rebecca was a great host.  She was very communicative and available for questions.  She was also accommodating to our check-in and check-out requests.  The apt was perfectly located and very clean.
4190704,84120313,2016-07-05,45946531,Patrick,"I felt very welcome. The Airbnb was very close to what was described. I had no problems with the instructions to get into the apartment. The neighborhood is ideal for any of the typical tourist attractions in Boston. Less than a 5 minute walk from the Freedom Trail. There is a night club in the basement as many have noted, but it really didn't bother me at all. The entry to the apartment feels a little questionable the first time you enter the building but it really isn't a big deal at all."
4190704,84853694,2016-07-09,2544523,Rebecca,"Very questionable, smelly and sketchy entry to the commercial building including stairway to the 3rd floor (elevator not working). We (two females) were not expecting it to be that questionable and we felt on guard the whole time. If we were solo on this trip, this is not a place to stay as a single female. The inside of the apartment was as advertised , clean and really in the central to all downtown attractions. Rebecca was very helpful with questions/communications. Highly doubtful I would stay here again unless the entry has a complete makeover."
4190704,85521334,2016-07-11,55357343,Caitlyn,"Description explains everything, location is perfect, close to any transport, shopping and food court straight out the door. The night club is now closed so it was great. We arrived early and she allowed us to access the room as soon as the others left (wasn't going to be cleaned then of course but it was great to drop off our bags) the main door is a little hard to use and it's annoying with no lift but it was explained before it and it's the building not her issue. There aren't any Windows so it's hard to tell what the weather is like. Overall would definitely recommend"
4190704,86016386,2016-07-14,74495355,Mazen,She was flexible on the check in time and very welcoming when she met me to hand off the key.

Some drawbacks: the entrance to the building has a quite peculiar appearance and there have been people loitering around,"you could also hear the metro and noise from the street which is difficult to avoid in a city center. \"",,,,
4190704,94962086,2016-08-17,7667602,Chabernaud,Parfaitement localisé pour une visite de la ville à pied. Appartement calme en raison des travaux en cours dans le bar en dessous. Il dispose de suffisamment de choses pour pouvoir se préparer à manger et parfois c'est bien agréable après une journée de visite.
4190704,95647598,2016-08-20,11345597,Nancy,The proximity to subway and Boston Commons can't be improved on. The apt is very clean and well furnished with a very comfortable bed and great shower. The entry to the building and ground floor are very sketchy...the 3 story staircase was steep and requires some stamina..

This place is worth it if you are by yourself and on a tight budget, it is definitely livable, although not ideal if you are going to Boston most days. The location can be noisy at night, there's nowhere to eat within walking distance besides a McDonalds and the bed takes up most space in the bedroom."

Además nos asesoraron muy bien como movernos en EEUU y sacarle el máximo provecho a nuestro viaje. La ubicación es estratégica porque el barrio es tranquilo, tiene de todo. todo es mas económico que en el centro y tomado el metro que esta a dos cuadras viajas a cualquier sitio , tiene la comisaria enfrente para que te sientas seguro y el aeropuerto a un paso. Para mi sin dudas el mejor lugar de Boston."

Just a note that it's a 'smoking allowed' apartment. Even though this is listed we missed it, and our coats/pajamas smelled like smoke for a bit afterward. Overall good airbnb experience. We were even allowed to stay way past check-out time due to our flight out being quite late which was fantastic. Thanks!"

So nice. And the apartment is absolutely gorgeous. It's located in a spectacular part of Beacon Hill which is just a jaw-droppingly beautiful. The apartment is spacious and clean and has stunning detailing. It's extremely comfortable and lovely. However, the place wouldn't be the same without it's primary tenants, Remus and Romulus (the two cats). They are the funniest and sweetest duo. I will miss them!

The two nice old cats are quite friendly,and scooping their poo everyday is not a problem,the house being well organized in that matter. The peeing is a bit more difficult to be ignored,with a strong smell in the bathroom,whose door has to be kept open,for the cats. (I do solve this in my home by having the cat's litter box on the terrace).
Communication was easy with the owners,although they were both out of town,and we were welcomed by a gentle neighbor.,,,
As requested,we sent regularly pictures of the cats: maybe due to the heat,"it seems that a Bostonian cat's best position is lying on the back!\"",,,
1303261,19035103,2014-09-05,17677995,Danny,"We had the best time in Larry's apt,"
The neighbourhood is the best location in the city. Cedar St is a quite street that is very close to the main street of neighbourhood (Charles St) and to the nearest Starbucks.,,,,,
The apt is very spacious and clean. But best thing about it are the cats! Romulus is smart and is actually in charge,and Remus is his sweet sidekick. Both of them really changed our experience for the better,and they made us smile every time we came in.,,,

1303261,19416548,2014-09-12,19288809,Philip,I really enjoyed my stay with Larry and the cats in beautiful Boston. The accommodation was first class and I was made to feel completely at home.  The place was clean and smelled great.  I had a fantastic time there and highly recommend Larry as a great host. Don't hesitate to stay here.
1303261,32196676,2015-05-15,1521958,Taryn,"Our stay in Beacon Hill was fabulous! The apartment was really cool and a perfect location. The best part was definitely Remus. He was so cute and loving. Also, the neighbors were very friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend for a business trip or vacation. Thanks!"
1303261,32768416,2015-05-21,31101406,Mary,"The Charles Street flat was the perfect place to stay during our visit to Boston.  The ambiance of Beacon Hill is just what I wanted! The shuttered, brick, row houses displaying window boxes of flowers, the hilly, narrow streets, and gas-lit brick walks brought me back to a time of gracious living in a century past."
Inside,the second floor home was clean and uncluttered.  There are beautiful,intricate,plaster crown moldings and hard wood floors.  The bed was comfy and the shower had plenty of hot water and water pressure.  Having a washer and dryer in the basement was of great benefit,as it allowed us to wash some clothes before going on to our next destination.,
Remus is a friendly,well-behaved,considerate cat,and we enjoyed his company.  Larry is a gracious and caring host and the neighbors made us feel so welcomed!  The location,near Boston Common,is so central you may walk to many places about town
Thanks for the hospitality,"Larry!  \"",,,,
1303261,33181955,2015-05-25,7194895,Doug,"Just there for 2 nights but lovely neighborhood, nice place. Could use another chair or loveseat in the living room to make it more comfy."
1303261,33692999,2015-05-31,32026820,John,"Larry David was away when we arrived, as expected, but had had kindly arranged for a neighbour to give us the keys and show us around.  Both were VERY kind in answering questions and getting things organised for us, well above and beyond the simple minimum one would expect."
The apartment was just as it was described and the neighbourhood was lovely.  Centrally located a stone's throw from Acorn Street (the most photographed street in Boston),excellent for getting to all points in the city,but a decidedly charming residential area with few tourists.  One could feel like a local wandering beautiful Beacon Hill,dining and shopping down on Charles Street,Jogging along the Charles River and taking in the sun on the docks there.,
However,we also had a reception hosted by French embassy at the Massachusetts State House and walked along the Freedom Trail from Boston Common like good tourists; both of these attractions are less than five minutes away.  Further away,research at the lovely Boston Public Library is a relaxing walk across the park and past the swan boats,"and the \"\"T\"\" up to MIT and Harvard in Cambridge or down to South Station in town are also direct on the Red Line",so no changes and a quick commute!,
Overall,a wonderful visit.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1303261,34327147,2015-06-07,33226370,Bill,The place was perfect for singles or a couple.  The apartment was easy to find.  We arrived at night and the light bulbs in the up stair hallway were burned out but by the second night someone had replaced the bulbs which made it much easier to unlock the door.
Since we got in late the first night and really didn't get a chance to checkout the neighborhood for coffee shops,we wish there was a coffee machine with coffee to get us through the first morning.,,,,
The apartment is very clean with nice decor. The cat was very friendly and was very easy to take care of.  The location was great,just a short walk to Charles street,the common and public garden,subway.  Wish we had access to the patio so we could relax with a nice cup of coffee or glass a wine.,,
"We had a great time at The Sevens Ale House watching the Cavs game and we ate breakfast at Panificio Bistro & Bakery which were both on Charles St around the corner.\"",,,,,
1303261,46625406,2015-09-12,11635226,Erin,Do not stay here. The apartment is in a nice area and is within walking distance to bars and restaurants. And the the check-in was smooth. But overall the owner and the owner’s cat made our stay very unpleasant.
The owner seemed nice enough at first but he turned overbearing and patronizing. He texted us multiple times during our stay reminding us to follow the “House Rules.” (He always capitalized House Rules as if they were scripture.) He expected us to do the laundry,make the beds,and clean the entire place for his next guests. This,despite charging us a cleaning fee. Two weeks after our departure,the owner returned from overseas and started badgering us via email about leaving the place dirty. (His evidence was a curtain on the ground,glasses in the sink and cat litter strewn about – none of which seems like that big of a deal anyway.) Another guest came in the same day that we left and stayed for several days after us
Then there was the cat,Remus. He was a very sweet cat,and we loved him. He slept in our bed at night. But he also made our stay very difficult. Despite cleaning the litter box multiple times a day,Remus routinely pooped in the bathtub,not the litter box. Every day,we had to scoop his “present” from the tub before showering. And he meowed constantly at night
Again,the location was great,and the owner seems like an otherwise nice guy,but this was not worth having to deal with all the crap. (Quite literally,"in many instances.)\"",
1303261,87693911,2016-07-21,3187118,Jon,"I've never used Airbnb before, but Boston was completely sold out of hotel rooms so I gave it a shot.  Had a great experience with both the space and the host.  Larry met me in person at around 11pm to check me in and gave me a tour and all of the particulars.  It is a beautiful apartment in one of the best locations in Boston."
Remus,Larry's cat - does require some love and care - but he is a great cat,and surprisingly friendly to strangers.,,,
Street parking is impossible,but there is a garage a couple of blocks away on Charles Street so that was easy also.,,,,
"Overall - a great experience and really helped me out in a pinch!\"",,,,,
9256035,55771262,2015-12-05,4174462,Naomi,"Had a wonderful experience at Todd's place.  The apartment is newly renovated in a light, modern, minimalistic style.  Kitchen is fully stocked, down to the wine glasses.  Todd was very hospitable and respectful, and a complete pleasure to work with.  It was an awesome experience and I would come again!"
9256035,56218796,2015-12-10,5731959,Shahab,"Place looked exactly like the pictures, in a safe and quiet area, and was clean and welcoming. Todd was not present, which was fine by me as the key pickup process was easy and pain free. He let me know if another guest was staying at his place (there are three bedrooms he rents out there, each with locks). The only thing that could have been a bit better was perhaps leaving the heater on the day of check in as it was rather cold :-). But really, this isn't an issue, just a suggestion. Overall, a very pleasant experience, and I would not hesitate recommending him to"
9256035,56754486,2015-12-17,47228150,Mo,"Todd was easily accessible via phone and email however I never got to meet him though I was there for almost 1 week. I'm not sure if I would classify him as a host, rather more of a landlord."
The description was not very accurate. There was mention of TV in the common area and a washer and dryer,none of which were there. There was also mention of a common area which was just the eat in kitchen.,,,,
The location is great. There is a convenient grocery store nearby and easy access with Uber but other transit takes a while. So if you are looking to stay there,accessibility to the rest of Boston is great but a taxi or a car us your best bet.,,,,

5601743,45573884,2015-09-04,39184077,Emily,"To be very honest, I hoped not to leave a negative review but the actions of the hosts have led me no choice but to do so."
First of all- I originally booked a stay from 8/4-9/4 but the host did not want to change the stay so I had no choice but to settle for a 8/3-9/3 stay.,,,,,
The hosts were pretty nice so I didn't want to leave such a review. But the stay was very uncomfortable.,,,,,
The house is extremely dirty and the conditions of the room were horrible. Yes there was a bed and a table and a chair,but it looked like it hadn't been cleaned since the last decade.,,,,
Dust was EVERYWHERE to the point where you smelt dust when you were sleeping. The carpet was dirty and the floor was unclean. I'm not sure why they bother asking for a $50 cleaning fee when it doesn't look like anyone cleans it.,,,,,
Aside from this,the bathroom is indescribable. Its a TINY bathroom that around 6 people share- more if you include guests who sometimes come really late at night and can get REALLY disruptive and LOUD,,,,
Also,"I know it mentions \"\"free breakfast\"\" but don't expect anything. There will be no free breakfast or anything. No one is going to cook for you or provide the materials to cook such \"\"complimentary breakfast\"\"",,,,
But that isn't even the issue. I'm already spending $1,500 to stay here I'm not going to complain about a $2 breakfast.,,,,
The most despicable aspect was when I asked them to change the move out date.,,,,,
"If you're going to follow a \"\"flexible\"\" policy then follow it.",,,,,
If you're going to promise one thing,follow it. Don't say one thing and do another.,,,,
"I asked the hosts before I requested an alteration if \"\"I could request an earlier move out date\"\"",,,,,
"If they said \"\"no\"\"",I would've accepted even if it meant losing around $250,,,,
HOWEVER,they said sure we will adjust the stay and refund you the nights you didn't stay. So I went ahead and adjusted- and no reply. I asked them again in person AGAIN,"and they said \"\"We have to talk it over and adjust it","no problem\"\"",,
So I waited,until its already 9/3. Its been OVER 10+ days and they have been COMPLETELY UNRESPONSIVE AND IRRESPONSIBLE.,,,,
So I contacted airbnb and basically FORCED the hosts to reply in which they rejected my request.,,,,,
?? excuse me,if you were going to reject it why tell me you would refund my nights?,,,,
Now its almost 1 MONTH after and they are still not responsive. I have called airbnb and filed an official complaint against them- including opening a case for them to return my money.,,,,,
Whether my money is returned or not,I just want to warn everyone that:,,,,
1.) not a healthy,or clean environment to stay in,,,,
2.) don't stay here if you don't want to deal with irresponsible,frustrating people,,,,

Thanks again for your great hospitality,and that we had the chance to come so spontaneous! The guestroom was big enough,clean and the bed very comfy :) It was just a little unusual for us,that we only got a key for the frontdoor,but not for our room. Anyway we didn't worry about it,and there was nothing to worry about!
We could use the kitchen,which was great to have a small breakfast before we went downtown every day. The bathroom was very small and not as clean as at home ..... but everything was working and the water was hot enough and the water pressure perfekt ;-),,,,
We liked the neighbourhood. A very nice cafe,some pubs and bars not far to walk and the Samuel Adams Brewery right around the corner ;)) Only 5-7 minutes walk to the Train station Green Street,and 20 minutes ride to downtown.,,,
We had a really good time and would recommand this place to anybody!,,,,,

12269155,79593745,2016-06-13,26215883,Emily,"This apartment was absolutely perfect! Great location, super clean and Richard was more than helpful. We couldn't have been happier for our stay in Boston! Thank you Richard!"
12269155,80034375,2016-06-15,31414801,Timothy,"Richard was very helpful in making arrangements and the apartment was the perfect location in Boston's historic North End...blocks from the Old North Church.  And you'll need the fourth floor walk-up from eating goodies (cannoli) at Mike's Pastry, which is just a quick walk away."
12269155,80800029,2016-06-19,67378841,Berry,"perfect apt in the perfect location !!!! close to everything from north end to the harbor to the T......clean,comfortable and more space than a hotel room.....host was great & very helpful........we will be back !"
12269155,81296588,2016-06-22,59987483,Chelsea,"Richard's North End apartment in Boston was perfect for our two-night  stay. It is close to the T (if you want to make a trip to Fenway) and within walking distance of so many other great Boston attractions. The apartment was clean, cozy, and comfortable. Richard did a great job of making us feel welcome, including dragging my 45 lb. suitcase up quite a few flights of stairs. He had cold water in his fridge for us and coffee for my caffeine loving husband. We enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it."
12269155,81445628,2016-06-23,1237291,Jo,"Richard was a great host - made accommodations for my schedule, punctual. The apartment is in a fabulous location, in the North End and close/walking distance to everything downtown, multiple T stops close by. It was cozy and comfortable."
12269155,81820684,2016-06-25,48164444,Daniel,Richard was a great host and made sure we had a great time in Boston. The apartment is right off the Freedom Trail on the Northend and everything is easily accessible. Great restaurants and bars that are within walking distance and the subway is right across the street.
12269155,82296024,2016-06-27,38837341,Patrick,"I stayed at Richard's place over the weekend and had a great experience. This was actually the first time we used Airbnb and now certainly wont be the last. I was not able to meet up with Richard but he was accessible via phone. The place was clean, organized, and comfortable. It was within a few min walking distance of Hanover st. which had plenty of restaurant options. I would certainly stay here again."
12269155,82629641,2016-06-28,56657556,Brenda,"Even though we did not get the opportunity to meet Richard, he called to give us entry instructions, information about parking, and to discuss any questions we had. The apartment was exactly as described, very clean and had everything we needed. Richard supplied water, towels, and additional toiletries if needed."
The north end neighborhood is fantastic with many restaurants,boutiques and historical sites within walking distance of the apartment. Truly a great location! If you want to venture other neighborhoods,public transportation (The T) is close by.,,,
Overall,"we absolutely loved the apartment and everything about the North End! We will be back!\"",,,,
12269155,82910458,2016-06-30,79735778,Debora,"This is located in a great location within easy walking distance to the waterfront, the T, restaurants, shops, etc.  We did not have a car on this trip and had no problem getting around.  The apartment is very comfortable, clean and pretty much what the photos depict."

12269155,83092359,2016-07-01,38070879,Todd,"Clean and comfortable and a great location---Paul Revere, Chicken Parm and a stone's throw from the Haymarket T station.  Richard was friendly and accommodating and and his place has some nice amenities/personal touches.  Thanks!"
12269155,83376735,2016-07-02,22245577,Val,"Richard was very warm, welcoming and helpful with recommendations for things to do in the neighborhood.  He was very flexible about logistics; e.g. allowing me to leave my luggage and drop off the keys later.  The apartment was nicely appointed, clean and comfortable - I really appreciated having the A/C and the ceiling fan in the bedroom.  Mainly, you just can't beat this location - the neighborhood is wonderful  - surrounded by amazing restaurants and all the great Freedom Trail stuff."
The only tricky bit about this property is the walk up the three flights of small,"twisty stairs with your luggage - it will get your heart rate up!\"",,,,
12269155,83668610,2016-07-03,77152215,Lesley,"Great location!  Host was great at answering all my questions.  Close to the T station and loved being in the North End of Boston.  Apartment is nicely furnished and clean.  Only potential issue, the stairs are steep and narrow to the apartment.  Not a problem for us...but might be for others.  Wish we could've stayed longer!!!  Thanks Richard we had a wonderful time!"
12269155,84170145,2016-07-05,5468491,Spencer,"Richard was fast to respond, accommodating,  and the unit was great.  I would recommend staying with him if you're looking in Boston."

The place was clean and pleasant with traffic sounds that you would expect from city living.  Richard was kind, attentive and helpful with any of our questions or requests.  It's also just minutes from the airport."
"Thanks Richard.\"",,,,,
12269155,89150129,2016-07-27,26802541,Janet,"We loved staying at Richard's charming and comfortable apartment!  Richard was very responsive at every stage, and made sure that we got settled comfortably. He also provided towels and had toiletries and bottled water available.  The location of the apartment was ideal and we loved exploring the north end and the waterfront. Travelers should be aware that there are some steep stairs that were a workout for us with a baby and all the gear, but they shouldn't be a deterrent.  We will definitely be back to this lovely location next time we are in Boston!"
12269155,89538259,2016-07-29,77955240,Heather,Richard was a great host and had everything we needed! The apartment was in a perfect location and he was easy to get ahold of with directions on how to get to the apartment and get the keys. We had a great experience and would definitely recommend this place to others!
12269155,89951949,2016-07-30,1691351,Mary,"We loved this apartment. Richard was extremely communicative ahead of time, helpful about checking in, and provided a quick turnover time between guests so the place was ready right on time. The apartment location was just off a main road, so was a bit noisy, but overall was a fantastic experience. He was very knowledgeable about the city!"
12269155,91246749,2016-08-04,18598789,Patty,Richard was fantastic as our host - place was perfect in every way for our visit.   Loved the location easily accessable to subways. Loved staying in the North End and highly recommend this place.  Would stay there again - thanks Richard
12269155,92329197,2016-08-08,7304429,Karen,"Richard was totally accommodating and great to works with,"
12269155,92859738,2016-08-10,8748484,Janna,"Richard was really  fantastic in regard to communication and made it very easy for us to access the apartment, as well as allowed us to store our bags in the building on the day of departure so we could explore Boston without hauling our luggage. The flat is clean and very comfortable with one AC unit in the bedroom and 3 ceiling fans, so on a hot day it cooled down nicely. The location is perfect for exploring the North End and easy access to the rest of Boston, particularly the Freedom Trail and Harbor Walk. The only thing to pay attention to is the narrow steps leading up to the 3rd floor apartment can be difficult with a large bag."
12269155,93949959,2016-08-14,74237596,Karen,"Richard was a fabulous host. His apartment is homey and relaxing and best of all, very clean! Comfy bed, comfy furniture, well appointed kitchen and bath, lots of towels, two big screen TVs...we couldn't have asked for anything more."
And Richard is just a nice guy. Friendly,helpful,welcoming,flexible about our arrival and departure--the kind of host that makes Airbnb a great experience.,,
The proudly Italian neighborhood is charming--lots of family-owned restaurants and shops. Mangia Mangia,a small diner,was great for breakfast,and Benevento's served one of the best pizzas we've ever had. The apartment is within easy walking distance of the Freedom Trail,which we walked and really enjoyed.,
There are only two possible negatives--and they don't reflect on Richard at all. 1) The apartment is near a busy street,and there was a little traffic noise that might bother a light sleeper.  2) This is a walk-up with a narrow,winding staircase. That might be a problem if you have bad knees or small children. This is the nature of every building in the neighborhood,though,and much of historic Boston--lots of steps!,
We absolutely would recommend Richard and his apartment and would love to stay there should we be able to visit Boston again.,,,,,
Thanks for a great stay,Richard!,,,,

The apartment is located in Boston's north end with parking available nearby, close to restaurants as well as the many sights and sounds of the neighborhood.

The listing is totally accurate and Richard was very kind and attentive. We would recommend this to any couple/small group looking for a great home base while exploring Boston. Our flight wasn't until 9pm and Richard let us check out as late as possible before he had to prepare the apartment for the next guests. We were able to leave our bags in the apartment building while we out and about before our flight which was perfect! Thanks, Richard!"

1887507,10109933,2014-01-31,11708735,Denis,Polina was a great host i didnt arrive until a little before 9pm and that wasnt a problem.  Arrived a little stressed as i had no clue where to park. She gave me good advice on where to park for free. Most appreciated as you could imagine in Boston. She showed me my room and around the apartment. I had a nice towel with a candy on it on my bed. A nice touch.
She and her friend were very friendly,and i enjoyed their company.  We spoke for awhile before i went out to some great restaurants that she was kind enough to reccomend. The bed was comfortable and the apartment was clean. It was my first Airbnb experience. I hope my future stays through Airbnb will be as nice as my first. I highly recommend staying with Polina and plan on returning myself. On second thought,"maybe i should have said it sucked and kept  this gem to myself. HAHA\"",,,
1887507,10222329,2014-02-07,11690935,Tanya,Me and my friend stayed at Polina's place for 3 nights. She was extremely nice and friendly host and we will definitely stay with her again! I highly recommend her apartment as it is very cosy and it has great location!

I really got to experience Boston living in a locals home instead of a hotel.,,,,,
The place was simple,clean,and near everything (restaurants,cabs,the waterfront,etc)

1887507,10779953,2014-03-07,4598919,Patrick,"Polina and her housemate were wonderful hosts for our trip to Boston.  The house was clean and very well located for our conference at the Seaport World Trade Center and tour of the Isabella Stewart Gardener Museum.  Their willingness to share great restaurants, easy ways to get around, and even the little chocolates they left for us, made it seem fancy, yet, friendly and comfortable.  I would highly recommend them, and their place, for its cozy comfort and, convenience to the airport, convention centers, and being able to get the true feeling of Boston.  Thanks again Polina!"
1887507,10914183,2014-03-12,11649711,Sergey,"Всё просто замечательно. Пять минут до метро, очень хорошие хозяева. Ы общем мне всё очень понравилось"
1887507,11102161,2014-03-20,4377678,Giri,Unfortunately due to personal reasons i missed the opportunity to stay at  her apartment and had to travel to Detroit. From the very beginning Polina was very friendly and guided well in her communications. I did stay at Boston Renaissance hotel and found that Polina's apartment in centrally located and near to down town. I will try on my next visit.
1887507,11143095,2014-03-22,5317332,Jen,We came in town for a few days filled with meetings and this location was less than a mile from the office. Polina's place is just as the pictures show; clean and simple! The bedroom worked well for 2. One bathroom wasn't an issue - sure wish I had time to soak in the jacuzzi bath tub.
1887507,11433273,2014-04-02,11411582,Rob,"Polina's place was a great location for my visit and was comfortable, functional and a good value. It is very convenient to a lot of authentic Boston. I particularly liked Café Arpeggio on Broadway and My Diner on Avenue A. If you are a runner, it is very convenient to Castle Island Park/Fort Independence."
1887507,11653021,2014-04-10,11882542,John,"Everything about the apartment was great. Polina was not there, but her friend was engaging and took care of everything. I would stay at this apartment again."

1887507,13734054,2014-06-03,956271,Petra,"We (a fifty year old couple from Germany) have stayed for three nights in Polina's appartment. It is very well located, in a plaesant neighbourhood, close to metro station, airport, downtown and the popular South End with many shops and restaurants. Polina is a friendly and polite person. The room is small, only the bed and a small table fit into the room. You have to walk through the common area to reach the bathroom. Boston is a great and very historical place to visit, we loved the trail of freedom which is a brick-lined route that leads you to 16 historically significant sites."
1887507,13817476,2014-06-05,237687,Susan,"The one bathroom is shared by Polina and her male roommate, but it was not a problem to work out.  That said, it would have been easier if there was a mirror in the bedroom.  The bedroom is as depicted in the photo -- a futon bed and a desk with chair.  (The futon was a bit lumpy -- perhaps because there was no mattress pad.)  This is great for short term stay near the convention center, keeping your things in luggage given no closet, drawers, nor hangers are available for your use.  Polina did send an email with recommendations, but other than that I had no encounter during my two night stay. Check in and out is easy with keybox.  No access to street parking pass -- so parking is an added challenge and expense."
1887507,14425619,2014-06-19,12945281,Daniel,Everything went well. The communication with polina was perfect. The room was small but clean and the Appartement is located near the subway. I can recommend it.
1887507,15488343,2014-07-10,11145430,Jorg,"Polina is great and super fast responding to any request. The place is clean and centrally located. I like the restaurant recommendation Lincoln. Certainly, I would stay again at the place."
1887507,15576036,2014-07-12,15225753,Lukas,"The room is small . It kind of looked like they host a lot of guests... What we did not like was that we could not leave or luggage in the apartment and we had to drop it off at the Station and furthermore that you cannot lock the room. Anyway it is located in the Center, it was very clean and the bed was quite confortable."
1887507,15695007,2014-07-14,15675663,Katrin,Polina was a great host and provided us with lots of useful information for her neighbourhood. The apartment is super nice and very close to the harbour. The bed was super comfy and we really enjoyed our stay. Her dog is super cute!
1887507,16331755,2014-07-25,7771879,John,"Great location to be near Southie or Downtown.  Apartment is very nice, and Polina is a perfect host. Highly recommend both her and her place."
1887507,17218437,2014-08-09,7087348,Domingo,We did not enjoy our two-night stay at Polina's.
First of all the good thing: Polina was fast and friendly in the communication.,,,,,
However,we did not like the accomodation: The location was quite far from Downtown - as opposed to what the ad says. The bed was obviously just made in great hurry and the room was spartanic and lacked any detail.,,,,
If you just want a place to sleep in Boston this place will do,"but that's it. \"",,,,

1887507,18058163,2014-08-21,982842,Rosanne,"I had an amazing stay at Polina's place. Check-in was super-easy as she provided detailed instructions on how to get there and get around. The location itself is just outside of the downtown, in a quiet neighborhood with pretty much everything you need nearby. The Convention Center is ~10mins walk and the airport is only 10-15mins drive. As for the apartment, I couldn't have asked for better - it had all modern amenities, was super-clean and tidy and very comfortable! I didn't realize that Boston gets so hot in the summer, so it was really great that there was air-conditioning in the room! :)"
I didn't get to see Polina during the stay,but she was super-communicative before and after,so it was good to know she was there if I needed her. So,for your own modern apartment in Boston,"Polina's place is ideal. Thank you for being a perfect host!\"",

The place was clean, and we really appreciated Polina's recommendations for places to eat, etc. (Lincoln was amazing!)  We were also able to find free parking a few blocks away from the apartment, so that was great. Although it's not located right downtown, it was easy enough to take the bus that comes a block away.. although if you're going to be using public transit often, look into getting a \"\"Charlie card\"\""
1887507,19374871,2014-09-11,19835385,Carlo,It was my first time using AirB&B! Polina is a very good host and lovely person! The house was cleans and comfortable! It is not too far from the centre and well connected.

Die Wohnung entspricht genau der Beschreibung und liegt sehr zentral, in wenigen Minuten ist man an der Subway. Die Wohnung ist sauber und super ausgestattet, wir durften alles benutzen. Der Zugang zur Wohnung war von Polina toll organisiert. Auch die Abreise war unproblematisch. Das Zimmer ist allerdings sehr klein und hat keine Möglichkeit zur Ablage."

The location was perfect for me as it was only a short walk to the Convention Center. The apartment was clean and quiet, safe and secure.

It felt very private, we actually didn't even meet her until we were walking out the door to leave. Beware of the no shoes policy. I put mine on as we were ready to walk out the door (2 steps from the door) and she still became really offended and asked me to leave."
1887507,34042469,2015-06-03,20607658,Sunil,"Polina and her boyfriend were great! Really nice people, although unfortunately I wasn't able to spend much time with them as I was there on a business trip. They were really flexible with the check in and check out timings and plus emailed me several interesting things to do in Boston, which is always of great help."
Neighborhood is very calm,away from the hussle of the city center,but perfectly connected as there's a metro station (red line) just 5 minutes away walking: ideal to go to the center or to the airport.,,,
"Definitely would recommend them!!\"",,,,,

1887507,68308869,2016-04-04,51431088,Sheryl,"I had an excellent stay. Poli's apartment was immaculately clean, comfortable, and quiet. The bed was amazing. Poli's place was a 10-minute walk to the Boston convention and exhibition center. Poli and her boyfriend were very friendly and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again."
1887507,85661384,2016-07-12,82139306,John,"Poli was very responsive and accommodating.  She sent a list of recommendations for the area that were very helpful.  I didn't actually run into her at all, though. Apartment was very nice in a good location.  ~10 min walk to Convention Center.  Nice little room with desk and futon bed."
1887507,89509636,2016-07-28,84383017,Maxwell,"This was my first time using Airbnb. Poli and her boyfriend were excellent hosts. I was looking for a nice quiet place to stay for a few days in the middle of the week and was nicely accommodated. Private room locked, had ac, comfortable mattress, nice patio view. Overall clean environment. Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in South Boston area!"
4446413,33513204,2015-05-29,23280625,Rosni,"Listing and description of the apartment was accurate. Location ideal and suited our purpose and visit to Boston. The T station, supermarket so near the apartment while there are good choices for eateries and shopping to meet every budget. We did have a problem on arrival with unlocking the door and a neighbour helped us while we were waiting for a call back from the local Churchill staff. Few minor things which I had written to Jessica which can possibly improve the experience for the next renters. Was there supposed to be a doorman and if so where was he located as we went directly to 30 Garrison as instructed and accessed the lockbox for our keys.The main thing is the AC unit was not working and the compressor needed to be replaced. This was finally done by 7 pm on the Wednesday. The temporary mobile AC unit cooled down just the living area,thus the bedrooms and rest of the unit was uncomfortable . itso happened the weather was hot in Boston while we were there. We opened the bedrooms windows at night to sleep but this means we had to put up with the street noises etc. Liked the attractive and hygienic packaging of the toiletries, kitchen supplies, towels."

4446413,37504370,2015-07-07,999181,Craig,"This is apparently an automated listing, done through a management company. I got a message shortly before our trip that our place had changed, and the apartment we ended up with was in the same building but different than what was pictured and described."
Thus,I'm fairly certain that I didn't even stay in the place I had booked and paid for,and this non-disclosed surprise apartment is what I'm reviewing.,,,
The furnishings and carpet had a stained worn-out,frat-house feel to them.,,,,
"The \"\"two bathrooms\"\" were an odd arrangement",with two tiny bathrooms containing sinks and toilets connected in the middle by another tiny room with a bathtub. Basically,it's one bathroom connected to the master bedroom,with an extra sink and toilet crammed next to it.,,
The place has shrink-wrapped packages of things like toiletries and towels in each room,provided by the management company.,,,,
"The check-in process was a little confusing. The document provided by the company alternated the two words \"\"street\"\" and \"\"avenue\"\" at random",which are actually two very different locations if you're typing an address into your phone to find the apartment.,,,,
Fortunately,"we guessed the right one and went with \"\"avenue.\"\" From there",we played Zelda for a while searching for the magic key,and found the doorman who pointed out where the lockbox was and gave us instructions to the apartment.,,
The doorman was very friendly and helpful,and the place in general is nice. Quiet,safe and in a great neighborhood.,,,
The only problem is that when you book here,you're probably getting a random room in the building,"and not the one in these pictures nor that fits the description. \"",,,
4446413,42728891,2015-08-15,38938994,Tom,"Fantastic location! Super close to The Prudential Center and to multiple T-lines. Area felt VERY safe. Apartment was nice, as advertised. It has a little bit of wear and tear that could use an update, but nothing that hurt our stay. Would absolutely stay there again!"
1240598,5154302,2013-06-15,4257106,Andrew,"The apartment is as advertised -- small without luxuries, and containing all the necessities (coffee maker, microwave, etc.). Bed is very comfortable, huge TV, nicely functional kitchen. Apartment is air conditioned. The biggest draw is its location -- in the theater district, near Faneuil Hall. Farhan was easy to reach and coordinate with. We would definitely stay again."
1240598,6512314,2013-08-15,3985149,Furen,very responsible host
1240598,12326573,2014-04-29,4213096,Jeff,"Ahmed's a good guy; he'll work to ensure that you're comfortable. I didn't actually stay in this apartment due to a problem, but he put me up in the front unit, which I found to be much nicer. After fixing the internet and heat, it was a great stay. Incredibly convenient location, large studio space with modern feel. Only recommended for night owls or heavy sleepers - the weekends can be rowdy up until 3am. All in all, I would absolutely stay here again."
1240598,13072469,2014-05-19,4215886,Dan,"The only redeeming quality of this place is the location. It's easily walkable to all major attractions in the city, and right across the street from Boston Commons and close to shopping in the financial district. That being said, we were extremely disappointed with the cleanliness and noise. The place clearly wasn't cleaned prior to us arriving, and although the host agreed to send in another person to clean, we couldn't see any difference after that had apparently happened. Hair and dust everywhere, the bathroom had not been cleaned, and the tub didn't drain. The place is also directly above a bar and a late night pizza joint, which made it nearly impossible to sleep because of bar fights and drunk people screaming all throughout the night and early morning. A theater is also across the street with lights on all night, and due to the thin curtains which didn't close all the way, the apartment was brightly lit even at night."
1240598,13903456,2014-06-07,13262918,Glenn,Nice and Cozy studio in great location.
1240598,18722924,2014-08-31,15913718,Laura,"This apartment is in a great location (right above The Tam, for anyone who knows Boston).  It's right in the heart of the theater district, just off the Boston Commons.  Perfect if you need a place to stay downtown, especially for students at any of the schools nearby (Emerson, Suffolk, Tufts Med)."
It's not the nicest apartment (hole in the ceiling,peeling paint in the shower,limited daylight) and the blinds don't provide the greatest feeling of privacy,but I stayed there comfortably for three weeks.  Ahmed & Ed were very responsive and accommodating,and the apartment had all of the basics (nice furniture,closet space
My main complaint would be the occasional cigarette smoke wafting in to the apartment at random times of day--not a great place to stay if you have respiratory problems.  I also didn't feel supremely confident about the safety of the apartment building after a couple incidents with yelling and banging in the halls in the middle of the night (it may be a better place to stay as a couple than alone).,,,,,
Still,"I would definitely stay there again if I needed to be commuting to classes!\"",,,,
1240598,20360072,2014-09-28,14381780,Christina,"Just stayed three nights in Boston and spent very little time in the apartment.  Eddie was very helpful, meeting at Panera and exchanging the keys.  Bathroom and kitchen are fine, bed is mediocre.  The location is perfect, especially if you like shopping or Pho."
1240598,21383332,2014-10-16,7881892,Michael,"The studio was perfect for what I needed for my week in Boston. As described, the space is basic and no-frills, but it is clean and secure and with it's location in the heart of downtown, it is close to everything! Ahmed and his assistant Eddie were both a delight to deal with, replying promptly to any messages before the trip and whilst I was there. Thanks guys!"
1240598,21528104,2014-10-19,10311927,Giorgia,Negative experience since the condition of the apartment is not matching photos nor description:
dirty shits dirty pillows dirty kitchen,broken window broken airconditioning,wholes on the walls,trash inside the condo.,,
We have documented the situation by pictures and sent them to the host and to Airbnb.,,,,,
We left the apt right away the same day and paied for both the apt and the hotel.,,,,,
"Asked for a full refund. \"",,,,,
1240598,21732363,2014-10-22,1032307,Jennifer,Eddie was super nice and accommodating with getting me the keys.  Great location.  Perfect for what i needed for a short stay.  Would stay there :)
1240598,21921286,2014-10-26,22680149,Yuanyuan,I will definitely recommend this room. Ahmed and his assistant Eddie are really hospitable and willing to help me. They reply quickly and give me many nice suggestions.
The apt is at a super great spot! It is near Boston Common,fancy theater and Chinatown which provide me with tons of tasty foods and sceneries.,,,,
Although the street is a little bit noisy,the building and the room is quiet to stay. Except a cozy bed and other necessary stuffs,there are also so many types of cooking utensils that guests could get access to. It is obvious that Ahmed and Eddie have considered a lot for their guests.,,,
Considering the location and the price,"this spot is a really nice deal.\"",,,,

1240598,27991337,2015-03-16,24847573,Fernando,So I will begin with the 2 positive thoughts Great location and Eddy was great( Ahmed's Assitant)
With that being said I would never stay here again. The room was in total construction mode and I was made aware of this the day I arrived even though I booked months ago. The light fixture was dangling,open holes everywhere,dust and debris covered the whole kitchen which made it unusable. I am shocked that Airbnb allows this place to be a representation of them. Ahmed could've notified me ahead of time as I would have prefer to pay more and stay some where else. I also asked if this place had been inspected for asbestos to which I never received an answer. Further more,"I will be filing a complaint with the city of Boston as I'm sure they would like to know that city code is being ignored. \"",,
1240598,28237874,2015-03-20,29410534,特,It's a great place with lowest price ever. Room is clean and quite. I really enjoy it.
1240598,30813624,2015-04-27,19145890,Alexandra Kaye,We loved this place. We stayed for four nights while my husband attended a conference at a hotel down the street. You can't beat the location on a graduate student budget.
True,it's loud at night,and the building is not kept-up. Nevertheless -- the apartment itself was comfortable,clean,"warm. It was well-equipped for our needs. Ahmed and his assistant were responsive and helpful. Our thanks to both for a great stay!\"",
1240598,32331390,2015-05-17,19243470,Julie,"This place is not worth $200 a night. We are very disappointed in the accommodations. The place is not as advertised on AIRBNB. The pictures are very misleading. There are patches everywhere, the electrical outlets are exposed/dangling and some of the outlets don't work. The bathroom tub is old and rusted."
Eddie was nice and met us at the apt but I would not recommend this apt to anyone.,,,,,

The place its just you can see in the picture of airbnb. Not much to say,great place,beautiful city.,,,
"\"",,,,,
1240598,33583213,2015-05-30,30008725,Alice,"The apartment was as advertised, small, clean and economical, but it had a few technical issues (bathroom light out, front door to the building wouldn't lock, no cable). I never met Ahmed, but his friend who dropped off keys was relatively responsive. The apartment is very conveniently located by the subways, and close to many exciting neighborhoods in Boston."
1240598,34025910,2015-06-03,4390585,Isabelle,The location is great !! And for the price - one of the lowest we found - the flat is really as you can expect from the pictures.
Some remaks though: the bathroom door isn't closing (if it's your first romantic trip I wouldn't advise it then) and the building reworking makes you wake up very early. But Ahmed always kept in touch and was always very available and gove us some advices anytime.  If you're looking for a cheap flat where you'll only be sleeping,"it's perfect. \"",,,,
1240598,34850950,2015-06-13,24785473,Dimitris,"Ahmed and Edie are very nice people and the location is perfect. It is located in a noisy spot of the city, but in the apartment almost nothing can be heard."
On the bad side,the apartment need some reparations. It is not dirty,but it is ugly and it is not a place to be enjoyed. If you have lots to do in the city and are only going to sleep,it is the place for you. But if you plan to enjoy your room,"look for somewhere else.\"",
1240598,35236075,2015-06-16,2322490,Emma,"This was one of my worst AirBnB experiences. First, Ahmed's assistant Eddie was over 40 minutes late meeting me to deliver the keys. Then, that night the electricity went out in the middle of the night in the apartment when I wasn't using that much electricity. Eddie, Ahmed's assistant, was initially not responsive via text until I called him and then at first he was not very helpful. Fortunately, Eddie was able to get the super to fix the electricity. Though the super said the circuits were overloaded which is odd since I had the AC on fan mode and wasn't using anything else when it went out. The apartment itself is fine, except for the electricity issues. There are wires hanging out which is weird and the apartment building itself needs some work. You do get the smell of smoke sometimes in the apartment from smokers downstairs. It's a great location and I wish I had a better experience. I was in Boston for a conference and my coworkers were making fun of me for using AirBnB versus staying in a hotel. In this instance, I can't blame them."
1240598,38928329,2015-07-19,28397555,Wes,"This was a great airbnb. First of all, its inexpensive for a reason. It's very small and basic, and was clean on my arrival. The sheets were clean and towels were laid out. The location is basically what I paid for. Excellent downtown location and is close to everything. The pizza place below the apartment was a great late night accommodation! Most of my communication was through Eddie and he was helpful and responsive. Easy check-in/check-out process. No complaints."
1240598,39844282,2015-07-26,32020085,David,The apartment was very clean and comfortable. The location was also amazing for the price.

1240598,41039293,2015-08-03,39917656,Weisi,"The landlord is pretty helpful, making suggestions on parking, food and other stuff for us. The house is small but cozy, great for travelling on your own or with one friend."
1240598,41452439,2015-08-07,15556776,Brandon,"Based on other reviews, I didn't have high hopes for this location. I chose it anyway since I needed a last minute place to stay for work in Boston. The location is good but the experience was worse than expected."
I emailed Ahmed three times before finally receiving a response. Since I was in town for work and traveling to the suburbs the first day,I needed to coordinate an exchange. Even if he was figuring out the best way to exchange keys,which was finally communicated at MIDNIGHT the day of my arrival,he could have at least acknowledged my emails.,,
"He could have also used this time to inform me that the electricity was going to be worked on during two of my days there.  I was quite surprised when early one morning some workers were knocking on my door TO ENTER THE UNIT to work on the outlets (none of which worked). I was equally surprised when I returned from a meeting to pack and head to the airport and the electricity was completely out. I spoke to a worker and he didn't know how long it would be out. He said all units were informed of the work long in advance and Ahmed should have let me know. I ended up packing by the light of my phone and was unable to take the garbage out because there was stuff everywhere in the hallway. \"",,,,,

The kitchen is well equiped (oven,pans...).,,,,
Nonetheless,the photos on AirBnb seem to have been taken couple years ago or more. The bathtub was peeled and the ceiling was cracked.,,,,
"The brightness of the pictures is also misleading. The apartment is always dark because the \"\"window\"\" gives to the small building's courtyard. If you open the blind",people in the corridor can seen the bed... So don't expect to open and see sun.,,,,
We had a good time in Boston but we would not advise our friends to rent this apartment because the quality/price ratio is too low.,,,,,
In French: L'appartement est bien situé,près du plus grand parc de Boston (Boston Common),à 100 m d'une station de métro et des rues commerçantes. La cuisine est bien fournie en ustensiles (poêles et casseroles) et il y a même un four.,,,
Cependant,les photos présentes sur AirBnB semblent dater d'au moins quelques années car l'état de l'appartement laisse à désirer : le fond de la baignoire est écaillé et le plafond a été grossièrement plâtré mais pas repeint.,,,,
De plus,la luminosité des photos est trompeuse,"l’appartement ne possède qu'une \"\"fenêtre\"\" qui donne sur une minuscule cour à l'ombre. Si le volet est ouvert",on a l'impression qu'il fait noir dehors et,de plus,on peut voir le lit depuis le couloir... Le volet reste donc fermé en permanance.
Nous avons néanmoins passé un très bon séjour à Boston,"nous regrettons simplement d'avoir payé aussi cher pour ce que nous avons eu. Nous ne le conseillerons pas à nos amis.\"",,,,

1240598,46295168,2015-09-09,36194850,Mary,"This apartment is in a super convenient location within walking distance of South Station, Downtown Crossing and Boston Commons, Beacon Hill, etc.  Ahmed's Assistant Eddie is friendly, easy to coordinate meeting with & full of helpful suggestions about the neighborhood.  The apartment is very quiet and clean.  One disappointment (but not atypical for an old urban building) is the window just faces a wall vs having a view."
1240598,48145225,2015-09-23,41712374,Nancy,"I felt incredibly welcome at this apartment.  Eddie showed me around the apartment and gave me all the info I needed.  Ahmed and Eddie were quick to reply to texts and emails.  The apartment couldn't be more convenient to everything in the city, including public transportation.  The space was as described, but better.  The electrical work has been completed and the lighting is very good and most of the outlets worked.  That was something I inquired about before I booked."
This apartment is $200/night less than any hotel in Boston.  That was something I had to keep in mind when staying there.  It's not the Ritz for sure,but it is worth what you pay.  You can't beat the location plus you have a kitchen with microwave,stove,and everything you need and ac!,,

The room is tight with not much natural light, but location is everything right? You're moments away from the T (red and green lines) and tons of really great food. Ahmed and his assistant were great, they were even able to check us in a little early."
1240598,51566649,2015-10-21,6373659,Thomas,Ahmed's place is as advertised. It has everything you need for a short stay. The bed is comfortable and the shower has good hot water with good pressure. The kitchen is well equipped but I didn't need to use it. The place is clean and in a great location. I walked everywhere from here. The best thing about my experience is the flexibility of the host. Eddie (who is Ahmed's work colleague) came and let me in and gave me keys as I arrived before the 4pm check in. There's a lot of wrap about this place being old but I found absolutely no problems with the building at all. I will more than happily stay here again.
1240598,52054955,2015-10-26,21508745,Frederic,charming small apartment that corresponds entirely to photos (some small jobs are needed in the bathroom). It is ideally located for visiting Boston on foot.

The neighborhood is in the theater district, very close to nice neighborhoods but isn't quite in one.  The apartment is clean but in need of repairs to make it what I would consider comfortable.  The shower was ice cold, there was a dripping hole in the bathroom ceiling which left a sheetrock mess in the bathroom.  The blinds (shown in the picture) don't quite cover the window.

1240598,67831031,2016-03-31,2154344,Mischa,Best location I could have hoped for in Boston. It is very close to all the subway lines and walking distance from lots of great sites in the city. It is tiny but for the price and location you can't beat it. I was with my wife and infant for 3 nights and it worked out great for us.

Not the studio to pick if you're after huge Boston charm, but a cost effective place with easy walking to everything."
1240598,70251270,2016-04-17,63238571,Kelly,"I loved this location, right in the heart of the theatre district. Faneuil Hall, Beacon Hill, and The Prudential Center are a 10 minute walk. SO close to the shops on Newbury as well."
The apartment was great. Yes,it is small but it was cozy and had everything I needed. Perfectly clean little place to come back to after a long day. There was no problem with noise. I slept well every night. The light in the bathroom is great for getting ready. Perfect brightness. I had hot water for every shower.,,,,
Ahmed and Eddie were prompt and kind. I had no problem getting in or out of the building. They were great.,,,,,
The only thing that was annoying at times was the smell of smoke that would get into the room. Thankfully,it wasn't constant or too overbearing. It might've been another guest smoking upstairs. Not really sure where it was coming from. Not much you can do about that I suppose.,,,,
"Overall a wonderful stay. I'll be back!\"",,,,,

The location is perfect for visiting different parts of Boston as it is very close to the Boylston T stop. Eddie C. made the trip very pleasant, and everything in the apartment was as described."
1240598,71975746,2016-04-30,24343865,Jacqueline,"The apt was just as described, a studio not too small for one person, possibly 2. No cable, just Netflix. Wifi was good."
Eddie,Ahmed's assistant met me just a little late,but was hard to communicate with during my stay and did not reply to my text to him at all,but Ahmed was quick to reply,although we never got an answer.,
It's 1 flight up,and the smells from the pizzeria below were wonderful. The apt is very dark,no natural light,although there is a window out to a small fire escape area. From the 2nd floor the light does not reach. The shower was great,but the toilet pressure required 4-5 flushes for anything every time. Not a big deal,"just so you know \""

1240598,78398334,2016-06-06,60352611,Lola,"This was a great stay. Ahmed and team were very helpful and the location was great. It is an old apt. and it is very small, so if you're looking for more of a hotel feel, probably isn't the place for you. However,  you can't beat the location, right in the heart of Chinatown, downtown and where things happen. Close to the subway, too! Easy check in and check out as coordinated by Ahmed's team. All in all, a wonderful stay in Boston!"
1240598,79523559,2016-06-13,75097284,Andrew,Its in a great location and Ahmed was very great at communicating throughout the process. I would highly recommend this place if your just looking to explore Boston.

If you prefer not to take the subway, we found everything was within a 15 min walk.  The apartment is on the 2nd floor and away from the street noise.  Ahmed's place was clean and comfortable for two ppl.  He provided all basic necessities.  Will definitely book again next time!"

This was my first AirBNB experience and it was pretty good. Minus the fiasco trying to get the key from the host's associate, everything was great."

I never met Ahmed, all communication was passed on to one or two other \"\"associates.\"\" Check in was delayed by about 2 hours even though I arrived on schedule. Also"
Besides the toilet and the check in,it was a great location by Boston commons,had tons of good food nearby,was a cute little apartment,"and had useful wifi and tv options. \"",
1240598,86261735,2016-07-15,884725,Sherry,"This apartment is in the PERFECT location!  It was an easy walk from the silver bus line (which is a free ride from the airport). We also found that you can check your luggage at the South Station for $10, if you need to.  Also we over shopped, so we shipped items home via ups, which is about 1/4 of a block away."
The apartment is older,and needs a few repairs,but we were well aware of that. The price point was perfect and all our communications were professional and timley.,,,

I was in town for a show at the Wilbur and couldn't have been happier with the location, AC, and smart TV. The bathroom and shower weren't amazing, and I have slept in more comfortable beds before, but those were relatively small downsides for a cheap and easy two-night stay."

Very clean space with quiet surroundings allowed for a much needed night of rest.  Conviently within walking distance of South Boston and plenty of public transportation options in close proximity.  The man that welcomed us to the apartment and let us in the front door was very polite and well acquainted with Boston enough to provide dining and bar suggestions in the area."
1240598,89315179,2016-07-27,84729946,Alisha,"I was unable to make my one night reservation due to an emergency with my traveling guest, and having come down with Strep the day of check-in. I communicated this with the person of contact prior to my check in time and was told I would probably receive a refund and that he would inform Ahmed. I later communicated this to Ahmed, who denied me any refund. I would have thought Ahmed would have appreciated me sparing a sick guest at his studio, and was hopeful he would have been more understanding, but he was not."
1240598,89850097,2016-07-30,15377945,Dustin,Kevin was extremely accommodating even though our arrival time changed last minute. He could not have been kinder and more responsive.

1240598,93414225,2016-08-12,37626200,Paul,"The team with Ahmed does a great job.  They are the stars.  The building is a dive.  But get over that and the location is fantastic and the room looks just like the pictures.  Had new towels and the shower has decent pressure and good temperature.  The air con is just right and the TV is decent as I could play my Xbox.  Have stayed with him before and will do so again if I need to and think Ahmed will continue to improve his offerings.  In the theater district, near the Common, Copley, Financial District and the T."
1240598,94385256,2016-08-15,83960362,Nate,I had to wait 45 minutes to meet with Eddie to finally get in the door. I also did not know the toilet hardly flushed. Other than that everything was accurately described and you can't beat the location.
1240598,95974217,2016-08-21,8548705,Tony,"As everyone else said, the location was fantastic. Eddie was very accommodating to our arrival and met us within a minute or arrival.

The guest bedroom was nicely set up to accommodate us--clean towels, a toiletry basket, some extra hangers, and a pitcher of water. The bathroom was also very clean. Something I was unaware of was that on-site parking is available. Though I ended up taking an Uber for most of my trip, this is a great listing for people who plan on bringing a car/driving around.

It was like living in Boston for a week.  Will was very accessible and provided answers to all my questions.  We stayed with my twin 8 year olds who did very well walking to the nearby orange and green T lines.  If we were too tired to take te subway we just took a cab, between $10 and $20 anywhere in the city.  The only drawback was the pull out couch.  It was not comfortable.  Good for eight year olds, but not adults.  Great places to eat nearby, especially across the street at he cafe with great beer and at a local coffee shop \"\"renders\"\" a block and a half away.  \""

Just a 5-10 minute walk to the Green (Symphony) and Orange (Massachusetts Ave) as well as buses such as the 1 that went to Harvard Square. We arrived early and was able to check in early due to prior contact. Whilst we didn't get to meet Will, there were plenty of instructions and recommendations of places around the neighbourhood."
The only complaint I would have was that the pull out sofa bed was not comfortable. It was an air mattress that was slightly flat. Otherwise,"everything was perfect for the three of us!\"",,,,

We ate out at a number of terrific restaurants in Back Bay, South End, North End, and Cambridge, and could not ask for a better hub with quick access to the Orange line and the 1 bus."

We stayed here with 3 persons, but we would really recommend you stay here with 2 at the most - there are only 2 places to sit down for a meal, and once the couch is turned into a bed, there is little to no room to move around. Also the kitchen equipement is thin, so you have to do the dishes everytime you use something. Again, good place for 2, but a bit too small for our family. As described by others, it is indeed a noisy location. Our experience with other airbnb locations was that there is always some basic supply (detergent, salt, pepper, tea or coffee etc.) but this location has nothing at all, so you have to bring it all. On the positive end, you are at the Tstation within 5 minutes which brings you to all the nice spots in boston."

We found great restaurants very close to us, esp Parish's. Being our first time in Boston, the only thing we struggled with in the beginning was the subway.

En nuestro caso, lo alquilamos dos personas pero con la intención de dormir en camas separadas. El sofá es supuestamente cama, pero con lo que nos encontramos al llegar fue con un colchón hinchable de escasos centímetros de grosor que a mayores estaba pinchado. De manera que tuvimos que recurrir a otro colchón hinchable que encontramos en uno de los armarios, pero que en ningún caso era por lo que habíamos pagado. Además, uno de los nórdicos estaba muy sucio, lleno de manchas de aceite."
349347,33014500,2015-05-24,32744558,Timothy,We felt welcome and the listing was pretty much as described.
349347,33429070,2015-05-28,15865867,Sandra,"The apartment was like on the pictures, it was clean and welcoming, enough for us because we were just there to sleep, the down side was that there is a busy road and the windows are not really sound proved, so we could hear everyone talking outside. The neighbourhood felt safe to us."
349347,33680106,2015-05-31,2000697,Lesley,"Back bay location is great. Owner is guick to set reservation. Great communication with rental company via email prior to stay. Easy access through electronic combo locks on main door and apartment door.  Everything clean. Only 2 of us, but could have for 4 if use of Air mattress or couch. Kitchen well equipped to cook.  Nice shower upgrades. Bike share locations close."
349347,34129103,2015-06-05,30847079,Patrik,"Easy access with keypad. Well planned apartment with good location, close to everything."

349347,36576405,2015-06-29,9269530,Hugues,"A few days before checking in we received an email with check-in and other useful instructions.  We found the studio apartment in excellent condition and as advertised.  The studio is perfect for two people but was very tight for the four of us (two adults + two teenagers) .  The studio was centrally located, and a 5 minute walk to the metro.  The first night we had a lot of street noise which kept us awake."
349347,36830625,2015-07-01,26756760,Kellie,"The listing is centrally located, and easy to find but I would not recommend for anyone who is a light sleeper. The lights come through the blinds at night and it is a very noisy block. The bathroom and kitchen are nicely upgraded."
349347,37876527,2015-07-11,24885163,Damian,"Apartment was exactly as pictured. Very comfortable, good spot in the neighbourhood and very short walk to the train station."
The host left a folder with local information for restaurants,activities etc. It was a nice touch.  Electronic entry so great not to have to carry around keys whilst site seeing.,,,,
The bed was not the most comfortable.  We could feel the springs/inners and it sank towards the middle.  The window dressings are thin so the apartment stays fairly lit all night.,,,,,
"I had no other contact with the host apart from the approval to stay. They operate as part of a collection of short stay properties.  The listings on airbnb didn't identify them that way though.\"",,,,,

Some street noise but certainly nothing unexpected given the way convenient location... Easy walk to Orange line, easy walk to Hubway bikes and we walked to downtown and Freedom Trail, but YES, we are avid walkers!   Felt very safe and secure.   TV, wireless, central air conditioning, all kitchen, blow dryer worked perfectly.  Couch and lamps showing some wear.     Zero interaction with Will or anyone associated with this unit...certainly different than some of our Airbnb hosts/experiences.   Parish Cafe ... Yummy!   Flour bakery ...wow!  Took \"\"Bites of Boston\"\" tour that started right across street ... Great tour and obviously perfect location if that tour makes it onto your visiting Boston itinerary.\""
349347,39633543,2015-07-25,24189972,Tim,"\"Check in instructions were detailed and very helpful. It was convenient having electronic key entry-pad locks and not having to carry keys around town. Neighborhood was good, safe, and conveniently located, especially with bike lanes on Mass Ave. and on nearby streets; and with Boston's bike share program Hubway located a block away. Listing was accurate and I would consider staying again if wanting to stay in the same location. The studio floods with fantastic daytime light but unfortunately does the same in the evening. We therefore would have greatly welcomed darker curtains and/or shades to aid in our sleeping past sunrise which was prior to 6AM but we are \"\"grounded in reality\"\" in knowing that the host is not in control of when the sun rises"

Inside was a bit tired and not as stylish as in the photos, bathroom could have been cleaner. Bed was very uncomfortable and the pull out sofa bed didn't have a mattress so we couldn't use that."

The bed however,was not so comfortable!,,,,
The check-in was unfortunately not ideal...,,,,,
We were informed we would receive instructions as to how to access the apartment 48 hours prior to arrival... I kept checking my inbox (and junk mail) but nothing arrived so approximately 24 hours before arrival I sent the host an email... And waited patiently for a response... Nothing!,,,,,
We had travelled from the UK and arrived in Boston after a 9 hour flight with no contact from the host and feeling rather vulnerable in an unknown city... And country! We tried to call the host,it went straight to voicemail. In the end we had to call Air Bnb who were incredibly helpful and managed to make contact with the host who finally emailed the details through to me claiming that an email had already been sent (I have since checked my inbox and junk mail thoroughly,there is no trace!),,,
I love Air bnb and I love the hosts I have met so far in my travels but this host is a more like a business... with lots of properties and an answer phone. Which means you can't get hold of anyone outside of office hours!,,,,,

The downsides: Internet was fairly slow,limited cable channels,a lot of street noise at night,and terrible shades that didn't block any light at night. I prefer dark quiet rooms to sleep,and this place was the opposite.,

Clean, a few blocks from the T, walkable to some fun restaurants, decent shower, good linens, etc. If you're just looking for an option that isn't a hotel and is easy to access, this is a great option. Personally, it wasn't clear to me in the description that this is a building full of apartments that are all used for Airbnb (they ask you to check your email from \"\"Short Term Rentals Boston\"\")—I like a little more personality and usually love meeting the owners of places... and maybe I've been spoiled because many hosts go above and beyond with toiletries"

I even managed to find a great cafe less than 300 meters away. Sleeping was great, AC worked fine as we were hitting 100F some days this year. Christiane really cares about you. Bus 93 leaves from just outside, Dry cleaning/alterations available. Tram/Subway is available at Bunker Hill Community College. I recoomend you take the 93 bus to city, have breakfast at Starbucks on Park Street, and take a walk in Boston Common (park). A week pass was 15 bucks."

Christiane went above and beyond to make me feel warm and welcome. Staying in her house is like staying in a museum. Priceless. Also she had maps, directions and books on everything. I will be returning to Boston in December and have no intentions on staying anywhere else.

She served breakfast every morning and, while the kitchen was not available to us, she provided snacks and would prepare coffee or tea if we saw her in the afternoon or evening.  Christiane provided abundant tourism information, maps, bus schedules, etc and even museum passes."
The location is wonderful; within view of the Bunker Hill monument,around the corner from the bus stop and about 0.5 mi from the T station. It's a quiet,residential neighborhood of charming row homes.,,,
The spiral staircase to the waterfall bedroom is very narrow and rather steep and probably would not accommodate anything larger than a carry-on suitcase. The house was built in 1885 and has lovely stained-glass windows. There is very limited floor,counter and shelf space available since there are many pieces of furniture,"collectibles and household items. The TV/DVD players in the living room and bedroom and extensive DVD collection are available to guests. Christiane made us feel very welcomed and we thoroughly enjoyed our Boston visit.\"",,,

Host was not very personable and would not let me talk more than two words before she interrupted. I only needed the place to sleep because I came for a conference and she got upset because i choose it as a last resort. It was very complicated to get the key and connect with the host and the key and confusing directions to get in did not work half the time.  The room is nice, the bed is comfortable, but the overall experience was less than desirable. Overpriced."

Cleveland circle station(green line C) is just in front of his house,and there are other two stations of green line B and D only 5-mins walking away.,,,,

Max was very friendly,and made my girlfriend and I feel at home. Wow were even invited to join Max and his friends who were over for diner on Saturday night (we declined as we'd already eaten,but it looked delicious!).,,,

The neighborhood is great. It's a mix of students and families,but trends more toward students. It's in the heart of Boston's college area,so it's not super luxury,but it's still very safe. I was lucky to find parking because there are a LOT of areas where you can only park if you have a resident parking sticker,so watch where you're parking.,
Keep in mind,this is a 3rd floor walk-up,with no elevator. This really is a place best suited for a one-person,one-night visit. Which is what my visit was.,,
The room itself is quite spacious. There isn't a lot of closet space,but then again,you probably wouldn't need a lot of hanging room if you're only staying for a night (or two). But I'm fairly certain Max would sort something out for you if you needed a place to hang clothing. The apartment doesn't have its own thermostat (temp is controlled by a central thermostat controlled by building maintenance) so it can get really warm in the room. You can open the windows,just know that the Green Line station is directly across the street,so it can be noisy. Again,none of this is a major issue
Finally,"it's important to know that the bed isn't an actual \"\"bed\"\" with a mattress and box spring. It's",I believe,a couch that folds out into a futon-type bed. It's got seams down the middle and across it. It's not totally uncomfortable,but you can feel the gaps and seams on your back. For most,that might really be inconsequential. But for someone like me who's had a couple of back surgeries
All in all,Max is a tremendous host. Location is great. Convenience to subway is great. Room is spacious. Bathroom is nice and clean. Apartment is clean,"if not a little spare. I'd go back--especially if there was a mattress and box spring!\"",,,
9685102,73917574,2016-05-11,46330609,Carol,Max made us welcome. His apartment is 5 minutes from the train station and takes 30 minutes to get to Downtown Boston. His apartment is nice . We had a lovely room and a great bathroom. Max gave us any information we needed.
9685102,73999438,2016-05-12,18269095,Barbara,"Sono stata una notte ospite da Max in compagnia della mia amica Valentina. Ho trovato disponibilità, cortesia e pulizia. Max è una persona molto discreta e ospitale. Ho avuto il piacere di condividere un caffè con lui e fare quattro chiacchiere prima che lui si recasse al lavoro e ci lasciasse disponibilità completa dell'appartamento. La zona è residenziale, ma a pochi metri si trovano caffetterie, ristoranti e un seven eleven, il parcheggio è un po' complesso, ma io non ho avuto grandi problemi, ho scaricato l'app del boston park e ho pagato con carta di credito una cifra contenuta per le due ore che eccedevano la gratuità notturna, pur non usando l'auto Max mi ha consigliato senza nessun problema."
"Lo consiglierei a chiunque.\"",,,,,
9685102,74536275,2016-05-15,2179032,Wilson,"Accurate was 100% accurate. Space was immaculate in cleanliness and loved that the T was 2 minutes away. Didn't use the kitchen, but it looked very nice. Would stay with Max again without any hesitation."
9685102,75030707,2016-05-18,55692987,Caroline,"Max was a great host, we loved his clean, spacious apartment, in a lovely quiet residential street. Max's apartment is just a three minute walk to the T (Reservoir) which is on the green line that takes you directly to the centre of town.  We were there sight seeing so we're out and about all day but it was wonderful to get back to Max's apartment to refresh and relax, Max was happy to offer advice on places of interest or directions. We would happily stay there again"
9685102,76615362,2016-05-28,54103053,Mikayla,"This was an awesome place to stay in Boston. The subway and buses were very close and made it very convenient to get around easily. The neighborhood was also really nice and safe. We only saw Max once the day we got there and then he left town on vacation so it was really nice to have the place to ourselves. My only complaint would be the lack of A/C. It was REALLY hot in the apartment. Overall though, it was very nice!"
9685102,77296559,2016-05-31,64355398,Christine,My friend and I stayed in Max's apartment for the weekend.  We didn't actually get to meet Max but we loved staying there.  The apartment is very clean and located in nice neighborhood. The train into downtown Boston was just a quick walk so the location was extremely convenient. Overall we really enjoyed our experience and would recommend Max's place to anyone visiting Boston in the future. Max always answered our questions and we felt right at home.
9685102,79071571,2016-06-11,55857051,Glen-Hudson,"Max accommodated us on very short notice and was there ready for us upon arrival. A beautifully restored apartment literally across from the tram station so very convenient when travelers do not have a car. A comfortable, cozy room and plenty of hot water in a fab bathroom. WiFi connectivity and cable tv in the lounge and well equipped kitchen. Thanks Max!"
9685102,80199398,2016-06-16,53150739,Liubov,"Stay in Massimo home was wonderful, expectations appeared better then written in the description of the house. The host is gentle,kind and widely helpful, most of the time Massimo was out of home and appartment was totally ours as if we are at our own home. The location is  calm and safe, near by T train from where we could easily reach any place of our interest. Next time in Boston for sure we will stay in Massimo home. Thank you Massimo for ur italian vivid support."

9685102,87727867,2016-07-21,63831321,Forest,My son and I really enjoyed staying in Max's home. It was very cozy and Max made sure we had everything we needed and even put an A/C unit in the night we arrived as a heat wave was hitting Boston. We would stay there again!
9685102,88045581,2016-07-23,32440995,Mary,"A great room in a comfortable, historic apartment. Max greeted us and helped us settle in after our long trip, even made us a nice pasta late in the evening on a Thursday. Genuine Italian hospitality!"

He is super easy going and the place is as described.  Max was out most of the time, but my friend and I enjoyed getting to know him. Max left for NY in the middle of our stay so we ended up having the place to ourselves. The room has an AC unit but the living room area doesn't. It wasn't a problem because the weather wasn't too hot."
The neighborhood is great. The restaurants nearby are all pretty good and it is easy to go into downtown Boston either by the T or by car (we did both). The only thing to watch out for is that parking is a bit tricky...ask Max about it and he can explain where to park. I got a parking ticket and Max offered to pay for it,"but I was able to get it dismissed at the Brookline town hall. Overall a great experience. The place is great for one or two travelers.\"",,,,

We were concerned about our motorcycles (i.e., parking, safety), but Nicole offered us her backyard AND driveway, and the bikes were pretty safe. You can beat that! Will stay here any day! Nicole is a great host."

1173306,14980133,2014-06-30,11212012,Christine,"Stayed an easy and comfortable full month. Nicole was nice and responsive. Even with another tenant, the place was quiet, very independent living. The room was large with great closet space. The bed was a convertible futon bunk mattress, but Nicole bought additional padding from IKEA. Street parking was worry-free, and the buses to the T were right at the end of the street; as well as a grocery store...which made it hard to resist late night snack trips. Takes about 45mins to get to Downtown Boston, bit longer on the way home in evenings."
1173306,16873560,2014-08-03,19106773,Joseph,Nicole met me at the door and I immediately felt welcome. The room was accurately described. The neighborhood was ideal. I had no problem finding parking on the street in front of Nicole's house and the supermarket at the end of the street was very convenient.

Nicole is a very nice & welcoming host, she always checked if we needed anything and offered us a Playpen and toys to use for the baby.. Nicole also made sure we got all the privacy we needed and when we wanted something, she is a perfect guide to where to go and what to do in Boston.. all in all it was an amazing stay, would definitely recommend it.. if you are looking for a great place to stay in proximity of Boston, Nicole's place is the Best.."

I had access to the living room with TV and the kitchen, where I would prepare my breakfast. I had a key for my room and for the main door."
The trolley station is a less than 10 minutes walk. Then I'd be in downtown Boston in around 35 minutes.,,,,,
During my stay the host was available to my demands and questions by text messages and by airbnb app message.,,,,,
It's an old charming house in good shape,but the heating system isn't very good,or seemed to be turned off. The host provided extra blankets,but the house was colder than what I'm used for. I can understand that,"I come from Quebec and the cost of heating is much lower.\"",
1173306,22211979,2014-11-01,16143686,Laramie,"This place was easily one of the best places I've been to using airbnb. The host is wonderful. She makes sure you have exactly what you need and will check in occasionally without being intrusive. She also provides a handy printout of the house rules, checkout procedure and a list of important locations around town.  The room itself is great, close to a bus stop and trolley stop which can take you to a red line station. I give this space my full recommendation! Do not miss out!"
1173306,27808411,2015-03-12,28248803,Luke,"When staying in the Greater Boston Area, look no further than this beautiful Victorian Home! Nicole's service and professionalism is unparallelled, and complemented perfectly by the house and the accommodations. The space provided was large, open, immaculate, and perfectly furnished, and fit my ever need and then some. The house had a true, classic New England theme about it. Whether you're from New England, or just in town for a visit (business or pleasure) this is THE place to stay. This quintessential New England home is flawless. The location from I-93 is great, and it's walking distance from town and the grocery store."
Nicole is always reachable by a text in case of issues or a simple request for dinner suggestions.,,,,,
"Thank you for the great stay and I'll be back soon! \"",,,,,
1173306,28763434,2015-03-29,21002084,Luca,"I booked Nicole's place the day before my arrival and everything went very smooth. She is very professional, and always at reach via text or email. The house is spartan but clean and very comfortable overall. The bathroom is not exactly heated, but there's plenty of hot water when you need it. The rest of the house instead is nice and warm. The neighbourhood is ok, I came back from downtown at around midnight three days in a row and I never felt unsafe. It's also extremely well connected to the underground and to the rest of the public transportation system through the express streetcar line. It takes about 45min to get downtown. I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
1173306,30443416,2015-04-22,27061192,Brad,"The host, Nicole, was very hospitable and she tried to accommodate me.  Unfortunately,  the room I was in had below standard beds and I had no choice but to find other accommodations after 2 days of my 5 day reservation.   The bedroom had bunk beds with a full bed on bottom and single on top.   The bottom full bed does not have a box spring and it sagged in the middle, despite the host having 2 thin mattresses on it.  It was very difficult to get to sleep the first night and to stay asleep.  It was just a little better the second after I slept at the bottom of the bed.    I told the host after the first night and she said she could put a roll-away bed in the room.    Since my brother was to show up for the 3rd day and we needed 2 decent beds, I held off on that until I tested the top bunk the 2nd day.   The top bunk mattress did not have a box spring but was okay and did not sag. However, because it had a thick plastic covering, it was somewhat noisy and very distracting and not the standard you would expect if renting a room.    So 2 out of the two bunk beds really weren't good."
Although,the host had offered a roll-a-way bed and a blow-up bed as other options,I opted out of staying for 3 more days after 2 days.   My brother and I needed to have good sleeps the final 3 days of the 5-day trip.   It sure didn't seem likely that the roll-away and blow-up mattress would be any better than the bunk beds - especially the blow up.  As such,I didn't try them.    We needed 2 good beds.  There also would not have been room in the bedroom for both of them.,,
My  recommendation is that the host try sleeping in the bunk beds herself for a couple of days to fairly judge my complaint.  She indicated to me that no one else has complained.  I highly suspect that the bunk beds are rarely used and if so,they are not used for more than a couple of days.    If the hostess agrees that the bunk beds are substandard,I feel it will be reasonable to request that I be reimbursed for at least 1/2 the cost of the 3 days I was unable to use her home.,,,
Overall,the hostess had a reasonably accommodating home that was clean.   If using this place,I recommend asking for the large bedroom with the regular twin bed.   The beds in that room would be fine for 5 days or more.  Unless the bunk-beds are replaced in the small bedroom with mattresses with box springs,I would not recommend staying in that small bedroom more than 2 nights if you want to feel well rested in the morning.,,

1173306,35008790,2015-06-14,33155960,Pradeep,It was a wonderful experience staying at Nicole's house. She is a very nice person and always ensure that you have comfortable stay. She is always reachable through text messages and respond promptly. Even she used to visit personally and ensure that you don't have any issues.
I booked the place just one day before my stay and I was delighted that everything was already setup before my arrival. She handed over the keys to me so that I can come and go out anytime.,,,,,
The house is exactly same as it looks in the pictures. Neighborhood is very calm and nice. I was able to find the street parking spot for my car without any difficulty!,,,,,
Overall,"my stay at Nicole's home was comfortable and nice. Thanks a lot Nicole for your warm welcome and hospitality!\"",,,,
1173306,46552047,2015-09-11,3949012,Don,Nicole is an excellent host and most helpful on the local ways and means of getting about. She is fast and thoughtful with email and phone responses.
I had only one issue and that is mainly because of where I am from and what I expect without thinking to ask. The room had a fan,but no AC. Unfortunately,the weather was hot and humid which for me personally made sleeping difficult.,,,

5904992,31841060,2015-05-10,32301135,Kim,"The arrival was almost seamless, I rang the bell for the incorrect floor, the 2nd floor neighbor was kind and got me to the correct floor.  Thomas' roommate let me in and besides handing me the keys and saying hello when I returned my first evening I felt as if I had the place to myself. The neighbor is very cute. Parking was a breeze, this is a big statement for being in Boston.  The bed was comfortable, despite only a bottom sheet and one full size pillow in a sham.  Bathroom was acceptable.  I would definitely come back."

5904992,33303979,2015-05-26,20948655,Austin,"This place was great. It's a brand new apartment building which makes the stay even better. It's located very very close to a major train line which makes transportation effortless. The area looks a little sketchy but I assure you it's perfectly safe. Uber is also very cheap,  we didn't pay more than $16 for a ride the entire trip. Bring towels for the apartment and have a great time."
12932001,83110293,2016-07-01,49102500,Amanda,We spent 10 lovely days at Derek's beautiful home in JP.
The photography fails to do this place justice - it's the very definition of a hidden gem. This gorgeous Victorian home is furnished with beautiful items likely gathered from a lifetime of traveling- or so I like to think :) The kitchen is a wannabe chef's dream with a professional grade stove that responds to every twitch or tweak you could hope for. It was a dream come true for my husband to cook on it. The kitchen has everything you would need including little details like ziplock bags,tupperware and all common spices and seasonings. As if that were enough - there was coffee and even a lovely bottle of Malbec to greet us. It was clear that this is a home that makes every effort to be a wonderful host to those who stay there.,,,,
The house also has a high chair,laundry,wifi and a lovely back yard with a weber grill and outdoor seating. Each room has a ceiling fan which is very helpful in the heat although the house is nicely protected by the heat anyway. The greatest virtue is the location. This house is ideally,almost obscenely well located. The house is 3 minutes walk from Stonybrook  T station which places you on the Orange line,a direct shot into the heart of Boston in under 15 minutes. And literally on the doorstep are 2 amazing family parks if you are bringing your little ones along for the ride. If you are feeling adventurous there are two further parks no more than 10 minutes away while the Sam Adams Brewery complex has a host of cafes and bars within a 10 minutes walk. If you want to stretch your legs a little further you can stroll to Whole Foods or the Centre Street stretch of Jamaica Plain where there are an abundance of cafes,stores and mischief to be found!.
This is comfortably the best Air BnB we've ever stayed within -  perfect location,"a characterful house and a wonderful way to begin your Boston Adventure.\"",,,,

12932001,92563198,2016-08-09,76157235,Kristin,"The house was very cute and comfy. The only thing to be aware of is that the full bathroom can only be accessed by walking through one of two bedrooms. There are window AC units which helped a lot when it was very warm, but overall the home stayed fairly cool. There were plenty of bathroom amenities, which I really appreciated. The decor and vibe of the house is pretty neat. Overall, it was a good place to stay."
579605,2099661,2012-08-26,2848922,Sharon,"The condo is beautifully maintained and furnished.  Clearly, Lance has worked hard to make all features of a guests stay stress free.  I would reccomend this condo to travelers who don't mind an urban neighborhood and want accomodations that have charm and authenticity."
579605,2603420,2012-10-14,3240655,Eva Cullen,"There were 3 of us middle aged women who stayed at the Mayhew. First of all, we wished we were told that the condo was on the 3rd floor, no elevator and had very narrow-steep stairs. Dragging our luggage 3 floors up/down was painful. Secondly, upon arrival , there was no bath soap, just sheets and bedspreed on the 2 beds no blankets, with 58-62 degrees weather forecast for the week, and no sheets provided for the futon in the tiny room off the kitchen. So 2 of us had to share a bed for the week. We asked for  and received extra blantkets  and towels only. We did not get any bath soap so we had to find an open store in an unfamiliar neighborhood that sold soap on our first night.. Third, the lights in the kitchen and dining room were so dim we could barely see each other. It was corrected the night before  we left! Too late! Fourth, we were expected to leave the place clean, carry the garbage down to 3 floors, take off all sheets and make sure that the kitchen dishes are cleaned or in dishwasher already cleaned. If all of these were expected of the renters--why were we charged cleaning deposit? NO dishwasher soap was provided either until the day before we left. Fifth, on our last day, we woke up with heavy gas smell in the condo and the stove was not working.  Apparently, there was work scheduled for that day in the basement! The least they could have done is warn us so we could have left the condo early, have breakfast out and not have to deal with the nauseating gas smell."
579605,11791506,2014-04-15,11430678,Sam,A beautiful building and an even nicer apartment. Although my friends and I only stayed the weekend it was a wonderful experience and I plan on staying here again in the future. With only a short walk to the red line you have practically all of Boston at your fingertips. All aspects of the stay were made clear and direct with the guide that was posted on the wall near the kitchen and checkout was easy and painless. I would much rather stay at one of Lance's locations than a hotel any day. The review with the 3 older women was absolutely comical and it was part of a running joke our whole stay.
579605,21507608,2014-10-19,15679312,James,Great sized apartment for 5 people which was very clean and in a great location. Host was always available to help out and answer any questions. Great place to stay!
579605,21800581,2014-10-24,15295254,Mihkel,"Great place to stay. We never met the host, but this was ok for us. Easy instructions how to access the place and what we have to do when we leave. No complaints!"
579605,22657344,2014-11-11,22216905,Shota,"we really had a good time in the beautiful house. the location of this house is also amazing. there are many shops where we can buy some stuff quickly and next to the house, we had a so cute and cool restaurant! at the first day of trip, we had dinner there. i think im gonna ask him to let me stay this house definitely when im gonna stay Boston again. of course i recommend it to my friends too."
"thank you so much for letting us stay!\"",,,,,
579605,29173983,2015-04-05,23495491,Antonio,"First of all, this rental is a full unit rental, so you don't need to, and most likely won't interact with the owner at all.  I don't have the slightest problem with that.  If anything, made the stay more comfortable."
Everything is handled via emails and a custom app for the rental,which is modern and convenient: you can check in in the middle of the night if that's what's your schedule is like.,,,,
The price is better than most hotels.,,,,,
The units is huge! For Boston standards at least.  Has two rooms,bathroom,living room,dinning room,kitchen and a small room on the back.  The view of the city is also quite good.,
Warning to older travelers: it's on a third floor,and no elevator since it's an old building.  So if you are carrying huge luggage you might struggle.,,,,
Dorchester might not be the best neighborhood of Boston,but this particular area of Dorchester is quite good: it is safe,reasonably clean,reasonably close to the T (and there are buses there too if you don't want to walk),close to a shopping mall (which includes a grocery supermarket) and to several small restaurants (next to a very good one actually).,
"I would definitively stay here again.\"",,,,,
579605,31879005,2015-05-11,15281726,Caroline,"Our stay at the Mayhew was just okay. We communicated throughout our stay with John of Swank Properties through the AirBNB messaging system. If you stay in a Swank Property, it will feel a bit more corporate because you're renting from a company rather than staying in a person's home. Before arriving, John was very accommodating in allowing us to access the apartment a few hours before scheduled check-in time. The apartment was very clean and spacious, and all amenities we could've needed were provided. There's a coffee shop a short walk away, a restaurant right next door, and it is conveniently located between two T stops."
Unfortunately,on the second week,we lost both AC and hot water in the apartment. We were told neither could be fixed until after our stay was going to be over. We did ask to have access to another unit for showers,but we did not receive a reply before our stay ended.,,
Needless to say,"our stay at The Mayhew was colored due to the issues with the apartment.\"",,,,
579605,80362462,2016-06-17,53411754,Adam,"Place was ideal for our stay in Boston. It was close to a grocery store and a Target, easy to get to downtown, and had plenty of room for my family. It would have been helpful to know that parking on the side streets was not allowed between 10 and 2, and the spots on Boston street filled up quickly each day."
579605,92869298,2016-08-10,3257325,Mike,"The apartment was spacious, clean, and had all of the basic amenities needed to make it a comfy visit."
Pro Tips:,,,,,
1) Check out the nearby Dorchester Brewing Company,,,,,
2) ~30 minute bus ride to Fenway park,,,,,
3) Plenty of lyft service nearby,,,,,
4) Parking was plentiful,but be sure to read and reread the signs since each little area has some restrictions.,,,,
5) Driving an 18 wheeler on many Boston streets looks very challenging,so leave the big truck home.,,,,
6) Finding a parking spot in other neighborhoods can be difficult,"so consider using public transit. \"",,,,

The condo is in the middle of a really nice new area. Although not representative of many parts of Boston but that is a good thing. I highly recommend. Uberx from the airport is about $15 or so. The convention center is a 5 to 10 minute walk down the street and over the foot bridge."

This is a very competitively-priced home-away-from-home that is complete and local to everything Boston …especially the waterfront and the airport.    It has everything needed (including comfort & great view) and I would know since I had the good fortune to stay here for 6 months.   I’ve been to Boston many times over the past few decades and this has been by far the best stay experience!!  I give significant credit to the owner/host Jennifer, who created this wonderful place and you’ll notice right away that she takes significant pride in it."

I was sad to leave! If you need a place to stay near the seaport, convention center or anywhere nearby I'm Boston, this location is convenient, the apartment is clean, has lots of great amenities like a Sonos music player and laundry, and is just really comfortable and private. Loved it!"

I was there for a conference at the Westin down the street which was a very short walk. All of the evening activities were even closer to her place so the location is hard to beat. Wireless and the nice desk made it great for getting work done as well. Highly recommend!

Just 5 min from the World Trade Center and lots of nice places to eat on Seaport. 20 min from South Station. Finally, Jennifer was a great host, super friendly and flexible, and extremely responsive. One of my best airbnb experiences!"

The Seaport District is beautiful with plenty to do.  My only regret was that we couldn't stay longer. Jennifer was very warm and welcoming when we met her.

Jennifer was great at communicating and was flexible about our arrival and departure.

13421289,88035826,2016-07-23,69395673,Julie,"Christian is an intelligent, polite, and courteous host. Our plans were very free flowing and involved coming and going at odd times, as well as bringing in an unexpected additional guest, but Christian took it all in stride. As soon as I mentioned a need, it was taken care of immediately.  The price was outstanding, and the location just blocks from the airport. Driving in Boston is not fun, and parking can be problematic, but at Christian's place, a car is truly not necessary. Maverick Square is a three minute walk up the street, where you can catch a Blueline train or a bus, on Boston's well-developed and extensive transportation system. I would definitely recommend staying there."
13421289,90062125,2016-07-31,32178274,Tapish,Christian is a really nice person with a really nice and comfortable house very close to the airport. Really loved my stay.

Our car got towed (our own fault for not reading signs -- be aware of street cleaning days if you stay here) and he immediately helped us find it and got us a ride to it.
We are in the middle of a road trip and he even warned us that there had been several zika cases in Florida if we were visiting there. Overall SUPER fantastic guy and the place was perfect for what we needed too. Simple,close to town and transportation,clean,"cool decorations. Would definitely stay here again.\"",,

We wanted a place to stay close to the airport since we had to leave at 5am the next day and Guy's place fit our budget and location. Just three hours before our arrival Guy accepted our request and was very responsive to communication to help make our arrival easy. He helped carry my luggage up the three flights of stairs, showed us directions from his rooftop and made sure we had towels, linens and wifi. It was a comfortable place to stay overall with a great location near the airport."

Everything was as described.  Enjoyed all the modern amenities and cool location.  So close to Fenway, we had to see a game.  Met a Red Sox player after the game going up in the elevator.  Kinda cool.  Lots of services across the street.  I would stay at this location again or at any of the hosts other properties when traveling."

The neighborhood is really save and all neighbors are very nice. We parked our car directly in front of the house.,,,,,
We felt home at this place from the first moment as we entered the house. Everything was clean and organized. We arrived very very late (2am) and it was no problem to get the key.,,,,,
The water is only some minutes away and the metro about 7-10 minutes walk. You need 10 minutes by metro to go to Boston city (Harbor/ Aquarium). From there,you can discover Boston in any direction.,,,,
Unfortunately,Christine was not present at the time as we stayed there,but she gave us a nice contact to her friend Liz. Both are very helpful and responded to our question immediately. We also asked them for recommendations about what to do,where to go and where to eat etc. in Boston and they gave us an excellent list!,,
I would like to thank Christine and Liz for their home and all helpful advises. If we plan to come back to Boston again,"I would definitely book this place again. Thank you!!!  \"",,,,

He and I connected enough over email and a couple of times by phone to solidify details around arrival and departure times, key pick up and drop off, and transportation to and from the house to the airport.  When we arrived Charles had prepared us a folder of very useful information about the area and home often leaving notes around the house to help us. He was also thoughtful enough to leave us some breakfast items, which proved helpful as we arrived late in the evening and were unable to make it to the store."
We felt very comfortable in the home,it was warm enough given the cold weather,and the area was perfect! The neighbourhood was quiet,clean,had several great places to visit,and easy to travel from via subway.

Her instructions were clear and she offered recommendations for us as well. Her place was clean and cozy; the air mattress was already set up for us upon arrival. For 5 people, we felt like we had a lot of space. The neighborhood of Little Italy is awesome; we had a great time there. We would love to come back someday."
3006311,39302438,2015-07-22,34782421,Elisabeth,"We absolutely LOVED our little spot in the North End!! Elizabeth's apartment was clean and inviting, and 30 steps to the Freedom trail and Hanover Street. The apartment was perfect for us. Located close to many of the sites and things we wanted to see. Boston really is unbelievably small. In the evening upon return, we would sit and watch and listen out the windows to the views down the street of the local neighborhood, and then on past to the high rises of the city. Loved the neighborhood and the food was FANTASTIC! Anything you want only steps away! Definitely not a noisy area I did not find."
We did not mind the daily exit or return to the apartment as there is no elevator. Nor mind that we parked .4 of a mile a way and left the car parked for our 3 day visit. Elizabeth gave us great advice as to where to park at a discount.  She also offered ideas on things to visit and where to get cannoli.,,,,,
We slept great every evening with the help of the air conditioner provided in the bedroom.,,,,,
We did not cook in the apartment,but used a couple of plates and cups which we washed before we left; but plenty of cooking things and dishes if you plan to do this.,,,,
Had trouble figuring out the internet,but I really didn't care nor try too hard,I was on vacation and prefer often to not look at a computer.,,,
My only trouble and regret was on departure when we could not find appropriate parking to load our things,and in my hurried departure forgot to remove our things from her fridge. I hope this did not cause any problems and sincerely apologize for this.,,,,
Great 1st Airbnb experience!!,,,,,

3006311,40464897,2015-07-31,35520526,Socorro,"Liz's place is centered right at the north end. It couldn't have been a more perfect location!! There are so many restaurants and within walking distance of everything you want to see and do. Her place was very clean, spacious, and very comfortable with everything you need. It is on the 5th floor so it's a bit of a hike when carrying a heavy suitcase but other than that you get a good exercise. The only complain I would have is that there is only AC in the bedroom, there are a couple of fans around the house but with the heat and humidity they didn't help much.  Overall, I definitely recommend staying at liz's."
3006311,54801216,2015-11-23,26862825,Nolan,"Liz is awesome.  From my interactions with her, she seemed professional, organized, and very friendly.  She left simple and detailed instructions for check-in, and kept a very clean apartment.  She is the ideal Airbnb host."
The apartment is in an incredible location,"and serves as a perfect \"\"home-base\"\" for tourists who want to get the most out of a visit to Boston.  While we didn't end up cooking anything",Liz offered access to her general pantry items (i.e. herbs/spices/oils),which I felt was quite hospitable.,,
I give my highest recommendation to Liz as a host,"and to the apartment as a great place to stay.\"",,,,
3006311,92651560,2016-08-09,3763051,Melanie,"Liz was very communicative and accommodating right away. We waited until the last minute to book a hotel in Boston so the prices to stay in the downtown area were quite high! We ended up booking Liz's place as it was a great price in a great area and we figured we just needed a place to sleep at night. It was easy for us to find her place and find the keys and ended up loving the area! It was nice to be in the North End surrounded by great restaurants and be away a little bit from the more touristy downtown parts of the city. We ended up only seeing Liz once during the 3 nights we were there as we weren't there very much and she was also not home very much but when we did get a chance to meet her, she was lovely to talk to and also shared a love for travel which was nice. She also recommended some great restaurants. Would definitely recommend someone stay here on a trip to Boston!"

He was very hospitable and provided us with any amenities we needed. Tivan made a great first experience with airbnb!

13594886,84855025,2016-07-09,76846627,Victoria,"Andrea and Tivan were amazing hosts who were super friendly and helpful. They gave us detailed and clear instructions on how to find the place and obtain the key so we knew exactly where we were going and what we were doing. The place itself was very clean and beautifully furnished, with everything we needed provided for us - the bed was especially comfortable and we enjoyed a restful night of sleep. We would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a great place to stay that is conveniently close to the Logan airport!"

Comfortable bed with drawers, table, closet, and locking door. Quiet neighborhood. Parking can be really difficult, especially if you come in late."
I'm not sure if it's normal,but the check out instructions had me strip the sheets from the bed,empty my garbage can,and put my towel in the laundry. Seems kind of like the host's responsibility to me,"but maybe this is common on air bnb.\"",

The apartment was clean and modern, and our hosts were friendly and welcoming.  While we were only there for one night, our room was incredibly hot. The AC is central, but was either turned off at night, or being in a basement room doesn't allow for the hot air to circulate out. It was uncomfortable to say the least."
Also,it doesn't mention on the listing that upon arrival,you're to make your own bed.  You only find this out when you get your check in instructions.  Our hosts kindly made up our bed since we asked due tonour late arrival,but if this is the case,"it should be mentioned in the listing. \"",

Our private room was clean and comfortable, and we felt completely at ease as visitors in their home. Andrea and Tivan's condo is the perfect place to stay if you are flying in or out of Boston Logan Airport. The Airport T Station to catch the Airport Shuttle is a quick and easy 5 minute walk from their front door.  They live in a safe, family-friendly neighborhood and my son and I thoroughly enjoyed dinner at Santarpios's Pizza just a few blocks away."

Communication was great throughout with Andrea,we were met by Tivan upon arrival who was very friendly and showed us around,he suggested using Uber to get around as I wasn't too comfortable using the metro,Tivan then suggested which area we should visit to get the Boston 'feel' and he was right,Faneuil Hall area,$14 by Uber

Bis ins Zentrum ist es nur eine Station mit der Blue Line. Für uns super, da wir nur eine Nacht in Boston waren und Flughafen & das Stadtzentrum direkt um die Ecke gelegen sind. Andrea haben wir leider nicht kennengelernt. Tivan war super nett.  Wir hatten das Badezimmer oben für uns alleine - alles bestens, sauber und zu empfehlen!!"

They were welcoming and kind, and they are so much FUN! The best storytellers, and I always looked forward to coming home and eating dinner with them.  I honestly can't say enough good things about my stay.  The house is gorgeous, Alicia has worked very hard on the decor.  The bedroom is the perfect size with a generous closet.  Lots of light and space throughout the house.  My favorite spot ended up being the music room window seat (well, my dog picked the spot).  I would read or listen to Kostas play his guitar....magical!  The neighborhood is so cool, very similar to Austin in the \"\"vibe\"\".  Lots of great restaurants"
2295530,12120114,2014-04-23,2058333,Karyn,"Generosity and graciousness are things that immediately came to mind upon meeting Alicia and Kostas. Within minutes of arriving at the door, we were oriented with the kitchen, the bathroom facilities, and given a front door key. Settled into a lovely private room that felt like a home away from home, we had full confidence that we discovered a super place to stay."
Location is fantastic: a 10-miniute walk from a diverse selection of Center Street restaurants,a 3-minute walk from the T-transit,which can quickly take you to downtown,and best of all,a 2-minute walk from the City Feed and Supply Store. At the store,we purchased and then enjoyed a delicious afternoon sandwich and coffee while sat on a sidewalk bench in this very hip but not too trendy Jamaica Plains neighborhood.
From our experience,the location,convenience and comfort of this listing is understated as we really are unable to imagine a better place for a couple to stay while visiting Boston.  In terms of affordability,this place is a steal!,,
We really enjoy gentle rising and slowly brewing a pot of coffee Morning coffee and toast and an evening glass of wineThe kitchen is arranged in a welcoming way,and we felt the,,,,

My daughter was living 3 blocks away. Kostas and Alicia are a kind, considerate, older couple, long time Boston residences. They offered us the use of the rooms in the house while we were there. But we were busy most days attending graduation related events."
It is nice,clean,older house on a quiet street in Jamaica Plains,a funky neighborhood of Boston,but easy walking distance to the T(subway).  All the rooms had high ceilings and big windows overlooking the neighborhood in all directions including the corner bedroom in which we stayed. Alicia cooked pancakes for us one day and Kostas played guitar and gave my son a boxing lesson. We ate breakfast outside on the patio under the grapevine.,
They have two friendly dogs. There are steep stair at the entrance which was not a problem for us but might be a problem for some. The shared bathroom is small but very clean. We were easily able to use their Wifi. Alicia very kindly drove me to the airport.,,,,,
This is a great place for a week stay in Boston that is half the price of hotels,centrally located and you can meet real Bostonians in bargain!  We would definitely stay here again.,,,,

2295530,13151866,2014-05-20,1641030,Catrin,"I spent three nights at Alicia and Kostas' home and I found them to be a really beautiful and warm couple. They made every effort to make sure that my friend and I felt at home; buying my friend a birthday cake, making us pancakes, spending time with us over a glass of wine in the evenings and a cup of coffee in the mornings, and showing us round the block. It was a truly lovely experience and made the long visit to Boston all the more special. The house was clean and their street and neighbourhood was safe (but also fun and full of character). They also have two cute dogs that provided lots of entertainment! It was a pleasure to meet them both and I would definitely stay with them again :-)"

2295530,13929487,2014-06-08,11841709,Hannah,Alicia and Kostas were absolutely wonderful hosts. The room was a reasonable size for two people with a large closet sufficient for more than the amount of clothing a reasonable person might travel with. We shared a bathroom with the hosts without any trouble at all - they even had a few shelves cleared for us to leave things in the bathroom. Their dogs are small and very respectful if you're not keen on pets.
The area is quaint with a small downtown area we walked to for dinner one evening. I would have felt comfortable walking alone at night without question.,,,,,
Alicia and Kostas are very warm and wholly interesting as people. I looked forward to seeing them when we returned in the evenings. They set out scones and coffee in the morning for us with no extra charge and gave us T passes! We had a busy schedule while in town,"but spent our last morning in Boston talking with them on their shaded porch which was as great a close to the trip I could imagine. I'll certainly keep them in mind if I find myself in the city again. \"",,,,

The neighborhood is beautiful; there is a whole foods within walking distance and the city subway is a block away (super convenient). I had a wonderful trip and would definitely stay with them again. Thank you for a great visit!
2295530,14577106,2014-06-22,15853272,Jmm,"I stayed fro a week with Kostas and Alicia, and I had a very good time. They are good in giving their guest their personal space and their privacy, and we had also very nice conversations in the evenings. Alicia had very nice muffins in the morning, I still remember the taste, and Kostas is a good cook! When I arrived late the first evening they offered me a cup of their home made lentil soup."
The rom is convenient with a large wardrobe,and a nice desk on which you can work and a comfortable bed. The internet connection is very good! I can recommend staying with them! They live in a nice neighborhood and it is less than two minutes from the T and less then five minutes from the Hubway system (for renting bikes).,,,,
When I need to go to Boston,I know where to go!,,,,

The bathroom is shared with the owners, but there was never a conflict or a difficulty.  Everything was clean and pleasant.  Alicia made coffee and had raisin toast or a scone waiting for me every morning.  Kostas offered to give me a free boxing lesson, but it never managed to work out.  Access in and out was easy and private.  There is a steep stair at the entrance which wasn't a problem for my 65 year old bones, but might be a factor for some.  My hosts were kind and generous, I was free to have as little or as much contact with them as I wanted.  I enjoyed playing guitar with Kostas, and watching the World Cup soccer games with both of them.  I highly recommend their home for anyone's stay in the Boston area.  They are only about 2 blocks to a metro station.  Centre Street in Jamaica Plain is only a few blocks away with restaurants, and a Whole Foods. Thank you Alicia and Kostas for a wonderful stay."

I had a very nice stay and loved their company. Their place is fabulous, really nice room with lots of storage space, very good vibe, and you can even work out in the garage, where Kostas has a boxing studio with regular classes! The neighbourhood is beautiful, and Alicia showed me all the good spots to buy food or have coffee. In short: best hosts ever, 20 out of 10!!!"

Therefor, it was necessary for me to have a place where I could lay my head at night and also prepare for my meetings in a relaxed and quiet atmosphere. This place was perfect for that. When I felt the need for human interaction, Alicia and Kostas were both simply lovely to talk to and wonderfully gracious hosts. The room was perfect, the WiFi great, the location also perfect for my purposes. I can easily see myself coming back again and again and I hope to do so."

The house is absolutely breathtaking and looks even better than the photos. Very cozy,relaxing,spacious,and far superior than any hotel I have ever stayed in. It's very close to the T,Whole Foods,CVS

Alicia & Kostas are the most amazing hosts I've ever met (and I've always been lucky in this case). It was a pleasure to talk with them and to stay at their charming house. Just wish we had more time to spend there. My warmest recommendations.

Good coffee and a delicious scone were waiting for me every morning!  The room was cozy and comfortable, with two large windows."
Alicia and Kostas are both extremely warm,interesting people.  I loved chatting with them in the evening at the kitchen table.  Their home is a three minute walk to the train and just a 5-10 minute walk to the main downtown.  I enjoyed a nice run around the nearby Jamaica Pond.,,,,

But I have to say that our time spent in Boston (which was our first time in New England) was highlighted by our time with this kind couple. Our leisurely mornings included tea and scones or muffins from a local bakery as well as a chance to converse and get to know each other. They treated my husband and I like old and dear friends from the start.  Our intention in traveling through airbnb is so we can meet people like the two of them: good hearted and interesting people who we can share our time with. We look forward to returning to Boston and seeing our new friends again! (And hearing more of Kosta's guitar)"

2295530,21283685,2014-10-14,2921556,Carol,"Staying at Alicia and Kostas' charming home was a highlight for me after many years of hotel stays in Boston.  This time I was visiting Boston for Parent's weekend at Berklee College of Music, and also decided to give my sister a tour of Boston for 6 days.  The home is a 3 minute walk from the Orange line in a very safe neighborhood in Jamaica Plains.  Only 4 T stops from where we wanted to be in Back Bay area....and very easy to get to downtown and North End restaurants as well.  My sister and I enjoyed  pastries and coffee and great conversation each morning.  We LOVED their invite to a hosted brunch Sunday morning, which included my college daughter and friend.  Sat out on the patio under a shaded vine arbor.  Loved the 2 Boston terriers.  It could not have been more enjoyable.  Alicia and Kostas make you feel like family, and I know I will see them again in my travels.  I highly recommend their place, as it is quite charming and well located for those who want a quiet place yet close access to city life."

We were so lucky to get the opportunity to be hosted by them, they are very nice and so interesting to talk to! We wish we could have stayed longer - we were only in Boston for 2 nights as my wife Sarah attended an exhibition and conference nearby - but we will definitely come back as soon as we can to spend some more time in their lovely home. They also have two very cute and quiet dogs, Mugsy and Babe."
They provided towels,wifi,and a delicious breakfast (very good coffee and treats!),which was such a nice touch. On the first day,Kostas also had us try a delicious Mediterranean meal which he made himself - yummy!,
The area (Jamaica Plain) is great,with very beautiful houses and a nice neighborhood feel and the subway is really close (it takes about 15 minutes to go downtown from their home).,,,,

So, I will repeat how enjoyable Alicia and Kostas are and that they are very caring hosts. We loved their warm hospitality and their comfortable home.  Kostas made a delicious pasta dish when we arrived and every morning Alicia had coffee and fresh pastries waiting for us.  Kostas played the guitar in the mornings and it was the perfect start to our day."
We enjoyed conversation and got to know these two wonderful people on a personal level.  Their two dogs were very well behaved and friendly.,,,,,

Was a small additional charge,but well worth it after a tiring flight.,,,,
Alicia and Kostas' home is in Jamaica Plain-a charming cozy suburb,,,,,
about 20 min from downtown by subway.  The curved streets are lined by well kept traditional homes. Alicia and Kostas' home is also traditional with high ceilings,wood floors-(just what I like,)-and  a country charm atmosphere.  The grapevine growing out the front,(to show Kostas' Greek heritage),shades an outdoor sitting area that would be very nice is the summer. The guest bedroom is small but very welcoming. Good light,attractively decorated
Alicia and Kostas have lived in Boston for a number of years and are very happy to answer any questions and make suggestions.  They are both very interested in music. and Kostas' plays gentle classical guitar in the evening. The dogs are an important part of the family and add energy and antics that are quite amusing,,,,,

We arrived as strangers and left as friends.  They welcomed us into their home, introduced us to Jamaica Plain, and spoiled us with tasty pastries from a local bakery each morning.  Their two lovable boston terriers, Mugsy and Babe, were very affectionate and entertaining.    The proximity to the subway (less than 5 minute walk to the orange line), combined with the safety of the neighbourhood, makes this the ultimate home away from home.  Thank you Kostas and Alicia."

2295530,22848335,2014-11-16,6186933,Arthur & Liz,"Staying with Alicia and Kostas was a fantastic experience. The room was cozy and clean, the neighborhood has great dining options and is very close to the Stony Brook T stop, and the company of Alicia, Kostos, Babes, and Mugsey was delightful. We really felt like we were at home!  You will not be disappointed if you stay here."
2295530,23338075,2014-11-29,7114706,Jan,Kostas and Alicia were wonderful hosts.  They made tea for us each day and we ate muffins together in the morning while we shared life stories.  Their home is very clean and artistic.  Kostas plays the guitar beautifully and Alicia is a fantastic home decorator.  We highly recommend them to anyone who wants to visit Boston.
2295530,23899233,2014-12-14,23164194,Sharon,"I had a great experience staying with Alicia and Kostas Smith in Sunlit & Beautiful in Boston's Jamaica Plain. They opened up their home completely and I felt very pampered and comfortable. The bedroom is cheery and immaculate, and even though I am a light sleeper I slept soundly. The bed and everything about the room was comfy. Alicia and Kostas treated me to a delicious breakfast while I stayed with them, and they are lovely caring people. They made recommendations about restaurants and travel, and they truly want their AIRBNB guests to feel at home and happy. It was my first time using AIRBNB and I imagine I won't have many hosts as considerate and attentive as Alicia and Kostas."
2295530,24196500,2014-12-22,24363016,Daniel,"Alicia and Kostas were amazing hosts. I was able to bring my dog along with me and we both were immediately welcomed into their home. I really appreciated the great care Alicia and Kostas took to make me feel integrated into the neighborhood-meeting the neighbors, going on walks with the dogs and seeing the area, and getting to know them. I was able to have a balance of time alone when I needed it, but was encouraged to hang out and get to know them. Spending the Saturday night around the TV, watching the Wizard of Oz, drinking wine and eggnog and just sharing stories about who we were was a really great experience and allowed me to connect on a deeper level than just host and guest. Each morning I had coffee and a pastry ready, which was really thoughtful. I highly recommend Alicia and Kostas for anyone looking for an experience in Boston where you feel like a local, as that is what Alicia and Kostas did for me. Thank you SO SO much!"
2295530,24430480,2014-12-28,24382435,Andres,"Alicia and Kostas are great hosts: warm, good people who make you feel very welcome. We shared good conversations with them early in the morning and then went about our day. Their place is cozy, clean, and conveniently located next to the subway in the fantastic Jamaica Plain neighborhood. Very recommended!"
2295530,25528034,2015-01-18,26007567,Alex,"Alicia and Kostas were the perfect hosts. We felt welcomed, comfortable and literally at home with them and their wonderful house. The rooms was clean, fresh towels were placed out and an unexpected gift bag of delicious candy and goodies were left by the bedside as a welcome gesture!"
The area is convenient,close to the train lines and bus routes and a host of restaurants and  night life. Jamaica Plane is a wonderful place to explore and get to know.,,,,
We would love to come stay during the warmer months to experience the area and energy when everyone is out and about in the parks and town.,,,,,
Alicia and Kostas have done a lot of beautiful work on the house by adding decor that is pleasant and some amazingly hand crafted items by them too.,,,,,
We cannot express the serene feeling we had while waking up in the morning and softly,in the distant living room,Kostas was gently playing ethnic/eclectic guitar songs that would make John Lennon weep!,,,
All this at a price that simply cannot be beat nor the location. We would HIGHLY recommend you stay with Alicia and Kostas...you will not find better spirited,more gracious and interesting hosts.,,,,
"We will be back!\"",,,,,
2295530,26255584,2015-02-08,12673816,David,"Alicia and Kostas were great hosts! This is the 3rd time I've used airbnb, but the other two times I had the entire place to myself - this was my first time just getting a room in a home."
Alicia picked me up at the airport (for a fee) and it was well worth it. A lot of snow and it was nice not to have to figure out a taxi. Alicia then offered to take me to the market so I could get some food (I was doing a race the next day in Boston). She patiently waited for me as I took a little too long looking for goods...,,,,,
House was clean,cozy and I had some delicious lentil soup that Kostas had made - yummy! Bed was firm and comfortable and bathroom was clean and convenient...,,,,
Basically,they made  me feel very welcome in their home. They have two dogs who were great as well (if you like dogs,of course)...,,,
"I would highly recommend staying with Alicia and Kostas if you are traveling solo or as a couple. \"",,,,,
2295530,27618390,2015-03-08,28511713,Gina,Wonderful hosts. Made me feel at home and part of the family. They think of the details. (The key fob is a flashlight to light the lock at night!) Very convenient to public transportation. Quiet neighborhood. Great first airbnb experience. These hosts will be hard to match.

2295530,28661697,2015-03-28,16498497,Franz,"This was the best AirBnB I ever had. Alicia&Kostas made me fill welcome as soon as I entered their lovely home, or rather when Alicia picked me up from the airport where she had waited patiently because my plane was delayed."
The room was clean,well decorated and the rest of the house was just the same. Perfect. But the best thing about it are the two hosts. Alicia and Kostas are jus terrific. I came as a stranger and left as a good friend. They helped me with everything.,,,,
See you soon.,,,,,
oh and of course near the T-Stop stony brooks,"easy to get everywhere in a lovely neighborhood.\"",,,,

2295530,29688494,2015-04-11,5719252,Erik,"It was a pleasure staying with Alicia and Kostas. They are, as others already have pointed out, terrific hosts. Alicia picked us up at the train station and gave us valuable information about the city. We were treated with coffee and scones in the morning. And during the last day we had lunch with Alicia, Kostas and a previous Airbnb guest whom they had become friends with and who stopped by for lunch."

2295530,30391376,2015-04-21,6296351,Kimberly,I was in town by myself to run the 119th Boston Marathon. Alicia was very insightful about where to go locally in JP for a nice shake out run as well as how to best get around to places using the T or on things to do. Also always had coffee available & really opened their home up to me. My flight left earlier than the T opened so I even used the option for them to drop me off for a little extra $ & it was super convenient ! Will recommend their Airbnb to friends & when I'm back in 2016 see if their room is available.
2295530,31053901,2015-05-01,20695969,Paul,Alicia and Kostas are wonderful hosts. Their home is warm and inviting and serene. The room is cozy and comfortable. Everything is provided for an exceptional experience in Jamaica Plain. I highly recommend staying here and I will definitely return!

2295530,32055412,2015-05-13,20782294,Mimi,This was our second stay with Alicia and Kostas and it was even better than the first.  They are such welcoming hosts and it felt like we were at home.  Their house is ideally located on the Orange line and for exploring Jamaica Plain.  Getting to downtown and the North End is a piece of cake.  Alicia and Kostas are wonderful people!
2295530,32528652,2015-05-19,30853062,Claire,"Alicia and Kostas were so easygoing!  Beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood.  Really close to where I wanted to be, near family.  Close to trains, great food, etc.  I was in town for my son's graduation, close to downtown via train or Uber!"
2295530,33252903,2015-05-26,30402727,Henk,"Alicia and Kostas have been our first encounter with Airbnb hosts. They are wonderful people to stay with. In fact they have exceeded by far what one might reasonably expect from hosts in terms of hospitality, friendliness and care. We will not go into details, but future guests of any Airbnb home should realize that Alicia and Kostas have set high standards for Airbnb. Though we only have a  very limited  experience with Airbnbtells we think that it will be hard for others to attain the same level as hosts as they have. Alicia and Kostas, thank you very much!"
2295530,33527399,2015-05-29,10370685,Jo,"Alicia and Kostas are the consummate hosts!  We felt welcomed to their home and at ease immediately. They were friendly without being intrusive and they made us welcome to make use of every aspect of their home. They are tuely lovely people and a delight to visit with. Private bedroom with beautiful linen. Very comfortable kitchen and living space. Also, The location of the house is close to the train Station and it was easy to access the larger Boston area.  There is a village close by that has some good cafés and restaurants to explore."
2295530,33717136,2015-05-31,14751535,Mengyan,"My mom and I had a very pleasant stay at Alicia and Kostas' place. We arrived much later than expected but Alicia still kindly offered pick-up. Alicia was very accommodating and helpful, and gave us valuable suggestions about sightseeing in Boston. Kostas plays great music and his boxing lessons seemed so popular! The house is awesome and conveniently located within walking distance to Whole Foods and plenty of restaurants and bars. The T station is just 3 minutes away! We really enjoyed our stay. Definitely recommend!"

Alicia gave us directions and told us things to do around town. The neighboorhoud is exciting and vibrant. We had a wonderful Alicia and Kostas / Boston experience.
2295530,34860332,2015-06-13,25318151,Sean,Alicia and Kostas were amazing.  This was first class service for our very first ABB experience and were were completely satisified.  The house was very easy to find 2.5 blocks from Orange Line.  Just up the street is the busy Centre shopping square with a Hubway stop.  We took bikes all over Boston.  Only a 15 minute ride to Fenway.
This house is one stop or a 10 minute bike ride by Jamaica Pond to the Harvard Aboredum...a must see for a picnic.,,,,,
We went there for a wedding and I knew I needed an iron.  Alicia had starch!  Their puppy was sweet and no allergy issues.  Kostas offers free boxing lessons.  And the artistic feel in the house is inspirational.,,,,,
Sam Adams brewery is a 10 minute walk and has free tastings on Wednesday nights.  Jamaica Plains is a great spot for shopping,biking through the parks,and viewing really beautiful homes.,,,

The house is in walking distance of public transport and the cute main drag, Centre St. Alicia was so kind to my husband and I, we enjoyed sipping coffee with her in the mornings. My husband was ill on the final day of our stay, and she picked up medicine for him! Talk about above and beyond :)"

The hosts are wonderful people, we felt like we've met old friends. We had morning coffee with them and shared our life stories in the beautiful yard under a grapevine canopy. The entire neighborhood is charming, close to the train and lots of good restaurants. We walked back from watching the 4th of July fireworks at midnight and felt safe."
Thank you very much,"Alicia and Kostas for the great place to stay and the best memories.\"",,,,
2295530,37974954,2015-07-12,21208938,Yuki,"Alicia and Kostas are super nice couple, also an awesome host, willing to help you like your family. They take care us very friendly and warmly for 3 days we had stayed there. Awesome coffee and black tea every morning, even have made the delicious breakfast for us. That's very touched my heart. The house is perfect, we eating together, singing together, and dancing together. You couldn't imagine how beautiful are the pictures. We will never forget it forever, and will definitely come here again. Miss Alicia and Kostas and baby(a lovely and smart puppy) very very much."
2295530,38896574,2015-07-19,36938746,Mary,"As soon as we first enetered their front gate, we were greeted by Kostas. He was sitting around the outdoor table drinking coffee, it was at this spot we were invited the next morning to join them for tea and coffee. The interior of the house is beautiful and welcoming. The bedroom has a large closet which provided plenty of room to store clothes  and other bags. One of the many awesome things about our stay was the bed. It was very, very comfortable. Additionally a floor mattress is available if needed. The house is full of amazing art work, including wood carvings made by Kostas. Alicia gave us the tour of the house and welcomed us to use or be in any part of it. Surrounding the house is one of the most incredible outdoor spaces of any city house. From a patio with a natural roof, to a garage doubling as a boxing studio, and plently of comfortable outdoor furniture. The house is incredible, Alicia and Kostas are wonderful, the next great thing? Location. This house is a 2 min walk to the Stony Brook, Orange Line, T stop, Whole Foods is a 5 min walk, and Jamaica Plain is a great neighborhood. Kostas gives boxing lessons almost everyday and I was invited to partake. That lesson was the first time in my life I was shown up by a 75 year old man. Kostas, including being in great condition, is a incredible motivator and teacher. This listing is perfect for any group of 3 or less who want to visit Boston. Highly recommend."
2295530,40561807,2015-08-01,5100847,Beth,"We stayed with Alicia, Kostas, and Babe for 2 weeks, and the experience was great - from our late night arrival to the day we left. Our travel arrangements brought us in town after midnight the night before our reservation, so Alicia found a neighbor's place for us to stay - in the morning we just walked over to her house (no taxis, no uber, no hassle). The first week, my eldest son & I found the room comfortable (nice firm bed) for sleeping, while I found time during the day to log into work remotely at the secretariat using their wi-fi. The house is a quick walk to the Orange Line of the T, which made an easy commute to Cambridge for my son to go to his workshop (I would tag along to explore in the morning and evening - get the 7-day pass if you're there for a week). Alicia always provided coffee in the morning and made the kitchen available for cooking breakfast and dinner (and furthering my son's cooking abilities).  The second week, my younger son joined us and slept in the room on a pad (comfortable). Two boys in Boston - there's only so much school and sight-seeing you can do and not get restless. Thank God for Kostas! The boxing sessions were the highlight of our stay. After the first workout, my one son (both row on a high school crew) said that it was much more intense than he's used to - and it was great! They both enjoyed the vigorous workout and Kostas's superb attitude and coaching. Finally, when we left, we arranged with Alicia to get a ride to the airport. After we parted at the airport terminal, we were walking to the check-in when my second son realized he didn't have his cell phone. Bummer. I texted Alicia and phoned her (left a message), and then checked in, went through security, and boarded the plane. I consoled my son with the thought that maybe Alicia would find it and mail it to us. A flight attendant called out my name - she had the cell phone! Alicia had found it in her car after walking Babe, raced back to the airport, gave it to the airline personal, and viola! I don't think you could find better people to live with for 2 weeks in Boston - gracious, courteous, accommodating, respectful, and forthright."
2295530,41107843,2015-08-04,37164963,Tara,"Alicia and Kosta are excellent hosts, they were very welcoming and fun company. They made us feel at home and have a lovely place in a great location, Jamaica Plains is a really cool suburb of Boston. The Scottish Bar that Alicia recommended serves delicious food and has a great atmosphere. And Babe is a very cool dog!"
2295530,42447982,2015-08-13,39385295,Shirley,Alicia and Kostas were excellent hosts! The room was comfortable and clean and it was nice to have air conditioning on the hot muggy days of summer. They were very generous with accommodating some items in the fridge and we had very easy use of the kitchen. Great location for public transport. Our only regret was not being able to take a boxing class with Kostas (who kindly offered but our schedule didn't bring us home until late in the evening after classes).

Jamaica Plain,where Kostas & Alicia live,is a very nice neighborhood,of low little houses with gardens,like a village inside the city.,
The area is of easy access to the center of Boston by train and buses and offers easy parking in the bordering streets.,,,,,
But pay attention to the indications about the cleaning days in the area,in which it is prohibited to park at certain hours. We didn't see it,and our car was towed. Alicia,very nicely,helped us to find it and brought us to recover our car.,
Alicia & Kostas are very cheerful,pending of all our needs very helpful in advising about what to visit,restaurants to go in the surroundings or excursions to realize in the surroundings of Boston.,,,

The area is very close to a subway station into Boston centre and there were a handful of good quality restaurants near the house too. I would highly recommend this area of Boston but especially Alicia and Kostas' house! It was our first time using AirBnB but we would definitely use it again if other places are even half this good.

Alicia was super friendly and showed us around the place, making coffee for those who like coffee. Because of their busy schedule, we didn't get to spend too much time together but we hope to be able to visit again. Baby is adorable!

They are a genuinely lovely couple, both intelligent and articulate, with great stories to tell.  It was a pleasure to sit with them during breakfast and hear about their lives.  The house is fantastic.  It's in a lovely neighbourhood, close walking distance to the subway which takes you into the centre of Boston in no time at all.  The house itself is clean and amazingly decorated.  The only con for us, and sadly it was a big one, was having to say goodbye.  You would be crazy not to book this place.  Alicia and Kostas, thank you for making us feel so welcome during our visit.  It was a pleasure to meet you (and Baby) and we will never forget our trip.  Thanks."
2295530,51898375,2015-10-25,22489411,Samantha,"Alicia and Kostas are fantastic hosts! They provided clear and easy to follow directions to their house via the train station. Their house is a short 10 minute walk, or less, from the T station. My flight got in early morning on my first day and they were kind enough to let me get into the room early. Alicia prepared coffee and toast for me each morning, which was lovely on those cold fall mornings! Kostas and Alicia made it feel like I was visiting family not strangers, creating a warm, welcoming and open home. I cannot express how grateful I am for finding them! Plus, their dog Babe is such a wonderful little guy!"

Their home is beautiful and cozy and the whole house gets a ton of natural light. The house has one bathroom but it was never a problem for us,and our room was perfect and the bed comfortable. The house is in a convenient location and we found ourselves walking around and really exploring the JP area - we walked to the Arnold Arboretum,and went on a run to Jamaica Pond.,,,
Our hosts were there when we needed them but stayed out of our way when we needed privacy,and their presence warm and inviting - we spent a few mornings hanging out with them over a cup of coffee and they are lovely,"storied people who instantly felt like friends.

They made our stay in Boston much more heartwarming and much more fun than it probably will be without them. They are really kind and nice people, treated us as if we were their family members. The room was comfortable, their house is beautiful and the neighborhood is nice as well. We rented a car and were worried for a while if there would be any parking spaces but it's actually really convenient to park. I was trying to keep it simple but I could really go on and on and on talking about how awesome our experiences have been staying here."
2295530,55994552,2015-12-07,23060350,Carlos,Alicia and Kostas are lovely people and I wish I had stayed a bit longer. The bedroom is great and the bed really comfortable even for a picky person like me. They were really communicative through the process and if I come to Boston again I'll undoubtedly come visit them!

Alicia came out to find me on a cold night when I took a wrong turn on a walk.  She offered us valuable information about her community with its wonderful urban charm.
Our room was cozy and just fine for the two of us with a wonderfully,comfortable bed and a huge closet for bags and our clothes.  We felt very much at ease with both Alicia and Kostas and will miss our morning coffee chats.  We have recommended their home to friends and relatives and we  will be returning in the future.

Their home is very convenient to the Orange T, which we took everywhere we went!!  They had coffee for us every morning and may fun extras throughout the week that made our stay very special.  Alicia was able to answer our questions regarding directions and T stops which took a lot of pressure off of me and made the trip so much more relaxing.  Our bedroom was comfortable, had a large closet and was bright and cheery.  If you are worried at all that the home only has one bathroom, don't be!  I honestly forgot that there was only one, it felt like it was our own bathroom.  I can't recommend their home enough!  Staying there made our trip SO much more fun and relaxing!!!"

2295530,70703808,2016-04-19,36359740,Linda,"\"My husband and I stayed in Alicia and Kostas' home during the weekend before and day of the Boston Marathon.  The bedroom was comfortable with adequate lighting and a closet that had more space for clothes than we needed.  The bathroom was just steps from the room.  I walk with a cane and had no trouble negotiating the stairs to the room.  We were encouraged to use the kitchen and sitting/music room, both of which were attractive and comfortable.  Wi-fi was available and worked well.  Alicia directed us to interesting restaurants in the area.  She also warned us of the street cleaning on Monday and let us park in their driveway temporarily.  The house is within walking distance of the \"\"T\"\"; if you've never been to Boston"
2295530,70958545,2016-04-22,63304625,Kevin,"My experience was amazing. I just kept thinking I want them to adopt me and let me move here... I mean, what an amazing place, couple, and experience.

2295530,71780850,2016-04-28,44096447,Katherine,"Our trip to Boston would not have been fabulous had we stayed elsewhere.  The house is the perfect blend of nostalgia, charm, art, and cozy comfort. I will never forget sitting in the light-filled kitchen and having great coffee with Alicia and Kostas who are absolutely two of the most warm, soul-soothing & interesting people I have ever met. The neighborhood is terrific...safe and walkable, with super restaurants close by...Alicia has great recommendations and suggestions. The bed is very comfortable and the closet & other storage is more than accommodating, even for someone who packs as much as I do!  We just got home and miss them both!"

Their home is lovely and their guest room is clean as a whistle and had beautiful high ceilings and a fabulous breeze!!!  I left my windows wide open each night and was astonished at how quiet the neighborhood and streets are at night!!!  Their home is located on the corner of 2 one way streets so that must attribute to the peacefulness at nighttime!  I enjoyed my stay immensely and loved the little tour of the neighborhood that Alicia gave me!!  Fantastic location... I walked to the Boston College campus one day and walked all around the neighborhood without any concerns for my safety!  For anyone looking for an economical, charming and pleasant home to stay...

2295530,75160873,2016-05-19,29705284,Colette,"On arriving at Alicia and Kostas' home we could not of felt more welcomed. Alicia greeted us, showed us around, provided us with directions and helpful tips and details of restaurants and places of visit to help us make the most of our short stay in Boston. The house was lovely and very creative, we loved the decor and the neighbourhood is also lovely with lots of great places to eat and visit nearby, such as the pond, arboretum and Sam Adams brewery tour."

Ils nous ont indiqué dès notre arrivée les meilleurs endroits à voir dans leur quartier. Leur maison est vraiment proche du centre ville (10 min de métro) et il est très facile de se garer en voiture gratuitement dans le quartier.,,,,,
Le matin,café et jus à disposition en plus des conversations avec Alicia qui est une personne très sympathique et très ouverte avec qui il est facile de discuter (même pour des non-anglophones).,,,,
il y a plusieurs choses à voir dans leur quartier,ainsi que plusieurs bons restaurants.,,,,

We can't imagine better Air BnB hosts.  Our room was comfortable and we appreciated them sharing their home with us.   We especially enjoyed lunch on the patio under the canopy of grape vines.   We also liked  the Jamaica Plain neighborhood and the easy access to the subway."
2295530,77018973,2016-05-30,73201492,John,"I can't emphasize enough how lovely it was to stay with Alicia and Kostas! They were so gracious and made it a perfect stay. You are lucky to have found them. The room is quiet and clean, bed was very comfortable, and location is ideal (visiting for an event downtown). Their dog Babe was a great host, too, even: sweet natured, adorable, and gave a happy greeting when I first arrived. Alicia couldn’t be more kind, cool, and caring. Kostas was delightful to meet, as well, and showed me his wood carvings and played guitar one morning. Two of the most sincere, interesting people I've ever met. Our lives are better having met them. Considering asking them to adopt me. ;)"
2295530,77915458,2016-06-04,62990535,Ed,"Alicia and Kostas were excellent hosts.  They have a great apartment in a nice, quiet neighborhood that is very close to the train system (only a short ride to Downtown).  Although we weren't around much due to our schedules, Alicia and Kostas made us feel welcome and like we were a part of their family.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay with them again.  Very knowledgable about Boston and are great people."
2295530,78560101,2016-06-07,32839662,Krista,"Alicia and Kostas' place is warm and inviting with lots of character. The location is amazing for getting around Boston by transit (the metro is very close), and Jamaica Plain is a quaint neighbourhood. The bedroom space was a bit tight for three people, but would be perfect for two. Alicia and Kostas are absolutely lovely and we enjoyed hearing their stories and chatting over coffee. They were flexible in letting us come and go but also open to chatting when desired. They are passionate and generous people who enjoy sharing their experiences with others, and we benefitted from their warmth and kindness :)  If we make a trip back to Boston we would definitely recommend spending time at Alicia & Kostas' home!"
2295530,79546929,2016-06-13,15230621,Anne-Estelle,"We got excited when we turned onto Walnut street because each house looked like a big ship! With huge trees and a community garden, we couldn't wait to explore Jamaica Plain. Alicia and Kosta's address did not disappoint,  surrounded by trees, wooden sculptures and flowers, the 2nd story apartment was really clean, no dust at all, rich with art, antiques, chandeliers, rugs, and breathtaking nature from each window. We arrived late because of traffic but Alicia and their pug gave us a warm welcome and made us feel right at home. It was an honor to have our own little 2 window queen size bed with lot's of closet space in their cozy, high ceiling home. The kitchen, bathroom and music room were between our room and theirs and the floors did not creak when we came in past midnight. Toast, coffee and lovely local products were set on the breakfast table in the morning. Kostas and Alicia were always happy to answer our questions and even gave us a map of the neighbourhood. The Stony Brook train station was a 5 minute walk away and since our car was parked right in front of the house (for free) we used the really user friendly train. Very easy and cheap. All in all I'd stay the price is right, we were 15 minutes outside of downtown Boston but we felt really safe in our neighborhood. The Haven Scottish pub was just a short walk away along with hairdresser, whole foods, bookstore, etc. The couple treated us like old friends, we heard Kostas playing Spanish guitar one morning and watched him sculpt a hand instrument the next. Just wished we could stay longer. Namaste."

We have spent a week at their home and were able to explore the city of Boston as well as the neighbourhood the Airbnb is in (Jamaica plain).
Alicia took care of breakfast every day and joined us for a few of them. The conversations we have had with Alicia and Kostas were inspiring and informative and they go out of their way to make sure you have a great stay. Their dog is fun to be around as well and the neighbourhood is lovely and close to the T (metro).  We can recommend a walk around the pond (Jamaica pond) as well as a walk through the nearby Arboretum (large garden). Alicia will provide you with a map of the neighbourhood which is helpful!,,,,,

2295530,98628928,2016-09-01,72932210,Ruxandra,"Alicia and Kostas are wonderful people and we are grateful to have met them.  We had a 3-night stay in their house, which is beautiful, very clean and charming. The location is very convenient for travelers, less than 5 minutes’ walk to train station and 15 minutes to downtown Boston.  Staying here we had a great opportunity to explore the neighborhood as you can bike / walk to Arboretum ( a beautiful large garden) and Jamaica Pond. The neighborhood is also full of small restaurants with great food, grocery stores within a walking distance and really beautiful homes.  Every morning Alicia kindly prepared coffee and breakfast and one day I also took one of Kostas’s boxing classes which was a great workout and lots of fun.   They are such wonderful people that treated us like friends and with whom we enjoyed great conversations.  I truly recommend staying with them. It’s like a home away from home. Truly an inspiring and pleasant experience."
2295530,99933996,2016-09-06,13420125,Suleyman,"It's often an awkward moment when appearing at the doorstep of someone's home, invited though you were; and it's equally often awkward to accept strangers into your home. In our case, as guests to the home of Alicia and Kostas, the welcome immediately pushed away any such awkwardness. My daughter and I felt comfortable from the start and we sincerely appreciate the  friendliness that was displayed throughout our stay by both Alicia and Kostas.  Breakfast in the morning was also a chance to chat and get to know these two interesting and wonderful people.  I enjoyed learning about them and I also enjoyed their genuine, non-judgmental curiosity in me, my family, and my life.  When it came time for me to leave I had to make the concerted effort to pry myself away from the interesting conversation I was engaged in with Alicia and a friend of theirs.  I hope to see Alicia and Kostas again."

Overall we were happy with the apartment but there are a couple issues we experienced.  The bed and pillows were very uncomfortable.  There was a leak in the bathroom ceiling so we had to place a pan under it when it was raining.  It also was not the cleanest place we've stayed, but still clean enough."
Again,"overall we really liked the apartment.  The decor is nice and it is pretty.  It was also very efficient to not have to meet up and get keys since there is a keypad to get into the building and the apartment.  We would likely stay here again IF they replaced the bed and pillows.\"",,,,

I think a cat usually lives there,in case you're allergic,and it's a ground level apt so there's some early morning street noise. But that's to be expected in a downtown apartment. Nice safe neighborhood,lots to do around,and this was a nice place as a jumping off point to see Boston,"or an economical option for a business traveler. \""
12208806,93354202,2016-08-12,3180580,Vivian,"Laura was prompt in answering queries and check-in was a breeze. Great location with Fenway Park just a stone's throw away. Easy to walk to everywhere including Harvard. Main issue I had with the apartment was a musky lingering pet smell in the air and in the bedsheets. Was told that no one has stayed in the apartment for over 10 days which could be the cause of it. Bed was comfortable but no blanket was provided, only a thin bed sheet. Did not have a problem with that as it was a hot day and the air-conditioning isn't powerful. No hairdryer provide (issue for the ladies). I'll recommend this apartment only if you do not intend to stay in the apartment for most part of your day."
14250499,95146104,2016-08-18,89737418,Jens,Room was as it's told to be though the cleanup fee is a bit high for a room that's not actually clean.
But if you like to be left alone and just need the room to sleep than this is the perfect place. No hassle with check-in,"you can come and go as you please and the neighbourhood is great. \"",,,,
3389896,45145896,2015-08-31,40745575,Jaryd,"Staying in 16 Saco St was an excellent experience. The neighborhood is on the edge of gendrified Dorchester, but the walk to Field's Corner T stop can be slightly uncomfortable. There is a CVS half a mile down the road, that is open 24 hours. The apartment is extremely spacious, with a TV, two bathrooms, and free internet. The internet is excellent and I never had a problem with it. I did have a roommate who was living there (it was the host's brother) who enjoyed the place a little warmer than I'd like. Just be aware the AC is not totally under your control. Overall I give my stay there a 4.5/5, as my host was extremely welcoming, the apartment was in excellent working condition, but not knowing the roommate was there was a surprise."

He was extremely flexible with the check in/check out times,gave us a our privacy and independence,and was always available for any help.,,,
The house is neat and clean,the bathrooms wonderful,and the rooms cozy. The number locks make it very smooth for us to come in and out without worrying about handing in/out the keys.,,,
The place is also very close to the red line,allowing seamless access to Harvard/MIT,and even the airport.,,,
We had a wonderful time,and are very grateful for everything Jonathan did for us.,,,,

11767622,68058243,2016-04-02,63006753,Tom,The room was as advertised.  Host was absent.  I Slept well.  I would stay there again.
11767622,72953468,2016-05-05,9120908,Nick,Jonathan was very helpful with directions and provided an orientation to the house.  Keep in mind that this is one bedroom among many with a common area etc.  However it was nice that the bathroom was exclusive.

Although we did not get to see Johnathan, he is a very hospitable and nice guy helping us to check-in and answer my enquries very quickly. The apartment is really nice, with a turquoise colored wall in the bedroom that my girlfriend loves so much! Overall, this is an awesome space to stay during visiting Boston and I will definitely recommend this place!!"
11767622,92973339,2016-08-10,11612691,Becky,"Jonathan was quick and responsive after booking the room. It was a quick walk from the T (take Preble St if you are coming from Andrew on the red line - (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) sometimes tells you to take Dorchester Ave.) Getting in was simply and the apartment was clean and nicely decorated. There is a fire place, little balcony and rooftop area (didn't go up they but just saw the spiral staircase leading up there.) The area is pretty quiet, not great for going out but great to come back to after a long day. Overall easy stay."
11767622,93112040,2016-08-11,89119700,Danielle,Jonathan's place was wonderful. Room was clean and bathroom was private. Also had access to a kitchen and living room area.

6854357,36146055,2015-06-25,30226488,Myriam,"I stayed in Mengqi's room for 2 nights in late June. The positive: Mengqi's roommate was very nice, welcoming and quiet at helped me figure out how to get around Boston since I had never been before. The apartment is well located, 2 min away from a green line train (although the windows face the street so you can hear the train pulling in at night if you are a light sleeper) and walking distance to a grocery store. The bed was comfortable. The negative: I suspect that the bed sheets had not been cleaned since there was some hair under the pillow. The kitchen and washroom were also unkept. I would encourage the hosts to keep the common areas cleaner for future travelers."
570493,6782659,2013-08-25,6843859,Laia,"The place itself is good, the bedrooms are big, we ad our own bathroom, washing machine.... Bill has been a really great host, he is always trying to help. The only inconveniet is the situation: it is at the end of the red line so we had at least 40 minutes to downton."
570493,7951606,2013-10-09,1715806,Olivier,"Nous avons été très bien accueillis par Bill à notre arrivée. Nous ne l'avons pas revu après car il part tôt le matin. Sa maison est très agréable et très bien entretenue. Les deux chambres que nous avions étaient grandes et nous avons apprécié leur situation indépendante au rez-de-chaussée de la maison. Nous avions lu dans un commentaire qu'il fallait 40 mn pour aller dans le centre-ville et nous avons été agréablement surpris car nous n'avons jamais mis plus de 30 mn, en comptant les 10 mn pour aller à pied au métro, dans une rue très agréable. Bref, nous avons été ravis de notre séjour et recommandons cette habitation."
570493,8138213,2013-10-17,322630,Judy,"My business partner, Lynn, and I stayed with Bill during a 6 day conference we were attending at the Boston Convention and Expo center; while I had some reservations about what it would be like to commute back and forth to our conference from Dorchester we opted to stay with Bill because it was so much more affordable than the $250-$500 hotel rooms near the convention center."
What I discovered was that my stay in Boston was so much more enjoyable because of our commute,"as well as because of the wonderful host that Bill was. Public transportation in Boston is easy and very safe and I  got a true feel for life in Boston because I had an opportunity \"\"live\"\" like the locals.",,,,
Bills place is lovely and very,very comfortable,but more than anything he is an amazing host; generous,kind,accommodating and helpful beyond words.,
I was initially a bit concerned about what it might be like to share a space with a host; in the past when I had used airbnb I always rented a space of my own (I am the type of person who values my own space and privacy). But I have to say that it was a wonderful experience and to anyone who is concerned about this I would say that you have no need to worry if you are coming to town to stay with Bill.,,,,,
He was totally respectful of our privacy while making himself available to us when we needed anything at all.,,,,,
Also,my business partner became very ill soon after we arrived and so she had to return home; which left me alone with my host. And again,while this may have normally been a concern (sharing a house with a man who is a total stranger to me) once again,I can only say that being with Bill was nothing less than a perfect experience.,,
He was always there to offer advice when needed,he was beyond generous in offering lifts to and from the train,airport,supermarket,access to laundry,coffee
"If I am ever back in Boston I look forward to staying with Bill again!\"",,,,,
570493,8378796,2013-10-28,2158511,Alexej,Bill is the friendliest and generous person that I have met in the US so far. The housing was wonderful and we had all the space we needed to have an amazing stay in Boston.

570493,10964601,2014-03-15,12261413,Cheryl,"Bill's lovely home is the perfect place to stay while exploring Boston.  The house is spacious, clean and bright, and Bill is a gracious and accommodating host.  The neighborhood is full of large stately homes, convenient to the T (Ashmont Station is within walking distance, if you like to walk or there is a bus that stops directly in front of the house and takes you to the T).  My first stay was in snow season, but for summer stays the beach is nearby.  Bill can tell you about all the great neighborhood restaurants and bakeries.  I will be staying again!"
570493,11598741,2014-04-08,13451825,Will,The rooms were absolutely amazing and Bill was an extremely gracious host. It was a bit cold at night but the room had a heating blanket which kept the beds nice and warm. There was always coffee in the morning and I genuinely felt like I was getting better treatment than I would have at a hotel for a lower price. I would definately stay there again any time that I am in Boston.
570493,11735699,2014-04-14,11070239,Brice,Bill is great.
He knows the area quite well and can offer help and suggestions for traveling around the city and getting the most out of your visit.,,,,,
The house is spacious and very clean.,,,,,
The guest rooms have tile and are located below ground level,so the floor can be chilly in the morning. Bring some house slippers!,,,,

I stayed with him for a last minute work trip and couldn't recommend him enough.  His home is beautiful, clean and well appointed.  There are two comfortable rooms with work spaces and one and a half baths.  Bill is very thoughtful and always had coffee and beverages at the ready as well as towels and any other supplies I needed.  Many thanks Bill for a great stay!"
570493,13577706,2014-05-31,10232035,Lina,The apartment is very nice and spacious. The rooms are very clean and we felt very comfortable.
It turned out to be nicer than most hotels which are more expensive.,,,,,
The T station is just a short walk away.,,,,,
Bill is a great host,he was very helpful and answered all our questions. We had to change the dates of our stay,which wasn't a problem at all and he helped us with that as well. He is one of the nicest persons I met in the us so far.,,,
We had a great stay in Boston and if I get the possibility to visit this city again,I'd love to stay at Bills place again.,,,,
Thanks a lot,"we had a great stay!\"",,,,

I felt very well at Bill. Thank you Bill for everything. Unfortunately his house is maybe for too far from the station but for me it was okay."
570493,15457658,2014-07-09,467089,Lach,"My two teenage sons (19 and 14) and my girlfriend stayed with Bill for 4 nights during a visit to Boston for sightseeing and a Red Sox game.  The accommodations were as represented and quite nice and comfortable.  We had two bedrooms, each with a queen bed and television.  Bathrooms were clean and quite nice.  We also had use of the kitchen and living room and felt very comfortable doing so.   A washer and dryer were also available."
But above all,Bill is an excellent host.  He provided very clear directions on how to get from Logan to his place by public transportation.  He met us at the subway/T station and gave us a ride to his place.  He stocked a couple of shelves of his refrigerator with juice and milk and fruit and had cereal,bagels,"etc. for us in the mornings.  He gave us very helpful sightseeing hints (e.g. our subway/T pass provides access to a ferry that crosses Boston Harbor from downtown to Charlestown/Bunker Hill).    While some of the areas are \"\"shared\"\"",it never felt intrusive or uncomfortable.,
"Bill's place is south of the City in Ashmont near Dorchester.  Its about a 15-20 minute walk to the Ashmont subway station.  Its about a 20 minute ride into the heart of downtown.  We found it very easy to get around.  \"",,,,,
570493,15593792,2014-07-12,17101807,Holly,"As first timers on Airbnb we really didn't know what to expect. Our only complaint Bill is you've set the standard too high! We couldn't have asked for a better host - very welcoming and friendly. Bill offered & picked us up from the airport, such a treat after a long flight to a unknown city. He was on holiday himself so had the time to chat and help us plan our short 3 day visit. We loved being a bit farther out of the city, 25mins on the subway with a 10min stroll to the station. Bill's home is spacious, clean & comfortable. Would highly recommend staying at Bills and we look forward to a re-visit in the future."
570493,16312855,2014-07-25,17672663,Barbara,"My husband, my two daughters and I stayed with Bill for four nights during our first visit to Boston and to Usa as well. We were very lucky to have Bill as our host; he was very nice, helpful and friendly, picked us at the airport, and twice at the Red Line Station (we were very grateful to him), answered all our questions, gave us good advice, talked to us a lot, it was a pleasure to stay at his house. We had everything we needed and much more for our breakfast, we could use the washmachine too. The neighbourhood was quite nice and the ten minute walk to the underground station was very pleasent. We highly recommend staying at Bill's house. Thank you for everything, Bill, sei fantastico!!!"
570493,16523108,2014-07-28,18637038,Sheila,"My mother and I stayed at Bill's home over a weekend. We were so pleased to find a very comfortable place to stay in Dorchester. Bill was great about making us feel at home. He provided advice on the area, and was a very gracious host. He provided little snack in the two bedrooms and in the kitchen for us, and made sure had all essential toiletries. The village of Dorchester is a wonderful Irish neighborhood. The Greenhills Bakery is NOT to be missed! Fantastic breakfast and very authentic pubs in the area. The area is a very unique way to experience Boston not too far away from the hustle and bustle, but in a family friendly neighborhood."
570493,16928544,2014-08-04,16370421,Hillary,Bill and his place were great! The rooms and common areas are clean and well equipped.

Bill lives about a 10 minute walk from the Ashmont station at the end of the red line. It is convenient to get into downtown Boston for all of your traveling needs! Would definitely recommend this for anyone looking to make a trip to the Boston area!
570493,18053553,2014-08-21,15585616,Miriam,"My parents were visiting from Ireland for two weeks and I decided to book with Bill as he is quite close to where I live. The house was immaculate, lots of space for them both. Everything they needed was accommodated for from cereal in the cupboard to ice tea, juices, coffee ect. Their stay was most comfortable. Bill was an excellent host, to deal with and also in making my parents feel welcome and at home. He absolutely went above and beyond. He even gave them a ride to the airport when they were leaving. He left notes for them to give them directions to certain areas and even baked muffins for them on a few occasions. I would highly recommend booking with Bill, he is courteous, thoughtful, welcoming and an overall great host. His house is gorgeous and conveniently located right next to Adams village and a short walk to the T station. I would recommend anyone thinking of booking with Bill. 5 stars!"

But it turned out that the accommodation was very attractive, just like staying in your own condo. Lots of room in a modern stylish home. The neighborhood is upscale compared to many others in Boston, and all was as advertised. Off street parking right outside our own private entrance was an unexpected bonus. The host made us feel very welcome and not like a \"\"tenant\"\".  He is friendly and helpful but not nosy - just the right balance."
He suggested a place (just down the street - a five minute walk) for breakfast one morning,and it turned out to be a fabulous neighborhood experience. And the place turned out to have been featured by Anthony Bourdain in his Boston program.,,,,

He arranged to be home when we arrived and and oriented us to his home, and to the neighborhood, and filled us in on public transportation, places to eat, etc.  His home is immaculate, and looks to be brand-new luxury-type construction and decor.  He made us coffee every morning, and had a variety of juices and snacks on offer."

570493,20292545,2014-09-27,4884459,Stephen,"A beautiful house in a nice neighborhood. We had our own space downstairs: two rooms with large, comfortable double beds and two bathrooms, all of which was spotlessly clean. Good attention to detail: things like bottles of water in the rooms, setting up the coffee machine for us in the morning so all we had to do was press a button, lots of choice for breakfast. Bill was an excellent host, very friendly and exceptionally helpful. He really went out of his way to make our stay as enjoyable as possible; he gave us good directions and honest advice on where to eat, what to do etc. and when we asked how to get to the nearest T-station on the last day he actually drove us there so we didn't have to walk too far with our bags. By the end of our stay we were tempted to ask him if we could just move in."
570493,20557794,2014-10-01,19788279,Graham,We had a great time with Bill. The accommodation is very spacious and clean. Bill was a pleasant host and made great muffins! He made us very welcome throughout our stay which was our first with Airbandb. Adams Street and village is easily accessible from downtown via the Redline and the house us a 10 minute walk from Ashmont Station. Would definitely stay here again if we stayed in Boston. Thanks Bill.
570493,20723001,2014-10-04,20141373,Michele,"Bill was a great host. Our family of 4 adults were housed in comfortable clean rooms with added extras such as bottled water, snacks and juice. The house is warm and inviting 15 minutes walk to the T station. Bill gave advice on activities when the weather turned wet and even baked muffins for us ... Highly recommended!"
570493,21384220,2014-10-16,16963593,David,"We were in Boston for a week with the vision of covering a broad spectrum of activities without using a car. We also needed a place that could accommodate an additional couple for a few days. Bill's place was perfect! Subway an easy walk, with  the option of a bus to get us there. But Bill was more than willing to drop us off. More than anything, Bill gave great advice on where to go, how to get there, food, events, really took time with us. Easy to the airport even at the bad arrival and departure times we had. Bed was comfortable, and rooms clean. Gave the trip a personal touch no hotel could match. Well stay with Bill when we come back!"
570493,21534587,2014-10-19,6893954,Corinne,"The two bedrooms are clean and spacious located on the lowest level of the property. Each room had its own separate entrance via a secure external lockable door. The spacious living area is comfortable, the kitchen well equipped. It is worth noting that the full bathroom is one flights of stairs up from the main level, but the sturdy handrail was appreciated by those in our group who needed it."
It is within easy access to public transport (the bus stop is a few yards along the opposite side of the street and it's a 5-10 minute walk around the corner to the closest train station).  We had no need of our car during our stay and the free parking space behind our rooms was much appreciated.,,,,,
Bill was very accommodating,hospitable and friendly. He had coffee and breakfast supplies out for us before he left for work in the mornings.  He even dropped us off at the station. His recommendations on where to go and the best ways to do it were very helpful,and he made us feel very welcome.,,,
Thanks for sharing your place with us,"Bill! We'll be looking you up next time we're over your way :)\"",,,,

570493,23867408,2014-12-13,1411935,Linan,"I had a great stay at Bill's. It's probably one of the best airbnb places I've stayed at - super clean and has everything I needed. Bill also doesn't take in multiple guests at a time so you'll have a lot of privacy and space to yourself. Bill is extremely thoughtful; all the rooms are stocked with paper towels and tissue and he even prepared a robe for me. Only thing is, because of the central heating system, the lower floor could be cold unless you set the temperature really high, but I think in the less cold months, this shouldn't be a problem."
570493,28279291,2015-03-21,22624810,Nima,"I had a great time here!!! Bill is a very gracious host, the room was very clean and comfortable and the location is perfect (convenient access to the red line). I couldn't have hoped for a better experience!"

The accommodations were just as described, and were perfect for us--my husband and I stayed 4 nights, and our adult daughter joined us for 2 of the nights.  Bill helped us find food, transportation (and even dropped us off at the T one day when he was on his way out about the same time we were leaving!) and was pleasant and helpful throughout our stay.  The T is about a 12 minute walk away, and it's easy to get wherever you need to go.  We ate at a great Italian place right by the T, and there were plenty of other restaurants nearby.  Great place & great host--thanks!"

Best of all were Bill's very careful and precise instructions and helpful notes; he made sure we had everything we needed and more, and was far more knowledgeable about traveling around Boston on a budget than most hotel concierges!"

There was a good place to park our car.  Not sure if bathroom location was in description, full bath was located two floors up from bedrooms, but was not a problem for us.  Overall very good experience."
570493,35332709,2015-06-17,13787408,Judith,Staying at Bill's place was very memorable. Bill is a very knowledgeable and generous host. He provided guidance on transportation around Boston and things to do. He even went out of his way to take us to the Kennedy Library - something that should not be missed. He stocked the refrigerator with healthy breakfast items which was appreciated. The space was better than described and very neat. It is close to the T and safe for walking. There are good and affordable restaurants nearby. I would definitely recommend a stay with Bill for a real Boston neighborhood experience.

We had a great time in Boston last we came, largely in part to the hospitality that Bill showed us, so we knew that when we came back we would look to Bill first for our accommodations. His place is clean, in a diverse and vibrant neighborhood, and close to public transportation. Bill males sure that he is available should you need him, even when he is busy with his work. You could do no better than staying with Bill when you visit Boston!"

570493,92103128,2016-08-07,84525626,David,"Bill made us feel very welcome, and was helpful in giving tips in relation to things to do in Boston.  The rooms are spacious and so although our stay was for 10 days, and we were an adult couple plus our two teenage children, the accommodation never felt too small.  Location was ideal for us with Red Line station in reasonable walking distance, and therefore easy to get into town - at the same time the location was not too far from Braintree where we had family friends to visit.  TV and wi-fi all worked well.  Air conditioning system was also effective.  Would definitely recommend."

570493,96364480,2016-08-22,89193880,Judy,"Bill was very welcoming checking in with us before, during, and after our stay! He had his own plans but still made time to make sure we could access what we needed (delicious homemade muffins, beverages, fruits, transportation arrangements) during our 3-night stay. He kept us informed of updates regarding his guests who would stay in his quarters for one night while we were there, and they were nice as well. The photos reflected the spaces pretty accurately. The house is lived in with great sunlight in living room and kitchen.  The neighborhood is diverse and we felt safe during daytime. I would still be careful driving around at night because a few streets over we encountered a few fast noisy drivers around midnight. Overall, great stay and Thank you Bill for sharing his home with us!"

La casa se encuentra a aproximadamente 8 cuadras de la estación de subte JFK/UMass,y se accede al WTC en 30-35 minutos y un poco más al aeropuerto,en transporte público. El vecindario es seguro y siempre volví de esa manera a la casa,a excepción de una vez que regresé tarde en un taxi.,,
De la propiedad y la habitación puedo decir que la relación precio calidad es buena,ya que me quedé 4 noches allí por lo que costaba 1,5 noche cerca del centro de convenciones,especialmente si viajas solo.,,
Isabelle me recibió un martes al mediodía y me mostró la casa,el lavadero,mi habitación privada en el tercer piso por escalera y el baño compartido. Fue amable.,,,

3344639,99947082,2016-09-06,81117807,Ankur,Isa's place was wonderful! This was my first time staying at an AirBnB and Isa made it very easy!
7475557,70529878,2016-04-18,67111968,Li,"Though there is a little misunderstanding between Mac and my friends that let me felt embarrassed as an intermediary,I have to say the house is great. The equipment of the house is complete and I like this location. This is such an unusual experience."
7475557,71515023,2016-04-25,45761590,Jeremiah,Mac had us all feeling really at ease. This was our first time staying at an AirBnB and I have to say it was a wonderful experience. Mac was really accommodating and there was everything would could imagine needing already there. I can't speak highly enough of our experience. The space was just as described and everything we could have hoped for and more.
"The location was excellent in my opinion. It was fairly close to everything we wanted to go to. We either walked or caught a quick taxi/uber ride all around the city.\"",,,,,
7475557,74454254,2016-05-15,29573187,Sunny,"It was a great place to stay, super convinience and welcoming. Mac responded right away when I had questions. All my friends and I enjoyed the stay! Thanks so much for hosting us! :)"
7475557,75981335,2016-05-23,12257301,Natalie,"Our stay was amazing!!! Mac made this place feel like home. Very clean, which we were all very impressed with. We were provided water bottles and soda as well as shampoo and conditioner. How awesome is that?! Also the 2 queen beds, they were amazing!!! Very comfortable (memory foam?) and the blankets were just perfect. My group of friends and me talked about how we knocked out every night because of how awesome the beds were. The sofa in the living room was pretty comfortable as well. Bunk beds are as good as any twin beds can get."
Neighborhood is pretty quite. It is a 10 minute walk to the nearest subway station,and hard to find parking during the week (Mon-Fri) that doesn't have any restrictions. Other than that,"I would defiantly stay at this place again!\"",,,
7475557,80445076,2016-06-18,19969732,Victoria,"This booking was for business travel. The place was big, very clean, easy to get in and out, and within easy walking distance to shops/restaurants and a T-station."
The wifi didn't work for me at all. I could log into it but it would drop out every few minutes. I had to log into my comcast account and essentially create a hotspot for myself. Mac was responsive about this problem,however our stay was brief and we did not request him to come look at the wifi issue (although he did offer).,,,,
Parking was a nightmare,but that's not Mac's fault. My car was towed despite reading all the signs carefully and being quite certain I was in a visitors spot on a non-street cleaning street. Alas,"apparently all streets get cleaned they just don't all have signs saying so. \"",,,
7475557,83744458,2016-07-04,39798959,Jamie,We loved staying here for a conference. We were able to find parking on old colony ave without any problems and it's actually a fairly pleasant 20 minute walk to the conference center.
7475557,85382383,2016-07-11,50480088,Cora,Mac's place was as described and even better. Everyone was really comfortable and it was the perfect place for our group.  He was very responsive throughout the whole process and left clear directions on everything which allowed us to enjoy our stay even more. The next time I am Boston I am staying here. It was centrally located to everything and just an overall wonderful experience.
7475557,85829903,2016-07-13,82908964,俊,"非常棒的体验!房东给准备了很多饮料,毛巾。更让我们惊讶的是还有做中国菜的调味品!唯一不足的是不好停车,停了很远的地方还被贴了罚单。"
7475557,86007740,2016-07-14,73380169,Kent,We really enjoyed our stay.  We needed a last minute place after an unexpected layover.  The owner went out of their way to help us out.
7475557,87824170,2016-07-22,83797879,Scott,"Two coworkers and I stayed with Mac for three nights due to a hotel crunch in Boston. The place was exactly as described/photo-ed, the fridge was full of complimentary water/soda (nice touch), and Mac was very communicative and responsive both leading up to, and during, our stay."
"5-stars for a great host and well run Airbnb.\"",,,,,
7475557,88665428,2016-07-25,48169256,Poojan,"Great host, great place. Very well maintained and fridge fully stocked. The instructions were very clear and it was an overall great stay! He was even super responsive when one of the lights went out in the house, responding within 2 minutes. Thanks Mac!"
7475557,90196230,2016-07-31,40209567,Junpei,"Mac's place is really amazing place to stay with family or friends. We stayed there one night with 7 people. It was spacious, clean, cozy and high-tech."
Though we didn't meet Mac,he is very responsive and gave completely clear and enough instructions. I definitely recommend this place!,,,,
"Note that to find space for street parking was slightly hard during weekends.\"",,,,,
7475557,92238528,2016-08-08,32261966,Adele,"We had a fantastic time at Mac's place: it was a clean and restful homebase for our stay in Boston.  It was well stocked with all basic amenities (towels, plates, utensils) and many extra conveniences (shampoo and conditioner, soda, water, ramen, and mac and cheese).  The hosts were very accessible and helpful.  And in the evening we enjoyed a walk up to Dorchester Heights, which was a scenic and pleasant park.  We would definitely stay again."
7475557,93113573,2016-08-11,35522053,Hernando,"Great place, the process of checking in is excellent. You have everything you need and more. The neighbor is nice and very close to downtown."
7475557,94121122,2016-08-14,19873778,Tim,"Mac was a great host. He provided lots of water and small amenities that you wouldn't have thought of till it was too late. (Top Ramen after a night out?- Check). I was able to come in a few hours before check in to drop my bags, really freeing me to explore the city. The rooms were all very clean, well decorated, and comfy. What more could you ask for?"
7475557,96337128,2016-08-22,52330615,Alison,"Mac's place was the perfect spot for a bachelorette weekend for my sister.  It was great checking in and finding a refrigerator full of cold sodas and water.  It was even better to see a cabinet stocked full of Ramen and mac and cheese! He had many conveniences ready for us, such as Dove shampoo and conditioner and body wash. Mac even had 2 blow dryers, which was perfect for our group. The wifi was quick and easy to set up.  There were numerous chargers available for us around the living room.  We felt right at home with a group of 8 women and never felt like we were roughing it.  The house is in a great location, in a small suburb of Boston.  There are bars, liquor stores, and a beach (with a walking path) nearby. We had some minor issues during our stay and Mac responded immediately to remedy the situations.  We loved our stay and would definitely stay here again in the future!"
7475557,99571964,2016-09-05,84898692,Adam,Great place to stay and Mac made sure we had everything we need. The place seemed brand new and made for a great weekend.
3250847,14672417,2014-06-23,14759705,Larry,Nathan was very nice and helpful. He picked me up at the subway station and walked me to his house. The room was big and clean. Very good experience!
3250847,18447909,2014-08-26,20119160,Zhongde,Nathan is very friendly. He responded my requests on time and provided detailed instructions. I will consider to choose his room again next time when I visit Boston.
3250847,34500533,2015-06-08,34468362,Aleid,"The cozy room turned out everything as it was described by the landlord. Nathan is a very friendly guy, he gave me a warm welcome. The place is very convenient as it is so close to the T-station (subway) which makes it easy to go to Boston, and for me to visit MIT for the reunion. With all the extras, like coffee, tea, etc it is easy to move in for a short stay. Although a grocery store is just a 5 minute walk. My first experience with Airbnb turned out to be a good one, especially due to the kindness and hospitality of Nathan."
3250847,66290171,2016-03-20,21870054,Samir,"Wohnung und Zimmer waren sauber, geräumig und mit dem Wichtigsten ausgestattet. Nathan ist ein freundlicher Gastgeber. Alles war so wie beschrieben."
12784064,80375150,2016-06-17,21295455,Justin,Great location and apartment. Elyne was super attentive as well - highly recommended!
12784064,81274167,2016-06-22,4607749,Christian,"The apartment is very centric and located in a very quiet street. The listing is very accurate too. Even though we never saw Elyne, she was always available and sent the instructions within the perfect timing. The apartment has A/C so it is perfect for summer, one of the bedrooms doesn't have it but it has a ceiling fan. Be aware that the apartment is located in the second floor and the premises doesn't have elevators. If you go with kids, you can leave the strollers outside during the day. In just one minute you can be in Hanover street with plenty famous restaurants around. Metro (T) station is about 10 minutes but you can take many lines to Boston other touristic places in Boston."
12784064,83770896,2016-07-04,43939808,Mark,"We (my wife and I) could not think of one thing that could have been better: the apartment was clean, well stocked, attractively decorated, and bright.   The location (North End) was ideal.  It seemed like there were 50 Italian restaurants within an easy 10-minute walk...and we were 75 feet from the Freedom Trail.  At night, the apartment was a quiet retreat after being on busy, loud Hanover Street (just 50 yards away)."
12784064,85857064,2016-07-13,42391673,Eric,"I stayed with my wife and our children ages 5 and 7. The apartment was plenty big enough for us, well-furnished, clean, and as described. Beds are comfortable. It gets hot in July, but there were several window air conditioners that kept the place perfectly cool."
The location is safe,fun,and filled with delicious restaurants,though it gets crowded on the weekends. The actual street the apartment is on is between the busy streets and is quiet.,,
The shower is pretty small. This is not something the host can do anything about given the space available,but just be forewarned if you are a large person.,,,,
The communication prior to arrival was not as good as at some other places I have stayed,"but Elyne was quick to respond to texts.\"",,,,
12784064,87001445,2016-07-18,70701582,Michele,"Location, location,location. The unit was a wonderful place for my family and I to stay in while we enjoyed the city of Boston."
12784064,88110402,2016-07-23,1801964,Eldad & Efrat,Great location - the coolest quarter in Boston. it is a quiet street but close to everything. the apartment is fully air conditioned- super important during the summer.
it's a two floor walk up... worth knowing...but again,"great choice!\"",,,,
12784064,93479016,2016-08-13,76950397,Lisa,"Great location.  Loved having great restaurants, Freedom Trail, and history right outside door. Listing was exactly as described. Very convenient. Plenty of room for family of four to be comfortable."
12784064,94684299,2016-08-16,51342890,Pierre-Clément,"This place is very nice, and the Italian neighborhood seduced us."
It is close to everything you can need,from shops,bars,public transports...,,
"We really had a great time there. The host was very helpful and the description is accurate. This may be one the the nicest place to stay in Boston.\"",,,,,
12784064,95385305,2016-08-19,17728901,Marianna,"Everything about staying at this home was EASY. Great communication, incredible location, and easy access to downtown Boston. We felt like we walked into another world when we got to the North End. Great communication and everything was just as advertized."
12784064,96439989,2016-08-22,21297985,Valerie,Great location. Appartment was very clean. Host was quick and helpful. Appartment is  small and the second bedroom is tiny. I found it rather expensive for the size but I guess we have to pay for the perfect location.
12784064,98348174,2016-08-30,33377593,Rachel,"My Mum and myself really enjoyed our stay in Boston and Elyne's flat was the perfect base. The location is fantastic, right in the heart of the Italian North End and a 5 minute walk to the harbour."
"The flat itself was lovely and clean with all of the amenities we needed for the week. Air con in each room which was a blessing as it was a very hot August. Overall a brilliant stay - thanks \"",,,,,
6939454,36645969,2015-06-29,36979219,Paula,The host canceled this reservation 32 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6939454,39208724,2015-07-21,15511540,Gerard,"Sarah has been an outstanding host, literally being there to open the door to us on our arrival. She also took the trouble to check in on whether everything was to our satisfaction during the stay period. The apartment itself is well located in Dudley Square, less than 15 minutes drives from the North End of Boston. The area is up and coming, with a wonderful local café (Haley House Café), Laundromats, bus station etc. We would certainly recommend this property to Airbnb patrons."
6939454,39586622,2015-07-24,17444731,Evan,"Sarah was super responsive and very flexible.  She was welcoming upon arrival and the unit was wonderful - clean, comfortable and quite."
"Great stay!\"",,,,,
6939454,40475597,2015-07-31,36694390,Jennifer,"Sarah seemed nice and receptive although she was not at the apartment when we arrived. A quick phone call to her and she soon arrived to let us in. She did apologize. The apartment was as it looks in the pictures. The bed in the master bedroom was very uncomfortable and seemed quite wobbly on its base. I wish there was a bath tub, essential with small children but that was my oversight"
Once inside the apartment it was very quiet apart from one night when the neighbors appeared to be moving in or out quite late at night.,,,,,
We were quite surprised about the surrounding area especially near the bus terminal. Quite a few undesirables hanging around,drunk and using foul language to each other but in ear shot of my young family. The commute to Boston city was fairly easy,we just did not like being around that area late evening.,,,
"All in all it was a not a bad first time experience and we would use airbnb again.\"",,,,,
6939454,41520558,2015-08-07,32774103,Jerome,"This was a beautifully renovated 2 bedroom apartment in an older Boston neighborhood. It was perfect for our needs: a comfortable place to stay, a playground right up the street, plentiful on-street parking, and the ubiquitous Dunkin Donuts a quarter of a mile away. Sarah was a wonderful and accommodating hostess. We'd highly recommend this charming 2 bed for your next stay in Beantown."
6939454,41852827,2015-08-09,14585989,Stephanie,"Sarah welcomed us with a lot of warmth and immediately made us feel comfortable. She went out of the way to make sure the place is equipped with everything we may need, from kitchen/ breakfast items to spare toothbrushes and bathroom supplies. The place is exactly as described in the pictures. While the building is a bit run down, the appartment is pretty clean. The master bedroom is huge and we loved the fact that there was a baby bassinet, which was super convenient for our 4 months old baby."
As far as the neighborhood goes,it is conveniently located in terms of distance to main attractions. We didn't use public transportation but everything was at a 15minute drive,more or less. However,you need to be aware that this is a 100% African American neighborhood. Not relevant in and of itself,but it may be intimidating if you were not expecting it,"or if you are uncomfortable with diversity. We found it to be super quiet and safe.\""
6939454,42339998,2015-08-12,23502635,Wendi,"Overall it is a nice place. Location is good and the apt is of large space. Sarah is responsive for us and helped us get into her apt. One thing is that my car got towed away in a Tuesday morning because of the street cleaning, which has not been informed."
6939454,42595870,2015-08-14,26756519,Annabelle,Sarah was great and met us at her property (even though she was in the middle of a personal move!).  We were only here for 2 nights and the apartment was great for our needs.  We walked from the subway (Roxbury Crossing) - could have taken a bus to Dudley but we aren't use to coordinating mass transit! Enjoyed walking to Haley's House for pastries.
6939454,43193189,2015-08-17,36385798,Kelly,The host communicated well prior to our arrival a days once I texted her that we arrived she promptly showed up to let us in.  We were quite concerned with the neighborhood  when we arrived since there  were boarded up houses and it appeared to be a VERY run down area.  As we awaited her arrival we think  a drug deal was occurring  one house away.  The apartment was nice and as pictured however there was one ac unit for the entire apartment  and a lingering  odor of cigarette smoke.  Immediately after Sarah left we made some calls and found a safe hotel for our family to stay.
6939454,44784464,2015-08-29,23198157,Saumya,"Sarah was great host. She was helpful, answered my all my queries immediately and would come over incase we needed her help. The house was clean, spacious and comfortable. Would definitely recommend this place to everyone visiting Boston."
6939454,45586502,2015-09-04,29531196,Enrico,Sarah has been lovely in everything! The location is perfect to discover Boston... And the apartment is very cosy... I and my friends had a very beautiful time in Boston and I absolutely recingendo Sarah as a very good host!!
6939454,45801240,2015-09-06,38388044,Jacob,"Great location and pricing, everything was as it was described.  Sarah was very pleasant.  I would definitely recommend this spot."
6939454,46154151,2015-09-08,23111455,Richard,We received a warm welcome at Sarah's. There had been an issue with leaving keys from a previous guest but Sarah was very responsive and made sure this did not affect our stay. The interior is beautiful and a short ride away from central Boston. Recommended!
6939454,46482628,2015-09-11,1364274,Todd,Sarah was a great host! Very accommodating and communicative. Place was exactly as described and we enjoyed our stay.
6939454,47292433,2015-09-17,32319440,Honza,We havent met Sarah during our stay. The appartment was spacious but the kitchen was very pourly equipped one of the window was broken and it could not be closed so during the night it was pretty chilly. Some of the pillows were missing pillow cases and the sheets were not covering the bad properly so kind of nasty if u imagine how many people slept in there before. Location was alright with the parking infront of the house on the street.
6939454,48243227,2015-09-24,32859917,Gamal,Sarah was absolutely wonderful. She was very accommodating with our arrival arrangement. The place is absolutely wonderful and the picture does not do it enough justice. Would stay here in a heartbeat if I ever come back to Boston.
6939454,49063263,2015-09-30,24695782,Francisco,The house was lovely and Sarah was very flexible in accommodating our different departure times. I recommend her highly.
6939454,49579189,2015-10-04,45621298,Wei,"房子有些陈旧,台灯残破不能用,需要配备茶杯和餐具,总之住的不如宾馆酒店舒服"
6939454,50035455,2015-10-08,22375463,Kat,"The host made me and my colleague feel very welcome. The image of the master bedroom is accurate, it is huge!! Sarah was also kind enough to make sure extra air mattresses were blown up even though we did not need them during our stay.  All our needs were met and we really enjoyed our stay."
6939454,50698745,2015-10-13,45535205,Arnaud,Sarah is a very nice person who took really  good care of us during our stay. I would recommend with no hesitation to use the rooms she proposed.
The apartment was exactly as described and very clean when we arrived,very spacious and comfortable.,,,,
"Wifi was also very good.\"",,,,,
6939454,51024271,2015-10-17,35010641,Rob,Our stay was great and Sarah was perfectly charming.
6939454,51155646,2015-10-18,44092089,Bruce,Sarah was very helpful and accomodating. The unit was neat and clean and very spacious. The neighbors were a little noisy and have an outdoor area adjacent to the back bedroom. Overall a very good value for a large family group.
6939454,51596916,2015-10-21,17903535,Amanda,Sarah's flat is an absolute gem. Beautifully furnished and equipped. Sarah was great and helping us to get to the location and everything was absolutely perfect. Check in and out was made very easy as Sarah was on the end of the phone to help. I will definitely recommend staying here and will come back next time I am Boston
6939454,51802493,2015-10-24,22698603,David,"The apartment was very nice, HUGE master bedroom, very clean, and very comfortable.  Close enough to everything by car; didn't quite figure out public transportation to the area.  Would easily recommend, especially for a large group of people as there was plenty of room."
6939454,51944315,2015-10-25,11638347,Michelle,"Me and my family stayed one night in Boston and really enjoyed our stay.  The apartment was large, clean and everything was in order. I did not cook on this short trip but the kitchen seemed well equipped for that. The apartment is well suited for a family, lots of space for the kids to explore and play hide-and-seek!"
6939454,55650130,2015-12-03,45438160,Christina,"Sarah was a great host. Very easy o contact and fast to respond. The apartment was great, very comfortable and warm! Important in the winter months"
6939454,57922759,2015-12-30,21580835,Anthony,"A rather grand old place, the master bedroom was huge!"
The beds were very comfy and there was plenty of room for our party of 7.,,,,,
The neigbourhood is a fair distance from the main sights,but the local bus service was fairly regular. One downside is there is a lack of eat-out options in the immediate vicinity,you have to walk for about 20 minutes to find some decent restaurants.,,,
"We never met Sarah but she was very responsive to any of our queries and check in was painless.\"",,,,,
6939454,58371979,2016-01-02,44791536,Matthew,"Sarah has a beautiful apartment, very clean, lots of space. I would only say that the Roxbury area where it is located is a little rougher than I am used to. Was a very short Uber commute to all areas of Boston."
6939454,61138057,2016-01-31,56539570,Cesar,"Sarah was the best!  Couldn't be more accurate and privacy was not an issue.  I personally liked the neighborhood, reminded me of my childhood!"
6939454,61621152,2016-02-06,45632518,Yalun,Sara is extremly helpful ! great experience
6939454,62367999,2016-02-14,36222512,Thomas,"Sarah was accessible and relatively responsive by phone, although I and my friends did not meet her. However, she advertised several amenities on this listing that were either unavailable or severely compromised during much of our two-day stay. Sarah was unaware that her internet provider had suspended her account, requiring me to inform her that this was the case (she had not paid her bill). My friends and I, all university students, were without internet access (of the utmost importance for students needing to complete assignments, especially at the end of the week) for no fewer than three hours upon arrival. Our first morning there, we discovered that the stove was inoperable because no gas was being delivered to it. We attempted to operate the microwave in the house, but while using it, at 6:45 AM on a Saturday with no precipitation, the power cut out to nearly all of the lights and outlets in the apartment. After I called her again that morning to resolve this second major issue (in a twelve-hour span, no less), Sarah told me that this was likely due to the fact that she would be moving out of the apartment at the end of the month -- another thing that she failed to inform me of at the time of my booking or arrival. Finally, the heating in the apartment was nowhere near satisfactory. My friends and I had to sleep with our coats on because the apartment was so cold. In addition to these pressing problems, the TV also did not have a functional remote, and one of her air mattresses had a hole in it. Overall, while Sarah seems like a nice person in general from our phone interactions, there were some egregious instances of her misleading me and my friends into believing that certain things about the apartment were true, when they were not. Our experience at this apartment was extremely disappointing."

The room was on the third floor, so if you have a huge suitcase that might be difficult to carry. The area doesn't have a ton of things to do, but it's a 5 minutes walk to the train station and you're in downtown Boston in another 15 minutes. We definitely enjoyed our stay!"

숙소 가격도 저렴한 편이였는데,가격에 비해서 방도 넓고 화장실과 집도 깨끗한 편이였어요. 보스턴 시내와도 가까운 편인데,Boston commons 까지 버스로 40분? 정도 걸렸던것 같아요.,,,

I was able to call him through (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN), because I could login into his wifi :) The house is beautiful, and all very clean. The room was also pretty, with towels and all."

He also allowed us to brew his delicious tea and coffee in the morning and evening which was a relief for my parents who can't stand a day without their favourite hot beverages.
About the location: Travelling to downtown was a breeze. we managed to not use uber at all to reach Airport,Harvard,MIT,Quincy Market,China town,Prudential mall

Even if we didn't meet Davis at our arrival, it was very easy to contact Davis through text messages. He gave us all the indications we needed to find his house. Downtown Boston is 20 minutes away from Davis's house by car. In Boston, public parkings are cheaper on weekends but on week days it is better to try to find a parking spot in the street."

11983286,93405649,2016-08-12,8540359,Andrea,"We stayed with Davis and Rachel for two nights while visiting Boston and it was a great experience! Davis communicates everything needed well in advance, is responsive and on top of that incredibly nice. The room and bathroom are immaculately clean and exactly as described. You can sleep there with three people without a problem. It's very calm. The house is beautiful and feels like home! Davis and Rachel made us feel very welcome (even offered to share their burgers with us :)). They also provide information about the city and are thoughtful hosts (as an example, they brought home Boston's Metro newspaper for us which included events)."
The location of their house is a little outside of the city. There are restaurants in walking distance (just as Davis for recommendation). The location works well for visiting Boston. There's a train station about 10 minutes walk from the house that takes you right into the city (about 15 minutes depending on where you want to go). We took the train back after a theater play,so you can even take it back a little later in the night. Having said that,be aware that there are no vending machines at the station and you either pay a lot extra for purchasing the ticket in the train,"or you download the train services app and purchase from there. A single ride cost about $6.\"",,

11983286,95976078,2016-08-21,23315634,Annie,"My sister and I stayed with Davis and Rachael for four days while we visited Boston. We got there a bit later than the original ETA since there was a bit of traffic when we drove up from Baltimore, but Davis was very understanding. When we arrived, he and Rachael warmly welcomed us and Davis gave us a quick tour of their home. Since it was our first visit to Boston, he gave us a list of places to see and shop. He also gave us information about getting around Boston. The train station is very close to their home (there's an app for public transportation in Boston), but my sister and I mainly Ubered and walked around Boston. Davis was a great communicator; he replied to my questions in a timely manner whenever I asked him questions through text or Airbnb. I'm currently training for a half-marathon, and he suggested a few places to go running (both were great by the way!). Overall, my sister and I enjoyed visiting Boston and staying at Davis's and Rachael's home. We look forward to visiting again."

It was clean, comfortable and a very short walk to the New England Baptist Hospital where we had a family member staying for surgery. On-street parking was limited so we left our car in the hospital parking lot and used the metro to get around town. The apartment is on top of Mission Hill, so walking to and from the metro was a bit of daily exercise which we enjoyed! Jeremy was very friendly and responsive. I would stay here again!"

13028092,95971858,2016-08-21,57562420,Shin,"Jeremy was a great host. Not only his response was always quickly, but also he corrected my wrong booking. And I changed our checking time right before, but he responded flexibly."

2683284,11843443,2014-04-16,6951903,Linda,"Kevin was extremely responsive, the apartment is pristine and extremely clean. There are several cafes in the immediate area, a market and a pharmacy across the street and several wonderful restaurants just a block away. We enjoyed our stay!"
2683284,12560906,2014-05-05,13777726,Barbara,Apartment was in a great location for the graduation at Northeastern.  It was close to a few good restaurants and easy walk to Tremont St also.  Parking is the biggest challenge but we did manage a spot in front for Sat night and Sunday which is free parking.
2683284,13141898,2014-05-20,13771222,Dmitri,We had a good experience. The apartment is very clean and all appliances are brand new. The location itself is in a very nice area within a walking distance from downtown and Boston Common.

Well located in front if the Silver line,direct  to Downton,and practical for airport.,,,
Large,modern and clean appartrment  To stay in the basement is a surprise,"but no noise from the street (good isolation). Kevin's assistant very kind and helpful. \"",,,
2683284,13629313,2014-06-01,15603734,Ann,"The apartment was clean and perfect after a long day of exloring Boston. Great neighborhood with cafe, parks, and bus stop right in front. We liked that the bedroom was on the quiet garden away from the street."
2683284,13974799,2014-06-09,8573911,Patrick,"This is an excellent apartment. A wonderful space in Boston. Clean, bright and with new furniture, appliances, etc. We had a lovely visit and absolutely enjoyed Kevin's space."
Aside from the amazing apartment there is a backyard area. We sat out and enjoyed our morning coffee listening to the birds in a pretty outdoor setting. The neighbourhood is clean,quiet and safe. Shops nearby. Grocery,pharmacy,cafés and pubs.,,
A bus stop is just outside your door. Travel to the Boston hotspots in minutes. We were attending a concert in the theatre district and the SL5 took us there in 7 minutes.,,,,,
"This apartment is close to all the downtown action yet it is a very quiet and peaceful space. I can't recommend this place enough. Thank you Kevin. \"",,,,,

We enjoyed the (URL HIDDEN) was far more relaxing than North End, Back Bay, etc. The apartment itself was spacious and quiet.  Bonuses were the great kitchen and backyard.  There were a couple of issues that Kevin and his assistant, Liesl, were very responsive to.  Communications with them was always prompt and entry in and out of the apartment is so convenient."
2683284,15498430,2014-07-10,5654491,Rafae,"Large space, great location, and very responsive hosts. We stayed here during an exceptionally hot week in early July and the A/C worked great - but the A/C does get a little noisy at night. Tuesday is trash day for the building, so they will need access to the trash bins in the back yard via this unit."
"Toro is just a few doors away and it is one of Boston's best tapas restaurants - definitely try it for dinner while you stay here.\"",,,,,
2683284,16361704,2014-07-26,4093292,Kelly,Very nice south end apt. I was staying for work and this place provided a perfect resting spot. Convenient with a silver line stop right outside the door.
2683284,16917169,2014-08-04,12814317,Les,"This was a great stay. The apartment was exactly like the photos and the two of us had plenty of space.  both the king bed and the sofa bed were very comfortable.  The neighborhood felt safe--it's still up and coming but the few buildings on the block that aren't renovated yet, will be in no time, I'll bet.  All the basics are within a couple of blocks walking distance: Walgreen's, Dunkin' Donuts, grocery store, restaurants, liquor store, etc.  Do try Petit Robert, a great little French bistro on Columbus and West Newton.  It became our favorite!  We never got around to doing anything in the terrific backyard, but it would have been ideal for outside meals on a nice day.  Beware, the air conditioner is noisy as can be, but it was nice enough outside that we just turned it off.  If you're going to the airport or South Station (Amtrak, Greyhound) don't waste money on a cab; the Silver Line bus is right outside the door and $2.50 will get you to South Station. (The airport may be more, but we didn't go there.) We ran into a wonderful concert in a park nearby and got to dance--for free--to a great Cuban band!  Do, walk around the neighborhood along the cross streets, like West Newton, Concord, Worcester, etc.  You will see the most beautiful brownstones and courtyards ever--but don't wear high heels because the sidewalks are all brick.  All in all, I would stay at Kevin's place again in a New York minute.  Kevin and his assistant Liesl were very responsive and easy to communicate with.  Superb hosts."
2683284,17526442,2014-08-13,3297571,Victoria,"Kevin was nice and mostly responsive except a hiccup with the check in. The apartment is OK, comfortable bed and new kitchen appliances, water heater is a bit rusty and gives a funny colouration to the water (Kevin emptied the boiler and it got better), the back yard is not very groomed. The apartment was clean but not spotless (crawling baby got dirty hands and feet quite quickly). The neighbourhood is gentrifying, Walgreen's and a nice coffeeshop across the road"
2683284,17974480,2014-08-19,1629059,Brenda,The location in the South End was a perfect location for exploring Boston.  The bus stop for the Silver Line right downtown to Boston Common was right out front.  The frog pond and swan boats in Boston Common were a highlight of our trip.  Flour Bakery just across the road one block had great breakfast and coffee and very friendly locals.  The apartment is just as it looks and had lots of room and a very comfy king size bed.  The woman who lives above did come home late and wake up early and wore high heel shoes that were quite loud so bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper like me.  We did two great tours by Free Tours By Foot.  The Vintage and Art Market on Sunday morning at SOWA were great too.   Toro and Stella were very good restaurants on Washington and lots of nice looking ones on Tremont.
2683284,18088755,2014-08-21,18818095,Ted,"The condo was exactly as described.  Owner was easy to work with, great location.  I like this neighborhood with its restaurants and bars and it is very convenient with access to the silver line bus."
The condo was a little sparse and could be warmed up.   The AC is loud,but luckily the weather was perfect so it didn't run much.,,,,
"I would rent again at this location.\"",,,,,
2683284,18490020,2014-08-27,13929986,Olga,"We had a great stay in Boston. We enjoyed the neighborhood, the shops and restaurants around and felt like locals. The apartment has a wonderful location, is clean and stylish and the kitchen has everything to fix a meal."
We never met Kevin but his assistant Liesl was very helpful and promptly returned our calls. Parking is a bit tight,"but not impossible. Highly recommended.\"",,,,
2683284,18598078,2014-08-28,90437,Ian,"This basement apartment is in a great location to see all Boston has to offer, it is well equipped but sterile. The only point to note is that the bed is EXTREMELY firm, like a rock, I prefer a firm bed but after one night I had to move to the couch which was much better."
2683284,18825441,2014-09-01,4037073,Derek,"Kevin and his assistant, Liesl, were both very responsive and communicative during all phases of our booking/stay!  The apartment has loads of space and is in a great neighborhood with public transit right outside the door.  The apartment and surrounding areas are quiet, and allowed for a tranquil and restful stay.  The kitchen is beautiful with great, high-end appliances; though, it could have been stocked more completely with cooking condiments (cooking oil, sugar, loose salt and pepper in the shaker, etc.), and measuring cups and spoons - easy fix."
The major issues we had with the place:,,,,,
- it wasn't very clean upon our arrival: The floor had not been swept or mopped.  There was hair against the walls and corners and in the bathroom.,,,,,
- Some previous occupant left a bad b/o smell on the fabric couch and the master bed - Pretty nasty.  It seems like the cleaning person might have noticed this and at least tried some Fabreze on it - just saying.,,,,,
- Also,we had to kill quite a few bugs (centipedes,roaches,and silverfish) during our stay.  We understand that we were in an old apartment building in an east-coast city,but maybe more visits from an exterminator would be in order.,
Overall,a pleasant stay in a pleasant neighborhood.  Great coffee shops,markets,and dinner/drink places in close proximity.  A great way to explore the beautiful city.,,
Thanks Kevin and Liesl!,,,,,

2683284,19874244,2014-09-20,16272050,Mike,"Kevin's apartment was absolutely perfect! It was located right next to both the silver line (bus stop) and the rental bikes. We got a 3-day pass for the bikes and navigated the city that way -- which was quite a blast! The neighborhood is just minutes away from the south end, which has a great personality of its own!"
The apartment itself was just as described in the listing. It was clean,modern,and very comfortable. The door locks are combination,so they were extremely convenient for multiple people. Also,Kevin and Liesl were very responsive and friendly.,
"I would definitely recommend this place to anyone else! \"",,,,,
2683284,20202494,2014-09-25,20895728,Terry,"Correspondence before the stay with Liesl, Kevin's assistant, was excellent - clear and timely information. Apartment was exactly as per description; neighborhood is eclectic."
2683284,21823763,2014-10-25,11393448,Frederike Marie,"Kevin and his assistant Liesl are great hosts. Very helpful and nice, easy to communicate with. I can also highly recommend the appartment. It is clean and modern. A lot of room for big luggage (I stayed a month). also, the South end is my favorite part of Boston. Cosy and not too touristic. But still very central. Lots of exelent restaurants. Silverline 4 and 5 depart in front of the house, hubway bike station very close, so convenient."
2683284,21987002,2014-10-27,18847593,Ricardo,"Great location and easy to get around, very walking friendly. Inside the apartment is quiet, clean and spacious. Bed is amazing and huge! Mega plus was the sound system that plugged directly into the iPhone. Kitchen is modern with nice appliances. Key pad entry facilitates everything, eliminates fear of losing keys. Besides that, this is a quieter area of Boston but a great area to lay home base, especially with uber which is very cheap in the area."

2683284,24309520,2014-12-25,24374034,Jenn,"Beautiful apartment, great hosts, perfect location!"
2683284,25325248,2015-01-12,24374034,Jenn,We really loved the apartment.  Unfortunately the occupants were mid-20's employees that were not on their best behavior and had to be sent home.  The process was expedited quickly and the owner's assistant was professional.
2683284,25448427,2015-01-16,5105636,Valerie,"I never met either Kevin or Leisl. Communication was done through Leisl. She informed me the morning before check in that the pipes has burst and would take two to three days to fix. Fortunately, instead of having to cancel and scramble to find alternatives at the last minute, she arranged for me to stay at another one of their properties a short distance away. I am not reviewing the place I had originally booked. The one I stayed in is not currently listed."
Like the original,I still had the entire place to myself. It was spacious. Large TV with access to Netflix. The wireless had some hiccups during my stay and not the most consistent. I had to get some work done,so I just went to get Internet access elsewhere.,,,
Bedding and the place in general was immaculate - clean & comfortable.,,,,,
She left a bag of homemade granola and various teas on the counter to try. That I did.,,,,,
I did have some difficulties with the heater. Despite adjusting it,it constantly stayed at 67 during my stay. Could just be my own user error.,,,,
"TLDR version - Beautiful property in the South End with access to many boutiques & top notch restaurants. Communication was spot on. Book with them!\"",,,,,

2683284,28086022,2015-03-17,27432051,Nisha,The apartment was very nice and modern. Great location in terms of being close to the city. Also a very simple check in process as no key required to access front door. My only comment for travellers staying at the apartment in winter is to take some slippers as the apartment has beautiful tiled floors but these can get very cold.
2683284,28345971,2015-03-22,29042781,Jemma,"Great location with the Silverline T right outside the door, also easy walking distance to some great areas."
The direct neighbourhood felt very safe and has some great cafe's and restaurants nearby (you have to go to Toro the tapas bar which is literally a 2 minute walk!) as well as markets and pharmacies etc.,,,,,
The apartment was a great price for what you get,really good size,good wifi,cable TV and great facilities.,,
The only negative was it was a very cold apartment and could benefit from some rugs to break up all the tiled flooring. Very minimalist decor and freezing floor made it feel sterile and not cosy to come back to after a day in the icy conditions of Boston,would probably be different in the summer though and an easy fix with some rugs. The bed was really comfy!,,,,
Overall a great size apartment,which top of the range facilities and in a perfect location for exploring the sights of Boston.,,,,

2683284,30438281,2015-04-22,22170709,Peter,We had a great stay at Washington Street over the Boston marathon long weekend.  The apartment is spacious and well appointed. It was ideally located. 2km walk to Boston Common or only a few minutes on the Silverline Bus which stopped right outside the apartment. It was also really easy to take the bus to the train station when we left for New York. The apartment was toasty warm on a horrible wet and cold weekend in Boston. Plenty of good restaurants nearby although we couldn't find a decent supermarket. The only small drawbacks were brown water in the bath/shower (but that didn't phase us) and a noisy heating system. Our host communicated with us promptly and accessing the apartment was easy. We would stay again.

Homeless urinating in front of the building and many undesirable characters walking the neighborhood doesn't make me feel safe."

Location is pretty good - not too far from the main restaurants in the South End.  The bed was comfortable, WiFi fast and we liked the stark, minimalist decor."
"The bath water is quite discolored which can be disconcerting but I believe it is just from rusty pipes and isn't uncommon in older Boston construction.\"",,,,,

2683284,33571797,2015-05-30,5424131,Jamie Jungmin,"I stayed in the unit for 4 days with my parents. Previously I used to live in the Boston area for more than 10 years and know well about pros and cons about many apts in Boston – generally old buildings, limited parking space, high price, etc. The reason I chose this unit, not a hotel, was that I needed  kitchen and a table area for tea or light snacks."
Unfortunately,this unit is very disappointing. The problem of this airb&b was the maintenance. When I opened the door of the unit,the air smelt damp and unpleasant. I wanted to take a shower but saw “brown water” coming out from the faucet. And the towels provided by the owner were all dirty and damp. My parents used the bedroom and I used the sofa,but the linens were not clean,and the sofa exuded very unpleasant odor.,
I had a very tight schedule in Boston,so did not have time to find another hotel. Since I couldn’t have had good sleep there,it affected my meetings. I reported this issue to the owner later and got $10 compensation (his reply was surprisingly short -- “thank you for your feedback.”),,,
I never expected a maid service or impeccable condition,but at least “cleanliness and hygiene” could not be negotiated. The price I paid was not low either; I paid $268/night. I think,for the price,I should have booked a hotel.,,

2683284,33807360,2015-06-01,31592347,Aimee,The neighborhood was exactly what we were looking for - a blend of different kinds of people in a neighborhood with a lot of charm. The apartment was nice - the bed very comfortable. It was a little subterranean and had no light but that would have been OK.
What completely ruined the experience for us was the trouble we kept having with the outside door lock. It worked sometimes,and other it just didn't. On Saturday night around 11:00 we could not get in to the apartment,could not reach the host or his assistant,"and I did not hear back from either of them until 11:00 AM the next day. All of our things were in the apartment and we had early flights the next day. So we ended up standing on the street for 45 minutes while we waited for the lock to reset. Airbnb has no phone number on its site. And the host did not believe us. I would steer clear of this one.\"",,

2683284,38327517,2015-07-14,37272097,Sabina,This is a reasonably priced accommodation in a great neighborhood - we found it much better than staying downtown; A lot of the best bars and restaurants are accessible from here and it is a great area to stroll around in. Parking was not impossible either! The hosts were responsive and the house was clean and had everything we needed and everything was easy to use - no problems at all. We would definitely stay here again !
2683284,38591091,2015-07-17,30862106,John,Kevin's place was brilliant. Great facilities and close to Boston common.
There is also some helpful insight into the good places to eat aswell which all delivered!,,,,,
Thanks for having us Kevin if I'm back again I know where to stay,,,,,

2683284,39205079,2015-07-21,37090499,Seth,"The apartment was exactly as described. Sleek, modern, and comfortable are all words I would use to describe this place. So much more convenient and spacious than a hotel. Several restaurants and bars within walking distance. Would definitely stay here again."
2683284,39695256,2015-07-25,18117560,Kay,Kevin and crew were great with communication.  The place was pristine and had everything we needed.  We even found inspiration in the Euro washer/dryer set up.  We loved the location and its proximity to various locations in downtown Boston.  Very great value and highly recommended.
2683284,40098347,2015-07-28,34144466,Olivia,"Boston was a great trip! Leisl was great at communicating with us and even checked in to how we were doing. He was very accommodating with our early check in and late check out, which we really appreciated.The apartment was very clean, well equipped and the location is great, walking distance from some great restaurants. Highly recommended!"
2683284,41066354,2015-08-04,16117257,Peer,See below. Communication was clear and quick
2683284,42254444,2015-08-12,31358322,Emer,"This basement apartment is exactly as it looks in the photos. It's in a good location with plenty of restaurants, a great bakery and an excellent public transport link literally steps away! Lovely and cool in the Summer, it is very secure and roomy and I would absolutely recommend it as a great place to base yourself to explore Boston. Thanks Kevin and Liesl, for a wonderful stay."
2683284,42590600,2015-08-14,3810892,Mark,Kevin's apartment was beautiful and very stylishly furnished. Very conveniently located to explore Boston. Would definitely stay there again.
2683284,43652019,2015-08-21,38782403,Ziwen,"Good house.  Everything is good. You can find anything you want, especially for cooking. It is a home. Best experience there."
2683284,45125366,2015-08-31,39941586,Kelly,"The place was sparking clean and comfortable. Kevin checked in with me through text to see if I needed anything, which I did not. There were plenty of extra clean towels. The water pressure in the shower was strong and water was hot. There is an easy to use coded lock on the door, so you don't have carry around keys. You are able to control the thermostat, which is great. It was 90 degrees one of the days I was there and the central AC worked perfectly. The neighborhood has great restaurant options. Our favorites were B&G Oyster, Banyan, and Flour, all less than a 5 minute walk from the place. I would definitely stay here again."
2683284,46464304,2015-09-11,27584605,Robert,"My wife and I spent 5 lovely days in Kevin's great apartment. It is in a good position close to transport links. The accommodation is just as described in the listing. The rooms were spotless and well equipped. Wi-fi works well, bed is huge and comforable and the outside space was a nice bonus."
A particular strength of Kevin and his assistant Liesl is the very prompt response to any questions we had.,,,,,
"We would very happily book Kevin's apartment again if we ever returned to Boston.\"",,,,,
2683284,47377604,2015-09-18,24749678,Noah,We stayed in Kevin's apartment for 3 nights and were very happy with our time there.
The apartment is a great size,plenty of room for the two of us and more.  It was clean and the code on the door made for very easy access.,,,,
This neighborhood may be the best feature.  You are right on a street with plenty of restaurants,bakeries and coffee shops all within walking distance.  We had one of our best meals in Boston just down the street!,,,,
We were also right by public transportation,however,we either walked or took Uber to any other neighborhoods and it was never more than $15 and more often than not,under $10.,,
I'd recommend a stay at Kevin's for anyone staying in Boston.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
2683284,48391028,2015-09-26,38957297,Sandy,The location is perfect.  Apartment is as described - no issues.  Loved the neighbourhood.  Very pretty and tons of good restaurants.  Yard needs cleaning so that morning coffee is more enjoyable.  Upstairs neighbors are noisy.
2683284,48754272,2015-09-28,14840275,Nathaniel,nice clean place.

2683284,49778369,2015-10-06,39432721,Randy,"This apartment is perfect!  Impeccably clean, spacious and quiet.  Nicely furnished ( for example Bosch appliances).  For those with back issues the mattress is wonderfully firm."
2683284,50851222,2015-10-15,15473488,Zhiya,"Silver line bus stop is just outside the apartment, so we did not have any problem when coming from the airport (also Kevin gave very detailed instruction). The apartment is perfectly clean and well organised. We really enjoyed our stay here and we would sincerely recommend it."
2683284,51301355,2015-10-19,43305012,Rebecca,"The apartment was fabulous! Very clean, nicely laid out, and perfect for our needs. The host's information about the area was very helpful (yum, Flour!). We were really pleased to find such a nice spot to stay, and my brother who lives in then neighborhood was impressed with what a nice place we ended up staying at. Thanks very much for helping us have a great time in Boston!"
2683284,52111933,2015-10-26,10371564,Stephanie,"This apartment was even better than it photographs. The locations was ideal for our plans, Kevin was helpful and made us feel welcome. The apartment is HUGE and there was more than enough space for the 4 of us. I would absolutely stay here again next time I'm in Boston."
2683284,54775350,2015-11-23,1910164,John,"Clean, easy access, very friendly."
2683284,55211941,2015-11-29,43307627,Paige,"\"Space was exactly as advertised:  sleek, clean & modern situated conveniently in the South End.  Kevin is very responsive to any questions, so we will be returning!  PS previous reviews stated that the entry way was \"\"messy\"\"you should know that this is not a fault of the host"
2683284,58216795,2016-01-01,30359025,Anne,"We had a great stay here.  The apartment was clean and centrally located near conveniences -- a small grocery, Walgreens and (most importantly) Flour Bakery!  This was also a great space for our family as there was nothing our toddler could break and the bedroom and living room were at opposite ends of the apartment making for easy nap time!"
2683284,60090743,2016-01-18,31796015,Mahmood,"Had a great stay at Kevin's place. The space was comfortable, modern & cool. Great convenient location. Didn't get a chance to use the yard but it looked great.  I'd suggest bringing along slippers if you are staying in the winter, the marble floors were a lil chilly for bare/socked feet!"
2683284,61307680,2016-02-02,45399149,Mike,"THe apartment is an excellent place to stay for a visit to Boston.  The bus line is right outside the door, there are great restaurants and coffee shops within a block or two."
2683284,62778911,2016-02-16,29887454,Ruta,"This is an excellent place to stay in Boston. Very clean, pleasant décor, all the kitchen supplies you would need, and so conveniently located. You can login into your Netflix account and chill out with some TV. Bed is very comfortable. The bus to downtown stops literally outside the door. The neighborhood felt very safe, and had plenty of great restaurants and cafes nearby."
Note that the floors are all marble. They are beautiful. Something to note,though,they can get very cold.. Slippers are thoughtfully provided to wear inside,but not everyone would be comfortable wearing slippers others have worn. If that's the case for you,bring some extra cushy socks! It was freezing when we visited and my feet were cold. However,it gave us a chance to test out the heating and the heat in this apartment works very well!
"I would definitely come back!\"",,,,,
2683284,63313764,2016-02-21,14983780,Leslie,Very clean apartment. Nice and quiet. Great kitchen to cook meals in.

2683284,64017180,2016-02-28,48046399,Alain,This place is exactly as described by the host. Great location and very quick response by the host. All the amenities you could ask for. Thank you Kevin for making this a simple and easy process.
2683284,67317787,2016-03-28,48964433,Justine,"This place gets 5 stars. Floor was a bit dirty upon arrival but everything else was spotless. This is the perfect unit. Location was pretty good too, walking distance to downtown. Mostly anything you needed was close by. I felt very comfortable at this Airbnb. I have tried to contact the host to thank him for such a great stay but have not heard from him since day of booking. So thank you Kevin!! Highly recommend this little unit to everyone! Would defibrillator stay here again!"
2683284,68330757,2016-04-04,7624371,Alexander,"I stayed at Kevin's lovely apartment for a week while attending a conference in the Back Bay / Newbury Street area. The apartment is exactly as described / pictured and was really nice. I had everything I needed to do some moderate cooking, so that was convenient, and they provided virtually everything else I needed for my stay (towel, slippers, a bar of soap, etc.). The space itself is big but homey and could easily accomodate a family or a few friends. The neighborhood is quaint and there are lots of great restaurants in the area. It's also only a 15 / 20 min walk to the heart of downtown - and a nice walk at that! Communication was easy and I have no complaints. Will definitely stay there again!"

2683284,69129784,2016-04-09,42928738,Kyle,"Super nice apartment. Very clear directions regarding how to go the apartment, things you may need to know during your stay etc. I really enjoyed my stay and would recommend the apartment to others!"
2683284,69495835,2016-04-11,7811465,Brandi,"The apartment is true to the photos, minus the (very cool!) updated artwork. It's in a great location, and the bus is right outside if you need public transportation. Very happy with my rental and I'd definitely come back."
2683284,69738256,2016-04-13,35604595,Jason,"The apartment was fantastic, great location and great layout.  The pullout sofa was also very good for the night my brother stayed. I recommend this apartment to anyone staying in Boston!"
2683284,70703889,2016-04-19,45459594,Joel,This is a great place. My first experience with an this service and I have to say that it was a great one. I stayed for marathon weekend. The walk to the finish line and to take the busses to the start not bad. Maybe 1.2 miles or so. Many good places to have breakfast and close enough to good restaurants! If I do the race again I would definitely look for this place!
2683284,71492023,2016-04-25,8908870,Steffen,"When we arrived, there wasn't enough sheets, towels etc. for all of us. We encountered a mouse or a rat, something that had eaten our bread and spread it over the kitchen while we were sleeping, but we only experienced it once. The cleaning wasn't super great."
Overall it felt expensive for what it was,"but we had a great time nonetheless and the host was excellent at fixing any issues we had and swiftly as well. \"",,,,
2683284,72124221,2016-05-01,66654282,Chaoqun,Kevin was so nice when I faced questions. The room was really perfect and clean that makes our staying like home

2683284,73155406,2016-05-07,50319058,Abigail,"This was my first airbnb experience, and I was very impressed.  The apartment was lovely, very comfortable and just as advertised in the listing.  Kevin was very easy to reach when I contacted him to confirm, a few days before my trip, and we had everything we needed at the apartment.  It felt very safe and cozy."
2683284,75358145,2016-05-20,61434781,Pam,"Great flat in very useful location. We used the buses, all within a ocuple of minutes walk, to go to/from airport, South Station, Downtowm, Copley Square, Cambridge and JFK Museum. Neighbourhood felt safe and plenty of places to eat nearerby."
2683284,77295564,2016-05-31,40408636,Lilei,"It was great staying at Kevin's place. It was spacious, clean, and full of character. The location is also really good, next to good restaurants and bakeries. Overall a great experience."
2683284,77876373,2016-06-04,2125618,Dimple,It was our first time in Boston and this condo didn't disappoint! Lovely condo in the heart of South end! Easy access to the bus/subway. Nice and roomy for our family of three. We got lucky and found overnight parking on the street. Overall amazing property for everyone!

2683284,80027735,2016-06-15,74370799,Nate,"The location is good. Several bus stops around you can walk to. And markets and restaurants are around the corner. BUT things in kitchen and bathroom are less satisfied. IF you live for several days, it is great for you to prepare for all the little things in these two places."
2683284,80807098,2016-06-19,6509669,Jordan,"Kevin's place was exactly as advertised. Great layout, great location, and easy access to the unit. I highly recommend this place!"

2683284,86123194,2016-07-15,59695846,George,The place was a wonderful stay for our short time in Boston. The neighbourhood had plenty of fantastic eating places and was in a great spot that allowed us to get around the city quickly.
2683284,87525896,2016-07-20,36547041,Tyler,My wife and I decided to take a trip to Boston for the first time.  We are from California and were heading out East for vacation as well as seeing our SF Giants play at Fenway and Yankee Stadium.
For the three nights in Boston,"Kevin's sleek and modern South End apartment was everything and more that we could have hoped for.  The location is perfect.  We walked or \"\"ubered\"\" cheap anywhere and everywhere we went in Boston.",,,,
Not only is the location awesome,the apartment was beautiful.  Personally,I love the clean,white aesthetic to the place.  On top of that,Kevin has essentially an entire brochure print-out ready for anyone staying that highlights restaurants,coffee
2683284,89033038,2016-07-26,3676701,Margo,"Amazing apartment in lovely neighborhood, perfect for my work trip. Kevin was easy to communicate with and super accommodating. Love keyless entry for easy checkin!"

It's very easy to get to the main sites by foot or car and the Silver Line bus is just outside. Cheap Uber/cab rides to Back Bay, Beacon Hill and Fenway. Kevin was a great host, returning messages quickly and with perfect detail. The only bummer was that we couldn't take advantage of the back garden because it was absurdly hot outside, but it's a lovely spot and my kids enjoyed the little bit they were out there. We'll absolutely stay at Kevin's on our next trip up!"

2021274,11667244,2014-04-11,13308561,Jan,"Evy and Khai are excellent hosts, very friendly and supportive. Communication is clear and perfect. The house and place is nice, clean and well maintained. Bedroom has a nice quality bed. Bathroom is very clean and nice. Washer/dryer makes it easy if you stay longer like me (3 wks.). Kitchen and living room, shared with hosts, are easy to access and to use at any time. The house is in lovely area near City Point, walking distance to Pleasure Bay and beaches, excellent for running or walking. Transportation to the area is by 3 bus lines, works perfect, the bus stops are just 2-3 blocks from the house, the buses go quite frequently, about 10 min to go to Red Line T South St. or Broadway St. My overall impression is that Evy and Khai do enjoy having guests in their house and it shows. Very pleasant experience. Next time in Boston I'll gladly stay again. Recommend."

The guest area of the flat is very comfortable and spacious, with its own facilities that make it feel almost like a self-contained flat. When I'm back in Boston I'd be very happy to stay with them again. Oh yes, and their puppy Rosco is adorable!"

They were very helpful with directions, the best buses and trains to take and places to eat.  Their basement apartment was comfortable and cozy.  It's just a short walk to the bus stop and about a 10-15 minute ride to downtown.  It's also just a couple of blocks from a beach with walking/jogging path.  We would consider staying there in the future."
2021274,12732827,2014-05-09,1812577,Liz,"Evy and Khai were awesome hosts for my parents and I on a cross-country stay. My family loved your fun home, neighborhood, and of course Rosco (they're still talking about him today). It was their first experience with airbnb and I'm glad it was a great one, they said they could've stayed a week (even though we were there for only a night). Highly recommended from SF, would definitely stay again."

But what is a great city without a decent place to stay....The hosts Evy & Khai made me feel at home.,,,,,
The souterrain appartement was both spacious and comfortable. Also its location allowed for quick trips to the city centre or to the beach.,,,,,
Thank you very much for your hospitality!,,,,,
@Rosco: Thanks for being a good guard;) I hope you'll find another buddy to play with very soon!,,,,,

2021274,13468177,2014-05-28,7851744,Erica,Pros:
Evy and Khai were very easy to work with - they were responsive to texts,emails,etc quickly.,,,
The space they rent is spacious,comfortable,and clean.,,,
Their home is very close to the bus stops and the neighborhood is quite quaint.  (The 7 bus does not run on Sundays - I had to learn this the hard way!  Just FYI),,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
There is no door dividing your space from the rest of the house - it's just at the bottom of a set of stairs,so there's less privacy than you might expect.  Also their dog (who is adorable and friendly) is able to wander down anytime they are not home - this did not bother me as I enjoyed his company,"but it seems like a simple gate at the top of the staircase would be a nice offering. \"",,,
2021274,15938439,2014-07-18,850363,Zeke,"Evy's apartment was big and comfortable. The bed was soft and the bathroom was clean, large, and well-stocked. The rented area was separated from the main living space by a stairway, and apart from a friendly and inquisitive puppy coming by to visit I had plenty of privacy."
2021274,16284374,2014-07-24,3752525,Auberon,"Great place! Very clean, stylish and the hosts were very responsive and sweet! The adorable puppy greeting is an added plus !"
2021274,16755859,2014-08-01,2155715,Alejandro,"Evy's place was wonderful and exactly as portrayed in the pictures. Evy was responsive, polite and overall a great host."
2021274,16875506,2014-08-03,9882505,Antoine,A disappointing experience...
First,the  good points : Evy is very effective and flexible: I could check in at my convenience and leave my luggage during the afternoon after I checked out. South Boston is a nice place to stay. Charming residential area close to the beach and having cafes and restaurants  at walking distance. Evy 's listing is very clean.,,,,
However,the itself is not what I expected: It is located in a basement (as said in the description),with very small windows with scarcely any daylight. In the bedroom,the small window is even covered by the garden wooden deck.,,
"The basement place is not private as no door separates the first floor from the basement. I found the title \"\"your own 800 sq feet\"\" misleading in that sense.",,,,,
"\"",,,,,
2021274,17700237,2014-08-16,18491982,Ken,This was a wonderful experience and a beautiful home.  The location could hardly have been more convenient to downtown and historical sites.  Roscoe was an added wonderful treat. With the rain we really appreciated their thoughtfulness in providing us umbrellas.  Their house is definitely a place we hope to stay again.
2021274,18343445,2014-08-25,11995959,Julien,"Khai & Evy were nice hosts, always available for any question we may have during our 3 nights stay at their place, which is exactly like described, and clean."
Communication was easy,as well as getting the keys.,,,,
It is true that their isn't much sun light in the guest floor (basement) but no issue if you are using the place mostly to be outside visiting beautiful Boston.,,,,,
The dog has never been an issue as Rosco carefully listens to its masters.,,,,,
Boston doesn't like cars. We had to spend time and $$ to park anywhere in town,and in order to avoid fines or being towed,be advised!,,,
Overall good experience staying at Khai & Evy's,"that we would recommend as hosts. \"",,,,
2021274,19520861,2014-09-14,17952328,Lesley,Evy was very welcoming and we loved Rosco her beautiful Australian shepherd dog. The apartment was spacious and very clean the bathroom and shower very good. We stayed for 8 days and yes as previous reviewers have pointed out it was a basement apartment and didn't have much natural light particularly the bedroom however we were out most of the time so was not a problem. We are British and I found the use of paper plates and cups and plastic spoons wasteful and would have preferred proper plates and cups but this may well be a cultural preference as we noticed in the USA that the use of throwaway plates etc is endemic. A toaster would have been a bonus for breakfast in the morning. We were unable to have anything other than a hot drink and sandwich in the apartment and it would have been nice to be able to make breakfast in the morning. The kitchen are could be a little better equipped. We adored Rosco and took him for a walk every morning to Castle Island and we will really miss him. The south area of Boston has excellent transport links buy a 7 day Charlie ticket for 19 dollars well worth it Several restaurants and bars in the area so you don't need to travel to midtown to eat in the evening. Nordstrom rack great for bargains loved Boston and had a great time there. If we did return to Boston would probably stay around the South Boston area.
2021274,19871553,2014-09-20,3239792,Barb,"Evy and Khai were great hosts. From helping me with my luggage, to having a nice carafe of water waiting for me in the mini-bar, they went out of their way to be welcoming and helpful."
Overall,I felt like the photos underplayed how nice the living space was. The living room area is very large,and the bedroom is also large. The bathroom is very nicely appointed... it even includes a jacuzzi tub. (I didn't get to try that out,but it looked pretty great.),,
It's clear that the hosts are very interested in making your stay great. They even have a luggage scale handy to make sure you don't get hit with airline surcharges. How thoughtful is that?!,,,,,
I was in town for a conference at the BCEC which is just over a mile away.  A two and a half block walk to a bus stop and catching a single bus got me dropped off about a block from the conference center. The trip home was equally easy.,,,,,
Grocery stores and eateries are nearby and Evy and Khai were happy to make recommendations.,,,,,
Perhaps the best part for me was their 16 month old Australian Shepherd. Roscoe is smart and impressively trained and well-behaved. He responds to a good array of verbal commands and hand signals. If you're a dog lover,he might even make a visit downstairs to play and or share some puppy love.  If you're not a dog lover,I'm confident that he'd get the hint quickly.,,,
I'd highly recommend this rental,"especially for those attending conferences at the BCEC. \"",,,,
2021274,21385054,2014-10-16,21101112,Janice,"The pictures and description was accurate . The kitchen picture was correct. There was not a picture of the living, bedroom and bath area. They were also very nice and in a similar style. The neighborhood location was perfect, and convenient to the public transportation, which we did use. There were several nice local restaurants, which Evy had suggested. The house was close to the water, and was a great place to run."
2021274,21604591,2014-10-20,12931803,Julieta,We had a great time with Evy. The communication with her was really good and the place is spacious and clean. The area has restaurants and bars and it's a couple of blocks away from the bus stop that takes you downtown in 15 minutes.  The only con for us was that the mattress is really soft but that's a personal preference. We definitely recommend it! Evy is a great host!
"\"",,,,,
2021274,21923489,2014-10-26,21918370,Matthew,"Our check in and check out with Evy was seamless. Although we didn't meet her in person during our stay, we did meet Roscoe, her dog who was a pleasure to be around ( be sure to keep your shoes in your room otherwise they may become an object of play for the pup!). If you don't mind transiting into town by bus or paying for a cab, this place is a good place to stay. It is not close to the subway station. The neighborhood was quiet and felt safe when we were walking around at night."
2021274,22147206,2014-10-31,2125908,Ana,Evy and Khai were wonderful hosts. Their duplex is very charming and the basement apartment is spacious and comfortable.
The location is great for taking buses and there were always Ubers near by.,,,,,
The only complaint I had is that the bathroom didn't seem just cleaned. I felt like I was using someone else's bathroom so I found a spray cleaner and just wiped it down myself.,,,,,
"Overall I do recommend the space.\"",,,,,
2021274,22276595,2014-11-02,12454066,Michelle,"Even though we had to change our arrival time a couple of times, Evy was very understanding and replied quickly. As soon as we walked through the door, we were greeted by her cute dog who was fun to play with! The basement was comfortable and had plenty of space. Evy recommended us to a couple of great restaurants, including Neptune's which was delicious! The location is great and only a couple of minutes from downtown Boston. Evy was a great host and made sure that we had everything we needed."
2021274,22581287,2014-11-10,18901298,Tetsuro,"Evy was a wonderful host. She reply to all the message very quickly, and help us stay very comfortably. I definitely recommend this place to  everyone."
2021274,23652959,2014-12-07,592946,Josiah,Great place to stay near the heart of Boston. Our hosts were very accommodating and responsive to inquiries and requests.  Best to find overnight parking somewhere out of the neighborhood and take a bus to the house.
2021274,25347851,2015-01-12,22689152,Amy,The reservation was canceled 95 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2021274,26668014,2015-02-16,27746109,Michael,"Evy was an amazing host! She accommodated me even on short notice and an impending blizzard. The room and space I stayed in was immaculate. Her wonderful house made me feel cozy and welcomed. Not to mention the beautiful dog she has, Roscoe! If you are looking for a place to stay in Boston, Evy's place should be highly considered."
2021274,27483497,2015-03-05,10845194,Emily,This was an excellent AirBNB experience and a great value. The guest area is an entire floor with a living room and fire place.  Everything is very high quality and luxurious. Evy and her partner were very helpful and friendly. I will stay here everytime I have to come to Boston.
2021274,27764716,2015-03-11,5164301,Bee,"The neighborhood is quiet and quaint. Lots of useful stuff within walking distance, cabs come quickly and get you where you need to go. A cab from here to BCEC is about $6-7, so no big deal."
The place is lovely and well appointed.  Gorgeous,comfortable bathroom with jacuzzi tub that definitely helped me and my travel partner after long days of convention staff work.  Beds were comfortable.  The place is well lit,warm and fees like home.  The cutest dog ever lives here.  Evy and her partner are amazing,gracious and attentive hosts.,,
"Highly recommend. \"",,,,,
2021274,28989974,2015-04-02,22955222,Siew Sun,"Evy, Kai, and Rosco (a cute & handsome dog) made me feel very welcome throughout my stay.  The house is locate in a safe and beautiful neighborhood.  I could easily walk 25 mins to the convention center, or take Bus 7.  Living in a place with a kitchen when I travel has really helped me eat healthily."
2021274,29151457,2015-04-04,8730782,Bill,"This place is really really nice, clean, quiet, and the host is extremely friendly. Highly recommended to anyone. An excellent value for the price, for any price."
2021274,30626677,2015-04-25,2005117,Mohammed,"The host (Evy) was very nice, welcoming, and kind. Whenever I wanted anything, I would just talk to/text her. The place is separated in two floors, main and guests floor. The guest floor is modern and comfortable, however, it isn't as large as it looks in the pictures."
The neighborhood is so nice and quite,narrow roads with nearby shops. Don't bring a car with you to avoid troubles with parkings,"like what happened to me.\"",,,
2021274,31555696,2015-05-06,1243033,Jason,It was a pleasure staying at Evy's place - it is on a quiet street and the space was neat and clean - plus Evy and her husband are great people! Highly recommend.
2021274,31679523,2015-05-08,31306134,Mohit,"Evy is a gracious hostess. From her busy schedule she found time to fire up the grill and we enjoyed the conversation over BBQ. She made the whole process very easy for a newcomer on Airbnb, she made it all ok!! Her home is very welcoming and it is a short walk to the ocean where I enjoyed running for miles.  The neighborhood is safe no concerns about walking after dark!  I hope to stay again at Evy's and I would encourage anyone trying Airbnb in Boston to look her up!  Thanks again, Evy!"
2021274,31741287,2015-05-09,1243033,Jason,It was a pleasure to stay with Evy again - she is a gracious host.
2021274,31906539,2015-05-11,28720414,Latha,"The location was great, rooms as described and prefect for a short stay - really close to the airport which was great for us."
2021274,34167638,2015-06-05,34441736,Jacob,"Evy was very accommodating considering my flight changes and odd work schedule.  All of my expectations for the stay were met, and I would highly recommend Evy to anyone looking to visit Boston.  The area is decent and with Uber I was able to get where I needed quickly."
"Rosco was also great!\"",,,,,
2021274,34258317,2015-06-06,21834164,Jan,"Evy could not have been a more communicative, charming and welcoming host. The apartment was just as described. The guest space was impeccable and large. The bed was comfortable and it was great having a private bathroom. This was, without a doubt, better than staying in a hotel room! Evy was also super helpful in acquainting me with where to pick up the bus in the morning. Roscoe is also a very friendly and welcoming dog! Evy also left a couple bottles of her own cold-brewed tea - it was delicious and I was very impressed. One thing to note that I hadn't read in any of the other comments:  house rules are that you take off your shoes by the front door; you may want to bring slippers with you since the downstairs area is all bare floors."
2021274,34639255,2015-06-10,23953991,Rich,Evy was an excellent host. She made me feel welcome from the moment I walked in the door. The accommodations are excellent...private and quiet. Great place.
"Easy walk to the convention center (20 - 25 min) and great access to running along the waterfront.\"",,,,,
2021274,35420351,2015-06-18,21384970,Ali,"Evy was very accommodating for my late check in and she was very responsive when I had any questions. The place was super nice and clean and accurately matched the description provided. The space was separate and very private with a nice living area, a bedroom and a private bathroom. The bed was super comfortable and I truly didn't want to get up in the morning!"
The neighborhood was nice and quite and I was able to walk downtown in less that 40min which is not bad in the summer time.,,,,,
"Evy provided me with information folder which included everything from WIFI info to surrounding attractions. This was a very nice touch and highly appreciated.\"",,,,,
2021274,36066712,2015-06-24,23223384,Xiaokang,"Evy is an entrepreneur what she is doing now is really attractive. Of course,  her lovely room is awesome, both my aunts feel good and they love their first Airbnb experience, they love to experience more on Airbnb."
2021274,37003850,2015-07-03,36622446,John,Evy was great! Bottom Floor was clean and comfortable. Wouldn't change a thing.
"\"",,,,,
2021274,37593784,2015-07-08,5626896,David,"This is a wonderful apartment.  Clean, spacious, quiet.  The hosts were welcoming and not intrusive."
2021274,38459025,2015-07-15,9431879,Sara,"Very responsive during the booking process. She was very nice and accommodated travel delay without an issue. The room is very clean and nicely decorated. It's private - in the basement - but with a bathroom right next door. I liked that it had a closet with hangers - I was there for a business meeting. Also, the lamented welcome packet was a nice touch. I wish I could have stayed longer to check out the rest of the neighborhood!"
2021274,40604348,2015-08-01,35726591,Mark,"The appartment was spacious and clean. There's one bedroom, a bathroom and a livingroom with a small kitchenette all for yourself. Unfortunately the fridge was not working during our stay but Evy was trying to resolve this issue. With 2 large beds and 1 small bed therevis enough space for 5 persons."
"Communicaton with Evy was good and the tips she gave were a great help. We enjoyed our stay in Boston and the appartment.\"",,,,,
2021274,41521139,2015-08-07,34070124,Michael,"Evy and Khai have a nice place in South Boston.  The duplex is comfortable and pleasant.  We asked for it to be set up with two beds and my son and I were comfortable.  We used the duplex as a place to crash while doing college visits, so we didn't spend much time there and with Evy and Khai, but our hosts were kind and helpful."
IMPORTANT TIP:  South Boston has no parking accommodations for non residents,so if you bring a car expect a hard time finding a parking spot and a ticket.  We got ticketed on one of our two night stays,"so parking averaged $20/night - not bad for city rates.\"",,,
2021274,43204184,2015-08-17,7766304,Siyun,"Evy always gives me the most detailed instructions and some tips about the neighborhood are really helpful! It's a fun experience that I was kind of frightened as her dog was barking at me and made me nervous but it turns out the dog is really friendly soon as I  entered the room. The bed is extremely comfortable maybe too soft? Overall, I'm really happy about the stay and recommend others as well."
2021274,43392299,2015-08-19,34408938,Nicole,"Evy's place was perfect for my stay in Boston, while I was attending a conference at the Convention center. Very convenient location; close to the airport and in walking distance to the Convention center. The communication with Evy was very easy. She welcomed me when I arrived in the evening and showed me my space, which is exactly as described on the website. Everything was extremely clean, tidy, and organized -- with information sheets about the neighborhood, essential toiletries in the bathroom!"
2021274,43862220,2015-08-22,20990037,Johannes,"Es hat alles wunderbar geklappt, die Lage ist super und Evy hat uns ein gutes Restaurant / Bar in der Nähe empfohlen. Nur die Qualität der Matratze ließ etwas zu wünschen übrig, meine Tante hat leider sehr schlecht darauf geschlafen."
2021274,44341259,2015-08-25,34253344,Alessandra,Great location.. The room was very comfortable and clean..you have all you need! 10 minutes to downtown..If I have the chance to come back to Boston I ll return in this beautiful location!!
2021274,45460238,2015-09-03,30329358,Robyn,"Envy was very warm and welcoming despite our late arrival and Rosco the dog was very friendly. The location was very central, close to shops and transport and only about 10 minutes from both town and the airport. We enjoyed our evening walks down to the beach. The apartment was very spacious and private with a large living area in addition to the bedroom."
2021274,46129584,2015-09-08,23503460,Janet,Evy made us feel welcome with her smile and her kind attention to our comfort. She answered our many questions with great information and canny advice.
2021274,46600105,2015-09-12,38321845,William,"We arrived on the morning and checked-in with no problems at all, Evy & Khai were friendly and always happy to help us with any questions we had throughout the trip. The Duplex was great, and exactly as described. After check-out Evy even kindly agreed to look after our bags in the evening, so we could pick them up before our late evening train back down to New York. There were also lot's of nice little extras that showed a lot of thought went into making sure guests had a great stay (like the pack of toothbrushes left in the bathroom which proved useful on realising I'd completely forgotten mine!)"
Roscoe (their dog) was awesome,we're not really dog people but by the time it came to leave we wanted to take him with us!,,,,
"We wouldn't hesitate to stay again. Thanks again Evy & Khai.\"",,,,,
2021274,48459708,2015-09-26,43093926,Ken,"Great first Airbnb experience, far exceeding expectations.  A comfortable, quiet spot right near the beach in South Boston."
2021274,49027554,2015-09-30,30022959,Amanda,Evy was a great host. Her place was very convenient to everything. We were able to walk everywhere or easily get a taxi to places. She is very helpful on where to go and want to do. We really enjoyed our stay with her. We would definitely stay here again!
2021274,49393798,2015-10-03,45173268,Ralph,Excellent recommendations  for this host & facilities. Evy is very friendly & accommodating. Look forward to keeping in touch with her
2021274,50371835,2015-10-11,21548317,Vivien,A great host and the puppy was especially adorable! My girl friends and I and a wonderful time in Boston and the place was very accessible using Uber or Lyft. The fireplace in the living room was taken advantage of and we stayed warm and cozy during that unseasonably cold week.
2021274,51549292,2015-10-21,6340848,Lanisa,"Evy and her husband were very helpful hosts. They were accommodating with our check-in time, which was on the earlier side and allowed us to store beverage/food in their upstairs fridge when the one downstairs needed to be serviced. They even offered us dinner and wine one of the nights since we happen to come back around dinner time. The semi-private space downstairs was equipped with a cozy fireplace for lounging since the bedroom is pretty dark (but perfect for sleeping). The bathroom was well-stocked with the necessities. We also loved all the playtime with their Australian Shepherd, Rosco, who is one of the friendliest dogs we've met."
Southie is a quiet,residential neighborhood,so things close fairly early; but it's also a quick 10 min Uber ride to Boston downtown. Although parking is for residence only,we did park our rental overnight for one night and didn't receive any tickets - so you can always try your luck. Even if you do get the $25 ticket,it's about the same as parking the car overnight at a garage and cabbing it back and forth.,
"We definitely recommend this duplex for any Boston travlers for the value and convenience.\"",,,,,
2021274,52141171,2015-10-26,15612362,Ashley,"Evy's place was absolutely perfect for our stay in Southie. My boyfriend and I came in for one night before a wedding and were pleasantly surprised upon arriving at Evy's gorgeous home. Roscoe, their friendly and loving dog, greeted us once we walked in the door and we loved it! The pictures do not do this place justice, and we found it to be even better than we expected. Evy left us towels, assorted toiletries, water, tea, and even a map of Southie with her favorite spots to eat and drink! It was such a wonderful experience and the bed was by far the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. I would definitely recommend staying with Evy if you are ever in Southie! Thanks again Evy, hopefully we will be back soon!"
2021274,52400350,2015-10-29,41208860,Marc,"Fantastic overall experience. Evy and Khai were welcoming and friendly.  Their dog Rosco may be one of the coolest dogs ever!  Room was clean, and there were fresh towels and toiletries.  Location was perfect. I could uber everywhere I needed to go in Boston in less than 15 minutes. Would definitely stay their again."
2021274,52536103,2015-10-30,47018675,Chris,Great space.  There's a fantastic combination of privacy (your own floor!) and roominess.  Evy was a GREAT communicator leading up to my stay and could not have made anything easier.
I was in Boston for work so not a lot of chit chat time but Evy and Roscoe the dog were really friendly.  I wish I could have spent more time there.,,,,,
"Overall a very good experience.  I would definitely stay with them again.\"",,,,,
2021274,52843478,2015-11-02,33326863,Randi,Evy 's place in South Boston was a dream! It was really nice to have a shared community in a semi-private space downstairs.  Evy left all of the essentials we would need and even shared a few glasses of wine upon our return home inter evening.  It's in a residential neighborhood but all of your essential needs are close by including Local 149- a great little bar and restaurant a few blocks away. You do have to take a bus into downtown Boston but it's fairly easy and we never had any problems making it where we wanted to be.  Evy and Khai are really nice and welcoming without intruding at all.  Their dog Roscoe is just a big harmless fluff ball who loves people. The bed was incredibly comfortable and we really appreciated the fireplace and the heated bathroom floors.  Thanks for a great stay!
2021274,54724887,2015-11-23,10646181,Yusuke,"Evy and her husband Khai were great host! I booked the place for my job interviews at Boston Convention center, and the room was perfect. Amazingly comfortable bed, big closet, and a desk were essential for business trip!"
Also the living room had stove,sofa,and small single bed,I had no change to use them because I was the only one who used the entire room,but it must be great if you come here with your friend(s).  Oh and Roscoe was adorable host-dog!,
I want to visit again,"but for sightseeing next time!\"",,,,
2021274,64733057,2016-03-06,38027254,Hanfeng,"I enjoyed this house . I slept tow days in here. I felt that bed was comfortable . About the live room have a five place so warm, my family liked here, importantly the host was polite and very care us , when we hunger she tall us where have good restaurant . She was a helpful person"
2021274,66823637,2016-03-25,62181096,Dawnmarie,"My stay at Evy's home was absolutely amazing!  She welcomed me with the most incredible hospitality from the moment I stepped on her front porch until I left Boston four days later.   The whole downstairs floor including a family room w/ a fireplace, a bathroom w/ a jacuzzi tub, and a bedroom with the most comfortable memory-foam type mattress were all mine.   I came to town for an event at the Convention Center and uber/lyft was really convenient and only cost a few dollars each way (*much easier than renting a car and trying to park it in South Boston).   Seriously... this place rocked and Evy is as genuine and kind as they come hostess-wise.  I highly recommend staying with her!   oh, and Rosco the dog is pretty rad too.  An all around 5-star stay."
2021274,68857506,2016-04-07,9085426,Mary Beth,What a beautiful home and couple! Evy and Khai could not have been any sweeter. Comfy beds and nice privacy.
2021274,70387612,2016-04-17,8533492,Mikaela,We had a great stay at Evy's place. She was very welcoming and helpful trough out the stay. Place was awesome as well!
2021274,71379922,2016-04-25,21700648,William,"Evy and Khai were great hosts. The room was great. We like to sleep in so we were able to get the room nice and dark in the morning. The neighborhood is quiet, cute, and a $10 cab ride from downtown. On street parking may be resident restricted, but we had no problems walking where we needed to go. They have a beautiful dog named Roscoe who was super friendly."
2021274,74199933,2016-05-14,14553910,Sam,Evy was extraordinarily welcoming and my stay there was great! Everything was clean and orderly. The bed was comfortable and the shower had great water pressure.
2021274,74494238,2016-05-15,38302885,创,"the location is very nice. the place that we live is very quiet and we can sleep very late, comfortable. if you drive and to live here, there have a parking garage 2 min driving and 20 min walking. nice place."
2021274,75207005,2016-05-19,66982427,Brian,"Great stay, accurate description and pic, Evy was a welcoming host and made it easy to settle in, plenty of privacy The space is larger than I expected and very comfy (especially the bed). Wifi clocked at 5-6 Mbps all three nights that I stayed, which is plenty fast for Netflix streaming. The neighborhood is quiet, safe, and very walkable. If I return to Boston, will stay here. Highly recommended."
2021274,76684281,2016-05-28,68721816,Marnie,Very nice accommodations. Comfortable sleeping arrangements. Very friendly hosts. This made a great home base for our sight seeing tour of Boston.  Loved Rosco!!!!!!
2021274,78895696,2016-06-10,7991364,Debbie,Evy was a great host and did her best to ensure our comfort the entire stay.
2021274,80257060,2016-06-17,4868215,Jessica,"As usual in my work life, I was very last minute in booking my stay. I'd never been to South Boston and was surprised to find what I think may be the most beautiful part of the whole city. Evy was incredibly accommodating, the space was gorgeous and huge, and check in and out was super easy. I'd stay for a vacation!"
2021274,80550965,2016-06-18,60379217,Emmanuel,"Staying here was a breeze. I had no problem checking in and was greeted by Rosco the dog, who was very friendly and playful. I didn't really know what the setup was going to be like, but upon arriving, I was pleasantly surprised to find that our living space was a huge living room space downstairs with a bedroom and personal bathroom."
It was obvious that our hosts Evy and Khai put a lot of thought into making guests feel at home from a welcome packet with helpful info to the mini toiletries in the bathroom if you need them.,,,,,
The neighborhood was quiet and beautiful,"a couple blocks from a small beach. I had no trouble taking the bus here from South Station and taking Uber/Lyft to downtown was no problem at all. Great experience staying here and would recommend to anyone!\"",,,,
2021274,81296949,2016-06-22,24752269,Momme S.,Khai awaited us on arrival and helped us to feel at home. Evy and Khai have also excellent welcome notes with key information. On top he showed us the station for the city bicycles and the way to downtown Boston!
2021274,81666638,2016-06-24,47185269,Eric,Evy was tremendously welcome for us to arrive despite a short notice. The space was clean and made up for our arrival. No problems of any kind.
2021274,83137698,2016-07-01,63293418,雅茹,"我一直住在西海岸,所以不知道东海岸basement会比较潮湿。另外就是夜间空调的主机在basement会很响,所以其中有一张床需要挪位置。除此之外,在这里住的不错,谢谢evy!"
2021274,85544476,2016-07-12,28215151,Oliver,"Evy was very welcoming and accommodating from the start - we had a wedding to get to the day we came in to Boston, and she left us a key so we could get in before she got home from work. She checked in periodically (via text) to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. We did not actually meet Evy in person, even though this is a shared space, but everything was set up and waiting for us when we arrived."
The living quarters are in the basement of Evy's beautiful South Boston apartment. It's a very nice renovated basement with a large living room,separate bathroom,and bedroom with an extremely comfortable full-size bed (with a memory foam mattress). There's ample closet space,a nice shower,and Evy had left lots of travel-size toiletries for us.,
The location of this apartment was perfect for us - we used Uber to get back and forth to Seaport (about $6),and it was about $14 to get to Logan.,,,,
I highly recommend this apartment. It is a shared space,but it felt like we were staying in our own unit. Evy made us feel very comfortable in her home,but was not at all overbearing. The place was clean and comfortable,and convenient to downtown,Seaport,"and Logan. We will definitely stay with Evy the next time we're in Boston!\""

It is a very spacious floor and you feel like you have total privacy. The neighborhood felt really nice. Some nice diners/bar places around the corner. Evy and her husband were very welcoming and made us really feel at home. Thank you so much!"
2021274,92406518,2016-08-08,25661124,Sam,"Just got home from my one night stay at Evy's place in Boston for a business trip. What a great, easy experience! Evy provided super clear instructions for check in. I got in a little later than initially communicated but this wasn't an issue at all. I parked over in the Seaport area and walked to Evy's place as there is no visitor street parking. Overall my experience was great. I'd definitely recommend this place and would stay here again!"
2021274,93796193,2016-08-14,2326821,Tommy,Evy and Kai were great. Very accommodating in all regards. They were friendly and available to whatever needs I had. It was very much a home and they made me feel a part of that. The place was very clean and very comfortable.

Evy was very responsive to our questions about the room. And to top it off the bed had an incredibly  comfortable blanket. I would definitely stay there again"
2021274,97549607,2016-08-27,46987972,Anders,Evy and Khai were very accommodating. They gave us an opportunity to check in early and we had the entire basement floor to ourselves. It felt as if we had our own hotel suite with additional amenities. I'd highly recommend staying here for any type of trip to Boston.
2021274,98797935,2016-09-01,35701342,Ros,"Evy very helpful and responsive. We arrived at an antisocial hour and there was no problem which was really helpful. Good location, uber v cheap to get to the centre, around $11. Nice beach area 5 mins away."
10228228,93706873,2016-08-13,66011201,Robert,"The Fenway Neighborhood was the best part of our stay by far!  It is wonderful and we really enjoyed our 5 weeks in the neighborhood.   Our biggest disappointment was that the apartment we were promised was changed two days prior to our arrival and the photos of the new apartment sent to us misrepresented the apartment.  The photos showed a bright,  unobstructed view out of the windows and when we arrived there was a high rise fully under construction (at least several months) already several floors above ours (6th) which totally obstructed our view as well as subjecting us to construction noise throughout our stay.  The Host should have disclosed this in their listing.  Although the building is relatively new, it is showing its wear, especially in the hallways and in the apartment."
The apartment had several issues including a dirty living room carpet,"faulty refrigerator and generally average quality amenities.  The host should be cautious about advertising the listing as \"\"Luxury\"\".  The Host and building maintenance was pretty responsive in replacing the carpet and after two tries at fixing the refrigerator",they finally replaced it.,,,
"I would suggest that if the host represents the apartment as \"\"Luxury\"\"",all the amenities should be fully functional and of the highest quality.,,,,
"There are other buildings in the area which are newer and might provide a more \"\"Luxury\"\" feel.  But I highly recommend staying in Fenway if you want a lively feel with everything within a few steps of your front door.\"",,,,,
18711,41856,2010-05-12,104064,Tanya,"Awesome experience.  Great place, close to everything.  Apartment was in excellent condition, and most enjoyable.  Thanks for a lovely time in Boston!"
18711,48734,2010-06-01,89310,Debi,"Great place to stay in Boston - plenty of space and a really nice environment. Lovely restaurant next door. 10 minute walk to the T, and there are shuttles to the airport available for $5 from local hotels. A hairdryer would have been nice."
"Thoroughly recommended\"",,,,,
18711,70408,2010-07-29,91247,Amy,We stayed in the Penthouse in Boston. The house was GREAT and we thoroughly enjoyed our week's stay. Check-in/out was very simple and convenient for when we got in to town and decided to leave.
The location itself is about a half mile walk from the nearest T station so if you don't mind walking,it wasn't a big deal for us.,,,,
Probably the only thing we would have liked to see was actually a sheet set available for the pull out couch or air mattress used during our stay. There was a thin comforter for the couch and a couple random blankets we used and made due with,but if we had any more people there or were really picky it would have been nice to be furnished with a real set.,,,,
Lance was great in responding to us as we had a couple questions while we were there and he was able to help us out.,,,,,
"Would definitely recommend a stay here!\"",,,,,
18711,118858,2010-10-14,201485,Bonnie,"Check in and check out was very easy.  We stayed in The Penthouse, and it was very enjoyable.  There is a balcony that gives a really night view of the city of Boston, and the apartment is very clean and comfortable for a family.  My son from England joined me here, as well as my daughter from California.  We all enjoyed it.  The neighborhood is being renovated, and public transportation, either bus or subway, are both near. We would stay here again, if in Boston.  The only drawback is that you have to walk up four flights to get to The Penthouse, which was no problem for my son or daughter but for a 67 year old with arthritis of the knees proved to be a task."
18711,297982,2011-06-05,347925,Roderick,"Wow what a great place to stay, very convenient to public transport. Beautiful apartment, well appointed with everything we needed including a good restaurant next door. We found Lance to be a warm and receptive host. Highly recommended."
18711,328453,2011-06-22,594225,Kristjan,"The Dorset was great! We were four that stayed in the apartment - two couples and we had a great time. The location was very good and we had everything we needed in the apartment. I recommend the Dorset - especially if you plan on having a rental car, then you can´t go wrong with the Dorset."
Lance was very helpful and a great host!,,,,,
"We look forward to coming back :-)\"",,,,,
18711,476043,2011-08-26,735995,Trish,"Just spent a wonderful week in Lance's property with my family. You couldn't ask for a nicer host. Prior to our arrival, he responded quickly to all my emails and immediately addressed any questions I had. The apartment was tasteful, clean, and located well for ease of movement around the city.  It was a positive experience on every level."
18711,658961,2011-10-24,1217929,Chris,Had a great weekend in Boston. The accommodations were spectacular. The host was very responsive and had very simple check in/out procedures. Hope to come back next year!
18711,1596370,2012-06-30,2646238,Jonathan,Great location about 10 minutes outside of downtown Boston.  We rented a car and drove into the city but I think there is public transportation close by.  Parking our car was never an issue...  We always found a good spot close to the location.
The accomodations were very nice...  everything was extremely clean and the location is safe.  There are two great breakfast joints close by,Mckenna's Cafe (a short drive away),and the SugarBowl (a short walk away),along with a Dunkin Donuts close by.  For dinner there is a pretty good restaurant right next door.  For fitness enthusiasts there is a Crossfit down the street,I think it's called Crossfit Southie but I didn't have a chance to visit it.  Next time!,
All in all for the price,location,size,and everything else I highly recommend this place as a great place to stay.,,
Next time I go to Boston,"this is my place.  \"",,,,
18711,1688318,2012-07-12,1595147,Odile,It was a perfect apartment to explore Boston and Cambridge.
There was A Subway station on walking distance.  The neigbour was a very nice restaurant.,,,,,

18711,2652123,2012-10-18,1368103,Ann,Stayed In a party of three...The Dorset is the lower apartment.
All four floors are leased to other travellers although there is little interaction.,,,,,
It is a very well presented and clean apartment with a new kitchen and good (URL HIDDEN) bathroom for six or seven could be an issue ...,,,,,
The area is on the edge of gentrification,there is a fabulous contemporary italianish restaurant next door,and the 8 minute walk to the red line metro gives access to all of boston.,,,
My usual..over ten... airbnb bookings include human contact so this one came as a surprise......there was no handing over keys or making sure you are ok,giving local advice,or asking if you need anything...none of (URL HIDDEN) all  very much a business...you are emailed the rules including that you must read the other rules once you are in the apartment.. If you don't leave the building by 11am and text re your departure,you will be charged a days rent. Theres no conversation,and seemingly no  compromise,and only minimal text messages...from two different people
The photographs show a dining room on the official dorset site....there is no dining room,it is now the third bedroom.... 6 people can not eat at the tiny glass kitchen table in this apartment. It's on the knees in the small lounge room ...with seating for 4.,,,,
"the fold out futon in the \"\"office\"\" is in a very small storage area",with no working lights and what appears to be left over household goods accumulated at one end.,,,,
We loved Boston,and the apartment is reasonably priced,and very good for two couples... but it's not an airbnb experience....,,,

We really enjoyed our stay, it feels like home away from home. The app/directions are very easy to follow and when we found something missing in the house \"\"air dryer\"\" it was brought to us the next morning. Overall I would give a 5 star because of the great app they have and really enjoyed our stay. \""

All kind of services nearby.  Customer service was the best!!!!  Lack of tv's in bedrooms and the one is there, is in a room that is very uncomfortable to watch.  Train station is also very close and transportation was not a problem at all.  My only complain is the access to A/C - Heat.  Is locked in a box and no way to control the climate inside the apartment.  In an overall, great value for the price.  Would I recommend it????  mmmmmmmm"

Nike was always quick to respond if we needed anything or had any questions. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in Boston!
2360109,11400528,2014-04-01,8297219,Chris,"My girlfriend and I stayed in Kelly's studio for the month of March and could not be happier about it.  Kelly's cozy studio is perfectly situated on Park Drive, directly across from the Museum of Fine Arts and only a couple of blocks away from Fenway Park.  All of the great shopping on Newbury is only a few blocks down the street near the Prudential Center which we routinely passed on our 30 minute daily walk to the South End."
Kelly and her husband Emanuel are amazing,friendly and welcoming hosts who were more than accommodating during our stay.  We are very happy to have met them and look forward to staying (hopefully later in this summer) in there Venice Beach listing!,,,,

2360109,11552217,2014-04-07,5628203,Chris,Three of us had a great time staying at Kelly's studio for a couple nights. The studio is cozy but is ideally situated near Fenway Park. We visited during home opening weekend and the area was really lively. Everything we needed was available in the apartment. We didn't end up using the kitchen to cook but things looked available for it.
"Kelly is very friendly and welcoming. We couldn't quite sync up our timing for check-in but Kelly was flexible and communicative. We had an awesome time in Boston!\"",,,,,
2360109,11765735,2014-04-14,13604347,Stephanie,Kelly was an excellent hostess! The studio is in a lovely location and it's a quick walk to Fenway and the T. She was easy to coordinate arrival/departure with and checked in a few times over the course of our stay to make sure everything was going well. The space is delightfully comfortable and the shower has GREAT water pressure. I would definitely stay again!
2360109,12149675,2014-04-24,4956777,Jimmy,"We had a great stay at this place in Boston. It has everything you need, and the bonuses are a super comfortable bed and giant TV! Kelly was great, very responsive and friendly. The location along the muddy river makes it very peaceful and quiet, yet still not far from everything."

2360109,12465493,2014-05-03,12625103,Montse,Kelly was wonderful working around our schedule for check-in and check out. She was a great host offering additional clean linens that we did not need.
Location is amazing if you plan to catch a game at Fenway,as we did. We were traveling with a 6 month-old and the space fit our needs. Building is quiet and people courteous.,,,,

The apartment - though small - fit our needs well and was a perfect place to crash for the price in the area. The building was very quiet and there was no street noise. The park across the street was lovely, the 7-Eleven around the corner was very convenient for a quick stop and the short walk to Fenway made our game nights very enjoyable. There were also a lot of good restaurant options that were in easy walking distance. We would definitely stay here again."
2360109,13427358,2014-05-27,11153367,Amy,Kelly provided good instructions on where to find keys and how to get to her place. She provided water for us and fresh linens. The wifi wasn't connecting for any of us but she tried her best to help out. She even called the company to see if it was working. The place is pretty small but cozy and the location is in a very nice and safe place.

2360109,14493204,2014-06-20,16097225,Justin,Kelly was terrific and very communicative during the entire process.  Another reservation I made fell through at the 11th hour and Kelly was able to get me situated very last minute which goes a long way anytime someone hosts you.  The place is small and a little bit older but a great location and was just what I needed for a single traveler in on business.  You'll be hard pressed to find someone more easy going and as nice.  Kelly is great!

We didn't get to meet Kelly unfortunately, but she was very nice and easy to communicate with and we had no problems checking in or out.  Although a bit small, it was the right price in the right location.  The park across the street was fantastic.  We also went to a Red Sox game and were happy we only had to walk less than 10 minutes to get back home.  The wifi worked great (and so did the cable TV)!  And thank goodness for the air conditioning in the middle of July. Would definitely stay here again."

Kelly was a wonderful host; she helped us get expeditiously from the airport to her apartment and recommended great places to eat right around the corner.

2360109,20882809,2014-10-06,2819993,Christof,"Kelly was very friendly, helpful and concerned; in touch by Email and text only. The small apartment is nice. There is basically one room with queensize bed and in case of urgent need of a second bed there is an old but comfortable matress in the same sleeping room. It is homely and equiped with a big TV. Bathroom is small and cozy. Kitchen is also very small and a little bit everything everywhere - but well equiped. I would recommend for one person only. Price for this tiny studio is too high. Take care of parking situation. There are additional costs for parking - the district is residents only parking zone. But there is a parking garage very close and you can deal a good price with them."

I used to live in Boston, so I'm used to small studios, they can be hot or cold no matter what you do. The location is super, especially if you plan to go to the MFA. I think Kelly's studio is best for one person or a couple, sharing bed, max. Cute place, and there is a great Thai restaurant around the corner. Kelly is super responsive to all my texts. Thanks!"

So many of positive listing points and just not valid:,,,,,
*Lift – there is one but it doesn’t work we were only told a couple of days before arrival so too late to make alternative plans despite it being broken for weeks. The room is on the 5th floor so stairs are a nightmare,especially with luggage and in the heat.,,,,
*4 windows – yes there are 4 but they are all covered up with quilting and tatty cloths that have been stapled to the wall so you cannot see out. The bathroom window has a towel stapled over it.,,,,,
*Claw foot bath exists but has been painted and all the paint is peeling off – you could not sit in it.,,,,,
*Air conditioning – was needed and was working but so,so noisy you can’t sleep or watch TV. Also you can’t use any other electrics – like hairdryer - at the same time as blows the fuse.,,,,
Location next to park is nice for the day but we were warned by the university that the park is unsafe at night and for 2 of the 4 nights I stayed there were police and ambulances out front.,,,,,
Kelly was responsive and easy to communicate with for check in but unfortunately a key was lost so we had to find the lock box in an alley behind the apartment block at night in the dark and we were very uncomfortable with this.,,,,,
Left a day early and would not recommend!,,,,,

2360109,52025108,2015-10-25,47173558,Kiranjit,"Kelly is very nice and accommodating. She made sure we were settled in and offered great suggestions for dinner and drinks. She checked in with us multiple times to make sure our trip was going well, which was appreciated!"
In terms of the apartment,the space was smaller than we expected but it didn't cause any issues because we just needed it as a place to sleep. You can definitely walk to the main parts of the city; we generally used uber pool which was around $7ish.,,,,

2360109,68456631,2016-04-05,7476613,Flavia,"The flat is very conveniently located in a nice area and beautiful building, just in front of Fenway park and the Museum of Fine Arts. Despite the lively area, the flat is very quiet. The beds are very comfortable, there is a powerful wifi, a big TV and everything we needed for our week stay. There are two queen size beds and it is not easy to find in a small size flat. Walking distance to the city centre but also well connected by bus. Kelly was very accommodating and helpful, especially about check-in and check-out time. We just thought it was a bit overpriced but it is probably right according to Boston standards. Overall a good experience, recommended."
2360109,70728505,2016-04-20,17439524,Ariel,"Kelly is a caring host.  Though we did not meet in person, she was in constant contact with us throughout the process.  She readily answered questions that we had about her apartment and the neighbourhood.  She gave helpful tips and checked on us via SMS during our stay."
Kelly's apartment is small,quaint,and cozy.  It is ideal for one or two people.  As far as we could tell,everything in her apartment worked especially the basics:  WiFi,cable television,heater
It is a quiet building in a quiet neighbourhood.  The Clemente Field,which is a large park with a track oval,basketball court,softball diamonds,etc. is across the street.  It was a perfect site for our final taper runs leading up to the Boston Marathon.,
I can think of only one downside of the location:  it requires a bit of walking to get to the nearest bus and train stops.  Perhaps it was just our unfamiliarity with the public transport system though.,,,,,
Overall,we had a very good experience staying at Kelly's apartment.  If we would return for another Boston Marathon,"we would probably stay at her place again.\"",,,

4567815,25093858,2015-01-06,23119,Patti,"We stayed at this apartment with our one year old son. This was the perfect apartment for our holiday stay in Boston. The apartment is beautiful, cozy, clean. You get a lot of natural light and the view from the third floor is lovely. It's located on a quiet street and really close to public transport."
Eliza is really easy to communicate with. She was very friendly and responsive to all our inquiries. We appreciated the thorough instructions and information. She even provided some items for baby-proofing,which was really considerate. Highly recommend this apartment.,,,,
Oh and should you decide to cook,"the kitchen is fully equipped. Otherwise there are eclectic restaurants right down the street.\"",,,,
4567815,37994284,2015-07-12,15859025,Sharlene,Our stay at Eliza and Tom's home this past weekend was convenient and enjoyable thanks to their wonderful hospitality. They were able to accommodate our late arrival and left a note with helpful tips and local events that weekend. Their home looks exactly as the pictures show and they were kind enough to let us use anything in their home from food to board games! The T is just a short walk away and there are restaurants about a block away as well. We would definitely recommend their home for anyone looking for a comfortable and homey stay in Boston.
4567815,40808629,2015-08-02,31799835,John,"We really enjoyed our stay at Eliza's home.  The apartment was clean, and looked just as in the photos posted on the Airbnb site.  She left detailed notes to help us get situated, and also gave great tips for us to navigate the neighborhood.  Parking was easy, and getting to the T was a very reasonable 10 minute walk.  We would be happy to stay there again!"
4567815,43915476,2015-08-23,15810802,Lorenzo,"Casa carina, con tutto il necessario! Non troppo chiara la questione dell'arrivo e delle chiavi! Soggiorno confortevole!"
4567815,44538378,2015-08-27,35041014,Eduardo,"Eliza provided outstanding and timely communication. The welcome letter and treats were special and greatly appreciated. Their home was very clean and convenient for travel to everywhere we needed to go. The immediate area is quiet, but also has vibrant neighborhood businesses with lots to discover in easy walking distance. We were fortunate to be their guests and look forward to future opportunities."
4567815,57815534,2015-12-29,712733,Paige,"Eliza and Tom's home is BEAUTIFUL, comfortable, spacious, and in a quiet + convenient location. They clearly love their home and it has lots of character and charm. The apartment itself is very JP, a nice trip down memory lane for me (though so much cleaner and more stylishly decorated than the JP triple decker co-op I lived in years ago)."
Although Eliza and Tom were out of town during our visit,they communicated proactively + clearly,responded promptly to my messages,"and were flexible. We did meet their friendly downstairs neighbor and terrier. I highly recommend them as hosts and (if our trips align again) would be delighted to stay at their home in the future.\"",,
4567815,61507564,2016-02-05,590583,Jeffrey,"I had a wonderful, albeit brief stay at Eliza's beautiful apartment. There were really no surprises----actually the lovely treats on the dining room table were a great surprise. The apartment is quiet, gets a lot of light and was really comfortable."
Communicating with Eliza before and during my stay was great. Eliza is extremely attentive and I was really happy with my short stay at the Treetop.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
4567815,62570433,2016-02-15,24420021,Liat,Eliza and Tom's home was the perfect spot for me and my friends this past weekend! They provided everything from a full kitchen with all the necessary gadgets (as well as coffee grinds and a French Press for a morning wake-up) to yoga mats and an exercise ball for a little yoga to keep us in a zen space during some record low temperatures! The beds were comfortable and the apartment was cozy and perfectly located. Jamaica Plain is an awesome neighborhood. Really great spot!
4567815,77225406,2016-05-30,40291007,Marine,"The appartment is nice and looks exactly like in the pictures,  we really enjoyed staying there for the weekend. The area is really nice, with lot of trees and nature around. The train is only 5 minutes walk from the appartment and you get in downtown in 20 minutes. We enjoyed the coffee and chocolate that Eliza's left for us, I definitely recommand Eliza's place!"
4567815,80991530,2016-06-20,15479951,Alisa,"We had a great time at Eliza's place. The appartment is exactly as pictures show, sunny and bright, very clean. It was the four of us, maximum capacity, a little crowded but most importantly enough hot water for a warm shower for everyone. The appartment is on the third floor without elevator so make sure you pack light or can carry your luggage up the stairs. The place is beautifully decorated, and the hosts went out of their way to make us feel welcome including fancy coffee for the french press and self brewed beer. Communication went well, Eliza was very quick to answer any questions through texts. The appartment can get warm if you're lucky enough to have beautiful weather but there are plenty of ventilators in the appartment. Location is very nice, enough restaurants and bars in walking distance and about 40 minites downtown with the orange line. There is no TV so if you're a screen addict, make sure to Bring Your Own Device, wifi is great. Next time in Boston will definitely check if available"
1885386,10970210,2014-03-15,12934207,Averil,"The Elephant room in The Roost is large, comfortable and quiet, which I appreciated. It has its own bath down the hall, a nice convenience. Robin was a friendly, warm, helpful host and quickly available when I wanted some help or more information. I was offered the use of a large kitchen, an unexpected bonus, and the offer of freshly brewed coffee in the morning. Although on a main Street, the house is set back from the road, and this makes it quieter, adding protection from traffic noise."
1885386,11096659,2014-03-20,11542092,Stephanie And Paul,"We had a great experience staying at Robins BnB. The house was very cool with interesting art everywhere. A very unique place. Both the bedroom and bathroom were clean and comfortable. Robin had fresh coffee made for us daily. We walked to JP in minutes where there are restaurants, shops, and nearby bus stops. Robin was very communicative and made sure we had everything we needed. My husband and I would highly recommend staying at Robin's Roost!"
1885386,11210454,2014-03-24,13379306,Lisa,"I had a wonderfully restful stay in this surprisingly quiet urban location. The room is beautiful, the bed super-comfortable, and the house is full of interesting art & antiques. Thank you, Robin, for all your hospitality!"
1885386,11491717,2014-04-05,13030658,Mishelle,"We stayed in the Elephant room for one week and had a wonderful experience. The house is so unique with all the original artwork, and has such a warm, cozy feel. This is an older house with a lot of character, and Robin's kitchen is amazing! The house sits back a ways from the main street, so it was quiet and convenient. It is easy to walk around the neighborhood for a bite to eat or shopping, and felt very safe. Robin is delightful, and we had everything we needed."
1885386,11665008,2014-04-11,13022925,Theresa,"Robin was an incredibly gracious host, and the Elephant room and the house overall were comfortable, clean, and beautifully appointed with interesting art and furniture. The bed was great, plenty of room for my clothes, spacious full bath, and books and magazines and info on the neighborhood and city were available for guests too. I stayed when it was still cold at night - the heat was fine, and an electric blanket and slippers in a basket at the front door made my stay even cozier. There is a large modern kitchen for guests as well. Robin has a wealth of knowledge about the area. She also has a sense of humor, and was available and accommodating with any requests and questions I had. I love this neighborhood, and it's easy to walk to cafes, shops, and green areas to exercise (pond, arboretum); easy to get downtown too. Highly recommended!"
1885386,11761329,2014-04-14,6361687,Maja,Really nice room in a very special house. The neighbourhood is very cute and has nice cafes just five minutes away. Robin was a great host and we would definitely come back next time we are in Boston! Highly recommended!
1885386,12145394,2014-04-24,8618705,Tony,"We had a great experience.  Room and facilities were really clean and well decorated.  Stayed for the Boston Marathon and Jamaica Plain was a great location since it was close to the T and offered plenty of dining options, yet close to Boston proper.  Robin was great."
1885386,12229731,2014-04-26,762553,Joe & Jill,"Robin is a wonderful host and great person to meet. She went out of her way to see that we were all set and had access to the continental breakfast she prepared. The bed was comfy, the artwork and antiques make for a fun and quirky environment, and of course the location is excellent. We would highly recommend staying with her."
1885386,12308441,2014-04-28,6051071,Iris,"My stay with Robin and Dennis was great. They both are such nice and warm people. They have the rare combination of going out of their way to make you comfortable and at the same time leave you to your own thing and privacy. I felt very free and at home. Robin is very flexible, just talk to her and she will stretch the possibilities for you. She has good coffee, a lot of tea-flavours and a fridge with food, yoghurt etc, which is all just there if you want it."
The house itself is gorgeous,shiny wooden floors,cool art-stuff everywhere and squirrels outside your window. I was really happy I picked this area too,"Jamaica Plain is such a nice area and everything is just right around the corner of Robin's house. All in all: a delightful experience. \"",,
1885386,12416644,2014-05-01,14381537,Thos,The accommodation is in pleasant suburb of Boston with good transport to the centre. Parking in the driveway means none of the problems of parking and driving in central Boston.
It is only about 300 yards to the 39 bus that runs frequently to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and Copley Square. The entrance to the Arnold Arboretum is about the same distance in the other direction. There are many cafes and restaurants close by in Centre Street and South Street.,,,,,
The room is spacious with high ceilings and wood floors as is the rest of the house.,,,,,
"We had an initial problem getting in as Robin had forgotten we were arriving and was at a previous engagement. She was very apologetic and assured us that it had never happened before. She was very helpful showing us the facilities including a large well equipped kitchen with a fridge where we could store our own food as well as items she had provided for the guests use. She had to leave for an out of town appointment so we did not see her for the rest of our three night stay.\"",,,,,
1885386,12750398,2014-05-10,13859660,Susan,The room is lovely and Robin is a gracious host.  The attention to detail makes a big difference -- much of which you may not notice unless they are missing (as has been the case at other places I have stayed).  Definitely hope to be back soon!
1885386,12907163,2014-05-13,15058488,Julie,The neighborhood was artsy and fun.  There was a lot to explore within walking distance.  Robin was a gracious host.  The comfort and amenities exceeded our expectations.  The room was exactly as it appeared in the picture.
1885386,13178743,2014-05-21,12873205,Kelly,"We had a wonderful stay! Robin was accommodating, the room was pretty, clean, and comfortable. The location was pretty, safe, relaxing, and close to public transit. I would stay here again for sure."

Robin's house is beautifully and artistically decorated, is roomy, comfortable and we liked the village atmosphere of J.P. Robin provided the best of everything we needed and more for a great breakfast and we felt very comfortable (great ameneties). We highly recommend Robin's place and can't imagine anyone not enjoying their stay. Thanks so much Robin!!!"
1885386,14026160,2014-06-10,14503526,Gregory And Lauren,"The room was well furnished. However, the floors were varnished (or otherwise treated) about a year ago, and are still offgassing. Robin was also keeping art supplies including paints and aersols in the living area on the first floor."
"Due to our chemical sensitivities we were unable to spend more than 10 minutes in the house and had to cancel our stay here.\"",,,,,
1885386,14613908,2014-06-23,823710,Ana Maria,Comfortable and easy stay. We were in town for a wedding being held down the street so the location was perfect. Not just for the wedding but for exploring all of Boston via the nearby t orange line and the 39 bus. JP is a very nice neighborhood to enjoy and take refuge in after a busy day sight seeing in the city.
Robin was great,"never actually met met she was very communicative and set up the room with everything we could need. Would definitely stay there again.\"",,,,
1885386,14811604,2014-06-27,12074290,Marleen,"Nous avons beaucoup aimé l'ambiance de cette belle maison dans un quartier tranquille, mais tout près de restaurants et magasins, et à 10 minutes à pied d'une ligne de métro directe pour le centre de Boston. La chambre était joliment agencée, et nous pouvions librement disposer de la cuisine (énorme !) où il y avait - en plus du petit déjeuner inclus dans le prix - des boissons et des fruits à volonté, ainsi que de bons petits gâteaux préparés par la fille de la propriétaire... Cette dernière est très accueillante et sympathique, et fait tout ce qu'elle peut pour vous rendre service. Si jamais nous retournons à Boston, c'est sûr que nous irons chez Robin !"
1885386,15035797,2014-07-01,9339539,Marylène,"We had a very nice and well decorated room with our private bathroom, in a nice and safe neighborhood. You can reach the subway by walking 10 minutes to the 1st station and be downtown in half an hour. Also, Robin is very welcoming she provides everything you need (maps, breakfast, towels...) This is definitely the best airbnb place I have been hosted!!!"
1885386,15309378,2014-07-07,13972276,Mariusz,"Great place, great location, away from city core but close to T and Sam Adams Brewery. Easy ride to core on the T. Host was able to respond to broken shower hose immediately even though she was away from the house."
1885386,15583862,2014-07-12,16334266,Christina,"I loved my stay at the Roost!  Although I was very busy during my visit, I did get to enjoy some conversations with Robin and she made me feel welcome and comfortable throughout the stay.  Everything I could possibly need during my stay was available and it was a quick and charming walk to the nearest T station.  Located in a very safe neighborhood with lots of options within walking distance."
1885386,15759447,2014-07-15,15538638,Bill,"My three most important items I judge an accommodation by (bed, water pressure, size of towels) were past expectations. The Roost house was decorated in a way I was always seeing new interesting art and decorations. The kitchen had every amenity I could ever need and the frig was well stocked. Robin the host was way way past charming and a superb host. She supplied me with great information and tips on getting around the area. The house is 2 blocks from the 39 Bus lines that can take you all the way to Boylston St or the Orange line and once on the Orange Line you can get anywhere.  Get the $19 seven day pass and you are set.  I have already recommended to a friend who is going to Boston in August to stay at The Roost. If I ever have the chance I will not hesitate to visit Robin at the Roost again."
1885386,15970521,2014-07-19,11117973,Jack,"Fantastic hosts - made us very welcome and I would absolutely recommend staying here to anyone visiting Boston, particularly if you'll have a bit of time to enjoy the beautiful house and this wonderful neighbourhood as well as the city centre itself."
Jamaica Plain is a very nice area to spend a few days,parks are close and riding the T into Boston doesn't take long.,,,,

1885386,18650219,2014-08-30,15955761,Annette,"I stayed in the elephant room for a week while taking an intensive course at the Eliot School, just two blocks away.   The house is in a wonderful neighborhood within walking distance of great restaurants along Centre Street. Robin and Victoria are wonderful hosts.  Victoria baked pumpkin spice muffins one morning and since I need to avoid gluten I was so sorry to tell her I couldn’t eat one.  When I came home the next evening, she had made gluten free brownie cake!  The elephant room was very comfortable.  The kitchen is enormous and well equipped for breakfast and packing a lunch."

The only worry was when we couldn't get in touch with Robin via email for a couple a days before the arrival. Though when we left a voicemail last day, she called us back quickly. We did't get to meet Robin, but her daughter Victoria was very sweet and friendly. Overall, we would definetely recommend and come back again."

The house is just beautiful and all the furnishings, linens and towels are of great quality and really comfortable. The communion kitchen is extremely clean, beautiful and of a high standard.

1885386,20499634,2014-09-30,19372788,Simon,Robin has a wonderful house at a good location in Boston. It's nice and quiet and a good refuge from the hustle and bustle of the city centre. The house unfortunately isn't that good accessible by public transport although bus 39 takes you to the city centre quite easily.

Great kitchen with yummy breakfast supplies. JP itself has a few really good restaurants and quirky shops which are worth  checking out: The coffee at 7 Pond Street was excellent, Tres Gatos tapas restaurant is off the hook!  Salmagundi hat shop is very cool and has great clothing. Would definitely recommend staying here. Victoria and Robin were very friendly."

La experiencia fue maravillosa. Una casa victoriana antigua,muy confortable,bonita y cómoda. Todo estaba muy limpio y ordenado. La anfitriona atenta,rápida y amable. El vecindario está algo alejado del Downtown,pero con el metro  no hay problemas de comunicación. Además el vecindario es precioso y merece a pena disfrutarlo. Muchos comercios pequeños,"restaurantes y actividad. Si vuelvo a Boston trataré de regresar al mismo lugar.\""

1885386,22434177,2014-11-06,22349065,Lisa,"Robin made us feel very welcome, the place was exactly as described and our accommodations felt very private.  It was great to have access to the kitchen, and Robin provided coffees, teas and breakfast.  The neighborhood was beautiful and safe, it was close to a very nice park and close to downtown.  We would definitely stay here again, no question."
1885386,22898320,2014-11-17,22491571,Julia,My sister and I had such a pleasant experience at the Roost. The room was exactly as pictured- with the added bonus of an electric blanket! We especially appreciated the muffins in the morning and access to the Keurig. The surrounding neighborhood was lovely and easy to navigate. We are planning on recommending the Roost to all of our friends planning trip to Boston.
1885386,23073974,2014-11-22,13557226,Stefanie,"Victoria was a lovely, considerate host and the house and room were amazing!  The room is spacious and comfortable.  Coffee, breakfast, and fruit were available in the kitchen.  I enjoyed staying in Jamaica Plain:  nice neighborhood with great restaurants within walking distance and the T was also only about a ten-minute walk.  Definitely recommend and I look forward to my next visit in December."

The accommodation was very comfortable,clean and well equipped,and we especially loved the decor from resident artist (and host) Victoria.,,,
The rooms were as shown in the photos and the location was ideal for getting around. Jamaica Plain is an ideal spot to spend a few days,with some fantastic restaurants and shopping. We felt very welcomed,"and loved our stay.\"",,,
1885386,24242008,2014-12-23,9357440,Cristyne,Looking for a place to stay in Boston? Stop looking. You've found one.
My partner and I stayed 5 days,4 nights with Robin and Victoria and had a lovely time in their stunning house. And by stunning,I do mean stunning. You can easily glean that these women both care for their home,and have creative minds! Beautiful artwork was displayed both in our room and throughout the house,including the creative and colourful light switch and outlet panels. This home was a peaceful respite at the end of a day of sightseeing. The house was completely silent both during the day and at night,and other guests in the home were not seen. Victoria and Robin provided bagels
As for the neighbourhood,it is quite cute,and there are a few bars and restaurants located near by on Centre street. The City Feed makes a mean bagel and cup of coffee,and serves some other sandwiches for lunch and breakfast. The house itself is a 10-12 minute walk across Green and down Centre. Given that you walk down a main road,we felt safe walking back from the train even at night after dinner or drinks. The train is about 25 minutes into downtown crossing (no need to transfer trains) and 45 minutes to Harvard Yard. We grabbed a $19 7 day pass,and easily hopped on and off the T train during our time in Boston.
While I never met Victoria while in the house,my partner chatted with her over breakfast one morning and found her quite pleasant and helpful. Overall,a great experience,"and we will be back when we visit Boston again. Thank you Victoria and Robin!\"",,

My husband and I stayed for three nights and were totally happy with the room, comfy bed, clean and stocked restrooms, free parking and even breakfast included. The hosts have truly opened up their home to the guests. Please be advised that there are about 12 or so steps to the 2nd floor rooms if you have to carry a large suitcase like we did but it wasn't a problem for us. Very happy with the stay.

The room was large and beautifully decorated, and the bed was so comfortable. The bathroom was clean, well appointed, and convenient. The kitchen was always well stocked; the breakfast and coffee provided was like a luxury for us! The location is quite convenient. We were able to explore Jamaica Plain, which is an amazing neighborhood. It was also a short walk to the T. We loved being so close to the city, yet far enough from downtown that it felt like our little haven when we needed to escape Marathon madness!"

We had full access to the kitchen where we made tea in the morning; there were coffee choices available as well."
We loved the location! It was about a 10-15 minute walk from the Green stop off the Orange Line on the T. It's a nice walk through the neighborhood and town. We enjoyed the coffee and breakfast at the  City Feed and Supply on Centre Street which you pass by on your way to the house. Blanchards wine and spirits has a great selection of wine,as well as beer and other liquors. It's also on Centre Street. It was nice to enjoy the city,but then come back to a quiet little neighborhood at the end of the day.,,,

The house was quiet. Maybe a little too quiet as we barely saw anyone. Not the place to stay if you are looking for a lot of host interaction.  (Which we kept too busy for anyway,so it was no problem.)  We did meet Victoria shortly after we checked in,so I know they exist. ;),,,

Our particular room did have a private bath, but it was down the hall. If you prefer an en suite, you should consider one of the other rooms available at this location. There were quite a few steps involved and not recommended for anyone who may have issues with steps. The location was very quiet and we felt completely safe in this neighborhood. Our Internet connection was excellent most of the time. Yogurt, English muffins, cereal and coffee were available daily. There were many places nearby to eat and a bus stop only a couple blocks away. We also greatly appreciated having a parking spot during our stay - a valuable asset in Boston!"
1885386,85567895,2016-07-12,73169808,Maureen,"Our stay in Boston was wonderful. Our room was very nice. There were breakfast items available daily. Robin came by right after we arrived and gave us the some tips about the neighborhood. She even gave us a ride into Fenway Park, pointing out things of interest along the way! The neighborhood was safe which was great, since we were out riding the train late in the evening. We would highly recommend this place."
1885386,86304393,2016-07-15,5230134,Jhon,The stay was really enjoyable. Robin and Victoria gave great advice on things to do and places to eat. The house is really cool and full of character. You feel like you're a Bostonian staying here!
1885386,89745790,2016-07-29,7999785,Carrie,"I stayed in the Elephant room for four nights while attending an event at Northeastern University. I left my car in the spacious driveway and took the bus to and from campus each day. It was fun feeling like I lived there! I slept wonderfully and woke up refreshed each day. The house is immaculately clean and very well decorated - every time I looked around I saw some new art or knickknack that cute or charming. There were even bunnies in the private backyard. I highly recommend this place, especially to fellow Northeastern students, alumni and their families!"
1885386,90684549,2016-08-01,56636944,Katherine,Seriously loved staying at this Airbnb. More than accommodating and the home is beautiful. Great location.

1885386,93075926,2016-08-11,185219,Holly,Robin and Victoria answered my inquiries quickly. Our arrival was complicated because we were arriving in Boston South Station via Amtrak so we were unsure of the exact time we would arrive at the house. They were very flexible and greeted us warmly when we did arrive.  The room was very comfortable and we were made to feel at home. The location is ideal because JP is an interesting suburb of Boston with its own character and charm. Lots of good place to eat and a couple of yummy ice cream stores. It was easy to get into Boston on the bus and intercept with the major transit system going to/from Boston. Their house is full of interesting artwork and truly a treasure. We would stay there again if our travels take us to Boston.
1885386,94760279,2016-08-16,13252201,Valerie,"The elephant room is decorated beautifully and we both slept really well. Victoria was very welcoming & assisted us well. It's a great neighbourhood, even found a yoga studio (Blissful Monkey) nearby. An added bonus was help yourself breakfast. We have no hesitation recommending this listing to fellow travellers."
1885386,95388273,2016-08-19,89747473,Hannah,This was a lovely place to stay tucked in from Center St. Very close to lots of restaurants. It was a bit far the walk with a suitcase from the train. I loved my room it was quiet and comfortable.
1885386,99741119,2016-09-05,25695932,Jildau,"Really beautiful place and room. So big and also had a private bathroom. I loved the beautiful house and Robin and Victoria really made me feel welcome. The communication was good. When I once had a problem, they were really helpful. The location of the house is in a beautiful area. I would definitely recommend staying here and I would love to come back when I visit Boston again."
6677700,37353217,2015-07-06,15315301,Irene,"Jordi was very welcoming host. We never crossed paths in person, but he was very proactive in communicating with us in a very timely manner. He responded very nicely to all our texts and emails, and was very helpful in providing us with recommendations for activities and restaurants near by. The apartment was very clean, modern and spacious. The best part was the rooftop - very chill place to hang out and the view is awesome. The neighborhood was very pleasant and we could get to different parts of Boston very easily from the apartment."
6677700,40930974,2015-08-03,35383857,Anne,An absolutely perfect place to stay when in boston! The apartment was as promised and then some. Very spacious with a nice kitchen and great bathroom - the best part though was the rooftop. What a view! Nice and quiet neighborhood with both shopping and restaurants near by. Jordi was a very good host. We didn't meet but he made the whole experience very easy and pleasent. Thumbs up all around!
6677700,45154627,2015-08-31,23145253,Henry,"Very Nice modern styled apartment comfortable for 4 guests with thoughtfully placed lighting throughout the halls, common spaces, and bathroom, as well as excellent natural lighting in the bedrooms. Furniture is adequate, if not minimalist, suitable for those not planning to spend much time inside. The place was tidy, but not immaculate, with many of the owner's personal affects present in the bedroom closets and bathroom. Location is excellent, within walking distance to many dining and night life options; also within walking distance to the T. If you have a vehicle, parking might be difficult due to non-resident parking restrictions. An added plus is the apartment's rooftop access with an incredible view of downtown Boston. The only negative was the lack of A/C during the stay as the apartment became very stuffy at times, especially when sleeping. Would rent again or recommend. Overall 4 out of 5 stars."
6677700,49879625,2015-10-07,4228551,David & Anke,We stayed at Jordi's for three days. His apartment is spacious and well equipped. It is close to the green and orange line. So getting around in Boston from there was easy. Communication with Jordi was very good. We'd recommend staying there!
6677700,52083465,2015-10-26,22970750,Yuvraj,Jordi was a great host. Responded to my request immediately. He also responded to any questions or concerns I had in a timely fashion. The place was very nice and spacious as advertised. I would recommend this place to anyone.
6677700,58645259,2016-01-03,51107106,Victoria,"Jordi's apartment was clean, nice, and in a great location. He provided us with everything we needed to know in a timely fashion and our stay went off without a hitch! The nearby area has everything you might need-- walking distance to restaurants, cafes, and a grocery store among other things."
6677700,77221166,2016-05-30,22012501,Émilie,Jordi est très disponible pour répondre à des questions. On sent qu'il aime recevoir chez lui.

6677700,85269137,2016-07-11,71719068,Steven,Jordi gave us very clear & accurate instructions on how to find his place & how to get in.  It made for a very easy check in - check out experience.
"Jordi's listing description was very accurate.  He has a very nice apartment in a great neighborhood.  The South End area of Boston that we visited & walked around in was beautiful.  I would highly recommend visiting this South End area of Boston & staying at Jordi's very quiet & quaint apartment.\"",,,,,

13800505,91710134,2016-08-06,35373085,Can-Onur,The flat is really close to everything because it's located downtown.
We saw Malaury only once for 1 minute when we came and didn't saw her again during the whole weekend. The flat is not that clean,and also there were no curtains on windows so we were awake at 6 by the sun and also the traffic.,,,,
"The price is too expensive even if the flat is pretty well located..\"",,,,,
13800505,93001947,2016-08-11,7451629,Paul,"The location cannot be beat, and when I booked the room at a low rate, I was able to deal with the drawbacks for this reason. Though the room is separated by a curtain from the common area, it still felt private. However, I was woken by light and traffic sound at 6 am. I also had to use the shower before 7 am due to the several housemates. The bedroom area was clean, but overall the apartment is not. The rate has been increased substantially since my stay."
13800505,94907181,2016-08-17,4186094,Sandy,The location was PERFECT!  It was very comfortable. When I arrived I met her friends and they were very nice.  It was wonderful for a quick stay.
"Thank you Mallory!\"",,,,,
13800505,96703319,2016-08-24,89559664,Derek,Great place to stay near down town.  I needed a quiet place to stay for two nights and didn't want to pay the ridiculous hotel prices.   Parking is hard to find in the area but as is with anything down town and it was well worth it to have a place to stay within walking distance of many areas.  I would stay there again if I need a place.
9301075,54796112,2015-11-23,49102043,Willie,"Keith and Beth were very welcoming they went beyond our expectations.  The listing was accurate and actually came with additional items toiletries  in case we had forgotten to pack something. We didn't venture off into the neighborhood because we spent time in Boston, so we can't say much about it."

9301075,59706988,2016-01-14,51657006,Claire,Keith and Beth were wonderful hosts! Their property is a beautiful house on a quiet and very safe feeling street. We visited during a very cold few days (including snow) and the house and room were always warm and welcoming. Keith and Beth made sure we could contact them at any time with any queries we had. I would definitely recommend this property.
9301075,65296577,2016-03-12,10950436,Diana,"This was our second stay in Keith and Beth's lovely home.  As before, everything was immaculate.  We enjoy their quiet location with on street parking, the charm and comfort of their historic home and their attentive hosting.  This was a quick turnaround trip for us, but it met our needs perfectly and our hosts made themselves available for anything we might need.  Highly recommend!"
9301075,65717413,2016-03-16,31459962,Courtney,Keith and Beth were extremely welcoming and generous! I sincerely wish I could've enjoyed their company more! The house was beautifully done - every aspect was done with thought and care. The room was just as described and absolutely beautiful. I feel sorry that I was jet-lagged and couldn't enjoy more of it!

They have a beautiful house and the rooms are very nicely decorated, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was exquisite.  Keith was very helpful in showing me how to get around the area and provided great recommendations for eating. They also went above and beyond when I lost my drivers license and they let me have something mailed to their house. Thank you!!"

I was in late and out early and her apartment was exactly what I needed and near to many spots of Boston with very close by public transportation as well.  Her apartment is VERY clean and she has many amenities setup for her Airbnb guests.  I arrived and was very thirsty and was more then happy to find a pitcher of water and glass in my room!  Lissette also has about any toiletry item you could possibly need hanging on the back of the bathroom door.  Lissette has taken great care in being an amazing host and it shows!  If I am ever back in the Boston area I would love to stay at Lissette's again, but I have a feeling her listings are going to fill up quickly, if her place is open you should jump on it!"
13907143,89233628,2016-07-27,85917935,Michael,"Lisette was very responsive in answering all my questions. She was the perfect hostess. I had a carafe of water in the room. Access to wifi and kitchen was alerted open for fresh coffee,  tea and snacks.( Although available I wanted to go to sleep, so didn't use them). This was my first experience with Airbnb, and I would definitely stay here again. You can't beat the price and it's only a 30 minute drive to Logan airport or 20-25 minute ride to downtown Boston. The cost savings of staying her and taking an Uber downturn is will worth it."
13907143,90904922,2016-08-02,4326401,Mary,Lisette was an awesome host. She is very welcoming and accommodating.
Her place is kept immaculately clean and she runs the place like a hotel! She has cold water and cups ready as well as a little corner in the kitchen for guests with fruits,snacks and pastries. Not to mention a little booklet that explains what you're welcome to in the apartment.,,,,
She also has a cat that is very shy but also very sweet if you're lucky enough to meet her!,,,,,
The best part about the location is that it's walking distance from a Dunkin Donuts that is also right across from the train into downtown. Very convenient if you don't want to drive and an excellent way to explore Boston!,,,,,

7868209,43861923,2015-08-22,38497772,Luke,"A great stay. The room was exactly as shown, if not bigger than pictured. Zack was a fantastic host who kept in regular contact, and although he was away and wasn't able to meet us personally, he made sure we were welcome with towels, toiletries, and a guest to greet us upon arrival.  A definite recommendation."

He was very courteous in our interactions, and he let me know who would be meeting me and when. He even left a handwritten guide to local attractions, which I loved! The listing was also exactly as described -- sunlit and close to public transportation -- and it was extremely convenient for me to get to from downtown. The neighborhood was quiet (possibly also given the time of year), just green enough and had its share of comfortable cafes, bars and restaurants within a 20-minute walking distance."

12233225,72281908,2016-05-01,36521092,Ross,"My wife and I were just staying due to parents being in the city.  Ricardo was very quick to get us set up, and having a code to get into the property was perfect.  It's located right next to Maverick station, with super easy access into the city.  As other reviewers have commented, there is a glass door with thick curtains separating from another room, which we didn't see as an issue.  The bed was very comfortable, and pillows pretty simple.  You simply can't beat the price and location for visiting Boston, but do note that this is a very simple space, nothing luxurious."
12233225,73300577,2016-05-08,7397787,Natalie,Ricardo was a great host and the accommodation was as advertised.

12233225,75829474,2016-05-23,72401686,Pauline,Sejour agréable mais aucun contact avec l'hôte. On se retrouve plutôt dans un pseudo hôtel et l'hôte qui communique par sms. Pas trop cool.
"Les toilettes sont partagées alors que sur l'annonce on croit voir des toilettes individuelles. Les espaces communs sont souvent très sales en fin de journée  car le service de nettoyage passe le matin.\"",,,,,
12233225,76601083,2016-05-28,72013845,Abdulmohsen,"The room was very clean. It had a queen bed, a small desk and a chair just as depicted in the photo and a ceiling fan (no AC), but nothing else. The shared kitchen was well stocked with cooking supplies, pots, pans, utensils, and we did find some spices in the pantry. We had a pleasure cooking for ourselves."
There were some restaurants near the hostel,though they seemed very cheap and we did not trust their cleanliness. The hostel is also very close to Maverick station (the blue line) which goes straight into Boston.,,,,
Ricardo was a wonderful host. He was very friendly. We saw him many times as we were going in and out of the hostel,and he would often pass by when we were cooking. He seemed to be busy constantly improving the hostel and even gave us new pillows during our stay.,,,,

12233225,79068321,2016-06-11,28320987,Megan,"My brother and I stayed with Ricardo while visiting Boston and we had a wonderful experience.   The room is perfect for a visit to Boston. You have a view of the city which is a great thing to see when you wake up.   There are people staying there from all over the world. I liked the self check in process. The location and price you can't beat! Parking was a huge bonus for us, we were able to go into the city with a car full of stuff and not worry about it being stolen, just around the corner from the fire department it's a very safe area.  The train was amazing,  just a short walk away and one stop from the city.  I hope to stay with Ricardo again in the future!  You should too, highly recommended"

Shared bathroom is not an issue. There are 2 bathrooms in the hostel and I have never seen both of them occupied at the same time. In my opinion, the best ratio of price / value."
12233225,85316106,2016-07-11,74991672,Robbie,Fantastic location and an easy walk to the Metro Station (one stop from Boston's North End district).
12233225,86211525,2016-07-15,73460,Leonard,"The pros: 2 minute walk from the Maverick T which means super-close to middle of Boston. Lots of little stores.  Great park nearby for kids and adults. Apartment and house felt clean. Inexpensive compared to rest of Boston housing I was looking at.  Nice sized room. Good kitchen and fridge. WIFI and  door lock worked just as advertised.  Prompt communication and instructions from Ricardo. The cons: No AC. This is shown on overview of the place on Airbnb, but it was really, really warm in the house.  There were towels but thin and small. You can hear everything from rooms next door (some separated by a glass door with curtains over it).  Ricardo didn't mention that there were new houses being built on all sides so from 6 AM it was very, very loud.  I would stay again only if really in need of saving money like I was during this trip."
12233225,86504769,2016-07-16,5185344,Mariah,"The picture is exactly the room you are getting.  The bed is soft and comfortable.  The only thing you don't see that is there is the ceiling fan which is an an absolute must in the Summer.  You have access to two kitchens, one on the same floor as the room and two toilets (with showers), one on the same floor as the room.  There is a washing machine in one of the bathrooms (but I didn't use it).  You must be able to climb steep stairs to stay in this room.  It is very basic."
12233225,90590118,2016-08-01,2296031,Lia,The room was as it looked in the photos. Also it was a good location to take the train downtown.
12233225,90840369,2016-08-02,389821,Colin,"Complete instructions were sent to me to self check-in and check-out. There was no ambiguity and I did not need to find someone to ask for a WiFi code. The room was clean. It was an affordable night in Boston with the benefit of a kitchen if needed. Be sure to bring a towel, soap, and shampoo for the shared bathroom."

12233225,94370370,2016-08-15,80068169,Jess,I wasn't aware there wasn't air conditioning. It was my first time using AirBnB and didn't need know I should have checked to see if the place had AC.

The location was perfect, we walked  from the airport and getting into the center of Boston was so easy and convenient. Glad we had the opportunity to book this! The house was clean and Ricardo was there every morning to clean and ensure that all was going well. Ricardo provided accurate and fast information. Lots of great places to eat nearby and grocery stores to shop! They let us keep our baggage there until we picked up our car rental and we were able to explore the city longer. We would definitely recommend and stay with Ricardo again!"

Shawna was an excellent host as well as Jose and Rosa (the cats). Very private and well kept apartment, quiet neighborhood, with a great bar scene nearby. Only tip to future Air BNB'ers is if you drive in, get there early, parking can be rough!"
12811191,80558356,2016-06-18,7717165,Valeria,"Shawna was a sweet host even if we only got to see a glimpse of her when we arrived as we departed right away to see some of Boston. Easy to get into town from her place, the cats were sweet (and a bit nervous), the bed was a bit too squeeky and a bit too short as well (at least for someone taller than 1.75 m) but everything was clean and neat. Thank you for having us!"
12811191,81109830,2016-06-21,12038485,Alex,"Place was very nice and also in an awesome location. Shawna was very good in communicating with me whenever I needed. It had been a while since I used airbnb, now I remember why I like it so much."
Just a heads up for future tenants,the cat will dart for the door when you're leaving! Don't let it out!,,,,

Beware ! It was a bit difficult to find a place to park the car,"mostly \"\"resident permit only\"\" places and not a lot \"\"visitors parking\"\".",,,,
The only thing I would say is that one of the cat was a bit agressive,"it scratched us a few times. \"",,,,

- Shawna was helpful at every point during the visit and made her home open to us.,,,,,

11866869,67292344,2016-03-28,60533849,Inna,"Both Vitaly and Evgeniya were amazing hosts and made me and my friend feel like we were at home, as they were very welcoming and attentive to us. They were also happy to help us figure out which places in Boston we needed to visit and left us plenty of food to enjoy. (The cheese selection was my personal favorite). The place itself was as beautiful as it is in the pictures and the neighborhood was indeed vibrant and picterusque. I believe that Martin Scorcese made a scene from the Departed just a couple of blocks away from the apartment, so If you are a movie afficianado, this is the place you should stay at. If you are not, then stay there just because it is not only beautiful, but has the best location in the city, which is right in between the airport and downtown (1 (!!!) stop away). Overall, everything was splendid!"

508017,8665000,2013-11-11,2252874,Claudia,"This is one of those locations you could only stay in with airbnb - a beautiful, tree-lined, historic residential neighborhood, with no hotels that I noticed. So much we wanted to go to was walking distance, it's in the middle of so much. We also explored a couple of neighborhood places (try Grotto for Italian food, suggested by the host) and walked the Black Heritage Trail with a Park Service tour guide in the neighborhood."
The apartment is nicely decorated and the small space is used well. Note that if you come during the winter,there is some noise from the radiator,"which I think is steam heat. Everything logistically also went well.\"",,,

Very clean and comfortable apartment in a really nice area! Beacon Hill is just that, a hill! Very steep paths with loose bricks could make the area a little hard for those with limited mobility but other than that it's A+++++++!!!!"

My husband and I were quite pleased with the set up. We were looking for a quiet comfortable spot to relax and sleep between our outings and this was that and more. We didn't use the kitchen but it was nice to have that option. The location cannot be beat (unless you are not into climbing hills).  Centrally located in one of the most beautiful neighborhoods in Boston, we were able to enjoy walking and hopping on trains with ease."

There was a little bit of confusion on which unit was hers upon check-in, but appreciated the flexibility on check-in/out. The place is small, but unless you're planning to stay inside while in Boston, was perfect for the trip. The murphy bed is a little hard, but again, it's only a place to sleep in between exploring around town."

A short stroll to the wonderful Charles Street and Boston Commons (lovely restaurants and bakeries). The only thing I can comment on was that the heating did not come on until the last night, so it was quite cold. I didn't meet Susan as she had left the keys out for me and there was also no handy instructions (how to pull the bed down, what to do when I leave, what to do with trash and towels, internet wifi password, etc). In saying that I did call her and she was so very helpful in explaining it all for me and the transaction of getting in, getting keys was so easy and smooth and efficient. I had no issues. I think its also worth noting that there is no hairdryer or iron- so ensure to bring one along."

However,in overall we were not satisfied with the quality of the app. The apartment gives the feeling of poorness and old.  Not well maintained,needs painting and fixing here & there.  A bit messy and not very clean.  Its location and size imposes a great challenge for sensitive sleepers.,,,
"This was our first Airbnb experience (but we are very experienced with the more traditional B&B); we had high expectations from reading the apt’s previous reviews. So we were left with mixed feelings towards this apartment and the overall experience. We are sure that with a little effort & investment and the energies of Susan the place can stand for its name “Beautiful Studio in Beacon Hill”.\"",,,,,
508017,38761210,2015-07-18,32764640,Ashley,Susan was good host. She was very informative and quick to respond. The apartment is in an excellent location and very central to a lot of places in Boston. There was a pungent odor (possibly from previous animals) in the apartment and the bath tub was slow to drain.

508017,41398319,2015-08-07,35491638,Suri,"I loved staying at Susan's studio! While small (very compact), it had everything I needed for my stay. The neighborhood was exactly what I wanted - quaint and residential with everything within walking distance. Like another reviewer said, a table and chairs to eat would have been useful, but otherwise, the place was great. There is no central air, but the window unit was fine. Communication was quick and everything worked out perfectly. Would definitely stay again!"

The apt. was clean and exactly what we needed. We never met Susan but she was responsive and easy to communicate with.

After being \"\"touristy\"\" the whole day it was so nice to feel more like a local by staying here. Walking distance to the Public Gardens"

The apartment is exactly as it appears. It was very clean, however there was a stronger musty odor that we kept smelling. I am not sure if it is the older building or something a former visitor or neighbor left behind. The neighborhood was very nice (Beacon Hill) and we were fairly close (5-7 minute walk) from a T-Station which was great for getting around. It was a perfect retreat for a quick trip to the city!"

The neighborhood is gorgeous and perfect for exploring Beacon Hill, Charles River, Back Bay, Boston Commons, and the Public Garden on foot. The place is small, as shown, but it was sufficient and a perfect homebase for our stay."

Less than a 10 minute walk to the office and fantastic restaurants nearby.  The internet wasn't working when I first arrived and Susan had it fixed the next morning (it was a comcast issue).  She's a very responsive host who made me feel welcome and made sure I had everything I needed.
508017,52658577,2015-10-31,38100339,Brian,This was my first Air BnB rental. Susan made the experience very easy and answered all of my questions about how this experience works. The apartment was very clean and exactly what I was looking for. I would rent again in a heartbeat.

You also have a lot of really nice restaurants and cafes a 3 min walk from the flat. Certainly recommend for 1 or 2 people. The space is small but we didn't mind because we were there mainly to sleep. Susan was very accommodating with check in and out times too which is appreciated.

The size and setup of the studio apartment were great for myself and my daughter on a trip of a few days to Boston. The studio apartment was clean and well maintained, in a historic property. The location was fantastic, and allowed us to take very short walks to dinner and shopping, and longer but very manageable walks to downtown Boston sights and activities. Beacon Hill neighborhood is scenic, safe, and very upscale."
The owner,Susan,was appropriately communicative before our arrival with instructions on how to get there from the airport,access the apartment,etc. Other than that,we did not need to contact her anymore -- everything was logistically very easy.

Everything is walking distance (although we picked the coldest weekend of the year to visit) and it was an excellent spot for that kind of leisurely, wandering-style sightseeing. There were plenty of boutiques and places to eat, and other landmarks were all within 20-minute drive. Susan made some great recommendations for eating out."
The only con was parking. There is absolutely no parking available on the hill,"given that there are only a handful of visitor parking spots. We paid for meter parking at the bottom of the hill and that was easy enough with the municipal \"\"Park Boston\"\" app",but it would have been nice to Park a little closer.,,,

It's within a few blocks of a bunch of great restaurants which are very easy to walk to. Boston commons is also just around the corner.

The location was perfect; centrally-located in an attractive neighborhood.  As with much of the area, it is hilly and sidewalks are (URL HIDDEN) high heels!

I walked from the apt as far as Harvard and as far as the Isabella Gardner Museum and did comfortable safe walks along the river. You can walk to the North End, the wharf area and Back Bay very easily. If you need to the subway system is great and from here you are closest to the Park St T in Boston Common. The studio is very comfortable and as advertised. I enjoyed feeling like one of the neighborhood staying here and shopping at the local stores. Whole Foods, CVS and DeLuca's Market are in the neighborhood. Susan was very accommodating with arrival and departure info and keys and answered emails promptly. Boston people are very friendly! I loved Boston an my vacation there."

508017,94175178,2016-08-15,59250117,Mario,The place was great and the Beacon Hill area was perfect. The 90+ degree heat made it hard for the window AC unit to keep the apt cool during the day but it was fine at night. Susan was great with communication and doing everything she could to make our stay pleasant.

The studio is very clean, good kitchen and bathroom equipment. Susan was always reactive and friendly to help. Some suggestions would be: a small dining table and more powerful/2nd airco, as studio gets warm very quickly."

8402408,62582459,2016-02-15,29734554,Caleb,"Betsy was a great host for our weekend trip up to Boston. Her home was full of character and was beautifully decorated with lots of Boston themed items. Located near the orange and silver lines it is a practical home base, far enough from the center of the city to feel 'homely' but well positioned for travelling into the city.  Our room was very comfortable and we loved the bookshelf full of various travel guides as well as the art displayed. At all times the apartment was very clean and we had no issue sharing the bathroom space."
"The thing that sets this listing apart is the host: Betsy. Betsy was a tremendous resource in helping us plan our activities for each day and we found that the restaurants she recommended were tasty and just a short walk away. She was always very friendly towards us and was always asking if there was anything more we needed of her. We were there on the coldest weekend of the year and she was always reminding us to stay warm before we went out. She had a great knowledge of the city and was clearly very enthusiastic about sharing her favorite spots with us. Overall we will definitely be staying with Betsy again on our next trip to Boston and would recommend her apartment to any other person or couple.\"",,,,,

She also has a visitor list framed in the sleeping area to remind about what she covered ;-)  To our delight the rooms were larger than they appeared in the photos.

8402408,90668919,2016-08-01,16996593,D Nyree,"Wonderful host and definitely a great location. Be aware that the apartment (room) is on the top floor.  Air conditioning was limited to the one room you sleep in. No worries the rest of the apartment was just a bit warmer but still comfortable. Betsy was very kind and informative. She provided us with a hard MBTA card that is re-loadable. This will save you money if you plan on using public transportation. Even though I doubt you'll need it. The neighborhood that Betsy's is located in has everything you need. She will provide you a list of fabulous restaurants so don't worry if it's your first time to Boston. For all my techies and social media fiends, do not worry Betsy has fast wifi and she will provide you the passcode upon arrival."
"We hope to see Betsy again. She definitely made us love Boston more. \"",,,,,
8402408,91843808,2016-08-06,66478754,Jean,"Our stay in Betsy house was wonderful. First the apartment is so nice, and there is pretty much everything you may need (with a special mention for the kitchen !) and it's about 15 minutes walking (for slow walker, 10 if you walk at a regular speed) to the center of Boston. Betsy was really nice to us too, she was available (even if she had to go out of town for few days she always reply to our questions within a day)."
"We would definitely recommend our family and friends to stay at her place if they plan to go to Boston !\"",,,,,
8402408,94327052,2016-08-15,34408264,Patrick,"Betsy is a real super host. It starts with a very warm communication before the trip incl. traveling recommendations  (how to best drive from the airport to the apartment), dinner tips in the area around the place (there are lots of places with super yummi food), city to-dos (and dont's) and ended with way beyond expectations support after we left (we forgot stuff in the apartment and Betsy 'delivered' it to a hotel downtown)."
The place is perfectly attached to public transportation (2 bus lines) and exactly how described). We'd love to come back on our next trip to Boston.,,,,,
"Thanks Betsy!!!\"",,,,,
8402408,95216580,2016-08-18,7316074,Ana,Betsy was a perfect host!
We lost our bus to Boston and arrived at midnight but she was waiting for us.,,,,,
The room was small and sometimes hot but a phant was provided. The flat is very cosy and situated in a quite area in walking distance to downtown.,,,,,
Milk,coffe and tea was for free every morning and you also have towels for your use.,,,,
I totally recommend to stay in Betsy's apartment and i hope i will come back soon.,,,,,
Thank you for all!,,,,,

The apartment is very comfortable and clean, and has a great kitchen set up if you were looking to cook during your stay. Betsy was extremely helpful both before and during our trip, and made us feel very comfortable being there. Nice to get out of the busy tourist areas at the end of the day and relax in the South End. All up had a great trip and would highly recommend Betsy's place to all travellers to Boston."
8402408,96961673,2016-08-25,5627798,Sablle,"Betsy was so kind and quick to communicate. I had a rental car and she went as far as to park her car in front of her house and once I arrived meet me outside so I could easily park my car and she went to park hers somewhere else! I don't know if you can get more hospitable than that. Her home is cozy and she has a nice AC fan in the window that works great, I was never hot and it was 85 degrees out my whole trip. Betsy rocks and I would recommend her home for the location as well! 10/10."

9824155,65455986,2016-03-13,62321690,Mukund,"The listing description was accurate. This place is brilliant if you just want a place to crash at night. It's a private room, had a huge bed as shown in the pictures. Had a small closet with a couple of hangers. If you need a place just to crash for a couple of nights, this is the place. Marcus is pretty fast with replies."
9824155,66236827,2016-03-20,51508441,Brianna,Marcus was very accessible! We had his number and were able to also contact him through Airbnb's messaging. He greeted us himself and gave us the keys as well as his own little tour of his place. It was tidy and we were given towels and the room has a mini fridge (which was great)! Easy to walk to lots of different public transportation (the T and bus). It's a great place to stay and would definitely stay again.

Heater wasn't working at all - it was freezing,but made extremely loud noise throughout the night and day. Only the mattress kept us  warm.,,,,
The host provided no hospitality (nor willing to) at all except on our check-in. procedure. I will not recommend to stay unless it's mild weather and/or you are short of money.,,,,,

9824155,69685139,2016-04-12,14616968,Rebecca,"Marcus was very responsive and the place was comfortable. If you are a light sleeper, this may not be the place for you because the building has vintage radiator heaters in each room that click and clack quite loudly.  I got used to it and didn't have trouble sleeping the second night though.  The bed was comfortable and the mini fridge would have been convenient if I had the need.  I would stay again."
9824155,70150321,2016-04-16,12981903,Hollie,The room was as advertised.  Marcus met us at the door and was very welcoming.  After showing us the room and the apartment he gave us our privacy. We would recommend!
9824155,70410141,2016-04-17,46090798,Naomi,This was the worst place I have ever paid money to stay in . I should have known when the host said- There are clean sheets on the bed- DUH- The radiator behind the bed clanged all night- We did not sleep at all. The toilet and bathroom were disgusting. Please avoid this place.

962610,6148795,2013-08-01,5314282,Pherooz,"We had the most wonderful experience staying at Damon's for the entire month of July. He was an absolutely fabulous host: always helpful, conscientious, and gracious. He was equally quick to react whenever we needed anything as he was to step back to allow us privacy and space."
Due to some delayed construction,the attic apartment that we actually rented (and paid for) wasn't quite ready - so to give us the most comfortable stay possible,Damon was generous enough to let us stay in his own apartment on the main floor,for no extra charge. The entire house is exactly as advertised: beautiful,comfortable,spotlessly clean
What deserves a special mention is our communication with Damon before the actual trip. Since we came to Boston for our wedding,and stayed such a long time,we had plenty of questions and concerns,and a very restrictive budget to boot. During the entire correspondence,Damon was always positive and open to negotiation,and as generous with the actual terms as he was with his time to answer our questions. We were so very happy about our choice
"We enjoyed the entire stay and would love to return whenever we're back in Boston!\"",,,,,
962610,6531589,2013-08-16,5320396,Jean-Philippe,"Damon was a really friendly host. The accommodation was excellent, actually this was the best place we've ever been to."

962610,11508360,2014-04-06,1013110,Kendall,"Damon's apartment was great! My friend and I stayed for 1 month and Damon was a wonderful host. The apartment was super clean with everything we needed, and Damon was very responsive. He was always available when we needed him, helped us unpack the car when we arrived, and let us use the laundry machines in his personal apartment. He also brought up an extra mattress for us to use so that we would have 2 beds, which was great. The apartment was much larger than we anticipated and everything was newly renovated. The location was also great and we were always able to find parking right in front of the house. I would definitely recommend Damon's place if you are looking for a place to stay near Boston!"

Having a separate bedroom and living room was perfect for our 2-year-old's naptime. Damon has thoughtfully provided many little conveniences in the bathroom and kitchen that you would never get at a hotel. In addition, the apartment was extremely clean, which made us feel really comfortable right away."
962610,14230786,2014-06-15,14519431,Jensen,"\"Damon was very friendly, helpful, available and without being too involved.  He was everything we could wish for from a host.  We felt very comfortable, feeling like this was our apartment while visiting Boston.  The bus stop is across the street and only a ten minute ride to the main transit station, and then only 20 minutes to downtown.  Wonderful neighborhood, 10 minute walk and you are in area with grocery store, package store, and a variety of restaurants.  We walked from the transit station home several times through a beautiful arboritum, and that took about 25 minutes - no regrets.  While we could have gotten a car and   there was ample parking, we didn;t. We lived there for 10 days and utilized public transportation.  An $18.00 \"\"Charlie Pass\"\" (which is valid for a week) gave us unlimited access to buses and subway.

As soon as we decided to return to Boston, we checked that Damon's apartment was available. Damon is a friendly and conscientious host; even though we never saw him, he was readily available by email and phone. Communication was clear and pleasant before, during and after our stay.  The apartment itself is lovely - comfortable, clean, spacious and relaxing. It was great having a separate bedroom and living room as well as a little kitchenette. We had a car and there's ample street parking - but the public transportation is also great.  Our entire experience was wonderful and, when we next return to Boston, we'll definitely book with Damon again.  A fantastic airbnb experience!"

The neighborhood was safe feeling and very convenient to our son`s home. We were able to walk easily to a near by restaurant the first morning for breakfast. The village of Roslindale is close,and we especially loved their Farmers` Market on the Saturday. The commuter train is close and easy to use.,,,,
The apartment was PERFECT!!!! It was spotlessly clean and the air conditioners worked well to cool us off after being in some warm and humid temps. It provided a very quiet atmosphere too...never heard any noise from the tenants below us. The kitchen is adequate for simple meals and easy to use.   Thanks,Damon,and hope to meet you next time.

On voit que Damon n'a pas lésiné pour rendre ce logement agréable et confortable. Si l'emplacement n'est pas central, il est cependant facile d'accéder aux transports en commun. Le quartier est paisible, joli et on y trouve quelques restaurants dignes de mention et des épiceries bien garnies. Damon est un hôte sympathique et attentif, qui s'est empressé de répondre à notre demande dès que nous avons eu un problème (mineur, avec un disjoncteur).

I was pleased to have access to the balcony, it was nice to start each day sitting outside with a cup of tea. We had a car which was a concern for us, but parking was as easy as he said.

Hôte très discret (nous ne l'avons même pas croisé)! Nous avons peu visité le quartier, mais nous y avons tout de même trouvé un pub sympa (le Porter cafe... mal bouffe assuré, mais ambiance, bières et service impeccable). le quartier était un peu loin du centre et le transport en commun critiquable, a tout de même répondu à nos besoins!

Host was quick to respond to messages before the trip. Didn't have a chance to to meet the other occupants, but everyone was quiet during my stay. Room and bathroom were clean- carpets could use some attention but no big deal. Set out towels. The neighborhood was the biggest downside- the area in Roxburry was not the nicest. Lots of people walking down the street cursing, loud music coming from cars at night, people hanging around the street you would not likely want to spend time with. I walked home one night and felt relatively safe, but took Uber to the doorstep the rest of my trip. Overall good experience for the price, but would likely not stay again strictly because of the neighborhood."
8228903,55885691,2015-12-06,20035574,Arnaud,Clean room. Access to the rest of the house. Several rooms rented. Efficient check-in and out.
8228903,57095407,2015-12-21,30341581,Blair,"We were only in Boston for one evening but Donovan was extremely helpful, always available via telephone, and made our traveling super smooth and convenient. He lives right next to the Orange Line which made it really easy to see the sights of Boston in a short amount of time.We will definitely come back if we are in the area again."

8228903,57940399,2015-12-30,47228320,Jenna,Donovan's place was fantastic! It was a great set up- cozy warm private room with a TV and desk (it was luxurious after many days of travel!)  and clean spacious shared living areas.  Great location if you're riding the T.  Would totally recommend this to anyone!
8228903,58405480,2016-01-02,7580141,Martin,"Only my second time using airbnb and I must say that I continue to be impressed! On this trip, not only was our domicile stylish, clean and cozy (more on that in just a second) Donovan had arranged exclusive deals with restaurants in the area for discounts on food! Ohh yippy!!! Back to the room: It was cozy and as I enjoyed the Netflix account on the very generously sized flatscreen TV, The warmth of the room took me back many years to my first days of life when my mother would nuzzle me in her warm bountiful bosom and there was no ISIS or Donald Trump and all was right in the world."
8228903,58743756,2016-01-04,52800635,Amber,"Staying at Donovan's place was a true pleasure and made our stay in Boston much easier than I could have imagined. Though while we were in the house we kept to ourselves, Donovan made sure to invite us to hangout with him and the other guests. He made us feel comfortable as if the home was ours. Close to the T, comfy house and amazing hosts, what more could a person ask for !"
8228903,59422190,2016-01-10,20089435,Aaron,"Donovan was very friendly and approachable, definitely made us feel welcome. The key code to get in the house was real slick, and having our own locked room left us feeling safe with leaving things while we were out. The room was as listed, clean, and the bed was comfortable. It's located just a couple blocks from an orange line T stop, which made getting around without a car really convenient. We will say the neighborhood was a bit loud. Just lots of activity outside, lots of sirens even late in the night. Since this was our first time in Boston, maybe it was just a busy weekend, or maybe the city is just louder than other ones we've visited, but it took a bit the first night to get used to it. Certainly no fault of Donovan's, but there's not much you can do about that. Other than the little bit of outside noise, we were comfortable, and it made our weekend in Boston incredibly fun."
8228903,59558111,2016-01-11,30546141,Mark,"I log a lot of time in BNBs. This place: Terrific experience. 5 stars all the way. Clean. Well organized. Responsive. Easy to stay in and get work done or go out and do whatever. The fellow travellers, very cool. Distinctive personalities of all kinds. Living the dream, as themselves, from wherever. Aware, creative, focused, articulate. Not fancy. Sophisticated. Experienced. Not one stereotype in the bunch. Good times in the kitchen and living room too. And I love the convenience, the 5 min walk to food, MBTA Orange Line, buses buses buses, cabs, churches. There's a vibrant local culture in every direction. If you like cities and people and discovering, this place is a hidden treasure, a real find, a gem."
8228903,59835723,2016-01-16,19038452,Sarah,"I booked Donovan's home for my mother in law who visited my husband in Boston for five days.  Although I didn't have a chance to see the property first hand, my mother in law and husband said the room was warm, cozy, comfortable, and clean.  Furthermore, they said that Donovan was an extremely kind and welcoming host.  He made them feel comfortable and right at home.  The property was conveniently located near public transportation (bus and T) and located in a safe neighborhood.  It was also equipped with free wi-fi and Amazon TV.  Thank you for making my mother in law's first visit to Boston a happy one.  Definitely recommend!"

8228903,66956386,2016-03-25,47883008,Sij,"Room was kept in perfect condition when I arrived. The bathroom on the top floor was kept clean, as well. The house is clean overall. No issues getting in or out, the house was secure, and I appreciated having a key to the room I stayed in. Never saw the host, but was always able to reach them via text message, and e-mail."

8228903,69798789,2016-04-13,62563477,Yunzhu,"We enjoyed staying there. We were worried about shampoo stuff. We got everything we need, which is very considerate and convenient. The train station is really close to the house. We love it!!!!"
8228903,70009017,2016-04-15,67250441,Amanda,"These guys saved my live, after one of the worst days I ended up stuck in Boston over night and all I wanted was a bed and a hot shower. They made it easy, convenient, and trouble free. I had my own space, privacy and was never bothered. It was honestly a great experience and I'm so grateful for them!!!"
8228903,70537829,2016-04-18,23378447,Kia,"Can easily say this was my best AirBnB experience yet. Convenient location, clean rooms, clean kitchen. Highly recommend."

8228903,72109720,2016-05-01,20474407,Abigail,Right as we walked in the door we were greeted by a smiling face. They were having a BBQ cookout in the backyard and we were invited. Definitely felt right at home.
8228903,72962803,2016-05-05,69585257,Yuhao,great room and great location
8228903,74343968,2016-05-15,63250142,Hesham,It was really nice to stay in S.P. (URL HIDDEN) clean and quite so helpfull people the room is confy with big flat screen tv...quiet and safe neighborhood..close to roxbury crossing T station (orange line) there is also so nice restaurant next to the house giving you 20% dicount on food...five star for everything really
8228903,75003169,2016-05-18,17479734,Chris,"Room was decent, neighborhood was amazing. So close to restaurants, downtown, etc. Would have appreciated shampoo + conditioner in bathroom, but other than that the stay was fine. As an FYI - pay attention to parking signs out front. Every Tuesday they do street cleaning and will tow cars - be careful you're reading the signs and parking on the non-cleaning side if you're staying on a Tuesday. I was careful enough to check, but that is a must to avoid being towed."
8228903,75194825,2016-05-19,68107671,Diego,"Everything was great as described, people were nice and very quiet i really liked this place, very easy to move from the house to museums and different attractions"

8228903,80863181,2016-06-20,33887331,Dorine,Très bon séjour ! L'appartement est juste à côté du métro et de plusieurs arrêts de bus.
Le code de la porte d'entrée que l'on nous avait donné n'était pas le bon mais nous avons appelé à notre arrivée et SP nous a répondu immédiatement,donc aucun soucis ;),,,,
La chambre est très bien,le lit est confortable,et il y a même l'air climatisé.,,,
"Merci ! \"",,,,,
8228903,81426678,2016-06-23,2390934,Marc,Beware. It's hard to find a much cheaper place downtown Boston but there is a reason why. So many things that should be simple went wrong with this stay.
The code provided to open to front door was wrong.,,,,,
The key wasn't on the rack where they said it would be.,,,,,
The room was not cleaned (dirty towels strewn on the floor,bed undone,dirty carpet).,,,
While the managing agency apologized and tried to fix the situation,it was too little too late. They also promised a discount to make up for their incompetence that I'm still waiting for.,,,,
Even if your check in goes well,understand that this place is kind of a dump. Musty smell,dirty bathrooms and bedding. The walls are thin as paper and you *will* hear everyone else.,,,
This place may still show 5 stars (they ask for it via post its inside the unit),"but don't be fooled.\"",,,,
8228903,81496239,2016-06-23,79328467,Rupal,The place was neat and cozy. It's in the heart of the city and everything is close by. Definitely worth the money! :)
8228903,81796538,2016-06-25,1460017,Sägar,Great place conveniently located near the subway. The room was clean and tidy. Shared amenities such as living and kitchen was very nice as well.

We didn't need to arrange specific time to meet up with the host or anything and were able to get in with just the instruction they provided, which was super convenient! The house is also right by the subway station, so it was very easy getting to downtown Boston."
8228903,83873604,2016-07-04,3043643,Cal,"Very basic. A bed, shower, and everything you need for a night. Didn't interact with the hosts but everything was where it should have been. Cheaper than a hotel so it was a win for me."
8228903,84378589,2016-07-07,61418484,Yujin,호스트분 답장 빠르고 좋았어요. 보스턴 지역인거 감안하면 가격도 저렴하고 방도 깨끗하고 컸어요. 저는 보스턴 지역에서 살아서 잠깐 일이 있어서 에어비엔비 예약한거라 자지는 않았는데 여자 혼자 자기엔 좀 위험한 지역이기도하고 방음은 좀 안됬던 것 같네요. 후기도 워낙 좋은 곳이니 무슨 일이 날것같진 않지만 그래도 9시 이후로는 잘 못돌아다니는 지역이예요! 방 자체만 보시는 거라면 되게 좋고 호스트분도 친절했어요!

8228903,85600573,2016-07-12,24150590,Fiona,The host was extremely welcoming and responsive to all my questions! The bedroom is a private room in a house with other Airbnb members and a short ~10 min drive from many different attractions.
8228903,85773636,2016-07-13,43102432,Elizabeth,"Great price, good location, decent place to spend the night. The hosts responded immediately when we had trouble getting in, and made it clear they were available if we had any further issues. The place is very hostel-like in set up and vibe. Could be a little bit cleaner (bathroom and carpets in particular), but it was comfortable and the TV in the room with HBO, Netflix etc was a nice treat after a long day."
8228903,85864129,2016-07-13,81277753,Max,Our stay was fine. Nice tv in the room and very close to the metro stop. The room was dingy- dark and low ceilings and the shared bathroom was crowded at times.
8228903,87103101,2016-07-18,55471461,Luis Gustavo,Room was clean and well kept in a nice house. Street parking in front of house was also a huge plus. Common bathroom was also clean.

8228903,92336033,2016-08-08,70641584,Jessica,"Room was exactly as pictured in the location we were looking for. Didn't meet the proprietor but had the info we needed before arrival. Lots of shared amenities (fully equipped kitchen, living room, and back patio) that we didn't use since we only stayed one night. Great price for a private room close to the T. Would definitely recommend and would stay here again."

The apartment is perfect for a couple - everything you'll ever need, cozy feeling but ample space, warmly and tastefully decorated. And the location is ideal for exploring all the sites - fairly central, you can walk to most places if you like treading the sidewalks; plus amenities such as supermarket and gym are very adjacent. Couldn't fault it for us Boston marathon runners! :-)"

We had a total of 6 people, and it was incredibly spacious and absolutely lovely.  My parents and parents-in-law were completely taken with the area, so that's a huge plus.  Danielle helped check us in and showed us around, and communication via text was straightforward and easy.  The entire place is thoughtfully furnished, so we made sure to clean up after ourselves when we cooked dinner."

Nate and Danielle prepared a list of the neighborhood restaurants and cafes and the farmers markets nearby. We didn’t get a chance to visit the farmers market,but we went to a couple of restaurants in the list. We like the Homestead bakery (tasty sandwiches for lunch) and Ashmont grill (yummy seafood and steaks for dinner).,,,,
The house was spacious,clean and well equipped as shown in the photos. The beds were very comfortable and there were 2.5 bathrooms! The living and dining areas were well designed. It was just like home!,,,,
We had a rental car and did not use the public transportation. There was a reserved parking space right behind the house. Parking in the Boston/Cambridge downtown was very difficult.,,,,,
Nate and Danielle,Thank you for all the arrangements!,,,,

The Unit is as advertised and is in the middle of the Seaport and a short walk to everything!  There is a parking garage in the same building - extra cost - but the convenience is worth it.   The Unit is very clean and had all the amenities you need.  It was perfect for a weekend in Boston!
11276570,67666627,2016-03-30,62403024,Cory,"\"We had a wonderful stay!  The location is beautiful with a lot of wonderful restaurants only a short walk away.  It is also an easy walk to a number of great Boston attractions.  The building itself is very new and had some nice amenities.  The kids loved the \"\"social\"\" room with board games and a pool table.  The staff was great and Mike was very accommodating making sure to make the apartment available for our early arrival.  We would definitely stay here again!\""
11276570,74533046,2016-05-15,4428407,Eric,"Place was great. Good location.  Very easy check-in.  New building and nice amenities.  Shades in the bedrooms aren't very effective, so if you are a light sleeper, bring an eye mask."
4586681,29804135,2015-04-12,14541675,Bert,Location location.... Hidden away high on a rock in a country setting in the middle of JP????   YES!
By car,public transport or walking – easy access to museums concert halls and historic Boston.... Or shop locally and a nice walk around Jamaica Pond. You will quickly know that your hostess is a gourmet cook – if only by the wonderful aromas from her kitchen. Erik and Lynne have both been helpful in where to go,what to see and how to get there. A pleasant,welcoming accommodation,"clean and tastefully decorated made my visit to the Boston area very memorable. Plus they have off the street parking.\"",
4586681,30471348,2015-04-22,5246219,Barry,Lynne and Erik have an amazing home and the room was exactly as described.  Lynne was away most of the weekend so her husband Erik was a wonderful host.  As a long time resident of JP he had lots of suggestions.  The location is perfect to local eats and the T.   I had a fantastic time visiting JP and would definitely stay here on my next visit.
4586681,31679405,2015-05-08,26954675,Rob,Very appreciative of my 2-day stay with Lynne and Eric and their family. I'm still new to Airbnb happily seeing a pattern of good-hearted warm and welcoming hosts. They made me feel most welcome - private when I wanted to be - and great conversations when we shared  cappuccinos and breakfast. The room was huge! The private bathroom is a walk from the bedroom - but worth every step: brand new - beautifully designed and built & a killer shower. Their dog Gracie wins the sweetest pet award. Highly recommended. Close to Boston and all its burbs.
4586681,31980004,2015-05-12,12134143,Jennifer,"Parley Ave, where this B and B is located, is probably my favorite thing about JP.  It's a winding wooded gravel lane with old over sized houses tucked in the trees. Like some out of towners's idea of an idyllic New England town.  But it's right there in JP one block off the main drag. Other things to love about JP are the beautiful houses near the pond, the peanut butter chocolate ice cream at JP Licks (the worst named ice cream place ever) and the humid night air."
The room is in a big old house.  It is spacious and the bathroom impeccably clean.  Even though I was there on a weekend I didn't see the family much and had lots of privacy.  The hosts Eric and Lynne were kind,"welcomed me warmly and made me feel at ease.  A real nice place to stay. \"",,,,

4586681,34111165,2015-06-04,33508035,Douglas,"Lovely house in a park like setting.  The room is very large, more of a junior suite than a room in a house, and very comfortably furnished.  Best of all, a great, very hot shower. The hosts were very welcoming."
4586681,34455110,2015-06-08,4118321,Brenda,"Highly  recommended! A very  comfortable  room in  a  beautiful  home, and it was  nice  to  chat  with  the  family  at  the  end  of  a  day.  JP is an interesting  and  vibrant  neighborhood  to  explore  and  if you  want  to  go  to Boston, transportation  is easy. I  would  definitely  stay  here  again."
4586681,34613843,2015-06-09,999979,Carin,"Eric made me feel very welcome and on the whole I had a very pleasant, but short 1 night stay.  Only downside was that the bathroom is not on suite, but far from the end of the world when a short stay.  Lovely part of Jamaica Plain.  Very friendly dog too!"
4586681,35034201,2015-06-14,5759095,James,Very nice home with a beautiful hard and a friendly dog.  If there is room and you want to be close to jp this is a great choice!
4586681,35177237,2015-06-15,3076719,Rosarie,Lynne was away but her husband Erik made us feel so welcome. It truly is aptly described as a hidden gem! A beautiful home and very a friendly family including the dog :) I would stay there again in a heartbeat.
4586681,35347878,2015-06-17,7334893,Joanna,"Seamless communication--even when my arrival time changed at the last minute. A lovely, spacious room (and home). Great location--easy access to the T for my meeting in downtown Boston. I truly enjoyed my stay. If Erik offers to make you coffee, just say yes!"
4586681,36053912,2015-06-24,1723765,Suzzanna,"When I was first looking for places to stay in the Boston area I knew I wanted to stay in JP and Lynne and Erik's house seemed like it would be a good place to stay - It turned out to be an amazing place to stay. If you are looking to explore an interesting lively area of Boston I highly recommend staying there. The neighborhood has many things to discover like Tres Gatos, (a tapas bar/records store/bookstore in one) and lovely streets & older homes surrounding Jamaica Pond. Lynne & Erik's house is just a short walk to all, and it's convenient to the T to get into Boston. The house is really cool - it feels like a retreat because of all the greenery in the yard, and because of it's airy farmhouse style. I loved the decor which (to me at least) had an old New England feel with a 70's vibe - which I appreciated as a Californian. I felt right at home. The room is private and has windows with a great view of the yard. There is a nice couch where you can sit and read, and a space where you can hang up your clothes. It's was also very clean and comfy. Yes, the bathroom is not next to the room, but it's really not a hassle."
I didn't get to meet Lynne who was away,but Erik was really fantastic. He had a lot of knowledge of JP and the city and lots of things to share about the neighborhood. He gave me a great recommendation on where to grab a bite when I first arrived (City Feed) and he suggested visiting the Isabel Stewart Gardener Museum,"which I don't think I would have made time for otherwise -  and I am so glad that I did! He also makes a great cup of coffee.  They also have a very sweet & friendly dog. I wish that I would have had more time to sit and enjoy the yard or to just read in the room or chat. I would not hesitate to stay there again. Thank you for graciously opening up your home and for taking the time to answer my questions about JP. \"",,,
4586681,37534367,2015-07-07,4929515,Joyce,I had the most comfortable and pleasant stay in Jamaica plain . Lynne's husband Erik was an incredibly kind and thoughtful host. The room and the home are impeccable. Top notch Airbnb !

The bedroom was exactly as in the picture! Spacious with a very comfortable bed... and the hamack in the garden, so so tempting!

Lynne and Erik made me feel completely welcomed, including Erik  meeting me at the end of the driveway upon my late arrival from the airport, to help with my luggage and show me around their home.  The accommodations were clean and comfortable, and the family was gracious, helpful and warm, giving me travel tips for Boston and always ensuring my comfort.  Jamaica Plain is a lovely community with great bus and train/subway service within close walking distance.  There are wonderful dining and coffee options on Centre Street, just a block's walk from the home.  I would highly recommend this \"\"hidden gem\"\""

Just off Centre st. in JP with short walk to several restaurants and a grocery, but is surrounded by trees and feels remote at the same time.  The room is large, nicely decorated and comfortable.

They had towels nicely placed on the beds and provided all amenities. The kitchen is super nice! I'm bummed we didn't get to cook anything. All I would say is the placement of the bed was somewhat annoying. I couldn't comfortably put my back up against the wall because the A/C unit is right there. Also if it were on, it made it even more uncomfortable. The window backs right up onto the street so you could also here all of the passing people and traffic. There was space for the bed to be moved to a different location in the room, but that's not my place or right to do. Overall, a good stay!"

The room and indeed the whole apartment, was clean and comfortable. It was on the first floor, so there was no need to drag bags up stairs. The room and location in relation to the Maverick T Station suited my needs perfectly. I was very pleased by the short walk to the T. The T was quick and convenient. The bus from the Logan T station was a little slow, stopping and picking up a multitude of passengers at the car rental stop before arriving at the 1st terminal.

13908638,97237926,2016-08-26,82220975,Kat,"Location was great, train to town accessible, very close to airport, apartment is opposite zip car and laundromat which was perfect! Facilities are just what you need with kitchen utensils, bathroom and aircon. Nothing special but if you don't hangout in the room too long you wouldn't need anything else really."
Unfortunately we were not allowed to drop off luggage early nor leave our luggage for a couple hours after check out so we could  explore town and there's nowhere at the airport or Maverick station where you can lock up luggage. This became an issue for us as we had to hang around at a cafe for 2 hours before checking in and needed to head to the airport 2 hours earlier than we needed to and couldn't make use of that time for sightseeing.,,,,,
The agency managing the property own the entire building so the experience isn't as personal as privately owned and leased Airbnb accommodation.,,,,,

5990896,33193016,2015-05-25,26181736,Mauricio,"First of all, I have to say that Jason is not the owner of the apartment, so even if u are gonna talk with him or make some plans, the owner of the place its a girl called Laura, so keep it clear that u are not gonna see and not gonna share the studio with the guy. The apt was clean and the girl is nice, but the other big issue was that the air matress didnt work! so at night I woke up several times to pump the matress and not sleep literally on the floor."

Also, she got a new futon memory foam mattress which could not be any more comfortable!!!  She is also a very clean natured person so her studio isn't crowded or dirty."

I reserved this listing as an \"\"entire home/apt\"\" and paid $175 for 2 nights BUT was asked to reside in it as a shared room arrangement. When I arrived"
I tried to stay out of the apartment as much as possible. I was told I was not allowed to sleep on the bed,only on the mattress on the floor. After checkout,the host contacted me and asked for more money stating that she should be paid the entire home rate of $174/night. WHAT? Bananas! You can view places in the area and note how unreasonable this after-the-fact suggested pricing was.  This felt like a scam and I would NOT recommend staying here,despite the great the convenience of the area. There are better options. RUN!,,

The place is small but clean and comfortable (good mattress!) and the cat Lucky makes for a fun stay. The pictures are honest and give you a very good impression of the place.,,,,,
Prior to arriving I did not read the listing properly and assumed there would be internet. This is not the case but there is a wholefoods with free wifi very close by that is open till 11pm,and during the summer you can comfortably sit outside. There is also some seating with power outlets indoors.,,,,
Doing laundry was no problem,the place has a decent shower and the host,Laura,is easygoing and friendly.,,
As others have mentioned,Jason is your first point of contact,which,while a little unusual,wont matter once you get there.,

The neighborhood is amazing, especially if you are into music, since there are many conservatories and music schools around. Great place to just walk around, enjoy the nature and the city. It's very close to the subway so I had no problems getting anywhere in the whole city. Laura is very friendly, she has been a great host to me. She's very helpful and makes you feel welcome. I didn't have any problems adapting to the place. There's a very cute, very playful cat called Lucky. It was great to have him around. The apartment is exactly as it's shown in the pictures. The mattress is very comfortable. There's laundry downstairs, great places to eat and relax around the neighborhood such as Whole Foods, Subway, and Starbucks. All those places have fast internet connections. Everything is accessible, the host is very friendly, there is a cute cat, the neighborhood is great, and the place completely matches the description and the photos.

Laura was a great host (she is the one you stay with, although the profile is named Jason, which they made clear on the listing). The location was perfect for what I needed. I slept well on the mattress and felt that the apartment was clean and safe. Laura even provided some toiletries. I found plenty of fun shopping and dining nearby, with a Whole Foods for any groceries or a meal if I didn't feel like eating out. Access to the subway was easy. Lucky the cat was adorable as well! I enjoy interacting with the people I stay with, and Laura was around enough that we got to talk and eat a few meals together. It was a good value for the price (especially when compared to the crazy hotel prices nearby) and I felt that the listing accurately reflected how my visit went."

Cozy brownstone studio within walking distance of Whole Foods was a boon!"

The space was big enough for both of us to share, and I felt like I could still have privacy if I needed to because of the treadmill right next to me. Pull out bed was comfortable, as well. Great location, perfect walking distance from everywhere I needed to go! Thank you so much, Laura!"

I knew about the host’s cat and the one-room studio. I had read the wonderful reviews about the host's hospitality and her pet cat. What I didn’t expect was that the cat woke early to play. That play included jumping on my bed. This was at 5 a.m., an early start for my full-day conference. Having risen early, I chose to shower, leave early for the conference, and not wake my host. When I pulled back the shower curtain, I discovered the cat used the shower as its litter box. Having readied myself for a shower, I did not want to wake my host for cleaning duties. I cleaned up the mess, showered, and left. I needed rest so I moved to another Airbnb location for the remainder of the conference.  I regret that I did not think to take pictures of the shower-turned -litter box. However, I appreciate that my host apologized for the cat’s mess even though she has refused so far to make any financial amends.  I certainly would recommend this location for its proximity to the Hynes and other amenities. However, please be prepared for the situation with her cat."

The bed is a thick foam mat on the floor that is quite comfortable and I never had trouble sleeping. She provides some toiletries so there's no need to bring shampoo and conditioner. Her loft is cozy and clean. The area feels very safe and I didn't feel concerned walking at night. The Symphony subway stop is nearby and that's how I got from the airport to her loft and back and travelled to the downtown area. Newbury Street (well-known for shopping) is a few minute walk away and it's also a 7min walk from the Hynes Center if you're staying for a convention like I was. Overall, my stay was a fun experience and I would love to stay with Laura the next time I visit Boston!"

5990896,89226523,2016-07-27,46561750,Wolfgang,"This is the smallest place I have ever stayed at, even smaller than most apartments in New York - through the door you will step onto your floor mat. The host Jason handed me the key but he does not live there. Laura sleeps in the big bed on the picture with her cat - she is a nice person. As the guest you sleep on a narrow and thin yoga type mat which is rolled out in front of her bed. For one night this is okay, but longer stays may get strenuous. I recommend the host should consider getting an actual twin size mattress; it would be so much more comfortable and could be flipped up like the treadmill against the wall when not in use. The place is clean and in good location, and my stay was uncomplicated, but a shared room with floor mat should be less expensive."

In the morning I was offered a traditional Chinese breakfast which was beyond thoughtful and very tasty. Her home is meticulous and comfortable in a neighborhood outside of Boston (West Roxbury) that includes parking.  She has an extensive fruit and vegetable garden in her backyard.

The location of the house is not great because it is not really close to any T station. There is a close bus stop. Susan gave us Chinese dumplings for breakfast for $3 per person. The A/C was not on for the entire time so it did get a little warm. No TV. The common area is not conducive to hanging out.

If you are looking for a clean safe place to stay overnight with a very reasonable rate, and it is close to the city, this is a good place to stay.

6425318,39902458,2015-07-27,27280860,Lena,The place was just phantastic. Susan was a very nice and warmly welcoming Person with many many Informations and good Ideas. The room was well furnitured and had a good taste. Everything was very easy and I would recommend Susan's appartment for everyone. The way up to Boston City is just around 15-20minutes. There's also a very good organic foods store 5 minutes away: whole Foods market.
6425318,40276752,2015-07-29,39076887,Em,Susan was an incredible host! So warm & inviting. Her space really felt like ours. Was staying in town for a major wine test with a college friend & her house was perfect for a morning walk to the T. We went from JP to Back Bay in about 25 minutes. I left my car parked on the street for 3 days without any issue. She offered us fruit & yogurt for the early mornings which was incredibly sweet. I'll stay with her again when I'm in town :]
6425318,40808085,2015-08-02,20638076,Jack,"A very quiet and relaxing spot in the heart of the pleasant neighbourhood, Jamaica Plains. The room was very spacious, clean, light and well ventilated in the hot weather."
The host,"Susan was only there for the first night of our stay but she is very warm hearted and an incredibly interesting host with lots of stories to tell. She made sure we were introduced to the other guests and all the facilities and treated us to fruit and drinks on her terrace. Would stay again.\"",,,,
6425318,94218374,2016-08-15,83781648,Christina,"Susans Wohnung ist sehr schön und eine wunderbare Ausgangsbasis für einen Städtetrip nach Boston. Das Zimmer ist sehr gemütlich und das gemeinschaftlich genutzte Bad sowie Küche und Balkon super, wenn man sich nicht daran stört, diese Räume mit anderen Gästen zu teilen. Susan ist eine tolle Gastgeberin, die alles dafür tut, dass man sich wohl fühlt (viele Tipps, Reiseführer zum leihen, Kleinigkeiten zu essen und trinken im Kühlschrank). Jamaica Plain ist ein sehr schöner Stadtteil, der gut an Downtown angebunden ist (T-Station ist fußläufig zu erreichen)."
5784404,48654644,2015-09-27,36988380,Sara,"This is the first time we used AirBnB! Great experience. The house was very clean, easy to access and over comfortable environment. The house is like a hotel. Everything is brand new and very clean! I would stay here again and recommend to anyone that needs an affordable place to stay in Boston!"
5784404,49547134,2015-10-04,45112650,Lance,"This is a fabulous place.  Brand new.  Tastefully done.  Bathrooms are fantastic.  So is the kitchen.   The little things are thought out -- easy access with a electronic door key, wifi that is powerful, a safe in the rooms, etc.   Its one of those places where you share common areas but never feel like you do.  The house was full, but I think I only saw another guest once."
Todd was extremely accommodating on all levels.  At one point,I needed to change my reservation,and he went out of his way to make it work.,,,
If you are going to stay in Cambridge or Brighton -- look no further.  Or even all of Boston.  I was under 15 minutes to everywhere with UBER or LYFT.,,,,,

5784404,50410029,2015-10-11,21026811,Christine,"This was a great last-minute booking for a conference at Harvard. Everything is new and clean, but still very homey. Todd left mints and toothpaste on the bedside table for us (very convenient as we forgot toothpaste!). We got caught up in traffic and ended up arriving later than expected--this was entirely fine because there's a very convenient electronic lock entry."
5784404,50987707,2015-10-16,46272073,Birahim,"Le séjour s'est très bien passé dans un cadre apaisant. Todd est très serviable. Par dessus tout, l'endroit offre une bonne occasion de socialisation avec des personnes de cultures et d'origine differentes. Parfait"
5784404,51854092,2015-10-24,12150487,Maya,"The apartment and room were very clean, organized, and overall a very nice place to stay. The arrangement was very convenient for me, as I was arriving late but this wasn't an issue since the apartment has an electronic lock. Todd was also very helpful and responsive to my messages."
5784404,52761105,2015-11-01,46939036,J,"This was my first Airbnb and it was an excellent choice. The photos matched the place exactly. It was clean, warm and extremely comfortable. I loved the little travel accessories on the desk and the plus was the warm shower everyday. The complementary drinks in the fridge were really appreciated. Aside from that I had an excellent networking experience. During my stay there were a lot of young professionals so I got the opportunity to interact and discuss with them what were all doing and where were heading, which I really enjoyed. The whole experience was perfect and I would definitely recommend a stay here if you can get it. Book it fast, there's a reason its usually booked up."
5784404,66979018,2016-03-26,53195358,Carlos Andres,Todd did a great job in keeping all welcome. I totally recommend staying at his places!
5784404,71391050,2016-04-25,67801507,Angus,Todd was very thorough and helpful with all directions which made the living experience very straight forward. The house was clean and well kept - a real pleasure in a very handy location for visiting Harvard.
5784404,76779538,2016-05-29,17736839,Majda,"Todd is an amazing host. Everything since check-in has been pretty straightforward. He is polite, always willing to help and always responsive easily. The room was spacious and in great condition. The cleaning staff also comes pretty regularly, which has been nice. The house, location and amenities are fantastic. I definitely recommend staying here if you are looking for a place close to Harvard Square, but also quiet. Definitely worth a visit!"
5784404,79089663,2016-06-11,25429550,Xiang,"Great experience, very helpful host!"
5784404,80872247,2016-06-20,11550460,Jim,"This place is terrific, clean, and in an easy-to-access neighborhood.  Though I didn't meet Todd, his directions for the space are clear and hysterical.  I believe there are 5 rental rooms in this unit, so you get to meet some other travelers too."
5784404,89012816,2016-07-26,52264943,Chris,I had a great experience! The place was exactly as advertised. Very clean! The cleaning team was so nice when I met them. Never made me feel like I was in the way or anything. I never met Todd but he was great at getting back to me! Really appreciate accomodating to my schedule and helping me with a place on such short notice! I highly recommend staying here!
5784404,98068955,2016-08-29,48943890,David,"My friend and I stayed at Todd's house, and it was everything we were expecting and more. The home is located in a great part of town, the other people staying in the house were quiet but friendly, and Todd was available by text immediately when asked about more towels. 10/10 would stay again."
5784404,99356016,2016-09-04,93275959,Rose,"This is my first time with airbnb. The place is very nice, clean and spacious. It is actually the same as in the photos. Satisfactory!"
12627225,86249955,2016-07-15,44447406,Takao,Host is freindly and kind because firsy day
she guided me good food shop.,,,,,
But she was very loose because,,,,,
i did not eat breakfast 3 morning(i stayed 8 night),,,,,
i waited over 30 minutes but she did not get up and i wasted times.,,,,,
And breakfast was not so much and no hot drink. So i sometimes bought coffee and hamburger.,,,,,
And there was no bed sheet so,,,,,
i felt a liyyle bit dirty.,,,,,
Any i did not recommend yo stay longer.,,,,,
And when stand lamp was broken,but she did not prepare new one,,,,
She said lamp stand was design.,,,,,
The room lamp was dark to read guide book.,,,,,
I think she did not have the mind of,,,,,
hospitality.,,,,,
Above all,,,,,
hospitality so,,,,,

12627225,87197002,2016-07-19,16630630,Andre,The room was as described. The host was very friendly and helpful. Communication was prompt and easy going!
12627225,88437138,2016-07-24,83709880,Anthony,Kaitlin was available and responsive
12627225,89637772,2016-07-29,78883132,Laetitia,Nous avons été déçu de l'ensemble de notre expérience des le commencement en ayant aucune réponse avant notre arrivée de notre hôte  ( ayant vu ses commentaires précédents on se demandait même si l'hôte allait annuler à dernière minute).Quand nous sommes arrivées dans le logement nous avons constaté l'insalubrité du lieu; chambre non accueillante ressemblant à dépôtoire  (affaires sous le lit dont mouchoirs usagés  et commode remplie). La salle de bain reflétant la chambre. Nous n'avons pas été accueili par katlin;le petit déjeuner ne ressemble pas du tout aux photos. Quartier non accueillant et à environ à 45min/1h du centre de Boston. Nous avons été également surprise de l'absence de wifi.
12627225,90334067,2016-07-31,79978613,Frédéric,Nous avons passé 3 nuits chez Kaitlin.
C'est une douce personne. Elle nous a agréablement accueillis bien qu'elle fût pressée.,,,,,
En revanche,la chambre était sale. Beaucoup de bazar sous le lit,pas d'armoire utilisable. Le ménage n'avait pas était fait dans la maison non plus y compris dans la salle de bain. Ce que Kaitlin nous a elle-même déclaré.,,,
Une nuit,minuit passée,du bruit et de la musique nous ont empêchés de dormir. Nous avons dû demander à Kaitlin de baisser le son et de faire moins de bruit. La musique a été coupée,mais le remue-ménage a continué. Quand ce n'est pas Kaitlin et sa mère qui s'interpellent en pleine nuit,ce sont des gens qui crient depuis la porte d'entrée pour appeler Kailtin.,
Le petit déjeuner : rien à voir avec les photos alléchantes piquées sur internet. Elle nous a proposé plusieurs choix à notre arrivée (en l'occurrence fruit'n toast et Egg et Bacon). Mais nous n'avons eu que des pancakes aux sirops (très bons cela dit),et jus d'orange. Et le dernier jour,l'un de nous a pu avoir des œufs (sans le bacon) et du café. Bref : très déçus.,,,
Juste un mot sur le quartier : des bus réguliers desservent le quartier vers les métros (à 1h du centre-ville). Le quartier est très mal entretenu malheureusement,et peut ne pas inspirer confiance,surtout la nuit.,,,
"Kaitlin est agréable mais hélas elle n’est pas du tout prête à être hôtesse.\"",,,,,
12627225,90706169,2016-08-02,46511222,Janet,"Our host was very nice. She texted back promptly and was very flexible with our check-in time, which was greatly appreciated. There is smoking inside and the bathroom is not very guest friendly. Our bedroom was dusty with broken end tables in it, and I had to ask for a pillow and cover for the bed. She made us a simple and tasty French toast breakfast. The surrounding neighborhood area is lacking in cleanliness and diversity. The house is someone run down and the lawn is not kept up. the parking was quite convenient. It is at least a ten minute walk to the nearest T station. She has a nice dog in the house, though I didn't recall a mention of a pet in the house prior to reserving. Wish I had had all the above information before I booked this location, I would have looked around further before deciding on this place."
12627225,94086933,2016-08-14,77553289,Maria,"Kaitlin´s home is great space and value in the Boston area. She was quick to respond and assist me with any needs, for example tell me about how to take public transportation and orientation with the subway stations. The house was great for me. It was close to downtown. In taxi, 10 minutes and it is about 14-15 dollars from the downtown. The space was tidy and well-kept. The neighborhood is safe and quiet, families with kids, just work people. Kaitlin and her mother were awesome at preparation for all, every day I had a delicious and typical American breakfast. They are very kind people. I would high recommend Kaitlin home to anyone."
12627225,94925721,2016-08-17,5527484,Flora,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
12627225,96156449,2016-08-22,47214548,Limar,One thing to be aware of: you have to be comfortable with the smell of cigarettes.
That being said,staying with Kaitlin was great.  Upon arrival she made us feel extremely welcome by making sure we had everything we needed and told us to find her with any questions.  Within a few minutes she was even curling my friend's hair before we went out dancing.,,,,
In the morning we were awoken at an agreed upon time to breakfast on a tray delivered right to us in bed.,,,,,
For the price,and location so close to downtown Boston,"this is a great deal.\"",,,
12627225,96471678,2016-08-23,79906966,David,"Kaitlin was very personable and communicated throughout the booking and was flexible with our unknown arrival time. She informed us that we could call on her any time during the night if we needed anything. However, we were VERY disappointed with the appearance of the room, its furnishings, its bare appearance and quality of bedding. There was one bare ceiling light bulb, nothing covering it, no bed lamps. We expected towels, washcloths, and pillows to be waiting in the room and not have to ask for them. There was air conditioning in the apartment, but nothing in the room. With the door closed it was uncomfortably hot. There two windows, one with damaged tangled, mini blinds. A large headboard (not attached the bed) blocked any air that did manage to make it through the window. The mattress was dirty, worn and lumpy. No mattress pad made it even less appealing. The sheets were thin and worn and did not seem to fit the bed. Street parking was available, but limited. Breakfast was acceptable. Hot coffee upon arising would have been welcome. Most of the pictures on the listing were of her breakfast; there was no photo of the room to which we were assigned. Coming from a small rural community we were uncomfortable with the neighborhood."
It was quiet,with the exception of a constant beeping of a dead smoke alarm battery.,,,,

6879036,54506469,2015-11-21,8003721,Peter,"The unit was as described, clean and in a strategic location.  I thought the keyless entry worked great.  Overall,  a very nice place to stay and I hope to use it again in the very near future on my next trip."
6879036,71025202,2016-04-23,59327914,Davis,"Great host, answered my questions promptly, had all the info I needed for my stay. Very nice studio apartment, as described, exactly as the photos portray it. Keyless access was very convenient. Nicely situated next door to Deluca's Market, across from CVS, in walking distance to many good restaurants. The perfect accommodations for my stay while I was working for a client in the area. Would definitely request it again for my next trip to Boston."
"\"",,,,,
6879036,75137706,2016-05-19,67593931,Yoon-Chin,The Newbary accommodation was just perfect for us. We could not have asked for a better location. The studio flat was walk in ready with a digital lock enabling us to get into the flat at almost 11pm ( flight arrived late ) without any fuss whatsoever. Some airbnb owners require delivery of keys making late night arrivals awkward.
The studio flat was clean and modern. Kitchen was well equiped and bathroom/toilet clean. WIFI,TV,DVD player and an efficient cooler/heater sytem made our two week long stay really comfortable. At street level,shops and restaurants lined the entire Newbury Street. Boston Common and The Charles River was within walking distance.  If we ever return to Boston,"I would love to stay at  Alicia's flat again. \"",
6879036,77605064,2016-06-02,9317909,Raphael,I loved staying in Alicia's place.

6879036,78505821,2016-06-07,69775044,Brandon,The apartment was in a great location. It had everything we needed to feel at home. This would be the first place I would look if I were to take another trip to Boston.
6879036,79022612,2016-06-10,45070734,Kristina,"It was great experience to stay here. Everything was perfect , small space but with everything you might need.

The room itself had a lot of character and very comfortable. The location was exactly as described and great for people wishing to tour Manhatten. The only criticism really was the bathrooms - sharing my stay with my girlfriend, she was a bit put off by their less-female-friendly nature! All in though, good value and would stay again."
7855120,69303525,2016-04-10,63558755,Fan,The room was as pictures and very clean when I got there.  Everything was clean and in good condition.  Overall a good experience.
7855120,70719629,2016-04-20,11716326,Ling Ling,Good about the apartment:
1. Location: just next to the broadway T station. Very convenient to most of the attractions nearby,,,,,
2. Allow early check in. Will is very helpful in letting us to check in earlier.,,,,,
3. The space and lighting of the house was really good,,,,,
4. One private bathroom and also 2 public bathrooms can be used.,,,,,
5. Furnitures and facilities are new and tidy.,,,,,
6. Good restaurants nearby.,,,,,
Bad about the apartment:,,,,,
1. Noise. Cos it is just next to the mainstreet and there are bars and restaurants just downstairs,the noise from the vehicles and pedestrians were really unbearable. We cannot sleep at all. The sound insulation should have installed to avoid this problem.,,,,
2. The coffee machine,plates were not cleaned properly. We have to wash it again before we can use it.,,,,

The apartment is operated by a business so it doesn't offer that airbnb \"\"extended family\"\" feel as you don't get to meet the owner and get personal face to face conversation/suggestions but they do provide a book with helpful suggestions.The only item to be aware of is because of the good location the apartment faces a busy street and you will hear a lot of street traffic all night long. This apartment is also on the 4th floor so be aware you will have to walk up 4 flights of steep"
7855120,86458632,2016-07-16,43390691,Lisa,"The location was great.  It was very close to the red line, and that was very convenient for traveling to different neighborhoods to visit.  The directions were very clear on getting from the airport to the apt., it was very quick, easy and cheap - compared to taking a cab.  The apt was very clean and modern.  The bathroom and kitchen were updated, and the air conditioning was wonderful as I was visiting in July.  There is some street noise at night, but it was relatively quiet for a big city.   Light sleepers might want to bring some earplugs.  Grocery store and restaurants close by, and it seemed like a very safe neighborhood.  I loved the place!"

3198169,56685702,2015-12-16,50192574,Vivien,"Host: I flew into Boston at 3 pm and used public transportation in order to reach the AirBNB. Prakhar was accommodating about that and made sure to be in front of the hotel to greet me when I reached the apartment complex. He took time out of work to show me around the apartment and the amenities offered. He even had an iron for me to borrow for my interview suit! Loved it. I was only in town for a brief period of time, but the initial greeting made me feel most welcome. Sadly, I didn't get to see Prakhar for the remainder of my stay, but we stayed in touch via texting to see if there was anything that I needed, check out times, etc."
Listing: The apartment was spacious and well-kept. My bedroom came with a desk and chair,full-length mirror,and a bed that could fit two people. Closet space was more than enough and came with a set of drawers,hair dryer,and clothes hangers. Prakhar provided me with a towel for my stay. There was one bathroom,which was very clean as well.
Neighborhood: The apartment is within walking distance to BW and BIDMC as well as to several T stops,which was ideal for me. It didn't appear sketchy to me at all. I was close to bigger,more public streets so was able to check out the stores,restaurants,and schools on my way to dinner.,
Overall,I had a great AirBNB experience,and I paid much less than I otherwise would have for a hotel. Thanks,Prakhar,"for being a great host!\"",
3198169,58581505,2016-01-03,49159834,Daniel,La descripción del departamento coincidía con lo que luego encontramos en la realidad. Prakhar ha sido un excelente anfitrión y hemos estado muy cómodos durante nuestra estadía.

Prakhar's apartment was my first accommodation in Boston, and from here I started to set-up everything I needed for my long-term stay in Boston. I was extremely lucky to arrive at Prakhar's apartment. He has been a great host!"
The building is very safe (there is always someone present at the front desk/reception). The apartment is at the 7th floor (there are elevators!),the apartment is clean and is well equipped with all daily necessity. Prakhar is working a lot,and is not much at home,but he still keeps his apartment clean. The supermarket is only 3 min walk away,as well as a few restaurants - this is very convenient if you are working and do not have much time.,
I have experienced Prakhar as a very respectful and extremely considerate person. He is busy with his work but when he gets home he is social and friendly enough to listen to you and talk to you about daily stuff. As a host/roommate he certainly made me feel welcome and at home!,,,,,

The neighborhood is nice and safe to walk at night. We found good food and drinks in easy walking distance. It's listed as walking distance to the seaport area, but as I am almost a senior citizen and not in great shape, I used uber which was there in minutes. Michael made the whole experience very easy and always responded quickly."
11757166,74306691,2016-05-14,68824877,Robert,"Michael is good host, his place clean and in a great location especially if you plan on public transportation being your choice for getting around. We bought a 7 day pass and used it and used it from South Boston to fenway park to downtown to uptown and every other town. Even had some brews where Ben afflict used to hangout. Great stay I must say."

11757166,78118111,2016-06-05,68150308,Allen,"Staying with Mike was a great experience. The first day he gave me the tour and showed me where things were in the house. He told me about places that could be easily accessible within walking distance of his place. The place was clean, bed was comfortable, and an easy access to transportation."
As I was in Boston for work,"and it was my first time there I wasn't there much other than in the evenings and to sleep and yet it was the perfect place and arrangement for me to stay at. If I ever get back to Boston I will definitely see if Mike has room for another guest. Definitely recommend!!!! \"",,,,
11757166,78579071,2016-06-07,5774453,Caleb,Mike was a wonderful and accommodating host. I had to arrive a little later in the evening and he was flexible on that. I had a private room with a comfortable bed and access to a nice bathroom. I even was able to have my own set of keys for the home and my room.
"It was a perfect place to stay for 2 nights and save some money instead of staying at an expensive seaport hotel. \"",,,,,
11757166,79003420,2016-06-10,29259879,Xiao,Very kindful host. While so far I can not believe Michael is a real police officer and he has been awarded by catching a bomber. It also means being very safe in his house. HAHA! Thanks!

I was in town for a work conference with a team member.  I arrived by myself first and felt very comfortable with Michael as a single woman staying in a man's home.  The location was perfect and it was nice to have a home to come back to so we could rest at night.  Michael is an absolutely fabulous host; if you give him information about what you want to do he makes all appropriate recommendations; knows the transportation system; knows all of Boston and surrounding area; is extremely accommodating, very clean and couldn't be friendlier or more welcoming.  His dog is adorable too!!  The area is outstanding, a true neighborhood feel and a great location:  there is a corner bar on the street; two blocks away is a street with many independent shops, restaurants, a grocery store and a liquor store; several restaurants in the neighborhood; the water a brisk walk away and the transportation system is in close walking distance.  The house was great as well with a comfy bed and bathroom right next to the bedroom.  I would highly recommend staying with Michael and am even thinking of going back to Boston just to stay with him and see more of the City."

11757166,95371761,2016-08-19,15231933,Daniel,Michael ist ein hervorragender Gastgeber. Auf Anfragen im Vorfeld reagierte er schnell und er gab uns nützliche Hinweise vor Ort. Die Wohnung ist sehr modern. Mit Bus 7 oder 9 fuhren wir in die Stadt. Zur T- Red-Line sind es ca. 20 min Fußweg  (oder Bus 9). Fiona (die Hündin) ist eine angenehme Mitbewohnerin ;)

7840131,52265942,2015-10-27,46085277,Hrafnhildur,"Mathilde is a wonderful hostess. She answered my comments/questions within just a few hours and stayed in contact with us during the whole process, as well as being an informed tour guide. The apartment is lovely, just right for my husband and I who were staying in Boston for a long weekend. The bed was very comfortable, the apartment was clean and tidy. The location is perfect, we were able to walk to all of our destinations and enjoyed the lively college setting. We would recommend Mathilde's apartment to anyone wanting a nice cozy place to stay for a few days in the wonderful city of Boston."
7840131,53533518,2015-11-09,47481178,Christina,"Mathilde was very accommodating although we were a bit behind schedule due to traffic. We did not see her (like I said, we were late) but her friend, Ben, very kindly showed us in."
Apartment was very clean and really quite charming. It was nice to see that Mathilde had left us a note on various things regarding the apartment that answered all of the questions I had (and didn't know I had).,,,,,
I was already familiar with the neighborhood having attended BU undergrad. It is a very safe neighborhood being on BU campus with convenience stores and restaurants close by.,,,,,
Parking could've easily been worse - but we just ended up parking at the BU lot for $12 on Saturday and on the street for Sunday (free).,,,,,
Overall,very charming apartment. One block in from the main street (Commonwealth avenue) so it was pretty quite even though it is on college campus during the weekend.,,,,
"Would definitely love to stay there again if we were to visit Boston again.\"",,,,,
1277618,5497842,2013-07-02,1676118,Andrea,Beautiful brownstone in a great neighborhood! Ross was a really good host. He responded to all of my queries promptly and was very helpful.  I would definitely stay here again.
1277618,5535527,2013-07-04,1575096,Tommi,"The place was great and clean. It felt like being a Bostonite. Close to great restaurants but on a quiet street. Although we did not meet Ross, everything worked out smoothly and he answered quickly to our questions. Would highly recommend the place."
1277618,5767035,2013-07-15,7213530,Matthew,"Somewhat disappointing. Pro's: Great neighborhood, quiet but close to great restaurants and bars. Con's: Left with a number of bug bites, most likely from spiders or insects. Also, pictures are not accurate. Pictures were taken with different furniture which makes it look like an ikea ad. In actuality, most of that furniture has been removed and either not replaced or replaced with bare essential furniture (ie bed, couch, table). Slightly cheaper than a hotel but probably not worth it for the bug bite experience."
1277618,5848558,2013-07-19,5698906,Marco,"My wife and I visited Boston during our honeymoon, and stayed at Ross's place for 4 nights."
The neighbourhood is safe and beautiful,with some amazing restaurants and cafes around the corner. (You should try the South End Buttery Cafe and The Beehive!) The apartment is housed in a nice brownstone building and quite well equipped. Cleanliness could be improved though!,,,,
Ross wasn't there to receive us,but he gave us very clear instructions on how to retrieve the keys to the apartment. We encountered some bugs though,which left us with some bites.,,,

12052288,69302625,2016-04-10,10447155,Wesley,"I can't say enough about how nice our stay was at Bonnie's cabin in the city!  From the moment we booked with Bonnie, she stayed in constant contact with me to ensure that I found my way to her home and that I had everything I needed.  On arrival in Boston, Bonnie personally welcomed me and my friend and gave us a tour of the space.  Jamaica Plain is a very cool neighborhood in Boston with many attractions and dining places within walking distance.  The actual space Bonnie has is awesome! It gives one the feeling of being in a ski chalet, but instead, just outside is one of the coolest neighborhoods in Boston!  I felt as though I would be perfectly happy to stay inside the entire time!  All features in the space are new and in great working order.  The space also has many architectural and design elements that give off a modern yet rustic feel that anyone can appreciate.  Bonnie had condiments, milk, coffee, and just about everything else needed to make our stay extremely comfortable.  I would recommend this spot to anyone coming to Boston for an overnight visit or an extended stay, and I plan to return here to stay with Bonnie in the very near future.  Great job Bonnie! Thanks for being such an amazing host!"

She answered any questions we had and even offered some great restaurant suggestions later that day.  Her little cabin is cozy and has everything you need: a nice big bed, an extra sofa bad, clean towels and linens AND parking was super easy!  Plus, she left us some very good coffee, milk, cereal, and oatmeal to have if we liked.  The old school bathtub was a little scary for my senior father getting in and out, but otherwise the bathroom was good. The apartment is located in a nice eclectic neighborhood about a block and a half from the Samuel Adams Brewery and a couple of blocks from the orange line.  Stay there!

Bonnie and her husband made sure we could  access the place and were ready to resolve any difficulties we had promptly. Her house is very clean and well maintained with all the day-to-day necessities and beyond. It's very impressive of her to have paid attention to minor details and be thoughtful about the guests. She even has kept a cute guide to get familiarized with the surrounding and to tour around the city. We had a great stay.

She has done a ton to make this a great place for families - there were safety outlet covers, child locks on cabinets, children's plates, cups, and spoons, and even a high chair to use!  The location of the Cabin is great - there are numerous parks within easy walking distance, the train is around the corner, and there are many great restaurants within a few minute walk.

As promised, a short walk from the T and soooo close to Sam Adams (if you're a beer fan do yourself a favor and take the early Friday tour to taste a new beer not yet on the market).  The City Cabin truly felt like a home away from home--a perfect place to be when I wasn't out in Boston. Bonnie was a great host who was in touch prior to the trip, and was available when I needed her assistance once I arrived.  I would definitely stay here again."

Bonnie thinks of every detail. She emailed us instructions for getting from the airport to The City Cabin via,car or the subway (we used the subway) and they were spot on!

We didn't get to meet Bonnie,due to our schedules,but we were in touch by text and email.,,

12052288,89275081,2016-07-27,37324121,Lexi,"Great stay! We enjoyed staying at the cabin and had a awesome time! It was nice to be a little out from downtown and see a lot more of the area! We loved Bonnie's suggestions of food in the area, especially the ones we just walked too! Definitely a great place to come to after exploring Boston all day!"
12052288,90857610,2016-08-02,14718267,女士,"The stay with Bonnie was definitely a very glad kind, that you would like to experience again. The place was cozy and the decorations were astonishingly elegant. The kitchen was especially awesome. The location of the house was also something we would like to mention. The subway station was only five-minutes-walk away, with a tasty Mexican food shop nearby. We had experienced a brilliant time in Boston, and that is all thanks to Bonnie."
12052288,91687965,2016-08-06,36802486,Andrea,"My family of four had a pleasant 2-night stay at Bonnie's place.  Her personality really comes through in the special touches - the Cabin is cozier than the photographs can convey. My kids especially enjoyed the DVDs and brain teaser puzzles and games. My husband and I especially enjoyed the coffee, half & half, and comfy bed.  We didn't get a chance to explore the neighborhood but enjoyed the 5 minute walk to the T station.  It's a great value and we appreciated Bonnie's kid friendliness.  The AC in the bedroom cut out any sounds from the other floors.  We would stay again."
12052288,92474719,2016-08-08,58702564,Chris,"Bonnie was a wonderful host!  She accommodated our early arrival, was friendly and helpful. The location was perfect, a quick walk to the T, everything is as described.  She really did think of everything one could possibly need while staying here!  So many nice touches to this place. We look forward to staying again on a return visit."
12052288,92781603,2016-08-10,30653894,Wendy,"Our stay at the City Cabin was great and Bonnie and John were wonderful. From the cozy decor to the charming patio and the fantastic garden, everything was just right."
12052288,93681848,2016-08-13,25958383,Samuel,"Le logement est très propre, fonctionnel et bien décoré.  Le métro est tout proche (Orange line) et mène directement aux attractions les plus prisées de Boston. Enfin, l'accueil de Bonnie et de son mari étaient extra!"
12052288,93962833,2016-08-14,26323489,Natasha,"Bonnie was a great host and I highly recommend staying at the city cabin! Our flight was scheduled to land earlier than the check in time and she let us drop our bags and check in early. Her place was easy to get to via public transportation and is very adorable, clean, and homey. Everything we needed was provided (in terms of cooking utensils, bbq, spices, bath/shower stuff etc.) there was even some cereal, coffee, tea, bread, and other food items provided. The garden outside the city cabin is also lovely with many different herbs and vegetables being grown. I would not hesitate to choose her place to stay in the future, we had a great time there!"
12052288,94972446,2016-08-17,65629113,John,"I reserved Bonnie's place for my parents when they came to visit. It was their first Air B&B experience and they loved it. A big space for the neighborhood, clean, and charming. Perfect for JP and Boston adventures."
12052288,96574394,2016-08-23,36826232,Timothy,Very cute nice place and value for the money to hang out and get a good nights sleep.
12052288,96708205,2016-08-24,74669509,Cipriano,"The city cabin is exactly as described but better. The place is super clean and has everything that you will need. Plus, there is a lot of space. We only stayed a night but we wish we could have stayed longer. We were looking to go to Fenway Park and this place was a short drive away plus we also visited downtown Boston which was not far away as well. No issues at all with this place, a must stay!"
12052288,99348711,2016-09-04,2029074,Luis Ernesto,Our stay was Just perfect! Bonnie helped us with everything and gave us usefull advice.

This was a first airbnb experience and we hope that we are not spoiled!,,,,,
The Diamond House #3 was AWESOME!,,,,,
The space was comfortable with great decor appropriate to the home. Meticulously clean and welcoming with all needs met. The location is beautiful and convenient. You must take a walk through the Jamaica Plain neighborhood and over to Jamaica Pond. The Ula Cafe for coffee,breakfast or sandwiches is very cool. Bella Luna restaurant is a must,great atmosphere and service! Most of all Louis the host of Diamond House was so welcoming,informative and really loves his home... You want to stay here!,,
"We will again!\"",,,,,
7789429,50120584,2015-10-09,33844335,James,"Louis made my family feel most welcome.  With my spinal problems,"
Louis was even willing to carry my one bag up to our room,and bring it down after our stay.  A little thing...but not when you have a bad back.  Enjoyed some brief conversations at check in time and likewise,,,,
at the end.  Rooms were clean and comfortable.  My daughter,"grandson and I all felt most comfortable.\"",,,,
7789429,89948467,2016-07-30,53761384,Ni,It has been a great pleasure for our whole families to stay at Diamond House. We had stayed there for more than a month. Louis is a very responsive person and he provided enormous support during our stay at his place. The House is old but very well maintained. The furnitures and decorations in the room are carefully arranged. Our kids had a lot fun there. The location is very convenient. 5 minutes walk to the T station and the huge (URL HIDDEN) takes about 20 minutes drive to downtown Boston. We appreciate all the help that Louis gave us during our stay!
7789429,94402807,2016-08-15,32489953,Helen,"DH3在橙色地铁旁边,5分钟路程。DH3是整个房子的第三楼。街区很安静,很高档。房东在我们抵达时帮助我们搬运大的行李箱。由于经常有人入住,所以厨房的配料一应俱全。房东在第一天协助我们开车前往附近超市,并在以后的日子里帮助我们预定诊所。是值得推荐的好住所。"
7789429,95976831,2016-08-21,7836921,Catherine,"\"I was late arriving, and Louis was so gracious about it. Diamond House is stunning, and the \"\"penthouse\"\" apartment was huge"
I was visiting my BFF in the area,and we did not end up cooking beyond making a few salads. But I noticed that the kitchen was fully equipped with every type of utensil and gadget one could need. The full-size fridge and stove were superb,and the kitchen had a cafe style table and chairs that we loved sitting at. The ceiling fan in the kitchen was much appreciated during my summer visit!,,,
I was also grateful for excellent air conditioning,because it was in the high 80s and humid in Boston the week I was there! Coming back to Diamond House after a day out and about was a true pleasure. Louis has done an amazing job with both the interior and exterior of this gem of a mansion. The gardens are a vivid addition to the beautiful paint and stained glass windows.,,,,
As for the neighborhood,it was perfect for my needs. I went a few blocks down every morning for my latte splurge to Ula Cafe,and I also went for tacos down the street right when I arrived--delicious! I went running at Jamaica Pond several times,which was a short walk from Diamond House--as was central Jamaica Plain,chock full of cafes,restaurants
I did not rent a car,and was so happy to be around the corner from the T--it was a straight shot into downtown Boston for activities. Coming from San Francisco,where the public transportation is terrible,I was delighted with the speed of the T. I even took it to the airport upon my departure since I wasn't in a hurry--it was fast and easy.,,
Staying in Jamaica Plain was the right choice for me,since I wanted access to the Arboretum and a place to run on non-paved paths--and I was able to get into the city proper quickly.,,,,
Louis was a wonderful host and had I took all of his suggestions. Anyone would be lucky to have him as their concierge for a fantastic stay in the Boston area!,,,,,

276450,1254595,2012-05-09,2092726,Brittany,"This was an excellently stay, the perfect 1 bedroom apartment in Boston and great, professional hosts. The apartment and all of the appliances where brand new, very clean and good quality. The queen bed was very comfortable and the area is quiet at night. There is central air conditioning and the heating is easy to control with digital thermostat. The kitchen is fully equipped with garbage disposal, dishwasher, large sink, granite counter tops, 6 place settings for dishes/cutlery, pots, everything you need for cooking/food preparation eg colander, measuring cups and spoons, cutting board, med-large Simple Human trash can, etc. All linens and towels were of good quality, fresh and clean. There was a medium sized walk-in closet with lighting, iron and ironing board, hangers, shoe rack and shelving. Bathroom is nice and bright, with window, good ventilation, water pressure, clean brand new tub, storage cabinets, towel racks. High ceilings, skylight and bay windows on top floor (apt 6). It was easy to go in and out of the apt with electronic door codes for building and apartment doors (keyless). There's free, large, new, front-entry washer and dryer in the basement, just bring a small bottle of your own detergent. Dish washing detergent, hand soap, and dish soap is included. The apartment is half block from Mass Ave, 5-10 minutes walking to stops on the green, orange and silver T lines, 7-10 min walk to Whole Foods, CVS, 15-20 mins walk to the center of Back Bay, Newbury St shopping, Copley Place and Prudential malls. Theres a small 24 hr convenient store across the street. I stayed one week and didn't want to leave! Keep in mind that apt 5 and 6 are on the 4th floor of a walk up, so may be a problem if you have mobility issues or lots of luggage. I had two sixty lb suitcases and despite a little sweat/huffing puffing at the top, it was worth the 5 mins of pain- nothing like this in Boston and the location is a convenient place to live like a local but be close to all the best of the city."
276450,1349556,2012-05-26,1358438,Melissa,Great place. New and very well appointed apartment. Just a five-minute walk from the T station and on the same block as the very convenient no1 bus.
276450,2168430,2012-09-02,1360013,Joanna,This is a great apartment. Will is great at communicating via email.
The location is a good. The Sofa bed is extremely comfortable,more so then the main bed which is still good. The apartment is fitted out with quality fittings and furniture. The shower is lovely. The kitchen has everything you need.,,,,
There was some confusion with door pin codes when we arrived which meant that someone else was in our apartment. this was sorted out quickly though. There is a LOT of street noise and lights at night coming in. The windows need block out blinds or curtain and there needs to be more pillows when utilizing the sofa bed.,,,,,
The downstairs laundry has a fantastic large washer and dryer. Will left a folder with lots of useful information as to were shops are located. I highly recommend Renders Coffee Cafe on Columbus street. this has the best coffee i have had in the states. Having internet access was great.,,,,,
The apartment we stayed in is #1 on the first floor. I would not recommend these apartments if you have issues with stairs as there are a lot of steep steps.,,,,,
Considering the above,I would highly recommend this apartment. We are a family for 4 with a 9 and 3 year old and we were very comfortable.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
276450,2444900,2012-09-29,3006909,François-Xavier,"Appartement bien sutié, quartier calme, à 5min du métro à pied."

The location is good, especially as our son and his wife live in the South End and we could walk to their home.  Enjoyed the restaurant across the road and breakfast at Flour Cafe for great \"\"goodies\"\" and coffee!"
"Because of the busy street we didn't open our windows at night however the location makes it an ideal place to stay.  \"",,,,,
276450,2647832,2012-10-18,3307228,Chris,"This was a great place to stay for our trip to Boston. Way better than a hotel!  Great location for visiting all the sights.  Easy to get to downtown Boston via the Orange Line Train and great location for exploring the South End.  The kitchen was great and has just about everything you need for most meals.  Just have to bring your own food and spices (we picked up salt and pepper packets from restaurants to use for our breakfast).   The door codes make it so easy and convenient, to not have to worry about keys.  We were in Unit 6 and like everyone has said, it's a bit of a narrow steep hike to get your luggage up there.  It was no big deal for us, as I had read the reviews and knew about it, but just wanted to add it here, just in case that is an issue for someone.   The walk in closet was great and made it easy to organize our clothes and not be tripping over our luggage.  The restaurant across the street has a great beer selection and really good onion rings.   I would definitely stay here again.  Will was great to communicate with and check in/check out was super easy with the door codes."
"P.S.  When we left it looked like they were putting the finishing touches on a Pub just downstairs and next door!  Looks like they will have 30 taps!  Wish it was already open when we stayed there.\"",,,,,
276450,2926202,2012-11-20,3405810,Aylin,Our daughter moved to Boston this year and we had visited her a couple of months ago and stayed at a hotel. our experience was less than satisfactory so with the suggestion of one of my friends we found this apt on airbnb. seeing the excellent reviews of this unit we booked it.
We received all communication in a timely manner and the door codes just as stated 3 or 4 days before our visit.,,,,,
The unit is in excellent condition (actually my daughter was begging us to rent it for her for a long term lol) Very nicely decorated - I know we are not buying it but I did not get the feeling of a hotel room decoration it was almost as if I was in a 'hip' young person's apt staying as a guest. And there was also none of that smell of 'well used laundry'/carpets that some hotels have,,,,,
The kitchen was fully equipped with new appliances the stainless steel was spotless - small dishwasher was cute !  Although the superb quality of restaurants prevented us from eating in. There were even really nice wine glasses.,,,,,
The bathroom is also totally renovated like the rest of the building and tiling is really nice.,,,,,
Orange line is just around the corner takes a couple of minutes to walk up Mass ave.,,,,,
Right across the street is a really nice cafe,if you walk couple of blocks (URL HIDDEN)  with a spectacular brunch. We heard that Metroppolis right across aquitane is owned by the same owner ? so if it is very busy you can hit there.  If you want a friendly diner with excellent waffles/pancakes and service Mike's diner is 1 block down.,,,,
Again within walking distance ( a little further up Mass avenue is a Whole Foods ),,,,,
It was interesting that up the street on Tremont there is this market witha huge selection of wines ! 748 Tremont Street.,,,,,
The architecture of the building is adorable.,,,,,
The only heads up I might need to give would be if you have problems carrying your suitcase up stairs you might need assistance. But this is true of all buildings around there.,,,,,
The city noise might disturb those who are not used to it.. but again this is the price for being in the midst of all happenings ! and since windows were closed it did not bother us that much.,,,,,
If you are very sensitive to light while sleeping and you want to sleep in late bring some eye masks as the adorable roman shades to let in light. I am sensitive but it did not bother me. My mom is super sensitive so she had to wear hers. But we had read that in another review anyways.,,,,,
We did not do laundry but I did check the basement and there were 2 nice front loaders.,,,,,
I am so happy we found this place as we are planning to book there everytime we visit our daughter !,,,,,

276450,3877753,2013-03-24,4893170,Maria,We really enjoyed our stay in Will's appartment. The area is great and communication worked out perfectly well. I would highly recommend this appartment if you're looking for a place to stay in Boston.
276450,4900567,2013-06-01,3346104,Patrick,"Great, modern apartment in the heart of Boston. It was our first time traveling to the city (from Virginia) and I don't think I could have found a better, reasonably priced place to stay. Right by the T stop and surrounded by so many great restaurants. Loved the convenience of not having to get and keep up with a key, but instead getting into the apartment via key codes on the doors. The place was modern and very clean and even has laundry facilities, wireless internet..everything you could need. Will was very professional and accommodating and quick to reply to emails. Definitely recommend Will and this apartment to anyone visiting the Boston area!"
276450,5600591,2013-07-08,5916381,Christian,"Very nice apartment, best for 2. Exactly as described and very good communication with the landlord. Near to the underground."

The space is really small: we were three and bumped on each other often,but the biggest challenge is what to do with your bags. On top of that,two floors by stairs do not help. If you travel lightly,not a problem.,,
Heating was quite good.,,,,,
Blinds could be a bit thicker.,,,,,
The location was very comfortable,mostly to access Prudential. Close to Washington subway station. Challenge: no groceries close by (or at least,"could not find them).\"",,,

276450,13277037,2014-05-24,11564562,Damien,Logement très bien équipé et joliment décoré.
Nous étions 3 personnes et le logement est tout à fait convenable pour ce nombre de personne.,,,,,
L'immeuble est très bien entretenu et le système à code vraiment pratique.,,,,,
Nous étions venus en voiture et nous avons pu la garer dans une rue adjacente (camden street) sans payer(3 jours).,,,,,
A 5 min à pieds du T Orange et au pied de l'immeuble un arrêt de bus (01) menant au MIT.,,,,,
Au pied de l'immeuble,un restaurant : Estelle's,très bon.,,,
Point négatif: le bruit de la circulation. En effet,l'appartement se trouve proche d'un carrefour à feu et est face à une station-service. Mais c'est surtout les ambulances qui sont terribles car l'appart se trouver sur la trajectoire pour l’hôpital qui n’est pas loin... Prenez donc vos boules quies,prenez également un masque pour les yeux occultant car pas de rideaux...,,,

The photos are pretty accurate though parts of the flat are a little worn, it's all very clean though. The location was a pleasant surprise, the walk towards town is great with lots of nice shops/restaurants (we weren't so keen on the walk in the other direction though). The bedroom wall is a bit thin as you can hear the shower next door but we didn't have any problems with noise from outside. We'd happily stay here again for a short break"

Nous étions 4, l'appartement aurait été parfait pour 2 voir 3 mais absolument pas pour 4.

C'est dommage."
276450,22114827,2014-10-30,5601584,Allison,"My stay in this South End unit was satisfactory, but there were no personal touches and virtually no communication whatsoever from the host."
Once my reservation was confirmed,I received a long,formal rental agreement from a third party business,which was full of rules and regulations. This was unexpected and rather cold. Because this document contained the entrance codes,I was able to successfully get inside,but I never heard from the host to see if I was comfortable or was safely checked in.
I'm an independent sort,and don't need to have my hand held,"but this was probably the least like the friendly \"\"my home is your home\"\"  culture I've enjoyed from my many other AirBnB experiences.",,,
To be fair,I didn't need to contact my host regarding anything in the apartment,so I can't say if he would have been responsive.  However,by the hands-off way the transaction was handled,I felt less than motivated to carry out my usual departure routine,which always includes a text to let my host know that I've left their property tidy and safely locked up
If you're simply looking for an alternative to a hotel,in a decent part of Boston,this will fill the bill. But if you enjoy even a little interaction with hosts from around the country,"you will be disappointed at this locale.\"",,

There is no contact with the host,the whole property is secured with codes instead of keys (actually practical) so I can't comment on the interaction with the host.,,,,
This property is fine for two but ABSOLUTELY not for 3 or 4 as advertised. Any more than 2 guests and they will be sleeping on a blow up bed as the couch bed is paper thin.,,,,,

If you were staying a long time lack of storage space would be a problem for more than 2 people, but for a long weekend it was fine. Everything nice and new, and all seemed to work OK. Once I’d worked out that the inflatable part of the sofa bed mattress was hidden in the wardrobe – maybe mention it in the otherwise useful instructions Will? – the sofa bed proved very comfortable. You have to put it away every day as it takes the whole living room, but it was so quick that wasn’t a problem. Only real drawback is that the wifi was pretty iffy, esp on phones. Oddly it worked best just outside the apartment door"

276450,37575370,2015-07-08,14816727,Susan,We stayed 4 nights at this apartment with our family of 4.  The location was great- easy access to the orange line and the bus.  The unit was very clean and as pictured.  Fortunately we had read the reviews and knew to look for the air mattress in the closet to make up the sofa bed.  We had a few minor issues that were resolved by emailing the property manager- we were short one bath towel and needed a light bulb replaced. The unit had a dishwasher but no dishwasher detergent was supplied which was disappointing.  We did not have any success in getting any when we requested it. The outside traffic noise can be quite loud but wasn't a big issue as we were out early each day.  We occasionally heard shower noise from next door.  Overall the unit met our needs for the time we were there.
276450,38826276,2015-07-19,2168080,Michelle,"Two teenager kids were travelled with me.  We found the apartment is very nice and clean. Clear instruction of how to access the apartment was given and the apartment  is exactly like the picture. There is also a menu inside the house about restaurant and supermarket.  Some previous users mentioned about space and noise problem, I believe this is what a downtown apartment can offer.    The location is  quite easy to access T station through which you can walk around most of Boston attraction."
276450,41981143,2015-08-10,35909751,Jacqueline,"We just recently stayed for three nights/4 days. The place was easy to find,email instructions were clear so it was easy to access the place. The condo itself was clean and nicely furnished. The only complaints we have is that it is small for four adults(what saved us is we had a sleeping bag that we used in addition to the air mattress found in the condo),also at night we hear everything in the streets (one night there were lots of ambulances going to the hospital nearby, the next day we bought ear plugs). But overall it was a nice stay. We recommend it."
276450,46578123,2015-09-12,15457727,Ajay,NICE APARTMENT
very centrally located,,,,,
internet was very erratic and only worked well,"when the laptop was taken down to the ground floor level\"",,,,
276450,47464186,2015-09-19,27431995,Kev,Globally it was a good experience.
The appartment was true to the picture. Well equiped and very clean.,,,,,
But you should be aware that the second bed,which is the sofa,is a inflatable bed which is not confy at all. So for four people the appartement is not really suitable.,,,
Also,as already mentionned,there is virtually no noise isolation from the street.,,,
The location was very good.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
276450,48086586,2015-09-23,4703314,Jillian,We had a great time! Definitely perfect for two people.
276450,49920067,2015-10-07,1679775,Will,"Easy access w/ pin-coded front building door and apartment door.  No keys to carry, lose, or be charged for if I lost them.  That is a super smart idea and makes it very convenient.  Neighborhood is quaint and really pretty quiet for being near a major street (Mass Ave).  Apartment is clean and efficient."
276450,50186226,2015-10-10,4947911,Hollie,"Myself and my parents stayed at Apartment 3 at Tremont street. It had everything you needed for a city stay. I took the sofa bed, which was surprisingly comfy (and large enough for 2), the flat would be cosy with 4 people but it was perfect for the 3 of us. The apartment is perfectly located, being only about a 20 minute walk in to the centre of Boston. But it's on a pretty busy street, so it can be noisy at night."
276450,50751936,2015-10-14,27464057,Pierina,"The apartment was as expected, clean and nicely furnished. Everything you need is provided! Our stay was pleasant, though the building has thin walls&windows so it is quite noisy. Bring ear plugs! Wifi is spotty, best in the bedroom. Also, the location is quite far from downtown Boston, but easy to get there using the T. Most convenient if you're looking to visit Cambridge as the bus is at the street corner!"
276450,51033643,2015-10-17,5319091,Bob,"My daughter and I were very impressed with the simplicity and ease of renting your place for our three night stay.  We arrived to find the apartment extremely clean and well prepared for our stay - to include a blow dryer!  It was a bonus to discover an abundance of natural light in the main room and updated, efficient appliances. The size of the apartment was small but the arrangement of the furniture and furnishings made it feel a lot larger.  We loved the location with a cafe across the street, Mass Ave subway stop a short walk away, South end stores and restaurants  and Northeastern college nearby.  The bed was very comfortable for my daughter and I to sleep in but we are rather petite people.  The inside stairs to the apartment were surprisingly steep and took a bit getting use to when managing my luggage.  Overall, we were very grateful to have found your apartment and plan to reserve it again in the future."
276450,52042944,2015-10-26,16965704,Vince,Pictures were very creative. BR & BA are extremely small. The photo of the BA must have been taken from the shower. I have rented dozens of places in US and abroad. I just felt like the ownership didn't really care if the guests had a nice visit.
276450,52840341,2015-11-02,5732947,Momma,"My interaction prior to my trip dates was great. Since Will has a number of short term rentals, when our group got smaller than expected his staff was willing to switch us to a small place that we could better afford. That was above and beyond."
It would have been nice to interact with a live person face-to-face,by phone or internet when we arrived. Will has a number of apartments,and while this wasn't a hotel,it didn't feel all that personal either. For those of us who enjoy meeting people when we use Air B&B,it was disappointing to not be able to.,
The apartment itself was fine---clean and cute and best suited for 2 adults. Four adults was doable but tight.,,,,,
Bed was ok,sleep sofa not so much but we did enjoy our time in a great city.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
276450,55118430,2015-11-28,16598815,Anna,"The unit was clean. It seemed much smaller than the pictures made it look. I never met the host which was different from most other Airbnbs I have stayed at, felt more like a hotel without a concierge in that way. When I phoned the number listed for the manager to inquire about a parking spot, no one returned my call. This was frustrating since the ad mentions that you can reserve and rent a parking spot, something difficult to find in Boston."
276450,58804609,2016-01-05,40421371,Declan,"The location is great and then not so great. It's a great area but you have a 24 hour garage directly across the road and people can be heard shouting at 3am loudly and close behind the apartment there is a methadone clinic two blocks away and it reminds me of the walking dead every time I walk near that area. The apartment itself is great but snug. I'd say it's perfect for two, three at a push. We had issues with the tv and phoned the contact number in the book, no answer and left message and no return so we had no tv channels for our stay. An Irish guy called Sean was great and gave us great points on where to eat and how to get around he works in an office in the basement and was very helpful. Facilities were as advertised and building was well kept."
276450,70846784,2016-04-21,25791822,Fernanda,"Description is accurate. Clean, comfy and convenient 1 BR and everything that is needed during your stay is provided.Easy check in. The bed is very comfortable."
"On the downside the TV selection is not good. So even if you have a TV you wont find anything to look at. Texted and call the manager of the building twice and never return my calls.\"",,,,,
276450,85829171,2016-07-13,7260242,Philip,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7823025,46322472,2015-09-09,4699326,Robert,Fivos had just moved and I was the first guest in the new place.  I stayed for 10 days while on a work assignment. Fivos and the other two guys were very friendly when our schedules did cross. Fivos did a terrific job communicating via text and calls when he was not at the apartment.
"My room was adjacent to the kitchen so if you are a light sleeper and go to bed early staying in this room would not be the best (I crashed at 7:30 one night). \"",,,,,
7823025,47206625,2015-09-16,17774428,Morten Kromann,I stayed for two nights in this very nice and quiet room. I felt very welcomed by Fivos and will definately stay here the next time I visit Boston.
7823025,48627463,2015-09-27,13619710,Allison,Fivos and his brother were very welcoming and timely when meeting us at their apartment. The room was very clean and comfortable.
We had a great time staying in the JP area. Fivos' apartment is really close to a lot of shops,restaurants and bars,which made it great to grab coffee in the morning before heading to the T train. The commute to the T was very easy too.,,,
"I would recommend Fivos and his apartment to everyone!\"",,,,,
7823025,50356653,2015-10-11,7380993,Colleen,"My husband and I had a nice stay at Fivos' apartment. It's the perfect location to explore Boston, and JP has so much to offer. The room was very comfortable, and Fivos was a welcoming host."
7823025,51181747,2015-10-18,21980859,Amy,"Our host, Fivos, was not around on our arrival, although we were aware that Leo would check us in.  Parking is on street wherever a parking space is available.  We were fortunate and found a spot in front of the building. I'm not certain that is always the case.  The neighborhood is lovely and Leo recommended places nearby to have coffee, one of which I would recommend is Cafe Nero."
The room was relatively clean,however,the bathroom had not been cleaned thoroughly.  The bedroom which we stayed in was comfortable,but there was an overpowering plug in deodorizer which I had to unplug.   The room was quite cold,so Leo gave us an extra blanket.,
"Leo was helpful and friendly but despite that I don't think I would return. \"",,,,,
7823025,54163554,2015-11-16,47693660,Ifigeneia,"Both fivos and leo were great hosts! Very welcome and helpful! They made me feel so comfortable! The room was great, big and clean! The location is quite and safe, although before arriving there I was a bit reluctant. The bus and T connections are very convenient."
"Highly recommended for short or long stay!\"",,,,,
7823025,56009494,2015-12-07,3404404,Katerina,Lovely apartment! Stayed there as I needed accommodation for a weekend. Everything was clean and neat and the hosts made me feel like home. Check in was easy and
The neighborhood is full of restaurants,shops and parks,and had close proximity to downtown ( I jumped on bus 39 that stops right outside and got to Back bay in a few minutes).,,,
"I recommend Fivos and his apartment to everyone!\"",,,,,

Highly reccomend,,,,,
"Happy New Year!\"",,,,,
7823025,59799497,2016-01-15,10352845,Amy,"I had a wonderful stay with Fivo and Leo. One of my best airbnb experiences! My previous reservation cancelled last minute, so Fivo accepted my request on short notice. He was flexible with my arrival time. They were super friendly and approachable. Fivo and I got along so well, we struck up a friendship and hung out during my stay.The room and bathroom were clean. Street parking was convenient and free. Lots of restaurants and stores within walking distance. My only caveat is the hot water heater pipes can get loud at night, so if you are a light sleeper, ear plugs may be helpful."
7823025,60300462,2016-01-21,22644595,Geola,The location was very convenient for me and the room was comfortable.
7823025,62474314,2016-02-14,55541416,Cynthia,"Fivos was great! He waited until I arrived to continue with his day to make sure I got in okay. The apartment and room were great- perfect for what I needed! Great location in JP, too."
7823025,64084863,2016-02-29,29633261,Gigi,"Fivos and Leo are terrific ! They are very accommodating, they make sure I have all my needs taken care of, and they really make it a good visit. I like the safety of staying with them. As a single woman traveler, it's nice to be with men that create such a welcoming environment."
The location is GREAT! It's right by downtown Jamaica Plain so shops and restaurants are just a few blocks away,several GORGEOUS parks are also merely a few blocks away,and they are blocks from the bus which can go to the train,though again,that's really walkable too,"so Boston is absurdly easy to get to. \""
7823025,65995824,2016-03-18,35686382,Giet,Fivos and Leo were awesome guys. The apartment is clean and perfect. The room is nice and clean and the bed is very good.

Tenía que llegar tarde y Fivos espero levantado hasta que llegara,"cosa que agradezco muchísimo.\"",,,,
7823025,66815510,2016-03-24,36326384,Bronagh,Fivos was a great host and really welcomed me in. The room was as described and was a good place to stay for a few nights.

7823025,75249978,2016-05-20,71992578,Lauren,Fivos was a great host and very easy to communicate with. The neighborhood is lovely with easy parking and easy access to the T. There are also many shops and restaurants within walking distance.

7823025,75896784,2016-05-23,70860378,Lance,Fivos was hospitable and friendly while still giving me an enormous amount of space and independence.  Great location with reestaurants within walking distance.

I had a single room with a comfortable bed, in the bathroom and kitchen everything was available you need. I'm always had the choice if I would like to have my privacy or to join to everyone which was available to have a talk or drink. Leo was really helpful and a great buddy, thanks to all of you feeling me home. I can absolutely recommend this host."

Fivos and Leo were always checking up on us and helping when we had questions. We will definitely stay with them again next time we go to Boston.
7823025,77635815,2016-06-02,19773494,Liudmyla,"The host Fivos is vey friendly and talkative person. Apartment is clean and beautiful. You will live in comfortable district Jamaica Pound, where you can find a lot of restaurants and shops. you can go by foot to the little lake (pound). We rented a car so road to city center took probably 20-25 minutes. I can highly recommend this place for staying. Thank you, Fivos!"
7823025,78331013,2016-06-06,72852626,Gresisce,"Fivos's apartment is spacious and very clean. The room got enough of sunlight and the bed is very comfortable. It nears to bus stop ( 39 ) around 1-2 min of walk and also Orange Subway station. The kitchen is superb!, there's lots of cooking tools that you can use."
7823025,78378871,2016-06-06,70328309,Roberta,"I absolutely loved this area, it's great. Fiveos gave me advise of where to go for a run, a place to go for dinner solo, and much more! He lent me an umbrella, an adaptor he is the best host! House is lovely and clean, comfortable and quiet."

7823025,81513940,2016-06-23,71187986,Juval,"Accommodations: The room, and the condo itself, were very comfortable, cozy, and clean. I visited in June and the breeze from the windows kept the room nice and cool.  I also liked having access to the kitchen so I could make a quick breakfast before heading out to explore the city. Overall, the place was great!"
Host(s): Fivos was a great host and was very helpful. I also enjoyed chats with his other roommates,all giving great advice about the area.,,,,
Location: It is most definitely in the heart of JP,which was fantastic.  I knew nothing about JP nor about Boston in general and was overwhelmed with how great of a location it was.  It is located on Centre St.,which is the main trunk of JP. It is about a 15 minute walk from two stations on the orange line (which is a great line to easily get to the city center). JP pond and the arboretum are even closer than the station and a slew of restaurants and cafes are just down the street (as well as spotted across JP). The only inconvenient thing was that the closest grocery store (Whole Foods) was a little bit of a distance on foot.,,,
Overall,"I couldn't give this place a higher rating!\"",,,,
7823025,81807212,2016-06-25,48986643,Phillip,Fivos has a great apartment in a lovely neighbourhood that is easily accessible by public transport. We fell in love with the area and wish we could have stayed longer! Fivos was flexible with our check-in time and made himself avaliable to greet us late in the day. This listing provides a great room and very welcoming people with which to stay.

7823025,83840868,2016-07-04,80734654,Leonard,Fivos was a great host! Very hospitable and knowledgeable about the area. His place is gorgeous and well kept; we loved his bathroom. His room was nice too but there was no air conditioning.
7823025,86717246,2016-07-17,82536022,David,"Great place and great location. This was my first AirB&B experience. Place was very clean, and I felt very comfortable. Walking distance to some low key bars and small restaurants. Didn't appear to be a very busy section of town.  I give Fivos a 5/5! I would recommend this location and person."
7823025,87583365,2016-07-20,35473374,Randy,"Fivos was actually out town during my stay, but his roommate was very accommodating. The place is a large apartment and we booked a nice room in a very prime location outside downtown. The walk to the T stop was short and that enabled us to be able to travel all around Boston. I definitely reccomend!"

7823025,89880074,2016-07-30,15897848,Ian,Fivos and Leo were great. I got into town really late and they made checking in really simple. The room was very clean and the apartment and building were nice and quiet. They provided everything I needed for my night. The next time I am in Boston I am going to see if I can stay here again.

The neighboorod was very beautiful and quiet but it  was a little far from the city center but it was Easy to reach it  with the Subway. One drawback though was that There Were

7823025,97186566,2016-08-26,14608094,Tony,"Fivos clearly puts a lot of care into keeping the room clean and attractive. It was also great to have a desk and chair and a strong wifi signal.  It is a nice apartment in a great part of Boston and Fivos was very helpful with welcoming me and showing me around. Because of my schedule,  I didn't stay long enough to use the other resources in the apartment, so can't comment on them. I prefer en suite to a shared bathroom, but apart from that preference I would call back on another swing through Boston."

We mostly stayed out of each other's way, but she was friendly and answered all my questions. The neighborhood was great, and its really close to both a green line and orange line T-stop, as well as a bus that takes you to Cambridge. Fair warning, there are a lot of stairs! This place was perfect for what I needed and made my stay in Boston a great one. I was very comfortable. It isn't super fancy or hotel-like, it is splitting space in a student apartment, so if that fits what your looking for, you won't be disappointed!"
20000,30522,2010-03-21,83929,Alexandra,"A beautiful place and a wonderful host - Amy has given us many good and useful ideas and tips how to get around, discover the city and have just a good time. I felt welcome from the very first moment of my arrival on and would come back any time: it's a very nice room, comfortable and cozy. We all liked staying at Amy's."
20000,45996,2010-05-24,123718,Marie-Claude,"We strongly recommend Amy's home for a stay in Boston.  Amy was very friendly and welcoming.  The room was clean, the bed very comfortable.  The house is located in a peaceful neighbourhood, has free parking and is only a short walk to the subway.  In the morning, we drank fresh coffee on the porch overlooking the bay. Amy even drove us to the subway the first morning to make sure we knew where it was located!  She also gave us wonderful tips on what to do and where to eat. To top it all, she even found factory outlets to go shopping on our way back to Canada.  Thank you Amy for being such a great hostess and making our stay so enjoyable!"
20000,56512,2010-06-23,88847,Susan,"If you're looking for a place in Boston, book with Amy and you won't be sorry. Amy was extremely easy to get in touch with and we had no problems during our stay. Amy's home is beautiful and in a great neighborhood. It's very close to a blue line T stop and the view of the water is a huge plus. The bedroom and private bath were definitely comfortable and clean. We had a fair amount of privacy in her home- more than I really expected since we were just paying for a private room. Amy was very friendly and really welcomed us into her home."
"I hope to back to Boston and will try to stay with Amy again!\"",,,,,
20000,68968,2010-07-25,164498,Aseem,Amy is a great person! We loved staying at her place. Everything was clean and she arranged for breakfast items too. I highly recommend her.
20000,74200,2010-08-05,134501,David,"Amy and Jim are wonderful hosts, very warm and friendly, laid back and generous. I got fresh coffee in the morning and a beer at night, Amy even had some food available throughout the day on a buffet in the kitchen. The house is very well located - just a short walk from the blue T line and close to the airport. One can even watch the city's skyline from the porch. The room is very nice, clean and light with a very comfortable bed and the bathroom next door."
On my last day,Amy gave me a free ride to the bus terminal - thank you very much again! I would not hesitate to recommend a stay with Amy and Jim,"and I hope to return in the future!\"",,,
20000,77358,2010-08-12,168246,Eliane,really really nice place to stay. Everything was clean. Amy was not there but we met her husband and he was really kind. I will definitely go back there! and I recommand it to every one!
20000,80788,2010-08-18,179066,Jim,My wife and I enjoyed our stay with Amy and her husband Jim.  This was the first time we have ever stayed in a bed and breakfast and we felt right at home.  Both Amy and her husband are professionals and fun to talk with.  We  invited them to stay with us in our home if they ever come to California.
20000,83401,2010-08-23,197281,Daniel,It was just wonderful to stay at Amy's house. The whole family made it unforgetable for us!

20000,87857,2010-08-31,125845,Lukas,Amy was a great host and the room was in an wonderful location with a fantastic view on the airport of boston.

20000,89723,2010-09-03,212890,Penny,"I had a lovely stay with Amy, despite fighting a cold and being in the middle of a heatwave.  She was extremely friendly and helpful, even sharing her dinner with me one evening when I didn't have the energy to go out.  She made me feel very much at home, and provided a nice breakfast.  The house is a lovely old Victorian, with a view over Boston harbor, Boston skyline and the airport.  There is some noise from the airport, but I found all the activity really interesting and the noise didn't bother me.  It's convenient to the airport and for getting into Boston, and I used it as a base for driving up the coast to Cape Ann.  There is wireless internet access which worked very well, and there is an office upstairs which was very helpful in printing out my boarding pass.  Amy was very relaxed about my hours, and I stayed in bed most of the day one day because of my cold and felt very comfortable doing so - so no pressure to get up and out of the house.  The bed is very comfortable, the bedroom has a ceiling fan and was comfortable despite 95+F temperatures.  I very much enjoyed my stay, and wouldn't hesitate to return.  Many thanks, Amy!"
20000,91182,2010-09-06,192795,Emily,"This was my first time using airbnb, and I had a great experience. Amy wasn't there, but made sure we had everything we needed. Her home is beautiful and in a great location. I definitely recommend going!"
20000,92214,2010-09-07,171451,Barbara,My partner and I stayed with Amy for one night after a long flight from the UK.  Staying with Amy was a very relaxing and welcoming experience.  Amy was a great host and the room was very comfortable.  Her house overlooks the water with the airport in the distance but there was no disturbance from aircraft at all.
Thanks Amy we will definately recommend you to our friends.,,,,,

20000,97554,2010-09-15,187875,Wibke,"Amy was a wonderful host, it was really like coming home when we first met."
The guest room is neat,our bathroom was completely equiped with towels,shampoo,soap and hairdryer and whatever else you could possibly need.,,
The kitchen including everything in the refrigerator was ours to use whenever we wanted to.,,,,,
The house is situated in a very sympathetic neighbourhood close to the T (blue line) and being close to the airport surprisingly quiet,you see the airplanes rather than hearing them all that much.,,,,
If you can,take your breakfeast on the front porch and enjoy the wonderful view over the bay and the yacht club.,,,,

20000,104218,2010-09-24,235505,Silke,"For those with attention deficit disorder: Loved the place, with the exception of the planes."
Amy is a great host,everything is perfect,including a great selection of cereals for breakfast. The house is very close to the next trolley station,so that you can be in downtown in 15 minutes. It's also a very short drive from the airport,with parking in the back of the house,which was very convenient for me as I had to drive around for business. The airport is also the disadvantage
Will come back when I'm back in Boston,"definitely.\"",,,,

We had a great time. Our room was nice,"Amy is very friendly and easy to talk to. The location is ideal for sightseeing  - only a few stops to the airport or the city center. We would    stay with Amy again when coming to Boston. \"",,,,
20000,120318,2010-10-16,255802,Helen,Amy & Jim were very gracious hosts. Their house has a great outlook over the bay. We found the subway into Boston was close and easy to use. Good value.
20000,121111,2010-10-18,189183,Mandy,We had a great stay with Amy. It was a very relaxed atmosphere and both she and her partner made us very welcome and helped  us out with all sorts of things that made our stay in Boston go really smoothly.Thanks Amy.
20000,123549,2010-10-20,261155,Oslec,Easily my Boston trip has been the highlight of my almost 4 months vacation in both East and West Coast thanks to Amy and Jim. I was never in a hurry each day to leave the house because it felt so comfortable and the view was spectacular. I would even try to go back home early to catch the sunset. Which I even did on my last day so I could take souvenir photos.
The buffet breakfast is indeed available all day! And yes the brewed coffee is from dunkin' donuts! :-) I even had home cooked meals courtesy of the couple and another very friendly chap from Spain renting the other room,who cooked us paella and Spanish omelette. And it was really good considering it was his first time to cook. The home cooked meals though do not come free with the stay and have to be earned according to Amy :-). So be nice!,,,,
The neighborhood is charming,quiet and friendly. I hope you all get to see the nice old Buick near the house that a very friendly neighbor owns. I was told JFK rode that very car way back!,,,,
Yes the airport is near but you will never be bothered by the noise unless you are a vampire who needs to sleep in the day :-). There is a beach nearby and the place is surrounded by 3 yacht clubs. Believe me there are more planes and boats than cars in this area. It is a perfect place for running/jogging if you're one of those coming over for the annual Boston marathon or just simply a fitness buff. Bring a windbreaker though,it can get chilly.,,,,
Amy and Jim would gladly suggest you places and restaurants that most locals rave about. And if you have your thinking cap with you the couple will regale you with the most charming and witty conversations about politics,"culture and desperate housewives :-).     \"",,,,
20000,125955,2010-10-24,259879,Lily,"We had a pleasant stay in Amy and Jim's traditional house with modern touches. The back room we had was very quiet, plenty of closet space, and a comfy bed.  The best part was the views of the bay from the front of the house. This place is a unique corner of East Boston, with an easy walk to the Blueline which brings you into the city. Amy is a friendly and attentive host. She took the time to help with suggestions and directions."

She was able to accommodate my schedule, which I appreciated.  In the midst of this terrible heatwave, the room was cool and comfortable, and looking across the street to the harbor was a treat."
20000,436902,2011-08-11,636672,Charlotte,Amy is really smart and a pleseant host!
The room offers a really big comfortable bed,mirrors and a good bower!,,,,
The room was clean,tidy and made me fell very welcomed.,,,,
Amy offers you a big breakfast with everything you need and on top of that you get a view over the ocean (and the airport- but its not that loud as you may assume!),,,,,

20000,704767,2011-11-08,1368451,Theresa,"While I never saw or met Amy, my host, Jim, was incredibly courteous and informative. They had a nice spread for a light/continental breakfast (cereal, toast, juice, coffee etc.) and when I left a note about finding a little mold on one of the available bread options (it was a very slow time for them) they replaced it the next day with several fresh and interesting options."
My room was clean and well equipped. In fact I slept so well (with years of lower back problems) I am determined to trade in my own mattress at home for something firmer.,,,,,
The location was just a short walk to the T-line,and despite being literally yards across the water from Logan International I hardly noticed the air traffic.,,,,
My favorite feature is the little room in the front of the house where you can sit and stare out over the water. The perfect spot to have some toast in the morning. :),,,,,
I suppose my only complaint would be the very low water pressure in the shower. But it is a really cool,old fashioned set up. So it could be I just didn't have the various knobs figured out.,,,,
I absolutely would have stayed again on my way back through Boston,"but they were all booked up. I will certainly consider staying here if I come this way again.\"",,,,
20000,715107,2011-11-13,1388539,Dan,I had a great visit. The hosue was clean and quiet witha fabulous view of Logan and the Boston skyline from the sunroom in the front of the (URL HIDDEN) was a short walk to the T and only 2 stops from the airport T stop.

It's in front of the airport, which means that it's a bit noisy but also very convenient. It's very close to the  T , restaurants, stores, laundromat and a veterinary."
The house is nice and clean,and Afiyah is very kind. We thought we could use the washer,but they didn't let us,so this is the only weak point,"but for the price you pay is still a great place to stay.\"",

It was a great location for us & a nice place to return to after heading into Boston.  Afiyah & Jim were very helpful, providing Mapquest maps for the next leg of our journey.  It was surprisingly quiet, given the proximity of the airport - especially when you want it quiet ... for sleeping!  The sun porch facing the street & water (& airport) was a great place to sit with a cup of something."

20000,2673383,2012-10-21,3702569,Lily,Afiyah is a very nice host. She stayed up late to greet us even when we arrived late ~1am. Everything looked exactly like how they are in the pictures. The bed was comfy. The breakfast buffet was helpful with many choices. The room and the common areas were clean and tidy. The walk to the T station is ~12min so it might be a problem especially when it's windy and rains (it was raining one night when I got back ~9pm) but the neighborhood seemed safe. Very convenient for late arrivals cuz the house is really close to the airport ($12 cab fare for me at 1am).

Its short walking distance to the T station Orient Heights, 8 min walk. Taxi to airport about 12 USD."

She was accommodating to our busy schedule and worked around us for check-in and check-out times.  She was very welcoming, warm, and happy to help."
The house:  The place is huge and each room has more than enough space for two people to stay.  The common areas (sun room,living room,kitchen) are organized,clean and full of everything you need.  The kitchen was stocked and we were free to use it whenever (essential for early morning coffee drinkers) and it felt like home.  A great place to stay if you want a relaxing evening in Boston.,,
The area:  The neighborhood was quiet and nice with beautiful views.  Sunset and sunrise were amazing.  The airport is right across the bay but it is definitely not noisy.  Free available parking was a huge help!,,,,,

Her place is in a fantastic location, much closer to the city center than it looks on the map! It is a very short trip into downtown and also to the airport. The house is right across the street from the water. The room was excellent, spacious (and this was the smaller room in the back), and the bed was so comfortable. The kitchen was all set with snacks and some breakfast items. The entire place was spotless. There is a really nice large flatscreen in the living room you can use. But the real bonus is sitting in the sunroom looking at the view - boats across the street, the airport, and the Boston skyline. Communication with Afiyah as superb. I had to change our reservation last minute due to a brainfreeze and Afiyah was super understanding and accommodating. Don't worry about the airport, the house has double-glazed windows and you really won't notice the planes. Afiyah recommended a great local restaurant, El Paisa, that serves Colombian and other fare."

It's a nice and safe neighborhood. Afiyah was very friendly. Everything was clean and there was a lot of food available in the kitchen. Good internet connectivity (which is important in my case). Even though it's pretty close to the airport,I didn't have any trouble sleeping and had no noise problems.,,,,
There is currently some construction work going on at the nearby subway station,but there is a very frequent free shuttle bus to the next station,so not a huge problem.,,,
The airline had sent my luggage on the wrong flight,and it only arrived two days after me. Jim was extremely helpful by providing me with a fresh shirt and socks. Thanks Jim,"you saved the day!\"",,,
20000,4818578,2013-05-27,1368289,Noah & Saera,Afiyah is WONDERFUL! We were truly impressed and touched by her hospitality and kindness. The pictures of the rooms/house do not do it justice. The common spaces are wonderfully decorated with art from all over the world. There are comfy leather chairs throughout the home and there is a breakfast table in an enclosed porch area that overlooks the river. The kitchen is also stocked with coffee/tea/snacks/juice.
The bedrooms are spacious and have all the necessities and Afiyah did a great job being in touch with us to make sure we had everything we needed. She even got us a hair dryer! We were traveling with a pet and she went above and beyond to make sure our four legged friend was made to feel at home.,,,,,
"We HIGHLY recommend Afiyah's place. It's a great deal and we will definitely stay here again when in Boston!!!\"",,,,,
20000,4956921,2013-06-03,6580060,Katie,"Great location with easy access to airport.  Afiyah and Jim were very hospitable and kind; plus their dog was very cute.  The windows in the blue room kept the sound from the airplanes out, but with them closed the room got a little warm.  If you don't sleep well without air, book the room with the bookcase as I believe it has a window unit."
20000,5029577,2013-06-08,6466545,Traude,A really great deal in East Boston. Comfortable room in charming house. Easy walk to train station and easy access to airport. Though  airport is right across water it's not noisy except for the occasional sounds of a plane. The hosts make sure you have what you need. I would definitely recommend staying here.
20000,5202056,2013-06-17,6861641,Meena,"Afiyah was awesome and very helpful.  However, I ended staying at a friends house so whatever I write may not be very representative."
20000,5493088,2013-07-02,2302923,Allen,Decided not to stay.
20000,5552000,2013-07-05,6941980,Fanny,"Great place to stay and nice location to see a different Boston : beautiful view on the skyline and the bay, a few minutes from the beach and not too far from downtown (although the nearest subway station is temporarily closed, which adds a shuttle to the journey)."
"Nice breakfast in the morning !\"",,,,,
20000,5634023,2013-07-09,1003356,Seb,"Afiyah is very well organised with easy checkin, checkout and other instructions provided by email. This place is in a nice neighbourhood 5 mins walk to subway and two subway stops to the airport (the nearest subway station (Orient Heights) is undergoing renovation until October 2013 so there is the extra hassle of a shuttle bus - budget an extra 15 minutes for this until October). The room was a good size, clean and quiet as it was at the back of the house."
20000,5686757,2013-07-11,174865,Tracey,"Good place for a quick trip to Boston. Key, wifi code and food were readily available. Close to airport. Clean bathroom."
20000,5892347,2013-07-21,7191119,Lorena,Afiyah is efficient and responsive.
Rooms are spacious and the location is strategic because of the proximity to the airport.,,,,,
"The ratio quality/price is very interesting.\"",,,,,
20000,5968171,2013-07-24,4634531,Cory,"Afiyah and Jim were kind and helpful about local sites, and had a simple but large breakfast selection. The bedroom was very warm without air conditioning, but definitely comfortable after the heat wave passed."
We loved the view of the airport and downtown Boston. You can see airplanes taking off pretty much any time of day or night,and you can sit in the front bay window while watching.,,,,
FYI,even though they have their listing marked as no smoking,Jim is a smoker,so if that bothers you,"you may want to look elsewhere.\"",
20000,6308838,2013-08-07,6888819,Sebastian,It was really nice to stay at the House. Afiyah is very convenient host and she told me about every necessary things to know. I would stay again. Absolutely recommendable. Thank you so much
20000,6438345,2013-08-12,7783408,Kent,Our stay at Afiyah's house was great!  The home is located in a great neighborhood and very close to public transportation.  The room was clean and very comfortable.  It was a very pleasant stay.
20000,6461190,2013-08-13,6899534,Annie,"Staying with Afiyah in Boston worked out fine for us. The room is small, but tidy - the bathroom tiny but completely okay. It was a bit strange that we never met anyone, so didn't really know whether we were alone in the house or not and that the door seemed to be unclosed the whole time. It is not really a non-smoking place which is no big deal because whoever is smoking tries to be very cosiderate about it. We had a really good time in Boston and would recommend Afiyah's place."
20000,6503268,2013-08-14,7451653,Luca,"Everything written or shown about this place is as it is suggested! Had a great time and felt super taken care of! The view and the ambiance of the house were great, the breakfast is generous! I can only recommend this house especially if you would like to stay close to the airport while being close to the subway lines!"
20000,6505459,2013-08-15,5312220,Cheri & Mark,"Good location about $12 by cab from airport. Quiet street, seems like a safe clean neighbourhood. Well stocked breakfast available.Older style house but very clean & the bed was super comfy. Friendly & obliging host, all in all a very pleasant stay and would recommend."
"\"",,,,,
20000,6583706,2013-08-18,6465588,Alessandro,Reception unfriendly and elusive.
We have no more met the guest after check-in,even for a greeting for check-out. Poor breakfast,with nothing to eat; the next morning there was more stuff,but we preferred to go out. Room and shared bathroom were not so clean,and there was someone who was smoking in the house,with no one to rebuke him.
The description of the location is not clear: there are more than one room (at least 3) and just a shared bath.,,,,,
Position,however,"is close to the \"\"T\"\" and the airport","perhaps the only good thing...the room needs better sound insulation for aircraft noise.\"",,
20000,6643722,2013-08-19,3322282,Agnieszka,"House is located in a very nice neighborhood. We went running in the morning to nearby city beach and smell morning ocean breeze. They have very nice porch, coffee in the morning and that splendid view gave me a nice holiday feeling. Perhaps house would benefit from extra isolation for the sound from planes but overall it was great. Communication was very good which is the key. Aliyah is very responsive and very helpful. Also room was very clean :) Next time I am in Boston I will definitely come back."
20000,6702949,2013-08-21,8244171,Crystal,Nice location. Surprising close to public transport. Relaxing and homely. Great access to food. Highly recommended.
20000,7035869,2013-09-04,795464,Zahid,cadre agréable à 2 stations de l'aéroport et 20 minutes de boston bien desservi vous ne manquerez de rien pour le petit déjeuner. Ne vous inquiétez pas si les portes des chambres ne sont pas verrouillées le quartier est sûr et personnellement il ne me manquait rien à la fin du séjour les chambres sont très spacieuses et le salon est immense endroit très reposant et hôte sympathique je recommande vivement cet endroit
20000,7133750,2013-09-08,6664420,Mike,"This is a great place to stay if you are looking for something close to the airport. The views over the water of the airport are stunning, although some might find the idea of being directly on a flight path unnerving. I found it thrilling. This is a funky, late 1800s house with lots of original features and plenty of space. Rooms are comfortable. The shared bath small but adequate. The train is a short walk and very convenient for exploring Boston. Afiyah is a helpful, unobtrusive host who recommended a fabulous, cheap fish place that is a short walk away."
20000,7344642,2013-09-16,8517677,Nikolas,Everything was great except for the bed - the crucial part - mine was way way to soft. I sank about 10 cm into it and woke up with backpain. Another guy told me his was way to hard. So there is definitely room fro some improvement. But seems to be some local issue to Boston as the have this old style very thick mattresses. Later on I stayed in very fancy hotel and had the same issue.
20000,7849705,2013-10-06,7327132,Sergio,"It is a great place to stay, very peaceful and quiet. The room is fine, pretty big indeed. The breakfast is great and Afiyah is very nice. I spent 4 great days. Thanks!!"
20000,7955120,2013-10-09,8658490,Mark,"A nice place to stay! Afiyah is really nice and we had great chat! The bathroom is shared by 3 room, it is actually no big deal. There are sound of plane in the day time, at night it will stop, or I even not feel it! It is about 10 min walk to subway blue line, but need to take a shuttle bus to a nearby station, could take 15 more min for that and get prepared. The neighborhood is safe as I walked around to  southeast direction to see Atlantic Ocean, quit good feeling for such peaceful neighborhood. If anyone need to catch early flight, or having big luggage, here it is a great place to stay, where u can easily enjoy the sea view, under the sunshine."
20000,8042662,2013-10-14,8195811,Ebony,"Pros:  The location is very convenient, just a couple of blocks away from the subway station and close to the airport.  Our bed was very comfortable.  Breakfast and coffee selection was satisfactory, and the price was hard to beat."
Cons:  They have an excitable springer spaniel who apparently likes to sleep on the furniture.  The dog only made a few appearances while we were there but jumped on our bed at one point,and the whole house smelled of dog.  This is not necessarily a con if you like dogs (which we do),but people allergic to and/or afraid of dogs should be warned.  Also,"the bathroom is old and the hot water on the shower faucet was really touchy.\"",,
20000,8323599,2013-10-25,9576485,Ben,"Afiyah was amazing ! Couldn't find anything in Boston because of the World Series as well as all the conference. She had a room posted up for one guest but we informed her of our situation and the fact there were two of us, and within minutes she sent us an offer. Would def come back!! Thank you again"
20000,11607937,2014-04-08,5310722,Boris,"This was actually my first airbnb experience and it was great! Afiyah was so nice and responsive to my every concern. Didint get to meet her but her sister was soooo nice and even walked us to the subway station which is like 10 mins away. House is real nice, the view is awesome, bed was great, never even heard the planes, bathroom is somewhat small but practical and who really cares about it. Breakfast was good, coffee, cereal of a several kinds, wouldve want like more ham and stuff like that haha but maybe thats just me. Afiyah was really awesome and I will always remember her as my first airbnb experience and now I feel really comfortable booking thru it. She gives you a number to get a cab if you ned one, called them and they were there in time. Transportation is really easy and subways up to 3 am now, even better! I did see the dog upstairs but that was my error as the rooms are on the main floor, it was a really cute dog, never heard it bark once. Housr, room, bathroom, towels clean! I felt like I was at a really nice inn! I hope this review gets Afiyah a lot of business she truly deserves it!"
20000,12152513,2014-04-24,5225522,Robbie,"This was our second time staying with Afiyah and Jim, and once again it was a great stay.  I highly recommend this place for anyone looking to spend some time in Boston.  Just can't say enough good things about this place!"
20000,12875246,2014-05-12,3184531,Wyht,Amazing.  Thank you.
20000,12986942,2014-05-16,13027568,Lisa,"I only stayed for 2 nights but I'd have been quite content to stay much longer. The room was perfect, extremely comfy bed and a very generous breakfast available all day! I didn't meet Afiyah but she was quick to reply to any questions I had. It was a pain free 'homestay' in a quiet, and convenient (for the airport and downtown) part of town with a great perspective of the airport. Don't worry, the house is quadruple-glazed so I never noticed any noise! Would highly recommend this cozy and eclectic home. Thanks again to Afiyah and Jim :-)."
20000,13159355,2014-05-20,10156810,Kate,My son Tom stayed here before a flight from Boston.  He said it was nice and comfortable and the hosts were helpful.
20000,13594037,2014-05-31,16101590,David,"I had a great, no-hassle stay! Very close to the airport. Highly recommend."
20000,13986616,2014-06-09,9518048,Tigist,"This is a great place to stay. It's like a hostel in Amsterdam. And the view in the morning. . . I'd definitely stay here again. I didn't meet Afiyah, but Jim was so nice!"

A simple, but great overnight for those with early flights!"
20000,15141227,2014-07-03,2605976,Geneviève,Nous avons beaucoup appréciés notre séjour chez nos hôtes. Leur maison est à quelques minutes de marche du métro de Boston à partir duquel nous avons rapidement eu accès au centre-ville et aux principaux points d'intérêt. Très pratique.
Le lit était très confortable,la chambre agréable,nos hôtes offraient le déjeuner de type continental et les lieux étaient tranquilles. Parfait pour relaxer après une longue journée de marche en ville! Afiyah s'est assurée de notre confort et à été très présente pour répondre à nos questions par courriel.,,,
Seul commentaire constructif,il serait intéressant que les portes des chambres puissent se barrer,quoique nous n'avons pas eu d'ennuis,ni de vols.,,
"Merci Afiyah et Jim!\"",,,,,
20000,15231844,2014-07-05,16595973,Chris,"We did not actually meet Afiyah and Jim because of our flight schedules and sight seeing, but we did communicate with them by phone and e-mail. Our plane was very late getting in--1:30 am--and we were able to just walk in and make ourselves at home because of their good directions. We enjoyed visiting with the other guests. The neighborhood was very nice and we especially enjoyed the view of the bay and sail boats."
20000,15659777,2014-07-13,2869829,Nicolas & Erica,"I had a very nice experience! I arrived late and left early so I did not have the opportunity to meet the hosts, but they were so organized I got along just fine without them! They also had a wonderful kitchen available and the bed was very very comfortable. It was the perfect place to stay before catching a flight!"

20000,16215314,2014-07-23,5918610,Zoe,"Jim & Afiyah are lovely hosts, and their home is conveniently situated near Logan Airport.   The view over the bay is really pretty! Even though it's so close to the airport, the bedroom has soundproof windows and is extremely quiet (as well as comfortable!) The return trip to the airport from their house was about as easy as it gets in Boston!  We highly recommend a stay at Jim & Afiyah's home :)"
20000,16639864,2014-07-30,15324014,Andrei,The place was clean and comfortable. I would recommend it. We saw Afiyah & Jim only once but they seem like great people. Thanks again for having us!

The breakfast was included and with a lot of choice: toasts,cereals,coffee...,,,
We saw the landlords once for 2 minutes and then we never saw them again,but they can be joined by Airbnb.,,,,
8 minutes walking from the T blue line,"20 minutes from downtown. The bed is comfortable and a fan is on the ceiling.\"",,,,
20000,17025975,2014-08-05,8213446,Tyler,Great stay made available by clear directions. I met Afiyah briefly during the stay and she seemed very nice. Overall it was a good experience and I would do it again.
20000,17084743,2014-08-06,3581962,Aude,"My friend and I wanted to spend a day in Boston on our way to Cape Cod, and this place was perfect for a short stay close to the city. The room was very clean and nice, and the house is charming. The only thing is the noise of the close airport, but with the windows closed you almost don't hear it. It is pretty easy to access to Boston, with a 20minutes ride with the metro (which is a few minutes away from Jim & Afiyah's place, in a very quiet neighbourhood). We would definitely recommend this place."
20000,17202747,2014-08-09,15270299,Marie,Pour notre première expérience avec airb&b nous sommes ravies d'avoir été chez Jim et Afiyah . La chambre étais propre tout comme les sanitaire et le lit confortable. Nous avions à notre disposition la cuisine pour les repas (petit déjeuner a disposition ) et également un salon avec vu sur l'eau. La maison est vraiment magnifique et agréable à deux pas du métro . Nous reviendrons sans hésiter chez eux !
20000,17304308,2014-08-10,18744957,Mihai,Everything was very good. I had a room with a towel and Internet access.

20000,17593890,2014-08-14,5761429,Jean-Philippe,"Easy to find, easy to park (in the street), the appartment is well situated at 5 mins of the subway and 15 from downtown. Jim is a good host, with some attentions, especially for breakfast. Finally, the bed was comfortable and clean. Good trip in Boston!"
20000,17724730,2014-08-16,19009437,Chrystin,This was a great place to stay. The hosts had great communication and told us exactly how to get there. It's so easy to get there by the T from the airport. I appreciated the cereal and the super comfy bed immensely. It was safe and the view from the porch was excellent. Great place to stay in Boston.

I have to say the bathroom tub was kinda icky looking but never used it because the owners failed to give us the promised bath towels!  Maybe that was a good thing.  The bed was comfy, the noise deafening windows worked well for low flying airplanes.  Did not avail ourselves of the breakfast, went to local restaurant Donna's on Saratoga Street near train station."

Just as described, pictures are super accurate but the charm of the house and neighborhood is GREAT! Great view of Boston's Downtown and airport, right next to the water. Great seafood only a short walk away. Jim was very welcoming and gave us great ideas for exploring Boston. Definitely a great first experience with airbnb."
20000,18610315,2014-08-28,14125920,Yan,Jim is so nice. And I have a own room   That is very clean. The location is good just minutes way to the beach. But I only stay there one night. Didn't enjoy the beach...
20000,19335020,2014-09-10,20432011,Mark,A very cost-effective way to stay close to the airport without the price of a hotel.  I appreciated the free wireless Internet.  Just a quick trip on the blue line.
20000,19362609,2014-09-11,380799,Nikki,Stayed for just one day as a layover between flights. Accommodation   comfortable and caters for your needs .  A little our of the city but that's not a bad thing. Public transport sorts that out. Would recommend for either shirt or longer stays

Two things to know, which didn't bother me- the house is right across from Logan so you'll here airplanes all day and the bathroom is shared, but kept very clean.  Would stay here again."

20000,20191390,2014-09-25,20080225,Nikolaus,Jim and Afiyath made a good discription to find the house. Nearby airport and subway.
We could get easily in our room as before discribed. Roomy living room and kitchen and a seat with a wonderfull view over the water towards the airport and Boston city. We did not see Afiyath and met Jim only a few seconds at the last day. The private room and the  bathroom could not be locked. The  house was used by three other guests.,,,,,

20000,21621782,2014-10-20,12805852,Gaelle,"Une excellente adresse pour une étape courte (transit après arrivée tardive à l'aéroport). proche du métro (30 minutes de l'aéroport porte à porte), calme (on n'entend pas les avions malgré une vue imprenable sur l'aéroport juste de l'autre côté de la baie), et confortable.  Merci!"
Deux petits bémols: certains des autres hôtes qui trouvent normal de parler à voix haute en prenant leur petit déjeuner à 6h30 am un dimanche (ma chambre était à côté de la cuisine),pas de fermeture sur les chambres,alors que pas mal de va et vient entre les différents hôtes et porte entrée ouverte (pas de problème pour moi,"je ne restais qu'une nuit).\"",,
20000,21714506,2014-10-22,18904397,Carmen,"Todo fue perfecto, la casa es muy bonita incluso más que en las fotos y además muy cómoda, la estación de metro está cerca y es muy fácil movilizarse a todos lados en Boston. No conocimos a Jim personalmente pero fue un buen anfitrión y siempre estuvo atento a ayudarnos con nuestras dudas ya que era nuestra primera vez en Boston. Lo mejor la cama súper cómoda!! Sin duda alguna lo recomendamos! Cuando mi esposo y yo regresemos a visitar Boston no dudaremos en quedarnos con Jim & Afiyah. Excelente experiencia!"
20000,21821910,2014-10-25,112278,John,The experience was pleasant. We never met Afiyah but Jim was very helpful with directions to the public transportation and Taxis. House was comfortable and especially the bed. The room was smaller than I expected but it met our needs.

20000,21963681,2014-10-27,21544416,S,"We stayed very briefly. We picked this place since it is so close to the airport - just 4 miles. Jim gave us a number for the local cab company and it worked out great. It cost us only $15 including tips. That was far cheaper than Uber. The place is a great location, very close to the public transportation. And what a view! You can see the water sitting in their living room and amazingly the windows very so good that you hardly hear the airport noise. Jim was also very helpful in providing a lot of information and how we can get around. Finally, you cannot beat the price."
20000,22143666,2014-10-31,21346656,Johannes,"Das Haus ist sehr stilvoll, das Zimmer ist einfach aber ok. Das Badezimmer entsprach nicht unseren Vorstellungen."
Das Haus ist sehr schön gelegen,mit Sicht auf Downtown,ein wenig laut,da es in der Nähe  des Flughafens liegt.,,
Ideal ist die Nähe zur Subway.,,,,,

20000,22226944,2014-11-02,112278,John,"This was our second time to stay with this host. We booked two separate nites 8 days apart as we were taking a cruise to Bermuda and needed a place near the airport.   It was quiet and served our needs well. I would stay there again if we needed a place near thew airport. The experience was pleasant and Jim was helpful with local  transportation details. A morning help yourself breakfast of  coffee, cereal, peanut butter and jelly and toast was available."
20000,22920933,2014-11-17,13900598,Varun,Nice room with a very comfortable bed. The location is also quite good right in front of the Bay and very close to the airport (just 3 train stations away).  Room would be comfortable even for 2 people. I just spent the night here while catching a connecting flight so not much to add.
20000,23464714,2014-12-01,23805993,Xiaobin,Its so nice of jim.this place is do nice.great cean view.clise to the blue line station.the room was nice and cleam.and nice breakfast.jim is a cool guy who ll help u all ) its all good of this nice place)
20000,25151937,2015-01-07,16743973,Steve,Terrific stay.  Was a cold night but my room was nice and warm.
20000,26030024,2015-02-01,16743973,Steve,Great stay in rough conditions!  Jim was incredibly helpful in digging out spot for me to park in 3' of snow.  I've stayed here 4-5 times and always hospitable.  Location is great - peaceful.
20000,27750232,2015-03-10,5841825,Carolina,"The house is in East bostin, so a bit far from the city center, the train station is 10 min walk. The house is right in front if the ocean! It is so beautifil! Woth a great bow window where you can relax , think, have breakfast...everything is very well organized ans even if I saw Jim only the last day I had everything to have a great continental breakfast and to feel safe. I recomend it both to couples, because it is very romantic, or sinhles. Jim was so nice that he even drove me to the airport because my taxi was late and I was misding my flight. I regret not being able to interact with him more because he seems a great person!his neighbour who came to fix the door handle was really nice too. It is better however to come with a car."
20000,29949578,2015-04-14,30664331,Ferdinent,Definitely coming back again if I happens to be in Boston! Jim & Afiyah was very helpful in providing direction tips. The room was very clean and quite. Can't complain.
20000,30270306,2015-04-19,4201446,Simo,"Although I didn't get a chance to meet with the hosts, I was very satisfied with this place. The view, the cleanliness, the breakfast and all the little details. Jim was prompt and thorough when asked about something. I was the only guest the night I spent here, so it felt like the whole house was mine. Definitely recommend."
20000,30310162,2015-04-20,8992465,Lori,"\"I lucked out with Jim & Afiyah's house. Felt very welcome in their house located literally next to the water.  Unfortunately, I was in and out so quickly; therefore, did not get a chance to meet J/A. Eveything was as described. However J/A description \"\"Temporary Housing Boston\"\" does not do their house justice. Perhaps"
20000,30939551,2015-04-29,4887699,Jacqui,"A terrific location so close to the airport, convenient if you have a car since there is plenty of street parking. The views across the water towards the airport are just stunning but no worries about the airport sounds because once you're inside you can't hear them. The enclosed porch was a lovely space to sit in and enjoy the views. They have installed a keyless entry system so the front door stays locked most of the time. A couple of things of note are that there is a not insignificant toll to go back into the city through the tunnels so you might want to investigate alternate routes, if possible. Also, there are 3 bedrooms that are rented downstairs and no locks on the bedroom doors so you need to be comfortable with a boarding house type situation with a lot of shared space. My first night there there were 4 renters sharing one bathroom.  Other than that, a delightful stay!"

20000,31841082,2015-05-10,15975741,Hanna,The place is as described.  great location if traveling by T. If driving always add 10-15 mins for travel (you'll need it).
The house is great. Love the masks on the wall. Nice view of the bay. I enjoyed seating in the front taking pics of the planes taking off. The front porch was nice to seat and relax,maybe enjoy your morning coffee.,,,,

"la chambre est très correcte  la salle de bains un peu vétuste mais la maison très sympathique par contre je n'ai pas eu l’occasion de rencontrer mes hôtes pendant ses trois jours et je suis un peu déçu car j'aurai aime avoir des renseignements mais je me suis débrouillée et j'en garderai un bon souvenir \"",,,,,

20000,32842013,2015-05-22,32467305,Marilyn,"Jim & Afiyah's was my first Airbnb and I was quite pleased to be at their place. The information and directions they provided were very helpful in getting around. During the two days I spent there i really felt comfortable. The location is close to public transportation  and very accessible to important places such as Logan Airport, downtown Boston and the New England Aquarium.  I enjoyed it."
20000,33415221,2015-05-27,16071838,Greg,"My second stay here.  Arrived late and left early.  Bed, bath and breakfast.  Perfect.  Thanks."
20000,33681778,2015-05-31,31349462,John,Jim and Afiyah have a great house on the waterway in Boston. This was our first experience with Airbnb and we might try it again. We were a little surprised that we needed to share a bathroom with other guests without a lock on the door. The other guests were pleasant and we had some good conversations.
20000,33761240,2015-05-31,23212662,Patrick,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
20000,33841876,2015-06-01,33359015,Saydul,Visited Jims place for one night before heading to New Hampshire.
The communication before hand made it very easy to get to. I got a taxi costing around 15 dollars.,,,,,
"The room was comfortable and clean and peaceful. Jim was lively and he really meant what he said: \"\"make yourself at home\"\".",,,,,
The subway is 5 minute walk from te house and very safe to walk around. I left my bag in the living room to explore orient heights and ended up in aquarium,that's how easy it is to get around.,,,,
"I would recommend this place!\"",,,,,
20000,34327033,2015-06-07,33268979,Elena,Provided description is accurate. It is a perfect place to stay close to airport.

20000,34789596,2015-06-12,13188234,Sebastien,"Logement situé à environ 10 min à pied du métro.pour information la maison se trouve juste en face de la piste de décollage de l'aéroport et malgré les bonnes fenêtres on entend quand même les avions et vibrations. Durant notre séjour nous avons vu que Jim et juste 5 min. Je pense même qu'il n'habite pas la ( les autres chambres sont également en location sur airbnb ou autre). La chambre est de bonne taille mais de style ancien ( je me serai cru chez ma grand mère). Vrai lit mais pour moi très très mou, et la propreté et à revoir ( toile d'araignée, peinture qui s'écaille etc...). La salle de bain est vétuste. Le problème est aussi que la chambre ne ferme pas à clé, sachant que plusieurs personnes loue aussi des chambres c'est moyen pour la sécurité de nos bagages et affaires personnelle ( mais nous n'avons pas eu de problème). Point sympathique il y a tout ce qu'il faut à disposition pour le petit déjeuner."
20000,34924636,2015-06-13,13068753,Jocelyn,Great place to spend the night - very convenient!
20000,35025015,2015-06-14,6758049,Justin,"Very comfortable, very clean, $12-15 cab ride from airport and easy access to the T. The bed was comfortable and the room was surprisingly quiet for how close it is to the airport. The decorations in the house are great and little breakfast was really nice."
20000,35133454,2015-06-15,34296124,Cynda,Excellent location and friendly hosts!
20000,35352244,2015-06-17,35669741,Amber,The house was very conveniently located to the airport and public transportation both to and from the airport. The house was in a cute neighborhood. Jim and Alfya provided a wonderful breakfast. I enjoyed my stay!
20000,35561908,2015-06-20,32467895,Erick Tanujaya,The room that I was assigned to was very nice and clean. It was also very private and it actually made myself feel at home. Afiyah was very friendly and helpful. Literally only minutes to walk to the nearest train station and then only a short train ride to get to downtown Boston. Would definitely recommend others to stay here if they are in Boston for short stays.
20000,36148050,2015-06-25,28314306,Stuart,"I didn't get to meet Jim or Afiyah as my conference schedule was so busy that I was hardly at the house. Having said that, my room was very comfortable and clean and the breakfast and bathroom facilities were top notch. The house is also conveniently located near to Boston Logan airport and quite close to the city center - there is a metro stop about 5 mins walk way. I hope to stay there again the next time I'm in Boston. I would recommend it to anyone."
20000,36436521,2015-06-28,24970271,Barbora,"The directions very clear and accurate. Jim also explained how to get to the airport by the T, public transport which is very close. Everything was prepared and clean."
20000,36934417,2015-07-02,37156305,Fernanda,We had a great time!! So sweet to arrive with a welcome note posted in our room! We never met the host but there was breakfast laid out in the morning and the keyless entry made it so easy since we arrived late!
20000,37604527,2015-07-08,2335317,Perry,"The space was comfortable. Breakfast spread was generous. If you visit in late summer, be aware that there is no A/C. My concern going in was that noise might be a problem being SO close to the airport - it wasn't."
20000,37991770,2015-07-12,3923314,Marco,"Accessible via free shuttle bus, 2 stops with the blue line and 5-10 min walk."
Easy check-in: PIN-code for the door and my name sticking to the door of my room.,,,,,
Jim helped me to get a parcel,it was waiting for me on my desk. Thanks for this.,,,,
Else pretty standard.,,,,,
Direct view over the water to the near airport (quite interesting,"but you have to close the sound-insulating windows at night).\"",,,,
20000,38212055,2015-07-13,32302730,Samarth,"Our stay at Jim and Afiyah's place went well. Although we did not see them much, the room was cozy and had everything ready for us. The sound of the airport and a few barking dogs kept us awake for a bit but was not a problem for most of the night. Location was great!"
20000,38272091,2015-07-14,15395534,Janice,"Afiyah was at the home to meet and welcome us, and show us to the room."
20000,38553521,2015-07-16,37917340,Matt,"The house is very nice. A 5 minute walk to the train station. Very nice kitchen with breakfast amenities laid out. Very easy access in and out of the house. Great location. One caution for summer time visitors - there is no air conditioning, and it can get a little hot. Great experience over all."
20000,39095280,2015-07-20,36732943,Alexandra,We didn't see The hosts but the house was very easy to find and get into. The display of breakfast food in the kitchen was great. The room was a little dated but very cozy and clean.
20000,39169456,2015-07-21,3221686,Philip,"This was a great place to stay. The welcome note made me feel right at home, and wow... Beautiful home with a phenomenal view! I was surprised it was as inexpensive, I would have gladly paid more for it. Will definitely stay again if I come back!"
20000,39302118,2015-07-22,36081545,Ganqi,really helpful hosts! the view and transportation are also fantastic there
20000,39504108,2015-07-24,3923314,Marco,My second short stay in Boston. Everything ok.
20000,39774602,2015-07-26,19091031,Søren,Nice home. But the linens seemed a bit dirty. And beware that when a plane passes over the house it is a bit loud in the house. But value for money is pretty good in the Boston area!
20000,39975763,2015-07-27,6137249,David,"We had very little time in the space, but loved it none the less. The location was perfect for our needs, Jim was gracious and welcoming. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. Access to and around Boston was easy (taxi and Uber), and the waterfront view of Logan and Boston was spectacular. I felt very safe in the surrounding area, too."
20000,40363905,2015-07-30,34149619,David,The room is very easy to find and only 5 minutes to subway(orient heights). Thanks for the traveling information prepared on desk. It is very convenient to tour in Boston using these infos.
20000,40760363,2015-08-02,36054853,Michael,"I stayed overnight in between flights. Even though I arrived late at night, it was no problem to find the house due to the accurate and detailed description Jim and Afijah had sent. It is only a 5 minutes taxi ride from the terminal and therefore very recommendable if you have an early morning connecting flight. The room was clean, air-conditioned and very nice furnished. There were basic breakfast utensils and a fully equipped kitchen. Unfortunately I didn't meet my hosts in person because it was too late when I arrived but communication with them was easy and very reliable. All in all very recommendable!"
20000,41181103,2015-08-04,24491685,Joshua,Was really cool didn't see them but the bed was really soft. Slept like a baby
20000,41258787,2015-08-05,12679726,Kris,"It's a great location in a nice neighborhood right at the water with an amazing view of the city. Our hosts communicated very well, explaining every detail of our stay and offering nearby dining suggestions. Unfortunately, our stay simply didn't match the experiences described by the other reviewers. The room was very small and not clean. The bed was like mush, absolutely no support. There were, what appeared to be blood stains on our bed sheets. The room was hot and smelled like dust and the ceiling fan didn't work. The bathroom was filthy. The shower had hairs and mildew and general filth from top to bottom. A dirty toilet brush and plunger were lying on the floor in a pile of cleaning supplies next to the toilet. The breakfast was a jar of peanut butter and jelly and some bread and cereal left on the table over night. Plus, you're expected to clean your own dishes."
The house has tons of potential,it just seems neglected. And I think it's a bit misleading to call it a Bed & Breakfast. It might be more accurately described as an expensive hostel.,,,,
"We definitely can't recommend this location especially for $90. \"",,,,,
20000,42445931,2015-08-13,39539874,Sean,"I met Jim when I arrived. He was very kind and incredibly welcoming. He gave me a quick tour and showed me to my room. The house is beautiful and has a great view, with the exception of the airport. I only spent one night there, but its accessibility to the L made it very easy to get downtown and back as well as getting to the airport."
20000,42628002,2015-08-14,18420264,Caroline,"The location is unbeatable, very close to the airport. The room is well-decorated. The host is very welcoming."
20000,42804860,2015-08-15,25004548,Abdulaziz,The place is perfect.. Near to the T.Station and got nice view plus a very nice host.. I would ofcourse recommend it..
20000,43079545,2015-08-17,25751102,Gina,"This was a great place to stay--a beautiful house, nice clean rooms, and free breakfast. It was a great location with a nice view and close to the train station. I would definitely stay here again if I return to Boston. Thanks, Jim and Afiyah!"
20000,43250207,2015-08-18,3437684,Loren,House was perfect for an overnight stay for an early morning trip to the airport. It was clean and accommodating.
20000,43968443,2015-08-23,5904745,D.D.,When  we arrived the house  was locked  and  we  had  difficulty with the  combo  provided by the hosts which  were not  there.  Another  guest  was inside and let us in.  He  said he had  been there  3 days and had not seen  anyone.
We  must have  been  fortunate  because  after  being there  for  a  couple of hours and  finding out  we  had  to share  a bathroom with a deplorable looking tub and  bathroom that was littered with old  shampoo  bottles etc with 2  other guests,jim  stopped by.,,,,
This  was  fortunate because it gave me an opportunity to tell him  we would  be checking out  in the morning,"2 days early. His  reply was \"\"ok\"\"  . I  had  expected to  get  some  money back in  accordance  with  their moderate  cancellation policy but have not heard any thing  from the hosts.",,,,
"This  was very upsetting to us as I was in Boston  for medical  reasons and  a move was  very inconvenient.\"",,,,,
20000,44355514,2015-08-25,39297361,Nate,"Getting to the house was quite simple and the key entry lock makes coming and going great. We arrived and there was a note on our door welcoming us. The kitchen was set with breakfast items (cereal, coffee, etc.). My Dad and I used it mostly for sleep as we were on the go quite a bit, so I would recommend the place. It's a PERFECT location if you're looking for an easy place to stay before leaving town since it's such a simple walk/subway ride to Logan. The only downside would be the 'beep' of the door any time would come in the home, and the bathroom was a bit sketchy. Other than that, it was a fantastic stay!"
20000,44595311,2015-08-27,41830135,Debraj,"I would definitely recommend this place given how close it is to the airport and its low price. Additionally, the impressionist paintings in my room were a nice touch."
The owners sent me elaborate directions on how to get here. An Uber from the airport cost me a total of $16 (airport surcharge is $8.75),and my trip back to the airport at 7 in the morning was $19. One of the drivers at the airport said the airport taxi charges around $35 for the same trip. You can also take the metro or bus if you don't have much luggage and want to spend less on travel.,,,,
The only problem I had was with the bathroom door,which is hard to open and has no lock. You need to knock to make sure no one's using the restroom before walking in. The bathtub also looked a little dirty. However,considering price and distance,this is not a dealbreaker and I would be down to staying here again.,,

20000,45141544,2015-08-31,28171038,Michel,"I really liked to stay at Jims/Afiyahs house as it is located close to the blue line subway-station, which gets you into the city center in 10 minutes. When windows were we could hear the planes at night."
20000,45509488,2015-09-03,36899185,Scott,"Perfect for a short layover in Boston.  It's a great old house near the airport, beautifully furnished and decorated, with quality antique furniture and a really, really comfortable bed.  The hosts have a continental breakfast set up in the kitchen, which is a plus.  Very responsive host; I had a small maintenance problem and Jim was right over to fix it.  Some air traffic noise but not too bad."

20000,46648938,2015-09-12,42924658,Avadhani,Stayed here for one night. Couldn't have asked for a better stay because all we needed was a place to crash for the night and this was the first time we were using Airbnb.
Everything was clean and neat. Towels were provided and the access was easy with out restrictions on time. They even made arrangements for light breakfast.,,,,,
We had friends in Boston who dropped us off and they were kind of wary because they were never in this part of the city(East Boston). That was until they saw the view of the Boston skyline from there,"which is simply amazing.\"",,,,
20000,46776318,2015-09-13,42411172,Lora,"Great first time experience! The room was super cute, bed was very comfy. The house was quiet, welcoming, and clean. Great view from the front, hot coffee and quick breakfast food... Everything I needed! I'll be checking back in here in the future!"
20000,47281591,2015-09-17,12244194,Markus,"Es war alles ok. Die Sauberkeit, insbesondere im Bad muss besser sein. Für mein Gefühl entspricht die Leistung nicht dem Preis. Aber vielleicht muss das in Boston so teuer sein."
20000,47426102,2015-09-18,827307,Linda,"Very friendly hosts + since the house entry is based on a numberpad, its very convenient to come and go. Host was very accomidating, even when I had to call him at 2am."
A simple room,with a small breakfast,"and a gorgeous view of the river.\"",,,

20000,47962088,2015-09-22,33646009,Kim,"We never saw the hosts.  At first it was okay, but then when we were back in our room, the front door opened and closed a few times.  We went out to say hello, but no one was there.  Some where along the line we realized that other guests stay in the home as well.  So we don't know if the person who came in and left was a guest or the owners.  We never saw anyone else.  But someone did come in.  You do share the bathroom which has no lock.  The bedroom did not have a lock.  We didn't feel very safe.  The bedroom was very nice, the bathroom tub was disgusting with mold and overall uncleanliness.  What we liked:  The airport across the waterway.  Really enjoyed watching the planes come and go.  Enjoyed the breakfast and coffee.  It was enough to get you going."
20000,48524807,2015-09-27,39534112,Jim And Jill,Wrote a review on this stay already.
20000,48706046,2015-09-28,39335505,Li,"The location is great, 2 stops from airport by subway. The neighborhood is safe, with restaurants and supermarket. I actually didn't meet Jim&Afiyah personally, but they are very kindness to leave welcome message and some foods for breakfast. 2 things are not so perfect, 1) the wifi is not stable; 2) the cover of bedsheets is not so clean. Anyway, it's a good place to stay if you need catch early flight."
20000,48886333,2015-09-29,34609762,Nancy,We were greeted & shown around although we arrived quite late.
20000,49071983,2015-09-30,36481942,Robin Lynne,"A great place for a stopover in between flights. Cozy, clean, and convenient. Delightful and roomy."
20000,49149181,2015-10-01,13167284,Robert,Jim and Afiyah  took care of me on a last minute request. Rooms always ready and clean. I have stayed with them numerous times. the house has a comfortable sitting room and the supply breakfast.
"I stay here coming and going from Boston as it's very close to the airport.  \"",,,,,
20000,49205073,2015-10-02,27105599,Yvonne,Superb location with plenty of restaurants and ammenities close at hand. Boston skyline was a beautiful sight at night. However accomodation  facilities had room for improvement. Jim greeted us about half an hour after we arrived and was helpful. He had been upstairs in the house and with 2 other guests appearing randomly it was not very relaxing not knowing who was coming and going. Especially with the bathroom  facilities having no lock. There were also no locks on the bedrooms. Fortunately the other guests were very nice but you had to rely on a lot of trust as your possessions were not secure.
20000,49365867,2015-10-03,5578499,Jo,Afiyah was very kind and referred a restaurant to me which turned out to be just what I wanted.  The location was great for my visit there even though it was very brief.
20000,49603678,2015-10-05,39090701,Michael,"My wife and I were happy with the location and its convenience to the Boston area, but what we were not the least bit happy about was the condition of the room, bathroom, and the security of the inner building.   Not only did it appear as if the floor had not been swept clean in quite some time, but we found an old pair of women's hosiery below the window.  The bathroom was dirty enough that it had to be cleaned before we would consider using it, and not having clean towels after the first day was concerning.  The bedroom and bathroom did not have locks and my wife commented that had she been there without me, she would have immediately left, especially because of not being able to feel secure while bathing with total strangers no more than three feet away.  We would ask that the owner's consider these complaints so that future tenants don't have to be concerned about similar issues.  We stayed at two other AirBnb's on our vacation and did not experience these issues at all."
20000,50118966,2015-10-09,44990298,晓明,"It is a good experience staying in the hOuse. The host is very nice to help me in that two days. In the beginning, the host also gave me detail instruction to how to get to the house. It is very considerable. The view in front of the house is very fantasy which make us crazing. In a word, it is a right decision to choose this house. Thank you !"
20000,50165384,2015-10-10,26821074,Don,"I selected this place because I needed a place to stay overnight while I waited for a connecting flight to the West Coast.  My email to the hosts about arriving late and leaving before daylight were immediately and graciously answered.  They sent me very specific directions by email and were always available by phone.  Upon my arrival, Afiyah made me feel welcome and comfortable.  It was in expensive and met my needs exactly.  I must say that I wouldn't select it as a vacation spot because it is located at the flight approach to the airport, which can make sleeping difficult.  The house is old, which means you can hear other residents opening and closing their doors.  The room was clean and the communal bathroom was mostly clean - except the shower was gross (I think the tub has outlived its lifespan).  If you need an inexpensive (hard to find in Boston) clean, comfortable and safe place to crash for the night, this is it."
20000,50665293,2015-10-13,44261395,Sarah,"Very quiet neighborhood and close to the subway station. The house is located beside the river, it is very comforting to take a walk along. The bedroom and restroom is neat."

20000,50989398,2015-10-16,46308771,Lewie,Excellent stay. Good place to catch an early flight in Logan.
20000,51097184,2015-10-17,46540178,Ed,Our very short stay was very pleasant and we would return in a heartbeat. We were right across the bay from the airport and the view of the Boston skyline from their home's front porch was awesome!
We never met Jim,but Afiyah was very friendly and helpful. She gave us recommendations of where to eat and wound up having an awesome dinner at Belle Isle Seafood - which was a 10 minute walk from their home.,,,,
The home had a warm feel to it and our room was clean,bed was comfortable. There was cereal and coffee available for the guests as well.,,,,
Thank you Jim and Afiyah - we will definitely stay at our wonderful home again when we come back to Boston.,,,,,

20000,51596427,2015-10-21,6260626,Evan,"The host was available and easy to communicate with the app prior to arrival, and responded immediately when we were in the space and needed help. The house is very old and everything that comes with an old house comes with this one, but it was comfortable and exactly what we needed."
20000,51705253,2015-10-24,38918683,Nicole,"The location was perfect, very close to the airport and in a nice neighborhood.  The complementary breakfast was very nice. The bathroom situation was not the best. Had to share with a lot of other guests. The room itself was not very clean there were spiderwebs everywhere and when we drew back the sheets there was hair in the bed. I'm a bit of a clean freak so I probably would not stay here again."
20000,52387150,2015-10-28,3271577,Cliff,Clear check-in instructions. Comfortable room. Affordable accommodations. Highly recommended for those looking for convenient bed to lay their heads close to airport and with a phenomenal sunrise view of the city.

"Thanks!!\"",,,,,
20000,52553342,2015-10-30,15975158,Kay,"There was a little post-it on the bedroom door that said welcome, which was sweet. Two nice clean towels folded, the bed was nicely made and the room was clean. I was there only a few hours because I arrived late and left the next morning, but the room was quiet and dark which was nice for a good night sleep. There was also cereal and freshly brewed coffee in the morning, but I woke up just in time to get ready to head out so didn't enjoy that."
20000,53723548,2015-11-11,48197291,Kadiatou,"My hosts gave very clear instructions on how to get into the house, where my room was, and everything else that was available to me (towels, use of the kitchen, etc.). The instructions were so clear that I walked right into my room (which also had a sticky note saying welcome). That was most useful as I got in right in the middle of the day when everyone is at work."

The place was very comfortable and it felt very much like a home. They also left out cereals,bread/jelly/peanut butter,"and coffee for use if we wanted. We had a great stay here and it was a short walk to the Blue Line so we were able to easily get in and out of the city to explore!\"",,,
20000,65460826,2016-03-13,59479930,Cathy,The home was beautiful and very easy to get to.  The metro was very close and the airport was only two stops away.

20000,65916475,2016-03-18,10645953,Orry,The photos describe the room exactly as it is plus the property has a very nice living room looking out to the water and the house has traditional bostonian design i suppose. It made me feel very welcome. Within walking distance there is a place called Belle Seafood make sure you go eat something there !!!

This was a really cool place to stay in! Right on the water and across the way from the airport. The sunset in the evening and being able to see the planes come in was so cool! If you want to see a great sight stay here!,,,,,

Very busy Jim. Very agréable and clever conversations with Afiyah. The house is superbe and very confortable with view over the water. Little bémol',"the fact that we can't use the stove reduced possibilities.\"",,,,

20000,73946085,2016-05-11,31883971,Jacki,Jim & Afiya's house was the perfect place for us for our two nights in Boston. We were sorry not to meet our hosts but everything was exactly as described and we loved checking out the seafood shack they suggested for us. Would definately stay again if we were to return.

Couldn't find makings for cup of tea, an essential for English people... Some written instructions for coffee  maker would be helpful  didn't really know what to do  and didn't want to risk breaking it. Bed very comfy,  a lock on bathroom door would be nice.  Otherwise all good."
20000,77919308,2016-06-04,20228856,Rhys,Great location adjacent to Logan airport so a brilliant choice for an overnight stay. Lovely waterfront views and kind helpful hosts. Happy to stay again.
20000,78167670,2016-06-05,63650527,Corey,"\"On June 4, 2016 we stayed at the Airbnb for Jim and Afiyah, in Boston, Massachusetts.  The house was close to the airport and it was on a relatively quiet city street.  The windows were sound proved so the noise from the airport traffic was not noticed.  Afiyah greeted us and showed us our room. Our accommodation was a single bedroom, adequate in size and we shared a bathroom which was a drawback for us. Because of the many occupants in the house, we were not sure who shared the bathroom another drawback for us.  There were no locks on our bedroom door or on the bathroom door, in fact the make shift bathroom door was a bifold closet type which made it difficult to feel safe  when in use.  The house itself appeared to have escaped maintenance for some time and seemed too much for them to handle, as evidenced by the ill kept back yard.  The broken closer on the front door, stuck out 12\"\" across the threshold causing a dangerous situation.  The biggest concern of all was the dirty bathroom tub.  The filthy tub hadn't been cleaned for a substantial amount of time as noted by the bathtub ring."
"I would be reluctant to return.\"",,,,,
20000,78639527,2016-06-08,72406007,Kim,"Descriptions were accurate...sorta.  You do look over the beautiful water and at Boston, however, the airport is also there.  Which for a positive view on it, many people park in front of the house to watch the planes land and depart.  The noise isn't bad in the back of the house."
20000,79267509,2016-06-12,28130140,Ken,"Enjoyed my stay. The house is in a beautiful neighborhood with views of the airport and city. A few restaurants are within walking distance. The hosts were extremely helpful with directions to the house. It's a little pricey but, in Boston, I guess everything is."
20000,79847472,2016-06-14,23273008,Shelly,"Alfiyah was awesome, one of the best hosts we have experienced."
The place has an incredible bay view and is extremely convenient to the airport.  You can take a short cab ride,or the Blue Line train to airport,and it is very convenient to all of Boston.,,,

20000,82410798,2016-06-27,27079057,Courtney,"Found this on a short notice because we needed to stay near the airport for our last night in Boston. Would have loved to stay longer, very nice setup and the kitchen with breakfast was a nice surprise (although we didn't have time). Would reccomend! Easy in and out access with parking."
20000,83788172,2016-07-04,16435927,Nathaniel,"Great location, with wonderful view across to airport and downtown Boston. Jim was really responsive and helpful in giving advice. Wish we'd had more time to explore the area."

The whole appartement is nice because of the beautiful furnitures, architecture, interieurs and the nice view over the bay to the airport and Boston skyline. The kitchen can be used and there were always bread, cereals, milk and coffee for an energetic start in the day. We saw Jim just short and Afiyah, too, because they have their own appartement in the upper floor, but if we would have had any questions, we could have ask them via call or personal."
Their dog is really relaxed,but you won't see him often.,,,,
The other mates of our appartement were quiet and not often seen people...same with us. There is lots to do in Boston. ;-),,,,,
It is easy to get to the appartement via T train (blue line) and you will be fast at the airport,beach,city center or any other place in and around Boston.,,,

20000,86719816,2016-07-17,14441055,Kyle,Did not actually meet Jim & Afiyah but communication with them was very good. Wifi was pretty slow & the house didn't have much air flow which made it kind of stuffy inside but other than that it was clean & easily accessible to airport!
20000,89343912,2016-07-28,20102,Ryan,"My buddy and I were in town for a day for a Red Sox game. We just needed a place to drop our things and to get a few hours of sleep before flying out the next day. Our hosts responded quickly to our messages, room was ready at check in, and easy to get in and out of. It was also close to a subway line. It was exactly what we needed. Easy with no hassle. Thank you guys!"
20000,89452351,2016-07-28,3967453,Paul,"Excellent communication from the host. Location was ideal for my purposes (close to Logan Airport, close to Orient Heights MBTA station). The accommodation was OK for me, a single male, but the lack of a lock on both the bathroom and the bedroom door, and other bedrooms sharing the bathroom might be a problem for a female guest."
I stayed there on a VERY hot night,room seemed stuffy and close on arrival,but the good ceiling fan and two windows on adjacent walls provided adequate ventilation. and I had no trouble sleeping.,,,
The large common kitchen was well stocked with K-cup coffee,cereals,bread,peanut butter and jelly,so that a sick continental breakfast could be put together.,
Easy parking on the street right in front of the house.  All in all,a good value,and I would stay there again on a solo trip,"but not with my more demanding wife.\"",,
20000,90111775,2016-07-31,81656824,Frank,"This home is located by the water on a Boston harbor road. Although this is an older home, it has its charm. We did not see much of our host, however, they provided us with clear instructions for accessing the home, the paper and breakfast every morning. Do consider when booking this home there are other guests staying there who share common spaces with you. If noise will be a deal breaker there is Boston airport located near the home. Still an ideal location for seeing Boston, not more than 15 mins from many popular locations and restaurants."
20000,91427463,2016-08-05,27019331,Kevin,Great experience in bnb for 3 nights. Airport nearby can  for noisy mornings if windows open.  Jim met me early in my stay and was very welcoming and conversational. My dog got to meet his dog and they got along. This was my first experience with Airbnb and this host is a credit  to Airbnb's network. I will repeat next time I'm in Boston. Thank you.

Jim & Afiyah supplied us plentiful items for breakfast. We enjoyed it siting in the sofa and looking out of the window, where is the sea. It is very near to the subway and airport. We will choose it in our future trip."

To start your day,coffee,cereal and toast are available in the kichen,"or for \"\"snack\"\" as sweet Afiyah stated.",,
Clean and clear sidewalks except for the occasional car jutting out,where most everyone initiates or returns greetings,makes this neighborhood great for walking.  The home is not far from MBTA for carless transport into the heart of Boston. Other small businesses are close,as well as a CVS.,,
Across the channel is the Boston Logan airport. I stated to friends on a call,that the planes coming and going are rhythmic and surprisingly relaxing like the ocean waves.,,,,

We felt safe and our bed was comfortable but the pillows were awful and we were very glad to have brought our own pillows with us.  Although this is a beautiful home it could use a lot of TLC. Nothing a coat of paint and some simple upgrades or touches couldn't solve but we will likely find another place when we return to Boston.  This property provides the basic necessities but nothing more.

We felt right at home!  We visited the local grocery store when we first arrived, and stocked up on food.  We made delicious breakfasts each morning (and used the wonderful coffee pot at the home),  We prepared sandwiches for afternoon adventures, and had a dinner at the home also.  The communication prior to the trip was wonderful and our time spent at this nice home couldn't have been better.  We appreciate being able to stay in a nice home, it was a great way to explore Boston.  A tip... if you do have a car, park near the central T station and take the train inbound.  Better not to add an extra car to a busy downtown.  Thanks Jack!"

To the downtown drive about 20-30mins, route 93 was a little busy. The best thing is the large kitchen to cook as our taste. My boy has lots of fun playing with the cutting tool."
2529318,21737005,2014-10-23,774318,Jennifer And Brian,"We loved the place - conveniently close to the trolley station, very easy access to the airport , relaxing , close to the grocery stores, whole house is very comfortable. We spent 4 days there using public transportation to get into Boston everyday . We would look forward to getting in at night and sitting down and eating a home cooked meal and then playing cards in the living room . The house is very clean, tastefully decorated and walls full of artwork ."

2529318,32982252,2015-05-24,26648846,Christina,"Although we did not meet Jack, he contacted me very early on to communicate arrival details. Finding the house was easy. Upon arriving, we were pleased to find a binder full of useful information about the neighborhood and about touring Boston. He even provided some CharlieCards for us to get to the closest T station (since you can't purchase tickets at the trolley station)."
Their home is very neatly and artistically organized. We loved the artworks in the house. We found everything we needed in the house,including condiments and utensils in the kitchen.,,,,

2529318,41207173,2015-08-05,34141283,Melissa,"Jack was amazing at keeping us in the loop prior to arriving; this was amazing as we had never used Airbnb before.  The house was just as described... beautiful full kitchen, very comfortable living room and easy to feel right at home.  The neighbourhood is outside of Boston which we loved because we got to see different communities and we got to learn the transit system and have a more involbed experience."
2529318,42111688,2015-08-11,26297454,Carole,"Très jolie maison dans un quartier calme. Belles chambres, intérieur de charme. Très bien équipé. Pour se rendre rapidement au centre de Boston mieux vaut se rendre á Ashmont (5mn en voiture) pour prendre le métro. Sinon á 10mn á pied il y a un petit train qui vous y emmène. Nous recommandons le logement de Jack"

Nous avons été surpris de trouver un sol poussiéreux ainsi qu'une gazinière non nettoyée et un tapis de salle de bain déjà utilisé. Je suspecte un problème de ménage entre deux réservations airbnb (et un aspirateur que nous n'avons d'ailleurs pas su faire fonctionner).,,,,,
"Outre ce désagrément nous avons passé un très agréable séjour dans cet appartement !  \"",,,,,
2529318,87118041,2016-07-18,10788376,Jennifer,"Jack's home is well appointed and charming. The place views even better than the photos. There is beautiful art work all throughout the house, a koi pond in the backyard and a hedge of hydrangeas that run along the side of the house. There is plenty of room and even a sofa bed couch on the first floor. Although his home is a few blocks away from the trolly and T system, plan 40-60 minutes for getting into Boston proper."

The kitchen was especially impressive as was the master bed -- super cozy! The artwork and books all over the house made it feel especially like a home-away-from-home.,,,,,
"The neighborhood was great. I'm not going to lie. I was worried about \"\"Mattapan\"\" but it was just as Jack described it: family-friendly",diverse,safe,and convenient. I arrived home many nights past 11pm alone with my young son and never felt anything but safe. We loved being on the edge of the city (near everything!) and the suburbs (near the family we were visiting.),,

Hilary provided me with a lot of maps and recommendations on what to see and do in Boston, which made my trip much more fruitful. Her house looked exactly like the photos, and had a cosy, artsy feel. Though the bedroom was towards the small side, the bed was extremely comfortable and I probably had my best sleep in weeks sleeping on it! The location of her house was a 5 min walk from the nearest T, and the neighbourhood of Jamaica Plain had its fair share of attractions and restaurants."

The reviews are true, the room is pretty small. However Hilary and Hazel are so welcoming that it doesn't matter. You are free to use the rest of the house and make yourself at home. Which we did, and even enjoyed an evening with them both watching the presidential debate."

We were running about all weekend due to wedding plans but we would have loved to hang around and talk with them a bit longer! Hilary's directions and recommendations were very helpful as well!  The proximity of the home to the T and buses made it a perfect location in a quaint and artsy little town. Overall it was a wonderful experience our first time doing AirBnB and we definitely would stay with Hilary again when traveling to the Boston area if she would have us!"

447826,3195949,2012-12-31,2760369,Rain,"Hilary is a very thoughtful host. As her family was away for the first three days, she left me a information pack, including welcome note, local maps, sightseeing recommendations and menus for surrounding restaurants. Her house is very clean, homey and artistic. The location is ideal for me - within 12 minutes work to the Orange T-Line, that can connects to the Hay-market and China town without transferring. The 39 bus stop is one block away that can take me to the Museum of Fine Arts and other downtown place. Good value for the price. Highly recommended."
447826,3258143,2013-01-03,141648,Silvia,"I had the most wonderful three days at Hilary's. Hilary accepted my last-minute reservation right away, and gave me clear directions to her house."
I chose this place because she seemed so nice and interesting from the webpage,and also because,as other reviewers said,the house in in a great location. Both turned out to be very true! I had a wonderful evening talking with Hilary (she invited me to join her for some chili - yum) about her art,her work,her renovations on the house.. what a treat to get to know her. And on the last night of my stay she and her lovely (and smart

We were in town for job interviews and a conference at the Hynes, and it was so nice to have a quiet, warm, and friendly place to retire to at the end of each day. As we were trudging around the city in the cold, I kept envisioning our cozy little room and wanting to go back to it asap, it was so inviting! I had never done the \"\"private room\"\" option on airbnb before"
447826,3554664,2013-02-16,511307,Elin,"Hilary, Hazel and Aggie are lovely! Hilary accepted my last-minute reservation, was very welcoming, and made me feel right at home. The house is awesome, located in a fun neighborhood near T, restaurants, groceries, shops, and Jamaica Pond. I highly recommend her sweet house and without a doubt stay there again."

447826,3736153,2013-03-10,1160814,Aimee,"Warm, eager hosts.  Efficient location.  Beautiful home.  We could not have asked for more out of our Air BnB experience.  Despite the 48 hours of snowfall we could not help but feel warm and cozy the length of our stay on Spring Park.  A 10 minute walk to main bus lines, equal distance to commuter rail, large walkable neighborhood with ample dinning options, including local produce which came in handy when cooking healthy breakfasts in the well stocked, large, inviting kitchen."
Hilary was a wealth of information,maps at the ready,excited to share all that Boston has to offer.  Her daughter Hazel is intelligent and engaging,equally gracious in sharing the tight quarters.  Their dog Aggie,quiet and a magnet for attention.  Our stay coincided with the celebration of a 30th birthday and I awoke that morning to a handmade birthday flag planted in produce,a delicious grapefruit.  If that doesn't sum up the host aspect of the stay
447826,3860177,2013-03-22,2050188,Doris,"Hilary and Hazel were simply wonderful, it was like living with you family and coming home to a place you had known forever. They made my stay in Boston unforgettable. The location is the most convenient, pretty neighbourhood, lots of good places to eat and drink near, the pond for some walks in the green. It simply could not have been better. Thank you both for this period."
447826,3886335,2013-03-25,926911,Sara & Jeff,"We had a lovely stay with Hilary, Hazel & Aggie the dog. Hilary and Hazel were both sweet and Hilary had a collection of travel guides and info for us to pursue, which was super helpful! Their home is situation in a lovely area of Boston, Jamaica Plains. The T-station was only a few minutes walk away and took us straight into downtown Boston in about 25-30 minutes. We were so glad to be able to spend the day in the city but then come back to this cute little neighborhood that had lovely homes and restaurants and even in the cold weather made us want to meander through the streets. If you stay here, be sure to grab coffee in the mornings at the Feed Store only a block away- adorable store! The room itself was cozy and inviting and had its own heater, which was great for a weenie southerner like myself who isn't accustomed to winter anymore!  And like many other reviews have said, it is true: Aggie might be one of the most loving dogs around!"

447826,4006780,2013-04-02,5351775,Deanna-Marie,"My boyfriend and I stayed with Hilary and Hazel for three days during my birthday. Hilary was gone the first two nights but left a very useful folder of information covering logistics about the house and places to visit, it was very helpful! Her home was very warm and inviting, we looked forward to coming back to relax after a full day of sight seeing. Although we drove to Boston, we used public transportation the time we were there and her home is conveniently located close to the 39 Bus and the T. Also loved exploring JP, what an awesome neighborhood! Hilary, and her daughter Hazel  were extremely nice and perfect hosts- so much so that we wish we had more time to talk to them both! Also, be prepared to fall in love with their dog Aggie who is absolutely the sweetest dog we've met.  If we ever find ourselves in Boston again, we will be booking our stay with Hilary again. Thank you, Hilary and Hazel!"
447826,4130064,2013-04-12,3504671,Lauren,"Hilary, Hazel, and sweet Aggie the dog were lovely hosts during our stay in Boston. We loved their little home - chock full of art! The room is pretty small - not much space for luggage - but cozy and cute! House is close to the stony brook t station and close to central JP - very convenient for getting around the city. We would definitely stay here again. (P.S. Happy birthday, Hazel! )"
447826,4243135,2013-04-22,4741507,Amanda,"Hilary was an incredible host. We were with her for 8 days. Full of great tips, ideas, warmth and care. Her home is in a very nice community, full of great Cuban food, Mexican, whole foods, coffee, a nice park, and the Sam Adams brewery are short walks and a close train ride to downtown. She also checked in with us during the chaos of the marathon bombings and was super caring and communicative during the insane week. I'm so glad we stayed with her!"
447826,4361734,2013-04-30,2512373,Michael,"My girlfriend and I spent 3 nights at Hilary's and we had a great stay. Communication was clear and quick beforehand, our welcome was warm and we were quickly made to feel at home. Hilary has the right approach in letting you get on with things around her but is always ready to answer questions or have a chat. The house is lovely and full of character, and we loved our relaxed mornings in the kitchen. The bedroom was more than adequate for the two of us. Hilary and her daughter are both friendly, creative and interesting people. You get the best of both worlds - quick and easy travel into central Boston while staying in a beautiful New England neighbourhood!"
447826,4415372,2013-05-04,2792811,Gaby,"Hilary was very helpful and friendly, with great recommendations! Although the room was very small, it was cosy,clean and comfortable."
447826,4502060,2013-05-09,4588133,Melissa,Hilary and Hazel (and Aggie) were wonderful hosts.  Very welcoming and willing to assist with any questions.  The room was small (as noted in the listing) but comfortable.  An excellent retreat from four days of conferences.  Very close to the orange line and buses.  There is also an amazing vegan ice cream place (FoMu JP) that I ate at every single night.  I highly recommend staying here if you are looking for a place in Boston.
447826,4546830,2013-05-12,1604716,Dave,Hilary and daughter Hazel with lovely dog Aggie greeted us at the door and provided us with an immediate tourist tip that the Boston Museum of Fine Arts {MFA} was free this evening and how to get there before we even were unpacked.  We enjoyed the MFA very much including a nice birthday dinner for Carol before heading to their home to meet our hosts.  It rained most of our second day so we only fit in a walk around nearby Jamaica Pond and a great dinner at the nearby Blue Nile.  Hilary also provided us with a coupon left by a previous guest for a Kennedy Tour in historic Boston which we took advantage of too.  Their neighborhood of Jamaica Plain has many eclectic amenities that we enjoyed whilst walking around during the evening including J P Licks [a local ice cream & coffee shop].  We would recommend Hilary and her home for any short or long stay in the Boston area with these charming hosts and the convenience of easy access to Boston...

Hilary provided great resources for things to do, places to eat, and other area information. The room was clean, the house was funky and we loved it!

Hilary was an easygoing and accommodating host, and I enjoyed the short amount of time I spent chatting with them. They left a lovely welcome note as well as a folder of information on the area and recommendations of things to do."
The house is very clean,cozy,"and was a great place to stay for a long weekend in JP. Would definitely stay here again!\"",,,
447826,4993908,2013-06-06,2780889,Krysta,"This house is cute and cozy! The amount of art sprinkled throughout really make it charming as well. The house is situated between a T station and a bus line, so public transport was a breeze (and cheap too - $18 for a week!). Hilary is a wonderful host and has great ideas for restaurants and things to do. The mattress was a little firm for my tastes, but even after a week there I slept soundly (and lots - yay for vacations!). Oh and the cutest dog! Such short legs for a long body :)"

Hilary is an excellent and thoughtful host, always willing to offer help. We quickly felt at home and our stay in Boston couldn't have been better. I would highly recommend!"
447826,5378118,2013-06-27,3881277,Hannah,Hilary was a great hostess and her home is truly lovely. Although we were visiting strictly for business we did get to enjoy a few of the wonderful restaurants and bars in walking distance from her place. I highly recommend staying with Hilary.
447826,5599450,2013-07-08,145959,Lindsay,"My husband and I were in town for 4 nights because he was in a wedding, and I don't know how we would've done it without Hilary's house! The hotels were about $300, and it was hard to find a place--even on airbnb--that fit our criteria of affordable, convenient places that had parking. I am so glad we found this one! We really enjoyed getting to know the neighborhood, as well. Hilary is a great host and her house is charming; we're very glad that we were able to stay there. It is worth noting that in July, the bedroom is very hot! I would suggest that at least in the summer, the room is more suitable for a shorter stay, since in addition to the heat, there is not much room for luggage, and the bed is not extremely comfortable."
447826,5673727,2013-07-11,4352163,Jayme,"Hilary's home is exactly what's represented in the pictures shown in a fantastic neighborhood with easy access to the rest of Boston.  Jamaica Plain feels like a suburb except you are still in the city and off a main subway line.  We didn't use a car nor did I regret it.  This a great base for walking and using public transportation.  But if you are arriving by car, there is street parking everywhere.  We were in Boston for a wedding we had attended and the bride and groom stayed in downtown Boston.  Where did I find them day 2 of their honeymoon?  In Jamaica Plain eating ice cream around the corner.  So Hilary's house is in an awesome diverse neighborhood with beautiful unique homes, and has fantastic food (Sorella's for breakfast! JP Licks for ice cream to name a few) and shops (Hilary gave us a great tip to go to Salmagundi's which sells only hats)."
Hilary's home is very personal and reflective of her.  The work and love put in her home is evident.  The room you are staying in is at the top of the stairs (all the bedrooms are upstairs) and it is a cozy 4th bedroom as advertised.   There is a shared bathroom downstairs (and very large).  The bed can easily accommodate 2 people.  As a previous reviewer mentioned,there is not much room for luggage.  As we are light travelers,this did not impact us.  There is a bed,bookcase,and floor lamp in the room. We stayed there on one of the hottest nights in the summer and it was sweltering--but it would have been sweltering everywhere but maybe a hotel with strong a/c.  You weren't going to escape the heat anywhere.  The room has a window fan.  Hilary gave us an extra fan and we were ok.  After that night,the room and the house were very pleasant temperature-wise.
"Hilary was very generous with both her recommendations and the guidebook material she had.  She couldn't have been nicer or easier to communicate with.  She also has a very cute dog named Aggie.  I absolutely recommend staying here--perfect location and great hostess!\"",,,,,

Hilary is such a sweet, kind hearted, and fun person and the perfect hostess (VERY hospitable!)! From the moment we arrived to her unique/gorgeous/cozy house, we felt right at home! She showed us around the house and then gave us a folder full of information about Boston. Hilary was also very helpful and informative both before and during our stay! She even helped us plan what we'd visit after we left Boston! Her home is located in a beautiful neighborhood and has great access to public transportation for when you head into the city center. It was a definite treat having access to the kitchen and having our own little space in the fridge. Again, we felt right at home!"

I will definitely plan to stay with this amazing duo when I next return to Boston."
447826,6275832,2013-08-06,6822486,Linda,Hilary's little house was a delight in the quirky and independent neighbourhood of Jamaica Plain. Just a short walk from Stony Brook T stop it was easy to get to and about a half hour ride from downtown.
Hilary herself was away for the majority of the weekend which meant we had the luxury of the house to ourselves. When we did see her she was nothing but lovely giving us recommendations and having a genuine interest in what we'd been doing and where we'd gone.,,,,,

Hilary, Hazel and Aggie were super nice and warm, making us feel really comfortable. The bed was really good, the bathroom is awesome, and we loved the house! Specially the kitchen area which is so unique and filled with art. Jamaica Plains is a really nice neighborhood. The T station is only a few blocks away so you can easily walk there, and you have supermarkets, restaurants and a place to buy coffee in a walking distance. It would only take us about 15/20 minutes to get to Downtown Crossing, so for us it was actually pretty awesome! We definetely recommend it and will come back for sure in our next visit to Boston!!"

The neighborhood is fantastic: historic houses in various sizes and colours,with nice restaurants,shops and café's within walking distance . Spring Avenue itself is peaceful: no noise!!!,,,
Hilary and her daughter Heather are easygoing and very friendly.,,,,,
It was a pity that we had a full program during our stay: would have liked to talk to them over a glass of wine or a cup of tea......maybe next time if we come to Boston.,,,,,

The room, as advertised, is sweet and cosy. The estate is very quiet and very safe even when we returned late at night. Hilary and her friendly doggy were at home to welcome us into her household.

We tried three restaurants (two in JP) and a museum that were suggested to us by them and they were all really good. The Sam Adams brewery is 10 mins away walking, that was so much fun! The subway station is really close, and a bus we also used. All in all, an excellent stay!! Thank you!"

Hilary was more than willing to suggest local places to go and some of the most underrated things to see in Boston. The room was small but cozy, and actually just perfect for travelers who just need a place to sleep. Jamaica Plain is such an awesome neighborhood, which I never would have discovered had we stayed in touristy downtown. This price is a steal for the all around lovely experience we had."

The distance to the subway was a huge plus,as there were many fun things to see and do in Boston and having them so easily accessible meant no need for a car.,,,,

Her home is clean and cozy and I pretty much made tea for myself everyday with comfort.,,,,,
Her area JP is also a gem in Boston - if we stayed in a hotel downtown we would have never gone to JP. JP has some of the very best restaurants and overall a convenient area. If you come to Boston,whether you stay in JP or not,"its worth a day trip just to go out there\"",,,

Thanks Hilary! :) She provided a clean, cozy room, a guest book with helpful information about Boston and opened her home and kitchen to us. She is very knowledgeable about the city and provided clear instructions to use the T (subway) from the airport to her home (which was probably around 20 minutes). She was very friendly and open to conversation but allowed us our privacy and independence as well. The neighborhood felt safe and clean. It was a beautiful part of Boston with beautiful trees, homes, and very close to the Museum of Fine Arts. Easy to get around and very nice people. Thank again Hilary!"

Hilary knows a lot about the city and is very helpfull and interesting in where we went to. The house is close to lots of restaurants and to the public transport. The neighbourhood is quiet and safe and also very beautiful with the colourfull houses. The bedroom is small and the bed as well. For a Dutch tall guy (1.95 m) too short. The house is a little bit old, but we like to stay there. Most of all Hilary is a great host."

We got groceries at City Feed and Supply and cooked one lovely meal and relaxed in both the kitchen and living room. For the rest of the time, we were on the go. The T is quite convenient, (even if it is sleeting/snowing/hailing!) Hilary is very nice, and after a wonderful conversation, steered us toward some galleries in Fort Point, which were awesome. We also browsed the Boston guide book she has at-the-ready. All in all, a most excellent stay, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this lovely artisan home. And Aggie... we loved their dog, too!"

Her place was clean, quiet and cosy. The dog, Aggie, was also a sweet heart and we had tons of fun playing with her. Her place is a short walk away (5 mins) from the subway and was relatively close to the restaurant and ice cream shops (JPLICKS!!!!!) in Jamaican Plains. We had an amazing time in Boston and were grateful for the advice that she had provided us with during our day."
447826,25130669,2015-01-07,15410102,Aaron,"The neighborhood is conveniently located near the 39 bus line and the orange T line, both of which are useful for getting to downtown."
Hilary is helpful and is talkative when you want to talk and stays out of your way when you need to get your own stuff done.,,,,,
The layout includes a full bed with a room heater,a bookshelf,a light,two hangers,and two hooks.,
There is some room at the foot of the bed,but there is only about 6 inches between the sides of the bed and the wall.,,,,
It works great if you have one large piece of luggage,but would be a bit tight for more than that.,,,,
Overall,I strongly recommend,especially if you are traveling by yourself.  The location is close enough that you quickly get in and out of downtown Boston,"but far enough away that the neighborhood is quiet and quaint at night. \"",,

447826,27344883,2015-03-02,27313745,Samuel,"We felt very welcome in Hilary's home. She was very helpful and enthusiastic about her home, neighborhood, and City. Unfortunately I did not have much time to explore the neighborhood and city of Boston due the schedule I needed to keep but Hilary was very knowledgable about what Boston had to offer and had plenty of information detailing the city as well. Her house is very conveniently located and easy to get to and from downtown Boston."
447826,27686687,2015-03-09,1331837,Katie,"Hilary is amazingly responsive. She sent me everything I needed to know before I arrived including step by step public transit instructions for my husband and I (we were coming from separate locations).  She answered all my questions by e-mail very quickly and she answered when I called her by phone as well. She is intelligent, kind, and friendly.  She wasn’t there when I arrived (which she had communicated to me via e-mail), but gave me instructions to use the lock box for the key, left me a note, and book of maps, menus, and brochures, which was very helpful.  The book also included the WiFi password (which works great) and tips about the house (including where she keeps the coffee and tea).  I didn’t need to ask for a thing, she is clearly a seasoned Airbnb host and has this down to a science."
I would stay with Hilary again and plan to if I’m ever in Boston again. Everything was as expected/described or better.  She has a charming single family old Victorian style home,with all the modern conveniences.  As typical with older homes,the bedroom was on the small side (although seemed bigger than pictured) and there wasn’t a closet.  There is a tall empty bookcase in the bedroom,where we kept most of our things and there is space under the bed for your suitcases.  There were small end tables on each side of the bed as well. My husband was with me and we felt like we had plenty of space.,,
The home was clean,towels were fresh and fluffy,and the bedding was warm and comfortable. The home is heated by a thermostat,but you also have your own room heater (which we didn’t need,the home was a comfortable temperature for us).  She has hardwood and stone floors,which tend to be cold
The neighborhood is so adorable! The houses are beautiful Victorian works of art and there is a hipster vibe.  I walked all over Jamaica Plain checking out shops and restaurants that Hilary kindly recommended. Everything is pretty much shut down by 9 or 10,not much of a nightlife there.  But the Orange line,which is walking distance from Hilary’s (about a half mile) runs late and frequently on Friday evening.  It takes about 30 minutes to get downtown on the orange line. To the airport it takes  maybe 45-60 mins,you need to switch form the orange line to the blue line. It was very easy to get around on the T.,,

Immediately felt like home - Hilary showed me around the house and handed me an extensive and well prepared folder with maps, restaurant tips, excursion information, etc. It's been a pleasure to have her around for a chat."
I stayed in Boston and took part at the marathon in 2015 - Jamaica Plain was the ideal area for getting a good rest in a quite area of Boston but also to get to the city center in just 15-30mins.,,,,,

She leaves you with a book that provides insight into Boston along with maps and a large notebook with places to go. Hazel is an engaging young lady who provides a perspective of Boston that can only be provided by a young person. Hillary's house is very accessible from the orange line and into downtown Boston---no need for a car. They have a great dog by the name of Aggy and she is always available for petting.

This was our first time to Boston and Jamaica Plain was a great neighborhood to call home for a little while.  The house is in a great location as it is near to both public transportation and many restaurants and small shops.  Hilary and Hazel were both welcoming and even provided us with a folder filled with local guides and menus to nearby restaurants.  We really appreciated being told about free days at the museums!

447826,33773516,2015-06-01,12100945,Rani,"My girlfriend were visiting Boston to attend a graduation, and we had the pleasure of staying with Hilary, Hazel and Aggie the dog. Hilary and Hazel were very hospitable, accommodating and gave us excellent advice and directions about the city. Hilary also gave us full access to her wonderful kitchen, but we didn't have the time to cook, which is a shame. When the weather got hot, Hilary gave us a fan for our bedroom room. And when it started raining the next day, she gave us umbrellas to use while out in the town. The stay was absolutely wonderful, and the house itself is just gorgeous and full of all sorts of art pieces. Just hanging out in the living room and doing nothing was therapeutic for us. We already know where we'll be staying the next time we visit Boston."

Obwohl wir erst sehr spät angereist sind, war sie noch wach und hat uns mit Hundedame Aggi empfangen (definitv der liebenswürdigste Kurzbeinhund :-) ). Ein Ordner mit super vielen Empfehlungen für Restaurants, Ausflüge etc. war auch für uns da. Hilary war eine super Gastgeberin. Sie hat uns ihren Drucker benutzen lassen und war sehr geduldig mit uns ( wir haben 3 Tage gebraucht, bis wir uns an das amerikanische Türschließsystem gewöhnt haben). Die Wohnung ist liebevoll dekoriert, mit einer gut ausgestatteten Küche. Das Bett war super bequem und obwohl es auf den Bildern nicht richtig ersichtlich ist, bietet der Raum vor dem Bett gut Platz für 2 Koffer, auch ein kleines Regal ist in dem Schlafzimmer. Der Platz ist sehr gut genutzt. Hilary hat eine freundliche und aufgeschlossene Art. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt."

She was extremely warm and welcoming and of course, very interesting, as I'm sure you can gather from her photos. The house was adorable with very eclectic choices of art.  The neighborhood was very quiet and easy to walk. The main 'drag' was just a short walk away in one direction and the train a little bit longer walk in the other direction.

The place is a stone's throw away from the T, and there are great cafes and restaurants nearby. You wouldn't want to stay too near downtown so this is indeed a relatively quite day to rest after a hustling day visiting town."
447826,54370099,2015-11-19,6783824,Joanna,"The directions Hilary gave us to her beautiful home were spot on. We got there without a hitch, and although she wasn't there for the first couple of days of our stay, she'd left us pumpkin bread as a treat and a lovely letter to welcome us."

447826,55218845,2015-11-29,29739221,Nailah,Thanks Hilary for opening your home to my mother and I.
Her humble abode was nestled in a quiet quaint neighborhood. We were presently surprised to have her space to ourselves. It was a perfect resting nest for our weekend in Boston. Pictures are true to charm,but please note the space is quite petite. Which is funny coming from someone only 5ft tall,but I suppose I may be use to spreading out a bit. Bedroom does not lend room to any large luggage or seating space,but the shelves were suffice for such a short stay. Plus I was able to make the hallway my closet space hehe if you have a vehicle  be sure to take notice of street parking rules. Otherwise,space was quirky with personal 'lived in',artsy ora that my party and I were grateful to be accommodated in.

447826,58013464,2015-12-31,4534285,Shinnosuke,"We had a great time in Hilary's little house. She warmly welcomed us with tons of tourist information which is very useful, and let us have some free tea and coffee. She even made brunch for us! The house is close enough to the train station, and the neighborhood Jamaica Plain is the coolest area in Boston (like Williamsburg in NYC). One thing I should let the other guests know is that the room is pretty small so if you have more than two large suitcases, it might be difficult to fit them in(We had one big and one normal suitcase and it was already full). But overall, I can strongly recommend her house of your stay in Boston!"
447826,58735315,2016-01-03,42405304,Martin,Both the Neighboorhood and the house are amazing.
The house stands with art and good vibes that makes it very relaxing and welcomy ! Hilary was a great host,her daughter is very nice and aggie (the doggie) just finished that amazing combo !,,,,

She's accommodating, ready to give suggestions when needed, while leaving enough personal space for you to tend your own business. Though not too spacious, this place's quaint and cushy decorations make it a cozy stay. It's also conveniently located: 5-min walk to the Orange Line, another 5 to the scenic Jamaica Pond, and easy access to downtown. For dog lovers, Aggy will be the sweetest companion you can have! All in all, I'll recommend it to those who wish an idyllic atmosphere, but don't want to stay too far way from the city hustle-bustle."

Hilary has a great binder chock full of great information about JP and Boston, plus I really appreciated the little notes giving me a heads-up about what to check out (i.e. certain museums being free after 5PM etc.)."
The location is incredibly convenient to everything thanks to transit,and it most definitely is a sweet little house in Boston.  You couldn't ask for a homier,more inviting house to stay in after a full day out and about.  The room was a perfect size for a solo traveller like me,plus lots of pillows and super comfy bed.  Definitely check out Hilary's recommendations for restaurants around JP,I particularly loved my time at Tres Gatos.,

The room is just as described. It is small,but perfectly appointed for the traveler. I loved the sweet little bouquet of flowers that was thoughtfully placed at the bedside.,,,,
I also appreciated the binder she had created just for her guests. It's chock full of tourist info,pamphlets,maps& other recommendations.,,,
Her home is charming andtruly welcoming. It is filled with colors,textures and art that create a hip vibe. I was inspired!,,,,
The location is super convenient with coffee shop,whole foods,laundromat and the subway just a short walk.,,,
"Clearly Hilary has done her homework . I would love to stay here again :))\"",,,,,
447826,88879052,2016-07-25,45936325,Charlie,"Hilary, Hazel and Aggie did everything in their power to make our stay at their home lovely. They are great hosts and very welcoming. I arrived in Boston on a stormy day and it was great to be welcomed and made to feel welcome when I arrived, especially after travelling through the stormy weather."
The house is lovely,with lots of awesome quirky art pieces and objects which are fascinating to see and talk about. The room is small,but I knew this and didn't find this a problem at all (I stayed for 3 weeks and it was plenty of room for me).,,,
JP is a very nice place to stay in too,lots of things to do,"places to eat at and easy to get to and from downtown Boston. \"",,,
447826,92515080,2016-08-08,58232094,Niamh,"The location is great. Jamaica Plains is a lovely area and the house is really close to trains, buses, shops, restaurants etc. The room is very comfortable and clean. We did not meet Hillary while we were there but she left a folder full of notes and maps for us to read which was very helpful. The house is near trains and buses that take you all over the city so we found it easy to explore Boston from this area."
447826,94561787,2016-08-16,8149077,Sandra,"Der Aufenthalt bei Hilary war super, alles wie im Inserat beschrieben. Wir fanden insbesondere den Ortsteil Jamaica Plain sehr ansprechend und eine nette Alternative zu Downtown Boston."
Die Kommunikation mit Hilary war im Vorfeld und während unseres Aufenthaltes sehr angenehm,sie hatte viele nützliche Tipps für uns und hat dafür gesorgt,"dass wir uns bei ihr Zuhause gefühlt haben. \"",,,
447826,95972930,2016-08-21,30372580,Ellie,"We really enjoyed our stay in Hilary's house - although she wasn't there during our visit she left us a tonne of useful information about the local area (maps, menus, tourist info etc) and gave very clear instructions for everything in the house. The house itself is incredibly pretty, with lots of quirks and character and it is situated in a lovely neighbourhood that is only a 20min bus ride from central Boston. Would definitely go back if I could!"
447826,96856798,2016-08-24,5524735,Michelle,"Hilary's is a cozy, artfully decorated and clean home, with a small guest room upstairs and shared bathroom downstairs. Hilary is friendly and welcoming, and was very helpful in letting us keep our bags for a late flight after checkout. Jamaica Plain was perhaps not quite as hip a neighborhood as we'd expected, but it is a pleasant suburban area with good public transport connections and a nice lake nearby."
447826,97899775,2016-08-28,68572025,Michaela,"Thanks to Hilary and her superb hospitality, the first Airbnb stay for myself and my friend could not have been better. She was incredibly communicative, welcoming, friendly, and helpful. Thanks to the directions and tips she provided us in advance, we easily found our way through a new and unfamiliar city, from the airport to the subway station, and to her house."
When we arrived,she and her sweet dog,Aggie,greeted us at the door,and we were welcomed into the kitchen for water and a chat. She provided us with a key and a large binder full of local menus,information
With the information in the binder,and some additional information from Hilary,we quickly learned our way around the neighborhood,and to a local pub for dinner after our arrival. In the following days,we visited many different areas of Boston,as well as Salem
On the last full day of our short visit,which was spent up in Salem,we made a visit into the North End for some treats from Modern Pastry before heading back to the house. Despite being in the middle of a project when we got back,she sat with us to visit over wine and pastries. Never once did we feel unwelcome in her home during our time there. My only dissatisfaction lies with not being able to stay longer! I would highly recommend Hilary as a host,and would gladly stay with her again on my next trip to Boston. Thanks for everything,"Hilary!\""
447826,98913113,2016-09-02,2877040,Alan,"Hilary's place was exactly what we needed at the end of a long trip. A really warm welcome and a very comfortable room. The house is lovely and full of amazing, beautiful, creative things. We loved being able to hang out here and explore the really great neighbourhood. It was also easy to get downtown Boston when we wanted to. Lovely local bars and restaurants and we loved the Arboritum close by too."
"I would definitely recommend Hilary's place.\"",,,,,
5959251,32773537,2015-05-21,1796898,Mel,This apartment was in a beautiful location. Nice & clean. Lynne was very easy to deal with. I look forward to staying here again on my next trip to Boston.
5959251,47285555,2015-09-17,42187240,Mohammed,The apartment is located in a very convenient area. The unite is very spacious and unique.
5959251,50632941,2015-10-13,2100208,Seth,"Lynn was such a delight to deal with.  From the moment we booked, until the moment we left, we knew exactly what the process was going to be.  The house was described and the pictures 100% accurate.  This place is a GEM and highly recommended.  Easy to walk around Boston from this location."
5959251,75907865,2016-05-23,70235380,Tony,Lynne was pleasant and accommodating. The location is excellent. The historical structure is well maintained. The inlaid floors are beautiful. The furnishings need updating. All in all it was a good value and a very good experience.
5959251,81828967,2016-06-25,71879447,Sherry,This was my first ever experience with Airbnb.  Lynne has set the bar high.  She was both easy and a pleasure to work with in reserving the apartment.  The location of this apartment is just the best if you are staying or visiting Boston.
I would certainly choose to stay here again if I was returning to the Boston area.  Thank you again,"Lynne.\"",,,,
12541136,74336393,2016-05-15,59142543,Jonas,The apartment is perfectly located in the heart of Boston and has everything within short working distance.  It is a very clean and nice apartment and it was neatly and beautifully arranged for my arrival. There is not much daylight coming into the apartment but it is very quiet and there is an great rooftop balcony with chairs and tables and a beautiful view over Boston.
I stayed there alone but there would have been plenty of room for two or even four people in the apartment with the large bedroom and the kitchen/living space. The kitchen was well equipped and it was easy and convenient to prepare food there.,,,,,
Jennifer was in Europe while I stayed in the apartment but she still answered me within few hours whenever I needed to be in contact with her and she was very helpful.,,,,,
"I can highly recommend Jennifer as host!\"",,,,,
12541136,79144779,2016-06-11,563393,Ghiwa,"A great apartment, very clean and well maintened. The bed is VERY comfortable with excellent sheets. Jennifer was an excellent host. The apartment is in an amazing location, close to many restaurants, grocery stores and other amenities. You're actually right outside the beginning of the freedom trail and close to a lot of hisrorical buildings. There's a subway stop about 5 minutes away which is very convenient for visiting the museums and Harvard square. All-in-all a great stay and I would definitely stay again."
12541136,80127700,2016-06-16,71529895,Laurence,"Tout était comme notre hôte nous l'avait décrit, appartement merveilleusement bien situé, très calme, haut standing, confortable, avec une magnifique terrasse sur le toit. Notre hôte s'est régulièrement inquietée de savoir si tout se passait bien."
Grace à elle,"notre séjour à Boston fut une merveilleuse expérience. Je ne peux que conseiller cette adresse.\"",,,,
12541136,84313676,2016-07-06,67985004,Justin,"I had a great and stress free time at Jen's.  The apartment was quiet and clean.  You couldn't ask for a better location considering it's proximity to the freedom trail, downtown, train stations, etc.  The rooftop view for fourth of July fireworks couldn't be beat.  She was quick to respond to any questions and like others have said, the bed was extremely comfortable."
12541136,88526285,2016-07-24,9472110,Alanna,The apartment is in a perfect location for visiting and touring Boston.
The pictures are very accurate,and its a beautiful apartment. One bedroom,with a fold out couch in the living-room. So plenty of room for extra guests.,,,
Its homely,and has everything you need for a fantastic stay!,,,,
Jennifer was a great host; always very quick to respond to any questions and very welcoming.,,,,,
We had a wonderful stay,and would definitely try to stay here again if I am back in Boston.,,,,
"Thank you Jennifer\"",,,,,
12541136,97478381,2016-08-27,34081042,Kerry,"We had a great stay at Jen's place. The apartment was centrally located and certainly met our expectations, and is exactly as advertised. Jen always responded really quickly to our emails and she is an excellent host who provides comprehensive information. Highly recommended!"
1391215,6449815,2013-08-12,14033512,Matteo,"The house was quite well, and clean. My room was small, but there are  also bigger rooms (for two people, I was alone) . Dorchester is not the best neighborhood for an holiday, but if you have to spend two or three days for something (I was looking for an house) it's ok. Don't go there for your honeymoon."
1391215,7282356,2013-09-14,8347813,Hamilton,"The room was exactly as it was listed on the website.  It is small but the bed was comfy, the room clean, and overall pleasantly decorated.  The whole house, in fact, was quite pleasant and enjoyable to be in.  If you're looking for a nice, comfortable, and safe place to put your head at the end of the night I would recommend staying here."
1391215,7381686,2013-09-17,8268759,Qi,Good location very close to subway station; helpful host and good facility of the house; overall it is good experience for me
1391215,7685027,2013-09-29,851303,Jacquie,Hermina is a very nice and welcoming host.  Her house is in an excellent location especially if you like amazing vietnamese food.  Only ten minutes from the center of Boston.  I have stayed there several times and she always allows me to park my car in her drive way because it is full of merchandise and i really appreciate that.  Check in and all of that is super easy as well.
1391215,7873946,2013-10-07,8062284,Jörg,Hermina is a great host. She was very welcoming and helpful.
1391215,8011294,2013-10-12,2670637,Olivier,"Overall a good experience. The house is very clean and the host welcoming and very discreet. Harvard is a bit remote, but it's a 25 minutes ride with the red line, during which one can enjoy a good book. I would highly recommend it."
1391215,8160939,2013-10-18,9358262,Julie,The house is very clean and it is very close to subway station. It takes just 10 minutes to downtown by subway.
1391215,8216393,2013-10-21,8717252,Shari,"What a beautiful home! Hermina was very accommodating and pleasant, as was her helper, Donna. My daughter and I were very comfortable in the Cozy E room. The location was easy to get in and out of by public transportation. We will definitely stay here on all future trips to the Boston Area!!!!"
1391215,8513074,2013-11-03,6175272,Steven,"I do recommend staying here. It is easily accessible from the city/airport and is in a very safe neighbourhood. The room is pleasant and functional, very good if you are just looking for somewhere to sleep each night."
1391215,8706677,2013-11-12,9546900,John,Comfortable stay. Easy to get to and to get around from there.
1391215,8739899,2013-11-15,8686501,Tristan,"The accommodation in Hermina's house was very comfortable and all household amenities were accessible.  I did not meet Hermina in person but we were often in communication via e-mail and phone, and she made sure that I had everything I needed."
The location is very good for travelling in and out of downtown Boston (it only takes around 15-20 minutes),and there are lots of local shops in the neighbourhood.,,,,
"All in all I would recommend staying here if you want somewhere reasonable to sleep while you explore the historic city of Boston.\"",,,,,
1391215,8796301,2013-11-18,9762691,Jimmy,"\"C\"\"était ma 1ere expérience sur airbnb et je n'ai pas été décus"
It was my first experience with airbnb and I was not disappointed,I arrive in car and the place is easy to find,very clean. I did not meet Hermina but i meet Donna which is her Helper when she is not there,she is very kind and she answers your questions. the house is well located,"easy to find and only 2min train!\"",
1391215,9167302,2013-12-10,10072688,Christine,"This house is clean and well furnished; I found the description on this site to be accurate.  Hermina let me know ahead of time that she would be out of town during my stay.  Her friend Donna was there to greet me when I arrived, and there were other guests my first night.  The second night I was alone in the house, which was a bit strange but worked out okay."
1391215,9209481,2013-12-13,3799744,Daniel,Great place to stay. Convenient to the city.
1391215,9299080,2013-12-19,10353192,Buwan,Traffic there is very convenient.
1391215,9378649,2013-12-24,600993,Daniel,Hermina was in Europe while I stayed at her house.  The accomodations were cozy and inviting.  The transportation to Boston was a very short walk away.  Her kitchen had all the necessary items to prepare meals.  The other guests were friendly.  Donna was about keeping order and maintaining the space.  I have no problem recommending this to the cost conscious traveler.
The supermarket and other stores were a stone throw away.  The police abutting off the back fence  lent an air of security.and additional safety. Chinese takeouts were plentiful  and there's a MacDonalds close by( if you are so inclined).  Had a scotch in the Blarney Stone-nice place.,,,,,
The red line runs to South Station,Downtown Crossing and Park Street.  It then continues on to MIT and then to Harvard Square.  The Rose Kennedy Greenbelt conecting Chinatown to the  Northend is easily accessible from the red line; as is the Faneuil Hall Market Place. I skipped the Harbor Walk this trip to Boston; it  was the middle of the winter and those breezes sweeping the docks can be chilling.,,,,
Make the switch to the Green Line and in a few stops you are in the Copley Square area; browse down Newbury Street and stroll the upscale Copley Mall on the backside of the Prudential Tower.  While you there snap a few shots of Trinity Church; needless to say they don't build them like that anymore.,,,,,
Hermina's digs unlock the keys to the internationally renowned City of Boston-bring your favorite walking shoes to discover the educational institutions and medical facilities.,,,,,

1391215,9792422,2014-01-10,9244087,Karen,Stayed two nights. Very clean. Had a small but cozy room. Great to park free on the street. The others in the home were very quiet. I would definitely stay again!

It was such an easy commute into and through Boston. I kept mostly to my room when home in the evenings, but there was space to lounge, a spacious kitchen, and dining table.  This was my first airbnb experience and I feel confident I will continue to utilize this site.  Thank you, Hermina!"
1391215,10223763,2014-02-07,9244087,Karen,Had most of the house to myself! There was a big snow storm and it was really warm and cozy. Donna shoveled the steps and checked in with me. It is nice to come and go as please. Beds comfy and Hermina is always quick to respond to my emails!
1391215,10317803,2014-02-12,9244087,Karen,A great cozy house. Thank you for the hospitality!

The house is really pretty and permanently clean. It is very big too!,,,,,
It's just two blocks away from the subway so you can easily get to downtown.,,,,,
I do recommend staying here,but it's better if you are not alone just because the neighborhood is kind of lonely - very quiet- and the house is very big (I was alone in the house) you could feel a little bit scared! but otherwise if you are with people I'm sure anyone would love this place!,,,,

1391215,12259739,2014-04-27,13530420,Wesley,I had a great stay at Hermina's! Special thanks to her house manager Donna who helped me settle down. Location was great! It was located in front of a police station so it was relatively safe. 15 mins or so to downtown boston by metro. The house was 3 mins walk away from the metro. Cheap chinese food located right outside the door. Great place to stay for budget travelers.

The location is perfect, close to the train station on the red line so I was able to go almost anywhere in Boston. The house itself is nicely furnished and extremely cozy. Room E is good for 1 or 2. It had everything needed including a closet, chair, lamp, and dresser. Everything was clean and sharing the bathroom with other guests was not a problem. Thank you so much Hermina and Donna!

Also, there are plenty of good restaurants nearby as well so if you need a meal nearby there are good options within walking distance."
1391215,15574823,2014-07-12,14866227,Yap,"Hermina has broken her terms of agreement by asking me to move room during the last day of my stay. Even though I had been really busy during the whole time, and didn't have time to pack and move rooms, she has forced me to do so, just because someone else has paid more money to book the entire upper floors of the house. This has caused me much inconvenience and a lot of anguish. I was forced to move into the basement, without access to filtered drinking water, and have to give up access to the kitchen (apparently the new party moving in booked the kitchen too, and I was not allowed to go in there). I had to remove all my food from the kitchen and finish them before the last day. I have requested that she properly compensate  me by refunding me 1 day's fees, but she has refused. She has offered to compensate me for a small amount, which I feel is insufficient for the anguish she has caused. I have obliged and moved room because the housekeeper, Donna, has been really nice, and I didn't want to cause trouble for her. By reneging on her promise to provide the agreed service to me after accepting my payment, I feel that Herima is dishonest and does not care about her guests, rather, she is just after the money, and will betray you for just that. People, be warned. the same thing may happen to you. Don't stay here."
1391215,15852365,2014-07-16,17886879,Rahul,House is nice. Donna welcome me and helped me to settle down.

Hermina was kind enough to extend my trip by a day, so I was able to stay both in room E and A. Room E is a great little room and room A is essentially an apartment and very nice, with books a fireplace, wet bar. I enjoyed staying here and would recommend."
1391215,16851693,2014-08-03,17466745,Carien,"I only stayed for one night, and it was perfect for my purpose, just a place to sleep and explore from there. It was very easy to go to the center of Boston by subway."

The house is in a very convenient location in Dorchester,within walking distances to the Red line station,some grocery store,and tons of nice Vietnamese restaurants. The room E I booked is a quite small (maybe the smallest room) in the house,but a very cozy one indeed,with a bed

1391215,17683954,2014-08-16,17002974,Edith,"The room and house was clean and neat. There was nothing fancy but it was adequate, affordable and conveniently located to a T station. I was able to  call Hermina's manager and she seemed most helpful. Everything was fine and I had a good stay in Boston."

House was absoluetely amazing, from the first second it just felt so welcoming homely. Donna was extrememly helpfuly and she's doing a great job looking after the house. Definitely my 1st choice if I ever come back to Boston ;) Thank you!"
1391215,19216043,2014-09-08,5370741,Deryk,"Nice little room, surprisingly comfortable with Boston going through a late summer heat wave.  Beautiful old Victorian house with everything you need to make your stay comfortable.  I know some people aren't fans of the area, but all my interactions with people in the neighborhood were positive.  It's a short walk to the T anyways and the police station is next door, so chances of something happening is minimal.  Overall, I enjoyed my stay.  Hermina wasn't around, but was easy reach via email/AirBNB."
1391215,19481370,2014-09-13,11203152,Jj,"Hermina and Donna managed my accomodations extremely well.  I arrived via a red eye.  Eventhough check-in was not until 2PM, Hermina permitted me to hang in the common areas until check-in time.  I was able to drop off my luggage and head off to some appointments prior to check-in.  In person, I met Donna.  She was extremely thorough in making sure everything was set.  The house is lovely.  The setting is warm.  The kitchen is well equipped.  The host makes cleanliness a high priority."
As stated in the post,the walls are THIN.  So,depending on the courtesy of your house mates,the restfulness of the stay may vary.  Hermina states House Rules which include quiet times. But,not everyone followed the rules during my stay.  But,"this is not the responsibility of the host \""

1391215,20247465,2014-09-26,18464037,Sushith,It was great
1391215,20924411,2014-10-07,9972190,Terry,"Hermina was very nice. Boston access by train is easy. The neighborhood can be a bit iffy to walk in late at night, but was fine for me. Timing can be an issue with 5 rooms sharing 1.5 baths, but it did not impact my schedule. I was there for Boston and it was wonderful to see. Terry"
1391215,21045592,2014-10-10,18464037,Sushith,Great host
1391215,22463512,2014-11-07,18464037,Sushith,Good.. It's worth it
1391215,22584425,2014-11-10,21336008,Daisho,"Awesome!! She was very kind and sociable. I talked with her everyday. It was close to downtown for me. It was comfortable. You can eat and drink something in fridge. My room was warm even when it was freezing. You can use laundry and dryer. One supermarket was close to this house, so you can buy something. I think this location was peaceful and quiet."
1391215,22746523,2014-11-13,21901451,Shirley,Hermina is too friendly and a great host I will definitely choose her house for the next boston trip
1391215,23600480,2014-12-06,3751402,Henry,Hermina's place is simple and comfortable. It was nice to chat with her -- she's very nice. The room was basic but had what I needed. Enjoyed staying here yet again!
1391215,25288597,2015-01-11,5804257,Luke,Herminas place meet all of my needs. Communication with Hermina prior to arriving was prompt and comprehensive. Big kitchen and basic supplies provided were very helpful. Only a few minutes walk to the T station so u can be downtown in no time. Sue the assistant house manager was a delightful. So friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend. Just be careful not to lock yourself out of your room as I did.
1391215,25720288,2015-01-24,18464037,Sushith,It's been great as always
1391215,26805734,2015-02-19,14819545,Greg,This was a nice place to stay with plenty of amenities in the house.   I stayed here for a few nights in February 2015.  I had just moved to Boston and I was able to conduct an apartment hunt during the snow storms.  I'd imagine there are more guests in the summer
1391215,27227279,2015-02-28,18464037,Sushith,It was great as always
1391215,28285081,2015-03-21,1810958,Michael,"Hermina was quick to respond with info  - before, during and after my stay in Room E. This room is small, and I think the most afordable in the house.  The bed is VERY comfortable and plenty ot fresh towels were provided and extra blankets were in the room.  The bed is only accessable from one side- not a problem for one person, but could be an issue for two - but then there are other rooms in the house that might be better suited for two people & at only slightly more money.  This was a good velue for me - a business person looking for a place near Boston financial dist. get away from longer commutes for a few days.  Thanks for welcoming me into your home - I hope to return some day & hope to meet you at our Wunda Farm some day (on Cape)  - Mike"
1391215,29470275,2015-04-07,30418488,Winston,as described Nice Cozy.
1391215,29774071,2015-04-12,260921,Paul,Enjoyed staying at Hermina's house.  Great location a few blocks from the T and near food shopping.  Hermina & Donna were very helpful and responsive.  Complete access to entire house including kitchen and living room.  Highly recommend!
1391215,30242480,2015-04-19,20202985,Ammiel,"I enjoyed my stay at Hermina ' s place. Access to the home's bathrooms, loving room, kitchen  and dining room.  Comfortable bed for sleeping. Use of washer and dryer. I was able to cook and make tea with appliances ready and available at the home; dishes, pots, pans and some groceries were made available, even.  Close to trains to transport to anywhere in the city. I would most definitely stay during future visits to Boston."
1391215,30848023,2015-04-27,23737927,Gerald,Staying at Hermina's was very nice. It was a last minute request to extend my stay in Boston and she answered it in a timely manner. Communication was excellent!
The kitchen had everything I needed to make breakfast and the towels were readily available in my room. There was a store nearby (within a 5 minute walk) to get necessities and the subway/light rail station was also just minutes away by walking.,,,,,

1391215,32082951,2015-05-13,31755111,Roberto,"Muy buen lugar para quedarse, comodidad, buen servicio y buena ubicacion"
1391215,33137197,2015-05-25,18248966,Ari,A very lovely and comfortable house. The host is professional and does a wonderful job at keeping the house under a delightful condition.
1391215,33960039,2015-06-02,32304618,Omkar,Hermina was very welcoming. The place is very close to the fields corner red line T stop. So it is very convenient to get around Boston.
The room was on the 2nd floor and it was comfortable.,,,,,
The internet wasn't working too well (that maybe coz my room was on the 2nd floor and in the corner).,,,,,
"Overall I enjoyed my stay :).\"",,,,,
1391215,34181707,2015-06-05,34859868,Dawit,"Although I arrived a bit late, Hermina pleasantly received me and offered me a hot cup of tea in the cold Boston evening. We had a nice chat and she explained in the morning I should feel at home and prepare my breakfast."
She showed me the room and the key. It was a small room with a big comfortable bed that was just right for my purposes. I spent two nights and was in the room only to sleep basically.,,,,,
"The house was a bit too cold for my taste but I understand heating can be costly. Overall it was a fine experience.\"",,,,,
1391215,34705930,2015-06-11,30959334,Nelson,"My stay at Hermina's was very comfortable, she has the arrangements for the guest to have a wonderful and pleasant stay, she's  very nice and talkative and helped me with information about boston area"
1391215,35305874,2015-06-17,32162192,Elizabeth,"I came to Boston for a conference and was wanting to not spend a lot of money due to  strict budget for the week.  Hermina was more than accomadoating, and answered every question prior to my stay within a few hours.  I was aware that I may not see her due to my time being limited, and it wasn't until my second day that I introduced myself."
Hermina's home is beautiful and very much kept like a bed and breakfast/hostel/bunking at a friend's for the night type of home.  Rooms were marked according to reservation,and a key was available when I arrived.  Room E was exactly how I expected and after reading other reviews,so too was the neighborhood.  I personally felt safe the entire time,but then again I can see how some people would be hesitant even though there is no need to be.,,
The only issue I had was on one of the mornings that I had to arrive early I woke up at a time that another group of people were leaving and they were assembly-lined outside of the restroom to take a shower.  I had to be ready in less than an hour and I knew they were all together so I would have little luck getting in the shower anytime soon.  Fortunately,that morning I met Hermina,and although I was frazzled and probably anxious with the current situation,she helped my by providing another shower.  I think this was an extreme case because on any other day I never had this issue with bathroom sharing.  I was more than thankful for her resourcefulness to help me out,and I arrived in time to begin for the day.,
Also,her home is a skip and a jump to the Red T-Line (that's what it's called,right?) and it let's off at South Station which I used everyday.  It was so convenient and the location made the city seem right next door.,,,
Overall,a wonderful experience.  If I'm ever in need of a place to stay in Boston again,"I would definitely reach out again.\"",,,
1391215,35474401,2015-06-19,33035668,Yuji,Really neat house & comfortable room!!
Close to station!!,,,,,
"Strongly recommend for those want to stay Boston :)\"",,,,,
1391215,35863175,2015-06-22,915420,Richard,We booked this room for our Au-pair who enjoyed the stay and the house was well located.
1391215,36293716,2015-06-27,3751402,Henry,Convenient and well-furnished place. Easy to get to from the T at all hours. Hermina is responsive as usual. Enjoyed staying.
1391215,36620439,2015-06-29,3686821,Samar,Great place. Great host. Had a good experience.
1391215,37420600,2015-07-06,35155284,Gerard,"Barbara is such a wonderful lady, so full of life and fun. Nothing is to much trouble for her."
Where do I start,breakfast was fresh fruit and bacon,eggs,toast and coffee. An Airbnb first for me and totally unexpected.,,
She was very informative about the local and wider area. The house and room was lovely,tastefully decorated and very homely and cozy.,,,,
Barbara was prepared to take time out from her schedule to show me round Niagara,if required.,,,,
I can honestly say,that if a received this standard of treatment from further hosts in Airbnb,I would be a very happy man and all for a very reasonable price.,,,
Barbara even drove me to the bus terminal to catch a very early bus back to the USA,I am sure this would have been before her waking time,but this is how accommodating she is !!,,,
If I go back to Niagara,I would definitely stay in this again.,,,,
Make sure you choose Barbara,everybody needs to meet her at least once !,,,,

1391215,37548265,2015-07-08,24526140,Anne,Hermina was a very welcoming host.
Her directions were impeccable,"great location close to public transport.\"",,,,
1391215,38296455,2015-07-14,26763436,Katelyn,Hermina is seriously the best and the nicest and most accommodating host ever! The house is so cute and in the perfect location. Close to the T (red line=the best line) and downtown Dorchester. You could not ask for a better and more affordable place to stay.
1391215,38715462,2015-07-18,33555421,Muriel,"Les  informations fournies par Herminia sont claires et aidantes, le quartier sympathique, la proximité du T(red line) très pratique, l'usage de la maison très agréable. Herminia elle-même a été adorable et m'a personnellement dépannée lorsque j'en ai eu besoin. Merci Herminia!"
1391215,40458263,2015-07-31,26763436,Katelyn,"Hermina is quite possibly the best airbnb host ever. My boyfriend and I felt so welcome in her home. It is so cute, cozy, and convenient. She is a great lady."
1391215,41252989,2015-08-05,38749625,Amelie,"Hermina always replied very quickly to my emails and was very friendly and helpful. Her description on how to get to the house from the airport was very detailed, so I found it without any difficulties. The house itself was very clean and had everything you could possibly need during your stay (coffee maker, toaster, hairdryer, etc). The room had a key, so it was possible to lock my things inside the room when I left the house during the day. Hermina herself wasn't in town during my stay, but her housekeeper Donna was very friendly and helpful when I had any questions."
1391215,45402223,2015-09-02,35996752,Dean,"I felt very comfortable and relaxed in Hermina's place. The house and room was charming, very neat and personable."
1391215,45591738,2015-09-04,37785712,Huihui,"The house is close to T-red line, and 5 stops from south station, so it's easy to go to the downtown area. The room is good, and you can cook yourself for breakfast, including fruits, bread and milk, etc. Landlord is nice, too."
1391215,45805520,2015-09-06,11213261,Alexandra,"The directions to the home were great, very easy to find and easy to get to.  The neighbourhood is a little run down, not somewhere anyone would want to explore but it is safe and only 5 min from the T which goes directly downtown.  I liked that it is in such a diverse area."
Hermina's home is lovely and she makes staying there very comfortable.  The photos are accurate.  The kitchen is fully equipped with pots etc so you can cook there if you like.  The bed was very comfortable.   This room is directly at the front of the house and upstairs.  It was hot and noisy at night with street traffic,but cooled off and got quieter as the night went on.  The room is small but fine for one person.  I would definitely stay there again,,,,

1391215,48205356,2015-09-24,10784048,HongHao,"Hermina's place is clean, safe and convenient. She is very helpful and mindful."
1391215,51160983,2015-10-18,44285862,Rafaella,"We stayed there for two days. Room was cozy, bed was clean, bathroom was clean. She has a blow dryer girls, so no need to pack one. Kitchen downstairs, and the place is really quiet. The neighborhood was a little iffy but I could just be over reacting due to my lack of exposure. There is a police station right behind, so it's pretty safe. Try the little coffee shop on the corner; they sell only local stuff (coffee, cakes, ice cream). T station 5 min walk, at night it can be a little scary tho. Overall I probably wouldn't go back, the house was really good!"
1391215,51535389,2015-10-21,42231977,Luis Miguel,"Es una casa muy confortable y tal como aparece en las fotos, además el barrio es muy tranquilo con una estación del metro a sólo 3 cuadras. Si tuviera la oportunidad de volver a Boston trataría de ponerme en contacto con Hermina de nuevo."
1391215,52220623,2015-10-27,39639931,Ralph & Vanessa,Room E is basicly just a bed...but a really good one and that's all i needed.
1391215,52458144,2015-10-29,47230670,Shirleyher,"It is just like return home when I get at the house: the road instruction is precise, digital lock is easy to use, no worry about disturbing others because all guest room is above the first floor. The room E is small just the same as the hostess told us and it won’t be a big problem for my husband and I. I tried to cancel the reservation because my friend told me the house located too far from downtown and Harvard where is our main touring site. We decided to try our luck when Hermina told us no funding if we cancel the reservation. Fortunately it is not bad choice to stay at this old , historic look house. It is really 3 minutes’ walk to the Cornerfield train station and we can buy milk and yoghourt from the food market nearby even at 9 pm. Walking outside in this area may be a little bit nervous for a single woman, but I still feel secured with accompany of my husband. Thank everything Hermina and her assistant Dona did for us."
1391215,53119609,2015-11-05,44772508,David,"Hermina is great at communicating by email, but was on vacation whilst we were staying at her house.  Donna, her house manager was present, and was very friendly and helpful (and deserves a gold medal (and bonus!) for clearing up after a previous guest apparently threw up on a bed after a Halloween night party!!)."
The property is as described,but all the rooms seemed to be let,and it felt more like a hostel or old-fashioned English seaside boarding house than any other Airbnb that I've visited (little notes posted everywhere,saying do this,and don't do that!).  Only one upstairs toilet,shower
Coffee,herbal teas,a few slices of bread,and cereals provided for breakfast,but no milk or butter/spread,though there was honey
I was able to park in the driveway which was a bonus,"and the red-line T is a short walk away.\"",,,,

1391215,54156485,2015-11-16,39284881,Daniel,Good location and very handy for local transport. Good instructions on how to find the house. Hermina was away but her house manager was available. Room E was tiny not cosy but was changed for a larger nice room. Great house amenities which included breakfast. Would definitely stay again.
1391215,54465896,2015-11-20,48512707,Shisong,"Hermina has a very lovely house. I like it very much. The checking in procedures were quite smooth. I could find smart instructions wherever I need it. Her house is close to the Red Line train station (Fields Corner). It was a wonderful experience to live in Hermina's house. A conversation with her by the end of my first trip to Boston made me feel really welcomed to the city. All the best to you, Hermina."
1391215,54726142,2015-11-23,35826101,Risa,Hermina is really welcoming person and her house is really cozy and comfortable!
The direction she gave me was clear to understand,and I could arrive there without any problem. Also,her house is really close to the Fields Corner Station (Red Line).,,,
She provided breakfast too. (bread,cereal,milk,coffee,tea,and so on)
After I got her house,I knew my friend stayed in the another room,so I asked Hermina if I could change my room or not,and she accepted my offer kindly.,,

She let us check in later than planned and was always willing to give directions and suggestions on what to do in the city. The house is organized, clean and well located. There are plenty of dining options nearby and the subway station is just a four-minute walk away. The neighborhood is calm and safe. The bedroom where we stayed was a bit small, but it's enough for two people. All in all, Hermina's place is an outstading place to stay!"

1391215,65130618,2016-03-10,61721749,Brian,Hermina was a gracious host. She even made me tea after a long day of walking around Boston. Don't believe everything you hear about Dorchester. The east side of this neighborhood felt perfectly safe to me. It was very convenient being that close to the red line on the metro.
1391215,70889185,2016-04-21,393564,Jim,"Hermina provided a pleasant & comfortable stay, again, during the hectic Marathon week.  It's a peaceful refuge with interesting guests from around the world."
"Hermina is very attentive and is readily available (phone/text) for those sudden questions even when at work.  She is very \"\"easy-going\"\" and as accommodating of special requests as possible.",,,,,
The neighborhood has improved every year.  From the beginning,6-years ago,"I have not felt threatened or even \"\"hit up\"\" for a hand-out even when wheeling large luggage from the \"\"T\"\" late at night---something that would make me a \"\"target\"\" in my home San Francisco/Oakland area.",,,
Several new establishments this year have made good coffee,breakfasts,burgers & dinners readily available.,,,
The local supermarket (3-minutes walk) stocks more high quality produce each visit (my 5th in 6-years).,,,,,
"Downtown & Cambridge are easily accessed by the local \"\"T\"\" subway (just 5-min slow walk away) or E-Z on/off the #93 expressway.  Logan Terminal #1 only 35-min \"\"T\"\" away during 5:00PM (1700) weekday commute time.",,,,,

1391215,71443631,2016-04-25,32875993,Eli,Hermina was a lovely host! Great combination of being there when needed and also not inserting herself in. And the hamburger-y thing she gave me was yummy!
The neighborhood feels a bit dodgy walking through it at 11:00 PM,"but it was really fine. Nobody bothered me at all.\"",,,,
1391215,73472418,2016-05-08,56464930,Neeraj,Hermina is very friendly. We had great chats & she even cooked Armenian food one day. The house is beautiful & located 2 minutes walk from the subway. The room was clean & the house seemed full of AirBnB'ers ... I would highly recommend staying with Hermina to anyone visiting Boston.
1391215,75205656,2016-05-19,70161228,Elisabeth,"It was a wonderful stay! Hermina is incredibly nice, we sometimes had dinner together. The house is very cozy, many rooms, you see a lot of guests coming and going. The neighborhood is mainly Asian, its clean, safe and close to the subway. I would choose Hermina's place over a hotel any time! Definitely coming back when in Boston."

Since it was my first time in Boston, my trip was more pleasant because of her kind hospitality and also the fact that commuting to and fro from the house was so easy as it was just less than 5 minute by-walk from the Red Line and is a very safe area !!! Anybody who is visiting Boston, I definitely recommend you to stay here !"
1391215,77826104,2016-06-03,7100353,Cathleen,"Hermina's place is minutes away from the Red T line, and hence very easy to get to the South train and bus stations from. It's also not far from the airport. The neighborhood is quiet, the bed very comfortable. Hermina is friendly and has decorated her house nicely. The room was sizable. When United bumped me from a flight, causing me to arrive in the middle of the night, Hermina accomodated me."

1391215,93571754,2016-08-13,71796339,Jesse,This is a great place to stay for anyone visiting boston.  Hermina is very welcoming.  The place is clean and it is very close to the beach and walking distance to the train into boston.
1391215,94219707,2016-08-15,67105559,Nicole,My boyfriend and I booked Hermina's place a few weeks in advance of Comic Con. She responded almost instantly to approve my request and she provided a very affordable place to stay in Boston.
Positives - Her home is located a short five minute walk from the Fields Corner T-Station,which can take you anywhere in Boston pretty quickly and affordably. That was key to our trip and our ability to navigate the city.,,,,
We came in after check in time and she was totally fine with it. She messaged me well in advance with information on how to find the home and how to get in. Hermina herself seems like a very lovely woman.,,,,,
For Comic Con weekend,when thousands of other people were probably looking to find a place to stay in the city,Hermina's listing was the most affordable and made it financially possible for us to stay in Boston.,,,
Negatives - Our first issue was with parking. This is not the first time this has happened to us with Airbnb,"but when the amenities list \"\"Free Parking","\"\" it meant free possible on-street parking. There seems to be a space in the driveway",but it was unclear if we could use it and she had us park on the street. We were lucky to find a spot,but just be prepared.,
The location can seem a little sketchy initially (especially some neighborhoods you pass through to get there),but we did not have any problems. There are some cool restaurants nearby (totally recommend the Irish pup around the corner) and we did not have any issues walking around. The road is very loud,however,from your room,so expect it to be noisy while you're sleeping.,
Along those lines,it was 90 degrees and humid while we were there and the room offered no real fan or air conditioner. There's a ceiling fan that was rather ineffectual,so we were forced to keep the windows open (which,of course,did not help with the aforementioned noise issue).,
The room (which was not photographed accurately in the listing) was small - a full size bed that you could only access from one side,an end table,and a chair. Hermina also did not allow us to lock it while we were gone,"assuring us there was \"\"no need.\"\" We used room E",the last room down the hall. There seem to be other rooms available in the home,which can hold many additional people.
Expect to share one bathroom with however many additional people are staying with you. One morning I had to cut my shower short because another family's child was standing outside pounding on the door and screaming. We did not have too many issues sharing the bathroom,but during busier times,it could get crowded.,,,
Overall,the room met our needs. It was a space to sleep and Hermina is a welcoming,"lovely woman. Just be prepared for the realities of the room. \"",,,

1881180,11194188,2014-03-24,12847341,Joshua,"Even though it is located in a secondary area of the city, the apartment of Nate and Danielle was experienced, by my parents, as an ambient of warmth and welcome, where they felt at home. The house, in fact, is well-defined in terms of its inside architecture, characterized by very spaceful rooms that communicate and that, at the same time, make of the rent room a private space. The room is very nice. It is luminous, and it is connected to an outside bathroom that my parents found very clean and manageable."
Nate and Danielle,then,left my parents completely free to use the kitchen and the entire house,"welcoming them with delicious cakes that made the experience \"\"more delicious\"\".",,

At first we were admittedly a little apprehensive about staying in a room of someone's house, since we always rented private apartments, but they were sooo incredibly welcoming and let is do our thing, but we're also totally available to chat and give advice about the city, etc..

They live in a fairly quiet residential area and their apartment was gorgeous. Their elderly cat, Prudence, was also very friendly when she was awake. Since we only stayed one night and our flights the day before and bus the next day were both delayed we didn't see Danielle and Nate too much, but they laid out light breakfast foods and instructions and even entrusted us with a set of keys for the night.

I'm Deaf so I was thrilled that they both knew sign language and I was able to chat with Danielle all day on the first day we arrived.  Nate knew a few sign language but I think he is really shy.. :),,,,,
We also communicated a few days before we arrived there so I think that was very nice of them.,,,,,
If we were coming back,we would love to stay at their place again.,,,,
Oh! Their place is not that far away from the subway and walking through the neighbourhood was so beautiful and safer (even at nights) than we thought.,,,,,
They made sure that we could feel like their place is also ours so we could help ourselves but we ended up staying in the downtown all day/night though.,,,,,
For Deaf community,if you are looking for a place that is Deaf friendly - you have to book their place because this place is perfect for the open space however you will need to bring your alarm clock tho.  You could ask them anything in sign language :),,,,

Kate is a very nice hostess who chats with you and gives you some guide to Boston when needed and lets you be.  Her house is clean and small, yet we didn't need to use all the rooms such as the reading room.  It's pleasant to stay in a house and enjoy some air in the back yard rather than confined to a hotel room.  We felt like we were coming home after a day of roaming around in Boston.  The children enjoyed Kate's 2 cats, Plum is sweet, and Moth is nice most of the time."

She let us help ourselves to food in the kitchen etc. Her kids were there for our last night there and that was fine as well.  As Kate wrote in my review, there was a problem with the shower head the day we arrived but that got fixed promptly.  The tub though, was very slow to drain.  Kate warned us that one of her cats was friendly, and my friend unfortunately got scratched 3 times and I got a small rip in my leather jacket.  Kate's art is beautiful and hangs throughout the house. Getting to the transit is relatively easy, about a 15 minute walk to the closest subway station."

Kate does have two very sweet cats, as other reviewers have mentioned.  I'm mildly allergic, but I didn't have any problems.  I did notice a bit of a \"\"cat smell\"\" at first"
The only real downside is that the place is a bit out of the way (a 12-15 minute walk from the T).  Frankly,I'd recommend renting a car if you'll be traveling around the city,particularly at night.  Boston cabs are fairly expensive ($40-50 from Cambridge,$15-20 from the North End,$45 from the airport),so you'll end up spending roughly the same amount on a cheap car rental.

There are 5 bedrooms/rooms to sleep in,each with double,2 single,foldout sofa options. Kitchen is good for preparing meals too.,,
There are two resident cats to share the house with. Great if you are a cat lover. If you are not then this house may not be for you.,,,,,
Kate was great to deal with,"we emailed before and during our stay and Kate was able to share some of the local attractions with us. \"",,,,

We found it very generous and trusting that she left her flat to us .We were allowed to use everything.We liked the rooms-very comfortable and enough space for us five and enjoyed the presence of the cats.
169430,1752002,2012-07-20,1972028,Ben,"We were 2 families in the house. Kate let us bring in our stuff early as the cleaners were finishing, which helped us out. The house is very cute and had enough room for all of us. The neighborhood is great and the (free) community pool across the street was popular with our kids. It was very hot outside, but there are small window a/c units in 2 of the upstairs bedrooms that work well. The kitchen has an attached deck, so we would feed the kids inside with the adults out, plenty of room. We had a great time!"

169430,1866667,2012-08-02,1808234,Allison,"Kate was a wonderful host!  She replied to all my emails promptly with my many questions!  This was our first airbnb experience and I would have to say it was a good one.  Kate's home was very clean and she was so accommodating with respect to our arrival and departure times.  There were 6 of us staying there and we were under the impression that it would just be us in the home, so were a little uneasy when Kate was actually staying there too, having her friends over also.  We felt as though we were intruding and didn't want to disrupt them.  Like I said, this was our first airbnb experience so we are not sure if it's the same for all rentals?  Her cats were very friendly and cute.  It was easy to walk to the subway, although after dark we always took a taxi to and from downtown (under $20).  We were a bit hesitant to walk around the neighborhood at night!  Kate even had food in the fridge for us for breakfast!  :)"

We knew from the start  there was only one bathroom, so we managed it pretty well. Bedrooms are all air conditionned but there is a natural airflow in the house with the windows opened. Everything was clean, in good order, worked properly. The cats were adorable. The balcony much appreciated as they were some really hot days of summer. Everything was pretty and the whole house is very well decorated. communication with Kate was good, and she was really fast at answering my questions. The free parking was safe. The area was pretty with all the Victorian houses. Subway was a 10 minutes walk from the home, right by a grocery store, a liquor store and some restaurants. I'm sorry my 3 days trip hasn't left me much time to visit and enjoy Jamaica Plain, but i'm sure I would have loved it. I would stay there again and again!!! Thanks a lot Kate :)"

Kate's house was very busy: a lot of personal stuff: Fridge was full with expired/rotten food, bedding was very old and dirty overall. Her response was very slow. When I asked about super hot temperature in her house, all she cares about was her cats( I have a 1 year old baby, it was very uncomfortable for him to stay in that temperature all the time).  For me, no A/C in the house is not a big deal as long as temperature is manageable. However the kitchen was like an oven. She has very very small fan in the Kitchen which didn't help with cooling down the temperature at all. She didn't not keep her words about the price she could offer me, she even complain that I negotiated."

I read other reviews, some said that the neighborhood did not appeal them and they used taxi to get home at nights, but we did not have bad feeling and used the T (metro) after dark. Respect the guidelines about the cats!

The most important features for us in this trip were comfortable sleeping arrangements, a working heater, and easy access to public transportation; and this listing provided them all! To add to that, and also one of my favorite aspects, there was a nice theater room with a large TV and couch which provided ample space for us to lounge in. The host was always available to answer questions and was very accommodating."
The one thing our group had a problem with during the stay is receiving noise complaints from the tenants of the first floor of the apartment and the host. We weren't shouting or dancing around,but we were having late night conversations and laughing to each other's jokes. We were also hushed by the host the night before the morning we departed as we were packing. It's completely understandable on their end,however it is just worth mentioning for any group in the future that would like to be at least slightly rowdy during the night. We were a large group of college students,and we would have liked to have a little more fun during the nights. We were a special case,and I would still highly recommend this place to anyone! I probably won't be coming back again with a group next year for the competition,however I would come again if it was in other company

169430,36377473,2015-06-28,10117390,Mike,"We fell in love with Kate's Victorian, and this little corner of Boston that's off the beaten path but easily accessible from the city center."
Kate's home is incredibly cozy,well-maintained and clean. It's also extremely practical – with plenty of space for kids and a well-equipped and spacious kitchen and balcony.,,,,
The place is very well-decorated and furnished – one of those places that feels so comfortable you don't want to leave.,,,,,
Kate is the ideal host. Attentive,available and extremely friendly.,,,,
"Highly recommended! \"",,,,,
169430,37450600,2015-07-07,4965270,Sven,"We had a great stay at Kate's place . Very convenient location , the T into the city is real easy . Lots of fruit and breakfast available . Kate is a very nice person . Great stay overall ."
169430,38476354,2015-07-16,2552815,Sylvie,"Kate was à charming host.  The house was very clean,  with comfortable beds and a well equiped kitchen.  About 12 minutes walk from the T, the location is perfect to get anywhere in the city.  We would gladly come back on a future visite to Boston."
"\"",,,,,
169430,39473780,2015-07-24,5141293,David,"Kate est une hôte exceptionnelle. Malgré son absence, elle a répondu à toutes nos questions et donné de très bons conseils pour notre séjour."
Ses deux chats sont agréables et de vraies patapoufs.,,,,,
Sa maison est décorée avec énormément de goût et très agréable à vivre en famille. La cuisine et les salles de bains sont très propres et totalement équipées. Les chambres sont spacieuses et les lits de bonne tenue.,,,,,
Le quartier de Roxbury est difficile à définir. Quartier Black,avec voitures de luxe et certaines maisons délabrées. Quartier vivant avec match de basket le soir mais aussi courses de motos sur Martin Luther King bvd. Nous avions une voiture ce qui facilitait beaucoup de déplacement vers le centre (15 min).,,,,
"Encore merci à Kate pour ce séjour. Nous espérons vivement  la rencontrer lors de notre prochain séjour à Boston. \"",,,,,
169430,40197366,2015-07-29,9321758,Dorothée,Nous avons passé un merveilleux séjour chez Kate. La maison était grande et fidèle aux photos.
"Merci Kate\"",,,,,
169430,41577992,2015-08-08,17483972,Delphine,"La maison de kate était parfaite pour notre famille (trois enfants de 11, 9 et 7 ans). Elle est spacieuse, conforme à la description et aux photographies publiées sur le site. Elle est très confortable et équipée de tout ce qu'il faut pour voyager en famille (notamment dans la cuisine). il y a la clim dans les chambre ce qui est vraiment appréciable l'été."
L'acceuil de Kate est très agréable et nous avons cohabité quelques jours en toute tranquillité.,,,,,
Le quartier est sympathique même si il est un peu bruyant les soirs de match de basket mais c'est tout à fit supportable et cela s'arrête tôt.,,,,,
"La présence des chats est également sans soucis.\"",,,,,
169430,41932532,2015-08-10,9658861,Xiaohua,"Perfect host! Help us to solve many problem. Beautiful and clean house and nice location. If have chance to Washington DC again, we will select to live here again!"
169430,42505835,2015-08-14,27042756,Denis,"Maison bien située, grande et accueillante. Kate est très relax. Nous avons apprécié notre voyage à Boston."
169430,43602211,2015-08-21,26634050,Cedric,We were a 6 persons family staying in Boston for 6 days.
The house is really well placed,only 12 min walking to the orange line.,,,,
It is very comfortable,and well equipped.,,,,
Kate is a very nice person,doing everything to make your life easier,and giving good advices.,,,
"I strongly recommend to stay there if you want to discover Boston !\"",,,,,
169430,45920911,2015-09-07,44129,Elizabeth,"I rented Kate's home for my family to stay in during my wedding weekend. My family loved the space and found it very cozy and clean. They enjoyed the back porch and were surprised at how much space there was for just half of the house. They are from the suburbs in Ohio, so they were initially a little nervous about the neighborhood. And they had a little trouble with the cats. But otherwise, they were very happy with the space and had a great weekend."
169430,48162070,2015-09-24,28574213,Barbara,The house was very cosy and clean. The kitchen is very well equipped. When we arrived Kate   showed us everything  and offered a lot of information about the area . We had the apartment  on our own and during our stay she was very attentive. Kate is a great host. We enjoyed our  stay very much.
169430,51263371,2015-10-19,32732689,Julie,"A group of 9 of us descended onto Boston from London for the Head of the Charles regatta and could not have found a more welcoming home away from home. Kate provided everything you could ask for and more, all the amenities, some breakfast items to get us going in the morning after a long late flight and comfortable rooms throughout. Thank you Kate for making this part of a fantastic trip for all of us."
169430,58287531,2016-01-02,8291622,Jennifer,"The place was as described ,thoroughly enjoyed our stay and it felt like we were at home!! Charming house with heaps of character! Kate was a perfect host easily contacted and we would recommend staying at her lovely home !"
169430,65363363,2016-03-13,20286692,Tracie,Kate's home was lovely and very inviting. My family and I had a wonderful time Boston. She made everything very easy for us and even provided some light breakfast food to get us going l.
169430,68287430,2016-04-04,39821142,Teresa,"Kate was a very kind host, allowing us to use her printer and making sure that we had English tea. We didn't see her much but she kept in close contact by email. The house was good -- excellent shower, good kitchen and the beds were comfortable."
There are two things you need to know before you book this airbnb.,,,,,
1. you need to really love cats to stay here. One of the cats is very large,and a bit of a bully,though basically very friendly. He sits on all the surfaces (including in the kitchen) and when one of us tried to move him he bit. There is also a indoor litter tray off the kitchen,so it can get a bit smelly. Fortunately one of our party did love cats,so we made her deal with him!,
2. the area is still 'mixed'. Kate's house,and many others,are lovely but there is still some deprivation evident in Roxbury. I think that it was hard for us to judge risk correctly coming from the UK but I didn't feel comfortable walking the area in the dark,so took Uber after sundown. Kate's teenaged girls walk home from the T till 11 pm but I would have felt worried doing this,even in a group. My sense is that this is my perception rather than any real threat but it's not something I would put to the test. If you have a car it would be a different matter.,
All in all,though,"if you love cats and either have a car or are more comfortable with mixed areas this is an excellent airbnb in all other ways and I would recommend it.\"",,,
169430,69359231,2016-04-11,16763749,Aurimas,"Kate welcomed us nicely, my travel plans changed and we had to have extra people over, but she figured it out for us in a timely manner. Initially I was looking for a whole place and she was present for a little while, but did not cause any discomfort. She was a nice and pleasant host!"
169430,70639377,2016-04-19,33355452,Danielle,"The host made us feel so welcomed. The house was a really great space for the 8 of us. Her furnishings were very modern, and up-to- date. It was really close to downtown and a short walk to the subway. The cats were SUPER friendly too!"
"\"",,,,,
169430,74551398,2016-05-15,54105597,Antoni,"Well, what can I say? As a first time Airbnber, I valued transparency and communication during the booking process and that's exactly what we got and then some."
Any question we had before or during the trip was answered promptly.,,,,,
My parents who are in their 60s and 70s were skeptical of the whole Airbnb process,but a personalized 'welcome' message written on a small chalkboard  made them feel right at home.,,,,
When the listing says it can sleep (URL HIDDEN) not a lie. We were 8 and slept super comfortably.,,,,,
House was fully equipped as described and very clean.,,,,,
Location: We enjoyed being a 15 min drive away from essentially everywhere lol...Though I'm sure the subway station is a great alternative as well. And the nearby basketball court had me and my brothers doing early morning workouts almost every day.,,,,,
I had read a review about the area not feeling safe before my family got there and it gave me cause for pause,but I got no such vibe.,,,,
The neighbourhood is cozy. It is lively during the day with many ppl playing basketball and tennis at the nearby park,but during my time there it was very quiet at night.,,,,
Neighbours were friendly constantly said hi to me and my family when we would walk by,but they otherwise kept to themselves really. And that includes the person who rents a unit in this building.,,,,
Cats were nice and no hassle. One of them  often wanted to leave the house. We just made sure to let them the next day with food waiting for them. The other was super shy lol. If you don't see him at all during your stay,don't worry --- you didn't lose him. He's just a stealth master.,,,,
All in all,it was my first time in Boston and it won't be the last.,,,,
And with Airbnb sometimes being hit or miss I presume,"it's very likely I return to this lovely home.\"",,,,
169430,77120965,2016-05-30,42621098,Anastasia,"Kate's home was wonderful! Seven of us split it very comfortably. The house was very well appointed and beautifully decorated with Kate's art. Kate recommended numerous nearby attractions, and we loved our sandwiches grabbed at City Feed and Supply in Jamaica Plain. Moth the cat was a charm and provided love and entertainment. (Plum remained a bit more hidden during our stay). The neighborhood was quite lively, with numerous cultures represented over a very short distance. Public transit was readily available using the orange line of the T back and forth to the airport. Truly Kate's home was a great find, and we would definitely stay here again!"
169430,79367061,2016-06-12,27821620,Rich,"The house is awesome, big and spacious and fun to be around! The cats are precisely as described! It's not too far from the T and there are some good places for breakfast if you're willing to do a bit of walking. I'd recommend it fully if you're in a group!"
169430,85456378,2016-07-11,42798332,Guillermo,"Kate got everything as expected. She was nice and well communicated with us. However, there was very little space in the fridge and in the bathrooms for us to put our things. Also, there was a cat and food smell in the kitchen that could bother some people. Cats weren't that friendly and it took us a a while (and a few conversations with Kate) to manage them."
169430,89057598,2016-07-26,12142212,Prabhakar,"Kate was a very good host, answered immediately and the overall experience was very good. Loved the cats."
169430,92695481,2016-08-09,35787357,Jason,Kate's property was as described and she was there to meet us on arrival with a fridge of breakfast provisions which was really helpful to get us started.
The bedrooms were fine for our family of five with air A/C units in each bedroom which were certainly needed as it has been one of the hottest summers.,,,,,
The T was easy to find and only a 12 min walk away so getting into the centre of Boston was really easy. The area is a little run down but didn't feel in anyway threatening when walking around.,,,,,
The only negative to bear in mind is the outside noise from the park/basketball courts very near by. It didn't really quieten down to after 11 which wasn't great for our children - but we do live in a semi-rural location back home in the UK and don't have slot of noise.,,,,,
We mainly ate in town but would recommend Bella Luna on Amory St - funky location and great food.,,,,,
We didn't see Kate during the rest of our stay but she kept in contact regularly to check everything was ok.,,,,,
The cats were around but no problem.,,,,,
Would recommend Kate's house.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
169430,93438453,2016-08-12,81986632,Xinya,"It's a comfortable and sweet house. The hostess was there when we were living,she is very kind and nice,also her cats are,they are cute and friendly!The location is near by downtown,if you have car or take Uber that will be very convenient. The neighbor is quiet and safe. We had a wonderful time here!"
169430,98539098,2016-08-31,13002013,Sophie,"We were a large, 2-family group of 9 people - 4 adults and 5 kids - so Kate's place was spacious and comfortable for us, with its two bathrooms, a well-equipped kitchen, and comfortable beds."
As Kate says in her description,grocery shopping would be easier with a car. For us,without a car and with small children,the station,shops and restaurants were a bit of a hike - especially uphill on the way back.,
The narrow and winding staircases - one up to the apartment itself (after the external steps to the porch ),and the set to the top floor,might be difficult for people with mobility issues and/or heavy luggage,but it is an older building with all the creaks and charm that go with it.,,
The apartment has basic window-mounted  airconditioning which maintained a comfortable temperature at night.,,,,,
We expected toiletries to be supplied - not an unreasonable expectation - but the soap dispensers,shampoo and conditioner bottles were empty or so low as to not work when pumped.,,,,
The neighbourhood is not the most salubrious but we never felt unsafe,"and generally enjoy staying in localities with a bit of \"\"life\"\".",,,,
The cats,Moth and Plum,were no trouble at all,and kept a low profile while we were there. There was a bit of a smell where the cats litter is kept,but that's not a room we needed to use,so it was not a big deal.
A nice place overall,"with a few minor issues\"",,,,
60356,8646231,2013-11-10,9726755,Daniel,"My wife and I moved from Portland OR to Boston. We found an apartment, but could not move in for a week and found ourselves scrambling to find a place to stay. We are very happy to have found this apartment and Anne."
PROS,,,,,
+ The location is fantastic.,,,,,
+ Anne is a very responsive host and helped us get settled quickly despite a narrow window of time.,,,,,
CONS,,,,,
- During our stay,the shower head in the shower was leaking quite badly,which led to a barely serviceable shower.,,,
- Though the apartment was clean,"I do not recommend it for anyone with bad allergies as the dust and particles in the air caused a bad flare up for my wife (despite medication).\"",,,,

It was so convenient, located just off of the Boston Commons, and within walking distance to the T-stop and many downtown Boston attractions.  Anne was a great hostess, and made us feel welcome.  The apartment was very comfortable, and offered everything we'd need for our stay."
60356,86225348,2016-07-15,58379502,Cindy,Fantastic location overlooking Boston Common.  Five minute walk from red and blue T lines (uphill on return to apartment).  Apartment felt very safe.  Building has concierge working at main door.  Fantastic internet and cable tv.  Fun to just people watch out the window from up high.  Plenty of restaurants near by.  Small convenience store two doors down. Great communication from Anne.  We really enjoyed this place and would definitely recommend it to others.

Made last minute plans to visit Boston. Couldn't find accommodation. Her place apparently was a rare find according to Airbnb,since it is always booked.,,,,
It was a train and bus ride from south station,where I got down. But,she was very kind and responsive to my calls and messages explaining where to get down,which buses to take ( I was new to the place). It was a short,one night visit. The room was very clean and she was a wonderful host.,
"Will surely drop by when I visit again.\"",,,,,

7842550,49018792,2015-09-30,24280271,Bhavesh,I didnt much use the house except for sleeping in night. Overall good place at this price. The room didnt have fan and bathroom shower was not working properly. The place is close to subway and bus stops but walking through the streets seemed scary especially after dark.
7842550,49249971,2015-10-02,41914436,Maria,"Sarah is a nice and friendly, open minded person, she made me feel home. I could use the kitchen for cooking and got everything I need for the two days I stayed. With the busses and the orange line you are quite fast in town. A grocery store is also just near by. The room is huge and very clean, the same as the bath and the kitchen and common areas. As I stayed just for two nights I couldn't really check out the neighborhood, so I don't know if there are any nice places to go or if it is safe to come home late."
7842550,49556997,2015-10-04,45356681,Bertrand,Un bon accueil de Sarah qui sait être à la fois avenante et discrète pour laisser une indépendance appréciable. Que de bons conseils !
7842550,49937233,2015-10-07,19477116,Denice Louie,"Sarah's place is a great place to crash, for anyone who is travelling light. There were some pros and cons to staying with her, but overall II enjoyed it as a light traveller. It was definitely valued at the right price."
Pros:,,,,,
Sarah was great at accommodating my check in. She made sure to communicate well and was very sweet upon my arrival. She provided extra blankets in case it got cold at night so I was able to sleep comfortably. In the room she provided wireless information and she was flexible with the checkout process. The room itself was clean and tidy and very spacious.,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
The neighbor was a lot more etchy than I expected. Although parking is free,it was somewhat difficult to find a spot. Her Wifi (for those of you who will be needing Wifi) was extremely slow. Also,her shower wasn't working properly when I was there,"which made showering difficult. \"",,
7842550,50112217,2015-10-09,44878607,Oliver,Sarah is a very nice and helpful host. She responded very quickly to our messages.
The room was really clean and spacious. The kitchen provided everything one needs for cooking. Plus there is a great grocery store nearby (5 min).,,,,,
There are a few options to get to the downtown like busses,the T-orange line and the commuter rail which are quite fast. Regarding the neighborhood there is nothing bad that happened to us,but at night it is a little scary to walk around.,,,
Overall we mostly used the apartment over night to sleep and just stayed for two nights,"but for this it was a nice stay. \"",,,,

7842550,54347742,2015-11-18,47519018,Toyiah,"I worried about the neighborhood due to multiple reviews. To my surprise it was fine. If you need a quaint, suburban neighborhood to feel safe in then you'll probably think Sarah's neighborhood is sketchy. But as a single female walking the streets at night I felt relatively safe. It's a well lit neighborhood with a good mix of multicultural families, it has a very Queens, NY feel to it. However,"
I didn't feel warmly welcomed and there was a lack of communication in general about amenities like the broken toilet and broken shower. I understand that Sarah was just getting off work and dealing with her kid when I made it back in,"but overall the whole experience made me wish I spent $20 less at a hostel that was listed and not as far out from the main parts of the city. \"",,,,

I walked the two blocks to the grocery store (and Dunkin Donuts shop) in the dark, and the neighborhood was fine, its a regular urban working class feel.  Enough overnight street parking nearby to make things easy.  A great choice when needing a place in Boston."

7842550,80406397,2016-06-18,45473362,Stephanie,Sarah and her daughter were lovely! We didn't really love the location as we saw many homeless people and heard many sirens. The cab driver even said it was not the best neighborhood. We loved the hosts but wished they lived in a different location.
7842550,82367987,2016-06-27,3400769,Allan,"Really nice place, Sarah was very responsive to messages which help us a lot, because I booked another apartment downtown, but when I arrived the host wasn't there and didn't answer my calls, so we have to run to get another place and 30 mins later we were on Sarah's place."
"Thank you so much Sarah\"",,,,,
7842550,84115565,2016-07-05,10922937,Lily,"Host welcomed us at the door and was very good at communicating amenities both within the house and the area. Her daughter is very well behaved and not at all an issue. She was helpful and friendly and checked in with us often to see how our stay was going. Host was able to recommend what bus lines to use, restaurants and events."
The neighbourhood is on the seedier side but we had no trouble and the buses are frequent.,,,,,
"The beds were comfortable and the air conditioning was a great touch!\"",,,,,
7842550,86247625,2016-07-15,62446356,Duncan,"Great host and a lovely place. Was made to feel welcome but at the same time had plenty of space to myself. Would happily go here again, its very easy to get into the centre of Boston and an interesting area by itself."
7842550,89204532,2016-07-27,36693827,Xin,"Nice house,safe,clean,quiet,I had good sleep.Sarah is very kindly."
7842550,92728078,2016-08-09,80445870,Albin,Sarah is a warm hearted host. She proactively asked me if I have any difficulties and recommended me the good places.
Her mother and her daughter are also polite.,,,,,
The place is every safe and quiet,not like some guests said being not safe or other situation.,,,,
We can park our car along the road.,,,,,
We used her refrigerator and microwave oven frequently.,,,,,
"We spent four days there and had a very good time there. We hope to meet Sarah next time.\"",,,,,

7842550,93353171,2016-08-12,80079840,Alex,"Sarah is a fantastic host. Made my visit to Boston very easy. She even had the AC running before I arrived! It's easy to get to and from her place to downtown Boston, and other attractions. Would definitely recommend again."
7842550,94094177,2016-08-14,72469557,Maxime,Super première expérience avec Airbnb !
Sarah a été une hôte incroyable,elle a répondue très rapidement à mes messages et elle a été surtout très accueillante ! Nous ne sommes pas resté très longtemps mais elle a su nous rendre à l'aise !,,,,
Oui,le quartier peut paraitre,à première vue,inquiétant surtout pour deux personnes qui ne viennent pas de la grande ville comme ma copine et moi. Mais l’accueil de Sarah nous a tout de suite mit en confiance.,,
L'air climatisé dans la chambre qui avait déjà commencé à refroidir la pièce à notre arrivé nous a beaucoup plu ! Les deux lits sont très confortable et très propre,tout comme l'appartement en général. Si nous avions put rester plus longtemps à Boston nous aurions aimés rester dans l'appartement de Sarah.,,,,
Nous avons pu nous trouver très facilement un stationnement et il facile de se rendre partout en ville à partir de chez Sarah.,,,,,
Merci Sarah pour ton hospitalité !,,,,,

7842550,96226509,2016-08-22,57477452,Hillary,The host & family were so incredibly nice. The room was clean and spacious and they were so friendly and sweet! I loved it there. Very welcoming and thoughtful people!
7842550,96808765,2016-08-24,5526644,Charlotte,"Nice, colorful and clean room with a great welcoming team. Thanks Sarah!"

7842550,97647194,2016-08-28,82842727,Alberto,Sarah was really nice and help us whenever we needed it. The room was clean and the bed were really comfortable. It just took us 25 min to get to the center of Boston. I really recomend this place.
7842550,99335274,2016-09-04,46139885,Nico,Sarah is very kindly and the room is really cozy and comfortable...
It's really near at the commuter rail station,so with almost 25 minutes you can arrive in the centre of Boston City.,,,,
I higly recommend this host and this room.,,,,,
"Thank you Sarah!\"",,,,,
11946029,68595388,2016-04-05,44121936,Isabelle,The listing was accurate. Check in was easy and room was quant and clean. I didn't spend much time there but it was a great place to drop my stuff and sleep for a night or two.
11946029,72668057,2016-05-04,17620623,Vincent,"The place was about two blocks off the T (orange line) which was convenient. I don't think the Harvard stop in Cambridge was anymore than 25 minutes, including wait times, and that would be counted as a longer journey. We didn't stay in town for long, so we didn't hang out in the neighborhood much, but we did walk to the Samuel Adams brewery tour and it wasn't much more than 15 minutes. Boston is really compact."
Joe and Sara were accommodating and even left my girlfriend and I a welcome card with a list of things to do in Jamaica Plain. If we'd have been in town more than 36 hours,we would've loved to check some of those places out.,,,,
The room was everything you'd expect. The bed was large and comfortable and everything was tidy. They had A/C or a space heater available if we had needed them. The bathroom was also very clean. As for the kitchen,it had a pretty cool view of the city,and I would say it was the coolest room in the house. Joe and Sara weren't around much when we stayed so I definitely got to satisfy my inner-neighborhood nerdness and stared out of that window from time to time.,,,
"It was just a really nice place to stay. \"",,,,,
11946029,73375816,2016-05-08,48686570,Peter,"We enjoyed staying with Joe.  The bedroom was clean, comfortable, and had great natural sunlight.  The rest of the apartment was also clean, warm, and pleasant.  Joe and his wife had even left a nice welcome note for us along with a chocolate bar when we arrived.  The location was near several good restaurants and cafes and less than a 5 minute walk from the MBTA Orange Line stop.  Our flight out of Boston was in the evening, and Joe allowed us to store our bags at the apartment past the normal checkout time."
11946029,75549710,2016-05-22,48190666,David,"There was a fantastic welcome, very friendly hosts. It's a lovely flat so don't be put off by the outside! The room was light and airy and who doesn't like to arrive to chocolate and a handwritten note? My only issue is that my schedule meant I couldn't stay for longer and properly enjoy the place."
11946029,80569047,2016-06-19,68634328,Lucy,"The room was very clean, the apartment was in a great location (close to restaurants and the T), and pretty quiet. Joe was very quick to respond to my message and helped make my first AirBnB a great experience!"
11946029,92496562,2016-08-08,31884270,Jan,"We had a bit unreliable commute and our ETA kept changing all the time, Joe was very welcoming and met us at the time and location most convenient for us to hand over the keys. Beautiful apartment with easy commute to the city centre. Everything we could need was provided for us, comfortable bed, clean sheets, and as a nice bonus we had the opportunity to meet Alfred, super excited and friendly dog."
11946029,93974488,2016-08-14,53807629,Esben,Joe and Sarah made me feel real welcome and I totally recommend to all to check it out when in Jamica Plain
11946029,98745235,2016-09-01,54298768,Benedikt,"I spent a great weak at Joes and Saras appartment. If you are in Boston and need a place to stay, I would definitely recommend Joe and Sara!"
6552654,37891354,2015-07-11,13602709,Anyssa,"The apartment is beautiful and Jeff was very accommodating. We spent our days exploring the neighborhoods around the apartment, and I would definitely book this apartment again."
6552654,38064982,2015-07-12,4144179,Sean,"The neighborhood and building were extremely nice and quiet. Recently renovated and very orderly. We had to push back check in time due to almost 2 hours of traffic, but the management service was extremely accommodating, allowing check in almost 2.5 hours after initial set up time. The room was in fact a studio, but posting seemed like a living room and bedroom, but it was a one room with murphy bed. Worked out well for a couple spending the night. Bed was comfortable also. All the amenties were very clean, and well stocked. Our check out was prompted by management member knocking. I should have confirmed a check out time, but there was not a set time. Either way, it worked out great and would recommend it to any 1-2 person party."
"Thanks!\"",,,,,
6552654,38406107,2015-07-15,35072079,Laura,"Lovely studio apartment in a great neighborhood.  Nice walking distance to the T.  The apartment was clean and my husband and I appreciated the welcome packet, snacks, and water."
6552654,39054372,2015-07-20,7288800,Jane,"Quaint Renovated Rowhouse was wonderful!  It is small but very efficient and a great bargain for the Boston traveler.  The location is superb...close to downtown, several T stations and great neighborhood restaurants.  Staying in one of the Rowhouse neighborhoods was a lovely experience.  My husband and I really enjoyed our stay.  Thanks, Jeff, for making us feel at home."
6552654,39545019,2015-07-24,35634829,Paul,"Everything was perfect, from the key hand-off to the very clean, comfy, conveniently-located apartment. Would definitely return."
6552654,39806201,2015-07-26,20687606,Kathy,"What a fantastic place to stay! Very cute neighborhood, quiet, yet an easy walk to back bay shops and restaurants. The place was clean, comfortable, exceeding my expectations. Host was very responsive and coordination of key pickup went smoothly with no surprises. Would definitely stay here again!"
6552654,40155034,2015-07-28,16469222,Beth,"Jeff was extremely responsive and helpful, both as I was planning my trip and once I had arrived in Boston. He even allowed us to leave our bags there the morning of our first day while we went out to sight-see. He had the pantry stocked with essentials and a couple of nice extras, and he even provided a reading lamp for us when we asked. The place is as described - very small, but well-designed with all new furniture and appliances. The location is perfect! It's a nice, quiet neighborhood feel, but easy to get to everything we wanted to check out, either walking or taking the subway. No need for a cab at all. I will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Boston."
6552654,40369899,2015-07-30,38339021,Joseph,"I was very pleased with my stay at this recently renovated brownstone between back bay and the south end. The location was fantastic and was perfect for my two day business trip. Check in was seamless as the management company met me right on-time to exchange keys. Despite having a pull down bed it was very comfortable, even for my 6'6 height. Thank you Jeff for a wonderful stay!"
6552654,40844420,2015-08-02,39449902,Yeji,"I really enjoyed my stay here. The neighborhood is very beautiful, and I had the pleasure of walking around and taking photos of the area. As the description says, the house is renovated and therefore, modern and clean. It is a small studio, but you'd have everything you need: AC, Wifi, kitchen, a high table, chairs, TV, bathroom, and bed. The place would be perfect for a couple or a single person. I especially appreciated the detailed packet that the host had prepared for me. It recommended great restaurants and places to visit in Boston and near Back Bay area. Also, the location is excellent. It's very close to Prudential center/ station and Massachusetts Ave station (orange line) and also the Back Bay station. I truly loved staying here :)"
6552654,41456079,2015-08-07,39085966,Joe,"A tremendous location, close to so many things while also quiet and tucked away. Very clean and comfortable, I certainly recommend this listing!"

6552654,42631177,2015-08-14,34685968,Lanier,"Great location, excellent welcome pack, one small room but so worth it.... We loved walking around the neighbourhood and heard some great music in the park..... The service that dealt with key handover etc was good. We would definitely stay here again."
6552654,44159621,2015-08-24,14814968,Lisa,"This studio apartment is in a great location!  It was really close to everything - easy walk to two subway stops, grocery stores nearby, and several restaurant options.  The studio is small, but it is very well setup with everything you need. The Murphy bed was quite comfortable and the room was clean.  Jeff was great at communication throughout the process and it was easy to check in and out.  Really appreciated the extra touches of bottled water, tea selections, and snacks waiting for me upon my arrival.  There's a decent bit of noise transfer between apartments in the building, but everything was nice and quiet during expected hours (~10pm - 6am).  Will certainly stay here again on a future trip to Boston!"
6552654,45613114,2015-09-04,42133954,Kristin,"Clean, lovely design, right in the middle of so many great things in Boston- it was a wonderful place to stay."

The neighborhood was fantastic. Cute and quaint,and accessible to lots of fun places – Newbury St.,Back Bay,Copely Square,as well as the subway. Super easy to get around.,
A lovely young man met me with the keys when I arrived. He was right on time. The apartment itself is small,"but has everything you could possibly need to be comfortable during your stay. Highly recommend!\"",,,,

6552654,48299043,2015-09-25,42112761,Jade,Boston is a really great city! We decided to take a 2hour Segway tour and it took us to all the major places you would see if you were traveling by foot. Jeffs place was smaller than expected(photos were a little deceptive) but that was ok as we didn't spend much time there. He gave us a detailed list of places and restaurants to see which was really helpful. Overall a really nice experience.
6552654,48482305,2015-09-26,26763061,Matt,The neighborhood was very convenient and the place was tidy and comfortable. Loved the coffee and chocolate!

"Highly recommended!\"",,,,,
6552654,49247029,2015-10-02,1368539,Weisen,Wonderful convenient place on a quiet street.  I flew into Boston on a redeye but Jeff was really accommodating to make sure I had a seamless experience getting into the unit at 5:30am.

6552654,49782130,2015-10-06,16396439,Adriana,"Perfect for our needs! It was a great AirBnB  first time experience and a great Boston weekend. The room is just as pictured. The apartment although owned by Jeff is managed by a separate company which were in contact with us the entire time. We arrived earlier than expected and someone was there waiting to give us the key. 2 sets of towels, keys and toiletries were provided with a welcome package (I thought was a nice touch)."
Location,location,location! The place is located 5 mins from the Prudential Center and within walking distance everywhere. A 10 min walk to Kenmore Square and Backbay. Note that there are 6 apartments in the building and the walls are paper thin. We didn't have any issues since we were only there to sleep.,,,
"Would def come back and stay again. \"",,,,,

Very well located,small,but complete with everything we needed.,,,
Clean,close to subway and several major attractions in the city,and cared for.,,,
Jeff was a great host answering  immediately all our questions  with  efficiency and we received everything as was announced. We could made our breakfast and lunch (couple of days) in the kitchen. Jeff prepare a nice reception with coffee,tea and other things.,,,,
Was a good opportunity to experience a few days in this nice apartment. We recommend it.,,,,,

Jeffs accommodation was clean, tidy and it was close to some great attractions in Boston (shopping and sightseeing). It also had everything you needed including hairdryer, fridge, coffee maker, iron etc. The street is so pretty and quiet with the key handover being quick and easy. We would definitely stay again is we were in the area."
6552654,53199393,2015-11-06,1892337,Jenn,"One of the best stays I have had via Airbnb. The place was clean and welcoming with all the essentials. It was just as good as staying at one of the overpriced, swanky hotels up the block. Everything was exactly as described and the extra treats were a great bonus. When I experienced issues with my luggage at the airport and was running late, it was great to be able to contact the 24-hour service to make alternative arrangements to get the keys. The welcome packet was very thorough and I ended up going to two of the restaurants recommended on the list, which made for some very pleasant meals and a lot less hassle. Will definitely be looking to come back if I'm in the area again and highly recommend it to others."
6552654,53504984,2015-11-09,44877935,Nicholas,"We had a great time staying at Jeff's apartment. The apartment is in an awesome location and the apartment itself is really nice. Jeff made checking in and checking out very simple and provided a great list to reference when it came to things like adjusting the temperature of the apartment, where things are stored if needed, and recommendations on places to check out. Jeff's model is a great example of what booking and traveling via airbnb should be. Highly recommend. A+!"
6552654,53939355,2015-11-14,34307599,Elissa,"Very cute little apartment with all the comforts of a hotel. There were towels on the bed upon our arrival, and little shampoo, conditioner, soap, and face wash. Definitely a small studio room apartment, but perfect for what we needed - a home base during or trip. Thanks Jeff!"
6552654,54137801,2015-11-16,19648261,Scott,"Nice area, perfect apartment for a few days in Boston - nice location, well stocked.  Great key delivery service, very responsive when I arrived an hour early."
6552654,54348713,2015-11-18,32655751,Liliana,"Jeff's cozy apartment is perfect for a visit to Boston. The space is bright and perfectly appointed with all amenities one might wish for.  Everything is recently renovated and very comfortable.  the apartment is conveniently located near museums and the back bay shopping district, as well as the T.  Jeff was very attentive and responsive when i experienced some internet connection difficulties which turned out to have been caused by my own computer not being able to recognize signal.  In short, i had an wonderful experience and highly recommend the apartment."
6552654,54487096,2015-11-20,3751431,Christian,"The apartment was a beautiful studio apartment. It was very nice of Jeff to leave a small welcome package as well as a packet of information about the neighborhood. I would recommend this place if you are not driving. If you are driving, parking is nonexistent unless you would like to pay $40 a night in a parking deck that is a few blocks away."
6552654,55161504,2015-11-28,48094017,Ryan,"Our overall experience with Jeff's Rowhouse was great. The unit matched the description and photos in the ad, and Jeff and his team were super responsive and accommodating to our needs throughout the visit. My favorite part about the unit had to be the location, as it was within walking distance to subway stations, restaurants/bars, grocery/liquor stores, as well as some of the must see tourist sites in the beautiful Back Bay neighborhood and Copley Square. The unit itself was small but clean, and definitely fit all our needs during our week-long visit. Drawbacks were minor, and included initially spotty wifi (Jeff sent someone to repair the wifi almost immediately upon being notified of the issue), and malfunctioning cable tv (only one channel worked during our stay). The walls of the building are also very thin so we could hear neighbors walking around, talking, etc., but they were quiet and respectful, so the impact was minimal. Overall, our stay at the unit was great, and I would definitely recommend it to others who are staying in Boston."
6552654,55669618,2015-12-04,48253311,Justin,"Communication with Jeff was excellent.  Studio apartment was clean, and exactly as described.  Great part of town, and excellent price.  This helped to make my first trip to Boston a great one, and I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
6552654,55960255,2015-12-07,1304224,Jesse,"Jeff has a perfect spot near Back Bay area in Boston - sized exactly for what me and my friend needed (we are a little on the short and petite side haha). Quiet neighborhood and no disturbances. The place was clean when we arrived and the bnb service rep was very friendly. If you need ideas of where to go or what places to visit for food, the place has a couple of hand outs on the table when you arrive - along with some nut bars, Fiji water and chocolate bar. One thing that bothered us was that the TV never really worked  properly - it might be the connection. Don't forget to pack your own q-tips and toothpaste. Besides that, it was a great spot and easy to get around."
6552654,56609480,2015-12-15,20706845,Michael,"We had a great stay in Boston, and Jeff's apartment was exceptionally clean and comfortable.  We enjoyed the many complimentary items including coffee, granola bars, water, etc.  The location was also fantastic.  There are plenty of great restaurants, bars, and cafes in the immediate neighborhood, and it's easy to walk or take the T to pretty much anywhere else.  Highly recommend."
6552654,57030851,2015-12-21,6067715,Stephanie,"The apartment was exactly as described. It is a very efficient studio with a Murphy bed and a table for two.  It is within easy walking distance of northeastern university, newberry street, and tremont street. The key exchange was on time and efficient. I would recommend this place for a single person or couple that's planning on being out and about all day and just looking for a place to sleep"
6552654,57893521,2015-12-30,34227135,Christian,The apartment is in a Beautiful and quitearea of Boston. Only problem is that it is private parking for residents in the area. However that seems to be an issue all around different areas of Boston.

6552654,60124039,2016-01-19,125452,Michelle,Jeff was very responsive to our request and the caretakers did a great job making the place feel like home.  The place was clean and within walking distance to much in Boston.  Easy access to two T-lines (green and orange).  It was a great place to stay for a weekend visit.
6552654,60496459,2016-01-24,5024658,Yael,"This place was perfect for a short stay - had everything I needed, very prompt communication with the host, and overall a smooth and enjoyable stay."
6552654,60989106,2016-01-30,54674268,Mathew,"Jeff’s place is great for 1-2 people – very convenient location, safe neighborhood on the outside.   Jeff was easy to communicate with and the key exchange service was easily reachable by phone and promptly met me to let me in, even after midnight."

6552654,61441143,2016-02-04,30495462,Meena,"I used Airbnb several times for trip to Boston. This place is the best so far. 1) Great location, 5 mins walks from Symphony on Green E or Massachusetts on Orange T, 2) great service to exchange keys, 3) clean and nice condition in the room like hotel including tower, shampoo, conditioner, two types of soaps, 4) nice welcome with enough water, chocolate, nut bars. In the morning I heard the birds. I highly recommend this place."
6552654,61986284,2016-02-10,51708010,Meagan,"I truly enjoyed my stay at this location. It was very cleanly and was in a very convenient, safe location near the orange line and the green line. The pick up key service was responsive and was able to assist me when my flight was delayed. The location is smaller than it seems in pictures, but was still perfect for my 2 person stay in Boston. I highly recommend this location and this host. The host leaves a very useful packet of information of local restaurants and sites of interest that I found helpful during my stay. Thank you for a great experience!"
6552654,62717423,2016-02-16,36730270,Rachel,"The neighborhood was great! We were in walking distance to many different places in a safe, quaint area. Most of our Ubers were just $6-10 to get to other places in the city. The apartment was overall clean and we were provided with towels, blankets, etc., which made us feel welcomed and taken care of. The company that provided us with keys was very professional and punctual. The only small changes I would make would be that the bathroom vent was very dusty, which caused me to have some allergies during our stay. I also was not aware of the parking situation before we arrived. We had to pay to stay in a parking deck, and had we been aware of this before arriving, we would have researched/looked for nearby parking decks. Otherwise, everything was perfect and I would highly recommend this apartment if you're looking for just a small studio to stay for a few nights!"
6552654,62911369,2016-02-18,39955579,Maire Therese,"Best experience I've had using AirBnB! Very clean, well stocked apartment close to everything! Will be back. :)"

The house is on a lovely, quiet street, a stone's throw from the South End and Back Bay -- and the apartment itself is tastefully furnished and immaculately kept.  Jeff, the host, was very responsive.  I'll return in a heartbeat if it's available."

Easy walking distance to several transit lines,Newbury St. shops,and many other Boston attractions.,,,
Challenge of any visit to Boston is parking: $42/day at the Prudential Center garage a few blocks away.  But,since a hotel room would have cost 2-3+ × the price of this unit,"it almost seemed like a bargain!\"",,,
6552654,64369294,2016-03-03,56746789,Lydia,"A great apartment in a really nice spot, close to a lot of restaurant. The place was very clean and well furnished. I'll go back anytime!"

6552654,65896328,2016-03-17,296797,Benito,Easy and convenient check-in process. Clean and cozy apartment. Great neighborhood suggestions. Easy access to and from the Amtrak station.
6552654,67587844,2016-03-30,61142604,Jessica,"What a great place to stay. The key exchange was easy, the overall apartment was just big enough for the two of us, and the neighborhood was good. We didn't spend much time in the room itself outside of sleeping, but it was homey and welcoming. The complimentary water and snacks were much appreciated, since I forgot to pack our water and we were walking a lot."
6552654,68041026,2016-04-01,4556376,Emily Alice,Jeff's apartment is presented to an extremely high standard. It is very comfortable and situated in the centre of the city. Jeff provided excellent information about the surrounding area as well as some water and snacks. We would definitely recommend.
6552654,68419791,2016-04-04,11496884,Jamie,"We never met Jeff but did have contact with the apartment service who were prompt and professional. The apartment is tiny, however it is well laid out and really beautiful (and the bed is very comfortable). There was water, chocolate and snacks waiting for us inside which was lovely. The building is on a dead end street so it was very quiet. The T is about a 5 minute walk away. We had a terrific stay and will definitely go back again."

It's in a great location and within walking distance to good food, coffee shops, Berklee College of Music, Fenway, etc. The unit had everything we needed during our stay. Do keep in mind that is IS small so may not be ideal for someone who needs space to spread out. We found it to be just the right size for our needs."
6552654,74479121,2016-05-15,15225829,Becky,Small studio in a great location! The apartment was clean and well equipped. Check-in and out were seamless.
6552654,76302619,2016-05-26,59354146,Shannon,"Location and apartment was perfect for what we needed! Very close to the orange and green lines and walking distance to Fenway, prudential center, and much more! There weren't extra towels or extra toilet paper, but getting ahold of the company was a breeze and more were delivered within a few hours! I was impressed! The space was a lot smaller than expected, no more than 2 guests; but, it was perfect for our needs since we were out and about all day.  My husband and I would definitely stay here again if we return to Boston. Thanks Jeff!"
6552654,77737893,2016-06-03,17853503,Mauricio,"Great stay.  Apartment exactly as described.  It is small but very cozy, clean and well kept.    location is great as well.  Owner/property management was quick to respond to our questions and resolve one minor issue throughout our stay.  I totally recommended and would rent this property again"
6552654,78205467,2016-06-05,69576898,Paige,Great room! Small but had everything we needed and was in an amazing location. So close to Newbury St and the Purdential Center plus easy access to the T. Jeff also gave some wonderful restaurant recommendations and it was such a neat area to explore. Definitely recommend this Airbnb for anyone looking for a quiet street in a great neighborhood.
6552654,78737662,2016-06-08,11592775,Samantha,"A great studio apartment. Excellent location with a number of good restaurants nearby. Also close to a subway station.

6552654,79964083,2016-06-15,369963,Tamar,"Jeff's cozy apartment was perfect. Location was great, walkable to both Back Bay and South End, where there are endless spots to explore. The Charles River promenade is super close (URL HIDDEN) if you're looking for a running route that was nice too. The apartment itself was very clean with all the necessary amenities one could need. Jeff was a great host, very responsive and flexible. Definitely recommend this apartment for one or two people looking to explore Boston."
6552654,80598486,2016-06-19,13798272,Sandy,It's on a quiet street but in 5 minutes you can be in the busiest street already.  The place is smallish but well equipped. Everything worked. Furnishings was very nice. Great place to retreat back to after a busy day.

Space being a commodity in Boston,I did expect a small place. Anyone coming to Boston should manage that expectation as well. That being said,the space was utilized incredibly efficiently,which was fantastic. The apartment was walking distance to everything you need to get around. The place was quiet for being downtown,tucked away in the back of a nice looking street. Everything we needed for the apartment was there and anything extra was included in the all inclusive manual left for us.,
The space was comfortable and convenient,the nice little treats left were nice,and the host was amazingly helpful,"especially in finding parking.\"",,
6552654,89029461,2016-07-26,38621197,Tamara,This was a beautiful place to stay in Boston. The location was perfect and the accommodations were awesome. The amenities were way more than expected. Check in and check out was very easy as well and they accommodated me when my train was running late. I look forward to staying here again in the future.
6552654,89466307,2016-07-28,5126574,Dorothy,"This was perfect for what we needed.  Jeff ensured that we could drop off our bags early so we could get keys and go to the Red Sox game. This is a tiny place, but I think it is listed as such, so no surprise. It's perfect for two people to just rest a bit in the AC before going out and about. We would definitely stay here again."
6552654,90902082,2016-08-02,86484212,Cristina,Jeff was very responsive to my calls and his management company worked with me to allow for an early check-in and late check out.  The apartment was clean and even had snacks and water!  The neighborhood is safe and within walking distance to a variety of restaurants.
6552654,91265322,2016-08-04,18901952,Catha,Listing description was perfectly accurate. Neighborhood is quiet and Jeff's place is in walking distance to many wonderful restaurants and convenient for Boston sights. It's also well stocked with essentials.

We were close to everything and was able to walk most places. Neighborhood was quiet and safe! The snacks provided came in handy. The only negative thing was hair found in bed linens and shower walls. Everything else was perfect. Defiantly recommend this place and will stay again when I come back to Boston!"

9414403,68703667,2016-04-06,11449745,Jan,"I chose Farouk's place primarily for its location. I was in Boston to attend a conference in the Hynes convention center which was almost around the corner from Huntington Avenue. Yet Farouk was a very friendly host, and the room was comfortable. I would certainly recommend his place to any visitors to Boston."
9414403,70650711,2016-04-19,9672875,Steve,"Farouk was a fantastic host and his apartment is situated just minutes away from the Prudential Center / Back Bay. A quick T trip to Boston Common takes under 10 minutes. In terms of location, it's ideal."
I stayed with Farouk prior to the 2016 Boston Marathon. He was incredibly accommodating,especially given my flight delay. The bed is large and comfortable and also has a private bathroom. I had a decent amount of luggage and even then the room still felt large. Plenty of fantastic restaurants nearby and the location was relatively quiet despite being on Huntington Ave.,a fairly busy thoroughfare.,,,
Farouk was very responsive to texts and any minor requests. If I make a return trip to Boston in the coming months,"this location would be at the top of my list of where to stay.\"",,,,

Farouk is beyond hospitable and instantly made me feel welcome, and we talked for hours about books, our careers, and our interests.

I went to attend a conference which close to Farouk's place. Although he was busy and had to work on his courses that day,he still spent several time to introduce his place in patience and made me feel right at home.,,,,
My friends was arriving at midnight,which made me felt really sorry for bothering Farouk because he had a test during the daytime. Farouk was really nice and took out his mattress to help my friend sleep. I really appreciate it.,,,,
Besides,Farouk was open to multi-culture. We shared a little bit experience of reading,which left me deep impression.,,,

9414403,72468599,2016-05-02,68676043,Carlo,"Farouk è una persona molto gentile e ospitale, ci ha aspettato pazientemente per il chek-in nonostante siamo arrivati con 45 minuti di ritardo rispetto all'orario concordato. Ha avuto un problema con il servizio pulizie ma lo ha risolto non appena lo abbiamo segnalato, non finiva più di scusarsi, la sera ci ha accompagnato in un ottimo ristorante e quando siamo partiti ha voluto a tutti i costi pagarci il taxi per South Station. L'annuncio è corrispondente alla realtà, la camera da letto è spaziosa, così come il letto, noi non abbiamo usato la cucina ma non credo ci siano problemi. La posizione è ottima, la metro è a 50 metri, Copley place è a 5 minuti a piedi e i giardini pubblici Boston Common da dove parte il Freedom Trail 10/15 minuti a piedi."
9414403,78188252,2016-06-05,1794128,Manoj,Our stay with Farouk was great. We had our own room with ensuite. The shower was to be shared with Farouk but he was away most of the stay. The location was very central and perfect for our needs. Farouk was great at communicating before and during the stay. He was extremely accommodating for our needs and we recommend highly.
9414403,79930877,2016-06-15,40997706,Nick,Good clean room that was as described. Great for those needing to be near the convention center. Would recommend others to stay. Thanks Farouk.

He met me personally and made me feel very at home; he was very available, communicative and welcoming. The room was generously spacious, closely located to my conference hotel, and easy to navigate to and from. Although not a member, The Christian Science Mapparium and historic church across the street were very cool to tour. The Museum of Fine Art and Isabella Stewart Gardner Museums were walkable distance. I was grateful for such an affordable place to stay right in the middle of all the Boston action. Farouk was responsive to any needs I had and very easy to talk to."

Beautiful view of a domed Church out the window (they offer free tours of you want to see the inside). The location in Back Bay allows you to easily access different parts of the city. The T station is just down the street.
9414403,98944557,2016-09-02,69197370,Deb,"We stayed several days with Farouk as we dropped our son off at Berklee College of Music. His apartment is in a comfortable, convenient, and popular building. It met all our expectations. What we didn't expect was how we felt like we found another son. Farouk is a kind, hard working young man, and we were delighted to get to know him. He was very careful to give us all the private space and time we wanted, and his suggestions (when asked) were always perfect for us. We hope to see him again, and if he's still in Boston on our next trip, we'll definitely stay with him. If his place isn't available, we'll see about a visit with him anyway."
9414403,99336090,2016-09-04,2325687,Abby,Farouk was a great host and greeted us at the door. It's a great place especially because of the location. We were able to walk to lots of places. It was safe and clean. Thanks for everything!
1902160,10655804,2014-03-02,10550643,Avalon,"The room was wonderful and just as presented. It was very large with a twin bed (and even an extra mattress underneath), with sheets and towels, a rack with hangers, a dresser, a mirror, and a desk. The amenities were great (although the oven was broken throughout my stay). When the sink stopped working, Monica was very prompt about getting it fixed and keeping us in the loop with the repairs. The only part I was not expecting was putting 4 people into a 3 bedroom apartment. Monica was sleeping on a mattress in the living room/kitchen area, which was fine though a bit tight. Overall, my stay was fun, easy, and as the name says--VERY close to the T, which was extremely convenient. It is within 1 block of Whole Foods, 7-11, a deli, a small market, and a pharmacy. I had a great time and enjoyed getting to know the roommates while still having plenty of privacy and my own space."
1902160,11404395,2014-04-01,12422199,Julian,I stayed a month in Monica´s apartment and really enjoyed the time. Monica is on the one hand a very dedicated host and helps you whereever she can and gladly answers you any question you can have. That made me feel very comfortable and let me settle down in Boston very fast.
One the other hand we had a lot of fun,went out with her great roommates and had interesting talks. You will also be able to join her meet up groups she organizes which allows you to get to know young people from Boston and all over the world and explore the city with them.,,,,
Within the apartment you will find everything you need but be careful with taking a shower in the very early morning: as a good advice wait a minute until you make your step below the water ;) This time it always takes a short minute for the water to get warm.,,,,,
"At the end I was very sad to leave but we will stay in touch definately! :)\"",,,,,
1902160,26547994,2015-02-15,21051182,Peter,"Ms. Monica Kang was a very gracious host, who made sure I felt right at home. On the day of my arrival, she even made me a delicious, authentic Korean dinner. She made sure I had everything I needed (towels, clean sheets, etc.),  and the room and bed were very comfortable."
"The apartment is located in a nice area that is also very easily accessible by the Green T line. It's about 25-30 minutes from downtown Boston.\"",,,,,
1902160,28705781,2015-03-29,8922006,David,"I came to Boston for a conference and needed a place just to crash in the evenings. Monica's flat was very close to the Green Line - about 30-45 minutes' commute into BU/downtown. The neighborhood was quiet, residential, and safe, and there were several restaurants and a Whole Foods within walking distance. Monica was a great host and made sure that I had everything I needed. I would definitely stay at this place again."
1902160,31519948,2015-05-06,25858071,William,"Monica was a super host.  The place on the third floor was neat and clean, and the private room was unexpectedly large and had a desk.  The internet access worked well, so I was able to work comfortably in my room.  You share a bath with the hosts but they don't spend a lot of time in there, so the bathroom was always available.  I like to cook and they made space for me in the fridge and the cupboard."
The building has a laundry; the tenants are friendly and considerate.  It is literally 1 block to the T station.  You are far enough out; I almost always was able to sit,but the travel time was not unduly long.,,,,

1902160,33103749,2015-05-25,30646431,Daniel,"Monica is an excellent host who is both very friendly and takes excellent care of her apartment. The entire flat is very clean, the room is spacious and well-kept, the WiFi is very fast, and the other utilities work great!"
The flat is very conveniently close (but not too close!) to the Green line,and the neighborhood it's in is a very nice one in its own right - Whole foods and the convenience store are both just a couple blocks away,and CVS and Subway are both about a 10-15 walk away (and are also along the same Green line).

She was nice even her room mate and house mate was nice. The room was very nice and clean. The bed was awesome. I was almost late for my conference because it was so comfortable. She provided me with some shampoo and body wash as well as clean towel. My stay was perfect. It felt like home, nothing to complain about. Even though during my stay the toilet pipe clogged but hey it happens in every house and Monica got it fixed right away so I'm happy with everything. The neighborhood was as describe, quiet and safe. Neighbors are friendly as well. The metro is very near and there's a nice place to have a simple breakfast opposite the metro station. I enjoyed my stay and surely will be back if I'm in Boston again."

1591827,7263428,2013-09-13,6272056,Katja,Jeff and Kathy were great hosts. They have a lovely house with a little garden which is a good place to rest after a busy day in the city. We had a car and ist was never difficult to find a place for it.
Jeff and Kathy are a really relaxed,open minded and helpful couple. They gave us good advices for the city and when we had problems with anything they were there to help us. We also shared some good conversations.,,,,
The dogs are a big pro. They are super amiable,peaceful and quiet. If you are not a big dog lover,they won't bother you.,,,
"I am really glad that we have stayed with you guys! \"",,,,,
1591827,7321226,2013-09-15,8500851,Xiaomao,Jeff is very very kind person.Helped us a lot when we lived in his house.We just live for one night.But I enjoy the day when I was there.I hope to live in there house again if I travel to Boston next time.And I love the dogs.They are very cute.
1591827,7804972,2013-10-03,1106835,Thomas,"Jeff's place met my last-minute needs perfectly. The room was exactly as pictured and tastefully decorated with the private bathroom right next to it. There are dogs and a cat in this home but they are calm pets that won't make noise or bother you at all. And the first thing I noticed when I walked in..this house smells good! I need some of *that* back at home. This location is not far from multiple commuter rail stations and right on a bus line that takes you right to the Orange Line T station. Since this house is on a main street, you will hear vehicles outside and passing trains but that is a part of urban living. I also had no problems parking on the street in front of the house. This place reminded me of staying at a relative's house; it was very comfortable, chic and affordable. Will definitely keep this on my list for Boston."
1591827,7866500,2013-10-06,4348163,Aileen,Jeff was very fast in responding to my inquiry about the listing. I came in on a Friday afternoon and the place is right on Hyde Park Ave. The house has a gorgeous backyard and kitchen.  I was only there for a night so I did not get to use it though.  The room had everything I needed. I had my choice of pillows since there were 4 or 5 of them ranging from soft and fluffy to spongy or hard.  The bathroom was private.  I would suggest if you like to be super warm while sleeping bring an extra blanket as there was only one blanket and sheet for the bed. Also bring towels and toiletries as the towels provided were close to hand towel size and only hand soap was available. The two dogs are super friendly. All bark and no bite. Definitely a nice place to stay for the night.
1591827,7955725,2013-10-09,9216942,Philipp,"Had a great time, thanks Jeff."
1591827,8357854,2013-10-27,9409392,Blair,"Jeff and Katie are very good hosts, and provided a comfortable place for us to stay. They gave us some good information about transportation and things to see in the area. We were able to catch a nearby bus to the subway which took us to downtown Boston. There is so much to see and do in the area that I hope we can come back soon. I would definitely enjoy staying with them again."
1591827,8456008,2013-10-31,9244087,Karen,I found the home with no problem. Jeff and his two dogs greeted me. They are friendly dogs and really just want to say hi. I had a nice room on the second floor and a private bathroom. I went into Roslindale and had dinner. Only a couple of blocks away. Came back and went to bed. I was in and out and did not get the chance to chat. Nice accommodations!
1591827,8646531,2013-11-10,2754064,Maya,Jeff is a great host. The room is exactly as described and the house is located conveniently on a bus route to the subway station just a few miles away. The price for the Boston area is unbeatable - a great value.
1591827,8676109,2013-11-11,9794109,Christopher,"Jeff and Katie were great hosts and the room was perfect and simple.  Great house and a nice location.  The treck to downtown via public transit isnt the most direct, but take the 32 bus (literally just steps from the front porch) to Forrest Hills Station and then take the orange line towards town.  Coffee, beer, shower and bed; what more do you need?  Thanks guys!"
1591827,9300843,2013-12-19,4706588,Kira,Very beautiful and clean house!
1591827,9414796,2013-12-27,5974206,Chris,Jeff and Katie have a great setup for Air B&B. They live close to my sister so I plan to stay here again when I visit her next. It was a very good value.
They have a lot of room and a lovely and clean home. The bed was very comfortable,and it was so convenient to have a bathroom right next to the bedroom. We stayed for two nights and rarely ran into either of them.,,,,
They have a lovely back yard,deck and porch and in the summer it would be great to hang out here. It was winter so we mainly stayed inside. We enjoyed their Keurig coffee machine.,,,,
One day we took the 32 bus right outside their door to Forest Hills station,and from there took the subway to Cambridge. The public transportation option was very helpful.,,,,
"We loved their dogs. They are very respectful and will leave you alone.  If you like dogs you can pet them. They seem to stay downstairs and never came upstairs. The cat remained hidden and I only saw her from a distance. \"",,,,,

1591827,12989052,2014-05-16,5734662,Cecile,Jeff was very kind with us and welcoming. He has lended us a card for the train/bus and given some informations when we were asking. The room was perfect for our first trip in Boston : thank you !
1591827,13179215,2014-05-21,12304263,Taryn,The house was clean and comfortable. They left helpful information in the room about the neighborhood and even some granola bars - very thoughtful!
1591827,13376667,2014-05-26,15272281,Paula,Jeff and Katie were great! My boyfriend and I drove up to Boston for a music festival for the weekend and they were quite accommodating with our schedule. Our hosts made us feel welcome and were overall quite friendly; they even let us borrow their charlie cards for the local transit. Their dogs were also cute and friendly :)
The room was large and clean and we had  our own bathroom right next to our bedroom.,,,,,
Overall we would definitely stay there again. The location is situated right outside the downtown area but getting downtown is super easy,the bus stops right outside the house.,,,,

1591827,13540045,2014-05-30,12881427,Alicia,Jeff's house was really great! they were really kind to provide us with the laundry machine and breakfast bars. This area is safe for us even though we were back after dark. (around 11pm)

1591827,14451520,2014-06-19,16594627,Karl,They were wonderful hosts! It was very neat and comfortable. Easy access to public transportation is a plus.
1591827,15229710,2014-07-05,16439230,Chase,"This was our first time using airbnb, and it was a great experience. Jeff was a great, unobstrusive host, his house was lovely and very clean, and he even let us use his dryer after we got caught in a massive downpour in downtown Boston. We couldn't recommend him more. Roslindale is a nice neighborhood as well, with Boston very easily accessible from it via public transit."
1591827,15339510,2014-07-07,16614762,Julie,"We really enjoy our stay at Jeff and Katie's house. The room was perfect for our needs, the bed was really comfortable and quiet and the bathroom really clean. They also lend to our disposition their kitchen, wifi and their charlie's card which was really nice. Their house was near enough from downtown so it was really easy to travel by buses and train from there. Don't hesitate to book there even if you dont like animals, their dogs and cat were nice and peaceful. I recommend this place to anyone ."
1591827,15504238,2014-07-10,554579,Sue,Perfect place & clean. Met all our needs.
1591827,15832511,2014-07-16,16950004,Soren,"We were new to Airbnb and very pleased with our stay. The hosts were really helpful in answering our questions and making sure we could find things. Everything was just as described. The room was pleasant and clean, the bed was comfortable, and the dogs were calm and friendly. There's a grocery store a short walk away, if you want to use the kitchen. The deck out back was a great place for a leisurely breakfast, shady and cool for a summer morning watching songbirds at the feeder.   Thanks!"
1591827,15891763,2014-07-17,554579,Sue,"It was just a quick in & out but I would definitely go back for a longer stay. Great location. Thanks for sharing your home, Jeff & Katie."
1591827,15993425,2014-07-19,17480998,Shaojun,"Lovely house,feel like home.Great experience with the help from Jeff !"
1591827,16113756,2014-07-22,16856321,Liz,"I really enjoyed my stay at Jeffs. The bed was really comfortable and made for a relaxing time. I wasn't too crazy about the neighborhood. There aren't any grocery stores close by which I would have preferred instead of picking up some take out. I ordered some really nasty take out from a Chinese place in front of the 32 bus - DO NOT ORDER FROM THERE. A fruit fly fell out of the packaging and I ended up throwing it all out. I hate to waste food. If you are driving then you will be okay to get around, but if you take public transit it takes about 40 minutes to get downtown. The orange line runs on average every 14 minutes and the 32 bus to the orange line is about every 15 minutes or so. I went mainly to relax for a few days to clear my head and it was indeed very relaxing. I loved their pups - they bark at everyone but they are affectionate and harmless. Overall I was given lots of space and privacy which I wanted and they had left me some tea/snacks which was cute."
1591827,16279707,2014-07-24,18368817,Sonia,"Jeff was very welcoming, his house was very conveniently located to the bus station,  made everything so comfortable and easy to us. The room and bathroom were very organized and clean, had a great sleep both nights after long walks in Boston.  The neighborhood was well located and safe, we could leave our car parked during the whole stay outside and nothing happened."
1591827,16517488,2014-07-28,11967695,Chaunce,"Even though hiccups in our Amtrak transportation forced us to arrive rather late at night, Jeff was available to welcome us to his home and get us settled in."
The house is comfortable and,as promised,right on the bus line to the T station - but we also were able to walk to the T station as well. The house also has a lovely backyard patio for those times you might like to just sit and/or read.,,,

1591827,16769563,2014-08-02,15477172,Peter,"This is an excellent place to stay for Boston, real close to public transportation. The room was more than adequate, clean with a nice firm bed and a pleasant back patio in which to have coffee on nice days. It can be a bit noisy with the Hyde Park Ave. traffic, but with the air-conditioner on it was no problem for us. The only difficulty we encountered is that we are in our 60s and the stairs (essentially two flights up from the street to our room) were bit much."
1591827,17344306,2014-08-11,2796231,Franka,"I have had a wonderful time with Jeff and Katie. Really good location and access to the city, the room was fantastic and having my own TV and bathroom were great perks! The entire apartment was spotless clean and the dogs adorable. The cat chose to ignore me, as cats usually do. :)"

The experience was positive: the house is beautiful, the dog and cat are nice and quiet, the host are friendly and the room and bathroom are new and clean. I suggest this house and if me and my wife will come again in Boston we will try to come there again."
1591827,18570414,2014-08-28,15110413,Elaine,"Jeff is a very friendly host. He let us use his kitchen for breakfast to toast bread and make coffee and tea. The parking is easy on the street. The room is very cozy. The bed is comfortable. The bathroom is clean and big. The only concern during the summer if we opened the window at night and not use air conditioning is the road noise. When we close the windows, the noise was gone."
1591827,18943919,2014-09-03,17736118,Richard,"Jeff and Katie were very accommodating and generously gave us use of their Charlie Card T passes during our stay.

The dogs were gentle and friendly and it was nice having them around."

We could borrow a map of the city which was really useful as well as a public transport card. It took about 20 min to get to the city center. We also appreciated the free parking right in front of the house. We would recommend this place."

1591827,19780197,2014-09-18,19744775,Eulalie,"We stayed at this place for three days with my friend and had a great time. Jeff and Katie are nice and let you feel like home. The house is really lovely and clean, the pets are adorable and the bedroom really comfortable. Everything was perfect ! It does take some time to go to the city center (30-40 minutes) but it is really easy with bus and subway and also cheap with the 7 days pass. It didnt bother us at all (we didnt have a car). I would totally recommand that place !"
1591827,19929534,2014-09-21,2109442,Harriet,"Jeff and Katie are very casual and welcoming. Lovely house and pets. Busy street and lots of stairs to climb. No problem for me, just heads up for others. Great hosts."

1591827,20617515,2014-10-02,8808957,Sebastian,Jeff was a perfect host. We arrived in the evening and had to leave early in the morning (for others it was still night). So we really just slept in his nice and clean room in Boston. We had our own bathroom and even a few snacks. We totally recommend to stay at Jeff’s home.
1591827,20915777,2014-10-07,20949622,Heather,Jeff and Katie are great hosts.  They were very clear and helpful.  Their home is really lovely and in a great area which is convenient to public transportation.  My friend and I stayed here for 4 days and felt extremely comfortable.  There is a lot of privacy in this home and it is very quiet.  It's a great place to stay when visiting the Boston area.  I look forward to staying with Jeff and Katie again.
1591827,21036806,2014-10-10,5757834,Marcia,was a nice stay/room  was clean and easy  commute to Boston  however the room in  on the  street side  so if u are not a sound sleeper u will not get much  sleep
1591827,21137161,2014-10-12,3020820,Rose,The hosts were very accommodating.  The place was clean and inviting.  There were two close local restaurants and parking was no problem.
1591827,22014312,2014-10-28,18942996,Danny,The room is just as listed a great 3rd air bnb experience. I didnt get the privilege to meet jeff but Katie was cool even though we came during the patriots blow out against the bears she still took time to talk to us. A very patriotic couple in a nice part of town! Nutmeg was awesome very friendly. The house and neighborhood are quiet. Thanks for allowing us to experince your city!
1591827,22315177,2014-11-03,20909237,Daniel,"It was our first accommodation by the AirBnB and were lucky to stay in with Jeff and Katie. They are excellent hosts, give all information that you need, all the privacy and freedom that you want. At the same time, they are always available when you need it."
The apartment is as shown in the pictures,very comfortable and cozy. The bathroom is really private and very well equipped (also with tub).,,,,
We use car and not use public transport,but we have seen that it is quite easy to access. It's a bit far from downtown,but the travel time is fast and quiet. There are also shops,markets and food not very far,but also advise you to buy your groceries and prepare your own meals,since the kitchen is very well equipped and spacious.
Dogs are lovely and quiet and the cat appears very little.,,,,,
Thus,we consider the great price for what they offer and we indicate to everyone to stay here.,,,,

Jeff was in communication with me before the booking and before I left on my trip, was there when I got there (as promised), and very helpful in getting me settled and on my way into the city."
The room was super clean,as was the bathroom,and both were very conveniently located within the house itself (right near the front door and top of the adjacent stairs).  I did not use the kitchen at all but assume the same about it based on the very neat house.,,,
The doggies are super friendly in case you're worried about that.,,,,,
The location is a 5 minute bus ride to a major T stop that gets you into downtown Boston within 20 more minutes.  Very convenient and Jeff's gracious lending of a Charlie Card (replenished,natch) was most helpful. I was able to park my car directly in front of the house which was super convenient,as well.,,,
Thanks for making my first stay so successful,"Jeff!\"",,,,
1591827,22914220,2014-11-17,19693917,Rachael,"Jeff was extremely helpful when we came up to Boston for the first time. He showed us around the house, helped us with restaurant recommendations, and even graciously let us use his Charlie Card for the trains and buses. We loved the attention to even the smallest details, and how he left snacks and coffee for us to eat and drink as we wanted. We would highly recommend him and his house to anyone traveling to Boston in the future. We will definitely stay with him next time we are in Boston!"
1591827,23080646,2014-11-22,12506963,Monica And Mike,"Jeff was easy to reach and very responsive to our emails and texts. He was responsible and trustworthy, doing what he said he would do, and being there when he said he would be. Nice neighborhood, right on the bus line to downtown. Jeff showed us where we were on the map, and how to get where we were going. He was helpful, and gave us all the information and help that we needed. We felt welcomed and comfortable. Thank you very much."
1591827,24002599,2014-12-16,3004783,Michel Et Françoise,Nous avons passé quatre jours merveilleux à Boston. Jeff nous a fort bien accueilli et nous a fourni toutes consignes nécessaires pour notre séjour. Jours après jours de visites et promenades nous retrouvions avec plaisir la chambre confortable et l'agréable salle de bain privative. Une bonne adresse.
1591827,24597004,2014-12-31,23322357,Gabriel,"Jeff and Katie were my first experience with airbnb and it was awesome! They are really kind, respectful and courteous. My girlfriend and I stayed for four days and we had no problems at all. The place is well located and the bus stop is right in the front. The room and the bathroom are really cozy and better than many hotels out there. Totally worth it, we wish we could spend more time in Boston."
1591827,25062810,2015-01-05,4436150,Derek,Very pleasant experience staying with Jeff. He was very kind and resourceful. He helped us find a route to get into Boston. The place is one of the cleanest we've been to! I'd definitely recommend!
1591827,25404050,2015-01-15,20122865,Nora,"Jeff communicated well via e-mail before we actually arrived in Boston. He gave good directions for getting from the airport to his home. He was there to greet us when we arrived and gave us a tour of the house. He answered questions that we had that evening. He was available when needed, but never took up any of our private time. Due to bitter cold temperatures, Jeff offered to take us to a nearby grocery store the first morning, so that we could buy breakfast items for our week-long stay. The location of this home is very convenient. Access to the bus and subway was very easy.This was our very first airbnb accommodation and enormously exceeded our expectations. If we are able to visit Boston within the next two or three years as planned, we would definitely stay here again."
1591827,25484287,2015-01-17,23414982,Shirley,"The room and listing was accurately described. Jeff made arrangements to meet us when we arrived even though it was during a work day and made sure there was space in the refrigerator and cupboards for the small amount of food we brought with us for breakfast and offered that we could use is Nepresso machine. The dogs were friendly, did not bark or jump on us and amazingly there was no animal hair in the house and we enjoyed their company. The cat hide while we were there. The room and house were immaculately clean and there was plenty of on street parking."
1591827,26333149,2015-02-09,9692751,Baha,Jeff was a great communicator. He helped me out with the ever changing schedules that I got exposed to at the time of snow storms. I ended up not using his space as the event I planned to attend ran way later than his check in time and I had to catch an eary flight the following morning. Didn't want to bother him for few hours.
"Recommend Jeff to future airbnb guests. \"",,,,,
1591827,27037864,2015-02-23,27287552,Saadia,"Jeff and his wife were not only very hospitable and helpful, but the place was excellent. It is a beautiful house, clean, and comfortable. The two of them were very friendly, helped us out with things, let us use their kitchen, and even let us borrow their monthly pass for the T. Great place to stay."
1591827,27414149,2015-03-03,27485054,Jean-Marie,Due to a severe snowfall in NB I have been unable to take the road in time and drive up to Jeffs and had to cancel that trip

1591827,27672459,2015-03-09,10111843,Natalie,My bf and I had a great and comfortable stay at Jeff's and Katie's place! We checked in really early in the morning (330am) because we were busy to do it on time! It was very nice of Jeff to open the doors that early! The room and bathroom are very clean and comfortable! We had snacks in our room and got drinks from the kitchen. There are nice places to eat in Roslindale and the bus stops right in front of the door.
I highly recommend Jeff's and Katie's place and we might come back! :),,,,,

1591827,30975652,2015-04-30,7553974,Rosalyn,Jeff and Katie are brilliant hosts. We didn't get a chance to meet Katie and barely spent any time at their beautiful house as we were out sightseeing. It's a shame as the house is beautiful and clean. The dogs are very well behaved and no trouble at all. It's easy to get to the house by public transport and the bus stops right outside the house. The only
downside is there is often a long wait for connections but we were not in a rush so it didn't bother us too much. You can hear the road traffic from the bedroom window but again didn't really bother us. The room is large and comfortable. The bathroom was clean with a really good shower. We were able to use the kitchen to make drinks and they kindly left out little breakfast bars for us. Jeff was very good at communicating throughout the whole experience - before,"during and after booking. Would highly recommend if you want a nice comfortable stay in Boston. \"",,,,

We were nicely welcomed by Jeff, who was very flexible with us, being present enough while making sure that we had our privacy and that we felt at ease in his home.  The place was super clean cozy and neat, and practicable (with the bathroom next to the bedroom). The bed was very comfortable.   We found everything we needed.

We were impressed with how laid back Jeff was as a host, easy going and yet always available.  Quiet and unobtrusive.  They have a lovely, well-cared for home that is attractive, impeccably clean and reflects their own personal style -- and progressive politics that we support!  The room was comfortable, the private bathroom was clean & the frig in the kitchen was convenient for food storage.  FYI, their animals are all easy-going and lovable as well.  2 Thumbs up for Jeff & Katie's Airbnb in Roslindale!"

The house is nice,the room is exactly like in the the pictures,Jeff is OK and  every morning they offer you snacks and coffee.,,,
Unfortunately we didn't have a car and we wasted hours trying to get to Boston and coming back. The closest subway branch was closed on Sunday and,for what we could see,"buses are totally unreliable.\"",,,

Jeff told us before our arriving how to come with public transports. The house is very cosy and clean. We had our own bathroom which was a plus. Finally they have two nice dogs.

We were welcomed by Jeff and quickly shown around; otherwise we all kept to ourselves to respect each other's privacy. It appeared to us that Jeff and Kate are very reserved hosts,but of course friendly. The dogs are very friendly,however barked a lot when Jeff and Kate were not at home. The cat is very shy,so we only saw her once passing by.,,
It was very nice and convenient that we could use the kitchen. Very clean and provides everything you need (pots,pans....),,,,
Going downtown Boston is very easy! Just take the bus outside the house,change into the train and you are downtown. Very easy! Thanks to Jeff for providing us with a Charlie Card,which made it even easier and cheaper to use public transportation.,,,
Parking was no problem at all! There a lots of parking spots on the street in front of the house. A mini market is located on the next corner if you need any drinks or food.,,,,,
So,we had a nice stay here,however the street noise is extreme. I couldn't sleep without earplugs at all. So if you are a light sleeper or you don't like street noise,you better not stay here. For me it put the experience down a lot! I'm used to some street noise from home (we live next to a bridge),"but I think we just have different windows which excerpt the noise a lot more than here in the US.\"",

Jeff also made it very easy to get in by giving me the code to the front door and a key to our room. We loved the private bathroom. We also loved how Jeff respected our privacy and allowed us to come and go as we pleased, as long as we were respectful. The location was also a perfect distance from all that we wanted to do in Boston and Massachusetts. There were also great shops and restaurants not too far away.

The bed was clean and very comfortable, with plenty of sheets and a heater if it gets chilly. There is a bathroom next to the room which was kept clean and stocked with all necessary supplies. Jeff does have two dogs which are very friendly and will greet you when coming home which adds to the overall welcoming feel of this place. It is affordable, comfortable, clean, and free wifi!

I really don't like the homely feel and the dogs were cool. What made it great was out football chat after my return from Gillette stadium and my first NFL patriots game, it helped that we supported the same team, cheers J and K, I'll pop in again sometime!!!"

Their home feels that way and the dogs have some of the same personality qualities.  The room and private bath are one of the best values in Boston! There is some street noise but their home has a a way of more than cancelling that out.  Clean and simple accommodations honoring privacy, though Jeff is always there to help or respond.  Excellent communication at all times prior and during our stay.  We highly recommend Jeff and Katie's Airbnb !"

The breakfast she provided was delicious, and we had a great conversation with she and the other guests in the house at the table. I highly reccomend staying here. The only surprise issue we had was the location and how far it was from downtown, sites, etc. The bus seemed to take a bit longer to transport from stop to stop than we had expected. I just suggest making extra time when traveling from the South side of the Boston area."

7092874,41116493,2015-08-04,26117629,Lisa,"This condo was a wonderful base for our weeklong vacation in Boston. The location was absolutely fabulous! It was very convenient for walking around the city, with easy access to the Green and Red lines and just steps away from the Esplanade and Public Garden. We were able to walk to a little grocery store on Charles Street as well as multiple coffee shops, restaurants and shops. I was traveling alone with my children and felt safe walking home from the T and through the neighborhood at night."
Our hosts were very gracious in meeting us upon our arrival and showing us around their home. The home itself was lovely with plenty of room on two floors. The shower was nice and the kitchen was fine for our needs (we did not cook full meals there,but did appreciate having a large fridge to store our breakfast items and dinner leftovers). The decor in the home is lovely and upscale but a bit formal (white upholstery everywhere!) so we didn't spend much time lounging around (but that's ok,we were mostly out exploring Boston!).,,,
The only negative feedback I have to offer is that the bed in the master bedroom was very,very firm. I really had trouble sleeping comfortably on it,which negatively impacted my stay (I woke up with a sore neck and back,feeling unrested). Obviously this is a matter of personal preference (I'm sure the hosts like their firm mattress!),but if you are not a fan of very firm mattresses then this is probably not the place for you.,
Overall,"this is a lovely home in a fabulous location and we had a great time!\"",,,,
12426977,72628889,2016-05-04,29739396,Katie,"Jon's apartment was great--great location, great ambiance, great price, and all around a great experience. I left a jacket there and Jon mailed it to me right away."
12426977,74419715,2016-05-15,264982,Florin,"Jon's place is great, a spacious studio. Quiet, bright and clean. Good location with many hip South restaurants close by. Great value for money!"
12426977,75789073,2016-05-23,62912702,Eren,Jon's Place was amazing! The location was perfect; close to just about any attraction in Boston. Very clean and cozy! I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone!
12426977,77097906,2016-05-30,27947894,Taylor,"Jon's studio was even more charming than I had imagined. He left clear and simple details to get into the studio and it was clean and cozy. Jon left fresh towels out for us and the bed, while small, was super comfortable. The location of the studio was even better. My husband and I are big walkers and everything we wanted to see was walking distance from this studio. And when we were tired it was a very short uber or taxi ride back home. If we go back to Boston we will definitely request to stay at Jon's studio again!"
12426977,78895212,2016-06-10,37826495,Vanessa,"I had a really great stay at Jon's apartment.  Jon was very responsive and the key exchange couldn't have been easier.  The apartment was very clean, the bed was super comfortable, and I had everything I needed including a kitchen.  The apartment is pretty close to the T and is close to restaurants, coffee shops, and stores.  Overall it was a really great stay!"
12426977,79816020,2016-06-14,33188261,Bruno,"It was easy to get in touch with Jon.  Upon arrival, he left us towels. A better description of apartment would of been appreciated, he found out it was a kitchenette and not a full kitchen. It was a small size fridge and he had to be creative to fit everything inside. The studio had a lot of charm but the bathroom lack of cleanness. The location was great as we were 30 mins walking distance away from Fenway and 8 min away from the train. He encounter great restaurants nearby thst we would back to. Although we noticed we were at the border of less desirable neighborhood but we never felt unsafe."
12426977,81162321,2016-06-21,28937073,Arie,"Jon was a great host! Provided great tips on things to do in Boston and his place was clean and comfortable! The location was great too, walking distance to downtown Boston and around the corner from some great restaurants."
12426977,82543868,2016-06-28,52193641,Xiao,"I had a pleasant trip in Boston. Jon has a nice and cozy apartment. Though I didn't meet him in person, he always answered my questions through the phone quickly. His apartment is close to the orange line (about 10 mins walk), and there is a Dunkin Donuts and a 7-11 right next to it. A convenient place to stay."
12426977,83507135,2016-07-03,22937006,Kate,"We really enjoyed our trip to Boston. Jon was a great host and was always on hand to contact if we needed. The location of the apartment is great.. Lots of amazing cafes and restaurants to try! The room itself was great and had everything we needed. As for cleanliness, the shower was a little dirty but just looked like it was perhaps an old shower. Thankyou for having us!"
12426977,83843173,2016-07-04,22595482,Christine,"John was a great host during my stay over the Jul 4 holiday weekend. He is very quick to respond to any questions and very accommodating. His place was perfect for my boyfriend and I. It isn't a huge space but has everything you would need for a comfortable stay. It is very clean and has cool, modern decor at a very reasonable cost as compared to Boston hotel rates."
12426977,85233314,2016-07-10,17124337,Adella,Great location. T stop not too far away.

12426977,90814206,2016-08-02,10522194,Lindsay,Loved staying at this studio! Great location for getting around the city. Perfect spot for a weekend away!
12426977,94039076,2016-08-14,55428548,Nicole,"Jon's place was everything the listing said and more. Such a good location, near Fenway and all other important locations for a long weekend in Boston! Jon was very responsive and made our stay extremely easy. Would love to go back sometime in the near future and stay the apartment again. Thank you Jon for opening up your home to a few New Yorkers wanting to get to know Beantown!"
12426977,95027842,2016-08-18,7835531,Gabriele,"The apartment is well located in a nice area. We have not met Jon during our stay but he provided us precise instructions and always replied quickly to our questions. Cleaness was good but could be improved. In general, considering the prices of the hotel in Boston, Jon's apartment was good for the price we paid."
8575476,50540653,2015-10-12,45381909,Zachary,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8575476,58247823,2016-01-01,13699889,Maura,"We stayed at Chris's place this past New Year's Eve and it was all we had hoped for.  Chris was very flexible on our arrival time when we let him know we were running late. He was available for quick entry and review of the place as soon as we arrived.  This unit is super cozy. The exposed brick walls and large windows looking out over a private bricked patio with twinkle lights set-up a lovely evening.  Chris had all the essentials you would need in the kitchen and his stylish decor and super clean space were a lovely backdrop for our evening.  On top of all that, he's right, his location is super convenient to many things in town.  We'll keep Chris in mind next time we come into town, it's a quintessential Boston stay."
8575476,61844234,2016-02-08,27350153,Douglas,Awesome place. Awesome location. Enough said. Chris was an awesome host and would stay here again.
8575476,62609236,2016-02-15,39648594,Nolan,Chris was very welcoming and accommodating.  He did everything he could to make our stay very enjoyable and relaxing.  The space is well represented and we found our time there to be well worth the price.  The location is lovely for a weekend in Boston.
8575476,63316233,2016-02-21,49797182,Shayla,The apartment is super nice and Chris was extremely accommodating being able to get us in last minute! Great location/neighborhood in the south end. Would definitely stay again :)
8575476,63980720,2016-02-28,49500542,Dan,Chris was very responsive to all my queries.  The apartment was perfect for our visit to Boston visiting my daughter.  It was close to shopping and restaurants.  I would certainly use this again for my other visit to Boston!
8575476,64871828,2016-03-08,150683,Karin,Chris was very responsive and great to work with. The location was perfect for exploring Boston and the neighborhood is beautiful with lots of great places to eat within walking distance. We loved the outdoor patio and the quiet street. Thanks Chris!
8575476,66176025,2016-03-20,56771900,Russell,Chris met us at the apt and made sure that everything going there was.to our satisfaction.  Apt is located in a great neighborhood.
8575476,67215340,2016-03-27,542758,Ann,"Fantastic well-appointed studio in a great location. There was a little glitch in checking in, but Chris made up for it with a gift bottle of wine. We recommend this listing."
8575476,68113580,2016-04-02,37559199,Jack,Really great location. My home office is around the corner so it was very ideal. Great restaurants  and bars within a couple blocks. The only drawback was that the unit was VERY warm. But we left the windows cracked and it cooled off before we came back to sleep. Chris said he was getting it looked at so I'm sure it will be ok. Other than that he was extremely responsive and I would stay here again.
8575476,70631162,2016-04-19,1661465,Andrea,Chris communicated very well prior and during our stay.  Pictures were an accurate reflection of this perfect studio situated in a very convenient area of Boston.  I felt like I was a resident of Boston during my stay at Chris' studio!   The accommodations were very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable.   Kitchen and bathroom were also nice.  The shower was great too.
8575476,72233875,2016-05-01,24774424,Carolyn,Chris was an excellent host.  Our flight landed fairly early on a Tuesday and Chris was able to get the place ready for us before we even landed!!  The location of the flat was perfect and so was the place its self!!  It is even cuter than the pictures.  I would def recommend staying here!!! Oh and the bed is VERY comfortable!!!!
8575476,73665568,2016-05-09,14363630,Sophie,"The place is very comfortable with basically everything needed! PERFECT location in cit center  that you can walk to malls, Boston library and new burry street.  Very close to orange line (3 mins). Chris is a very nice host that answer all my questions fast. Quite and beautiful neighborhood. Walking distance to nice bars in south end. I would definitely recommend."
8575476,78409625,2016-06-06,9990662,Alan,"Really loved the place. Location in South End is awesome - super convenient for shopping on Newbury Street and there are a ton of restaurants and cafes in the immediate area. Chris was easy to get in touch with, and check-in/check-out was seamless. Definitely recommend."
8575476,78827054,2016-06-09,75593293,Gretchen,"This was our first time using Airbnb and it was a great experience!  Chris was very welcoming and gave us the keys and the details of the apartment then he told us how to get in touch with him should we need anything, then left us alone!  Just what I would expect when renting a private entrance studio!"
The apartment matched the description and pictures exactly!  Plenty of linens and towels were provided and Chris showed us where extras were if we needed them!  The neighborhood was beautiful and close to public transportation as well as places to eat,drink and grab a cup of coffee.,,,,
Small nit-picky details that kept me from rating it 5 stars - the bathroom floor needed a good sweeping/mopping and the AC unit barely kept up. Probably needs to be a bigger more powerful unit.  It was only an issue during the day since it was cool enough at night to open the windows. It would also be nice if there were extra pillows in the closet for freaks like me who like a ton!  ;-),,,,,
"Overall it was a great experience and I would stay here again!\"",,,,,
8575476,79766071,2016-06-14,35155837,Megan,"\"This place is awesome! The location was perfect and walking distance to many cafes, bars, restaurants, etc. The neighborhood is quintessential Boston and we felt very safe the entire time. The space looks exactly like the pictures and is very clean and stylish and has everything you need. Chris was a great host and very welcoming and check-in/check-out were a breeze. I would definitely stay here again if I come back to Boston and highly recommend it. The only comment I have that may be of interest to others is that there was a dog upstairs that was pretty noisy (particularly in the morning). If you aren't accustom to \"\"neighbor noise\"\" then it may be disruptive"
Overall,"I highly recommend this place. Thanks Chris!\"",,,,
8575476,80180803,2016-06-16,2477011,Ewan,Chris' apartment is really lovely and the perfect spot for excellent food at The Beehive and to walk around and explore the city. We had a great stay. Thanks Chris

8575476,98545144,2016-08-31,80988537,Colin,"Great place parking was a nightmare at $400 for 3 nights 3 blocks away at the garage. Had trouble with meter maid police while loading the car, as it was parked on side of street for maybe 5 minutes - not in the way of anyone."
9626428,87696692,2016-07-21,42489219,Ellen,"Sarah was a wonderful Airbnb host. The house is in a perfect location. There is so much to walk to - great restaurants, coffee shops, the harbor, and more! The home is warm and welcoming. Great outdoor deck. Comfy beds. Great size! This was the perfect Airbnb. I would suggest it for anyone in the South Boston area."
1912940,11035294,2014-03-17,13002809,Jake,"I recently stayed at Artur's apartment and had a great experience! It was very comfortable, neat, and well-kept. Artur was a very welcoming host, meeting with me to give me the key, show me around, and he even offered some of his food! haha My girlfriend and I had a very pleasant stay and I would definitely recommend Artur to anyone looking for something in the area."

1912940,13449281,2014-05-27,1715577,Olga,"This studio is clean, well equipped and conveniently located. Easy to park and affordable too. We were there on Memorial Weekend and had a great time. We did not meet Arthur but he was very accommodating and caring for us. The studio has everything you may need for a short stay, cooking utensils, etc. We travelled with our 8 month baby and he enjoyed it too. It may be too small for a family of three but worked out great for us!"

The apartment was all we needed and fit us just right for the trip.  It's a very short walk to the T-Stop which takes you downtown and all around almost anytime of the day."
1912940,14149529,2014-06-13,5369595,Andrea E.,"Studio muy bien equipado, tal como se ve en las fotos, se trata de un basement con ventana a la calle, en un barrio muy bonito y cerca del transporte."

"Recomendable!\"",,,,,
1912940,14307311,2014-06-16,9078823,Rachel,"Artur was very easy to communicate with and very quick to respond to any queries. His place was clean and lovely, and in a great location for us, near two T stops. He took care of every detail with fresh towels, clean bed and even left a museum of fine arts pass for us to use! I would definitely recommend Artur's place to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in Boston."

1912940,15063558,2014-07-01,3637088,Sheal,Artur was really prompt in getting back with messages. His apartment was in a safe neighborhood and there was parking which for Boston was a nice bonus. It was also very accessible to public transportation. Thanks!

His apartment is close to Harvard Square and MIT (for those who want to go there). Artur even provide us with free admission to the Museum of Science! Thank you :)"
1912940,15380873,2014-07-07,3561642,Kirk,"Artur's apartment was in a convenient Allston/Brighton area and easy to access. The apartment had everything one needs for a short stay, with minimalistic decor."

1912940,18138645,2014-08-22,19577660,Jake,"Great host. Very informative and helpful. Apartment is about 30/45 minute train ride into the centre but is just a 5 minute walk to get to the station (the T). The room itself was as expected, small but did the job. Would be better for double rather than 4 people. Drapes broken on one side and unable to open window on the other which left the room quite hot at times. Overall a good find for the price you are paying."
1912940,18882663,2014-09-02,6223038,Taryn,"My parents and siblings stayed in Artur's apartment - I booked this on their behalf. They've informed me that Artur is a great host - and I can attest to this because he's always in contact with me and my siblings - and that he's very helpful and will go out of his way to make you feel welcome. The apartment itself is cozy and clean and well equipped, situated in a leafy quiet suburb and near the T line. Thanks artur!"
1912940,19294446,2014-09-09,4722634,Marion,"The room is clean and next to shops, subway... Very convenient. Arthur is Very Nice and helping. The appartment is half an hour from downtown boston so dont be afraid of the subway. But in general i really recommend this place!"
1912940,19352792,2014-09-10,21078482,Daniel,We just stayed one night in Boston and we were very happy to find a place so close to public transportation. The location of the apartment is great. It's a basement unit that was suffice to our needs. It is more of a college experience than a hotel experience but everything was clean and organized.
1912940,19622308,2014-09-15,20324508,Abim,"Artur is a great host, although I didn't get to meet him but he was very attentive and responses to your emails quickly.

Artur worried that at any time the terms of the lease,the arrival at the apartment and we stay clear standards,"something appreciated. He made our stay easier.\"",,,
1912940,19859057,2014-09-19,9037496,Chris,Good neighborhood. Apartment was as described and Artur was very accommodating for my last minute travel plans. He sent me detailed info and it was super easy to get access to the apartment. I would definitely stay again the next time I'm in Boston.
1912940,20042541,2014-09-22,20671386,Cornelia,"Artur was very helpful when I asked questions about Boston. He also responded quickly to any message that I sent him. The apartment was small, but clean. Perfect distance to the T and several shops and restaurants close by. The apartment was also in a quiet  and safe neighborhood."

1912940,20412430,2014-09-29,4193368,Caitlin,Nice apartment. Arthur was very quick to respond with any questions or concerns. Location was great for visiting my sister at Boston college.
1912940,20863492,2014-10-06,21148727,Marlene,The host was very good in communicating in a timely manner. The room was just as described and pictured. It is definelty geared towards people under 30. It was too spartan for retired folks!
1912940,21209506,2014-10-13,20578436,Rachel,"Artur was a great host, and responded promptly to all of our questions. This was a perfect space for our weekend trip. Thanks Artur!"
1912940,21584069,2014-10-20,20088013,Michael,Studio was exactly as advertised.  Very convenient location and excellent conscientious communication from our host.
1912940,21859443,2014-10-25,12170593,Stu,Our stay was very pleasant. The instructions to get into the apartment were very clear and easy to follow. The flat was very clean and the facilities were perfectly a acceptable. I would most definitely stay here again.
1912940,22025798,2014-10-28,17729114,Daniel,"Artur's apartment was just as shown, it was clean and in a good location.  We very much enjoyed our stay in his studio."
1912940,22754846,2014-11-13,12586976,Tomer,Artur is very helpful and approachable. He was sick but did his best to get back to my emails in no time.
The place is basically an old servants' room. It's a basement apt with a metal door and very tiny windows from which you can see the shoes of bystanders and wheels of passing cars. I don't like this feeling at all and won't recommend it to anyone. The place doesn't feel clean nor cozy and it seems like one of these places that no matter how hard you try,you can't make it feel nice. The bedding was very uncomfortable and slim. If you go there,you better bring your own blanket and pillow. Finally,to write that there're two beds is quite a false thing to do as the second bed is a single inflatable mattress.,,
I would recommend this place only if you're stuck with no roof top at the middle of the Bostonian winter,otherwise I would never choose it as my sleeping spot.,,,,
I'm sorry for the harshness and I have nothing against Artur who's a very nice guy. I'm just trying to be very honest in order to help this amazing community.,,,,,
"Tomer\"",,,,,
1912940,22957643,2014-11-18,17936190,Nicole,Arthur was very welcoming and gave great lead in intro that made us feel educated about our home and surroundings! He made himself available with questions and was very understanding of our needs.
1912940,26721817,2015-02-17,11134573,Jennifer,"Because of the awful snow I wasn't able to make use of my reservation, but Arthur could not have been more gracious. He was always in contact, responsive and even somehow made it to the apartment in awful weather to leave the key for me. He even offered me a significantly reduced rate to stay at a later date if I'd like - which was very nice. I'd stay again just based on my interactions with Arthur."
1912940,27020178,2015-02-23,6080514,Rick,"Couldn't have been easier to handle checking in and out.  Basic apartment but very clean.  Bathroom was bigger than most places I have rented in the city.  Weather couldn't have been worse, but I was still able to easily walk to some great bars and restaurants.  Very safe/friendly neighborhood.  Easy access to train and bus stop."
1912940,28050163,2015-03-16,29033321,Jared,"Artur's place is great. Exactly as advertised, clean, easy to get to from the Green Line, and generally seemed to be in a good area. My schedule was a bit unconventional so we did not meet in person but he made check-in and check-out very simple, which was precisely what I was looking for."
1912940,29061593,2015-04-03,29328133,Oana,Although we haven't met him personaly  Arthur was very nice and gave us all the instructictions we needed. The studio was as described by him and showed in the pictures. It was perfect for our 3 days stay in Boston. The neighborhood is very nice and the T stations are 5 min away.
1912940,30445239,2015-04-22,5434974,Bridget,"Artur did a very good job of communicating early regarding the specifics of the property and whether or not they would work for our visit. He quickly and in a very detailed manner responded to all inquiries. The description on the listing was completely accurate and it was exactly what we were looking for. The property was very convenient to multiple mass transit train lines, as well as easy (and safe) walking to a lot of touristy areas we were planning to visit."
The instructions for arriving,"obtaining entry to the building and leaving upon checkout were clear and very easy.\"",,,,
1912940,30939068,2015-04-29,29997081,Jenna,Arthur was very welcoming and accommodating while in Boston. We thoroughly enjoyed how short the metro ride was into the city. Would go back 100%. Thanks Arthur!
1912940,31339789,2015-05-04,28368046,Jason,Everything was as described in the listing.  The T stop was very close and convenient.  I would stay here again.
1912940,31665532,2015-05-08,30341118,Michael,"I had an easy stay at Artur's place.  He was constantly in communication with me the days leading up to my stay, answering all  my questions about key location, parking, etc..  The space is just as pictured- cozy and functional for one ( I imagine two would work as well ). Artur left the space clean and I had everything I needed for my short stay."
The neighborhood is great. Quiet at night,and bustling during the day. Parking was a little difficult my first night,but when I had to move the car for street cleaning it took literally 3 minutes to find a new spot.,,,
Overall,"I enjoyed my stay and would go back again.\"",,,,
1912940,32786834,2015-05-21,27114903,Anna,"The apartments were as described. Artur was very easy to reach and we didn't have any issues with communication. It was a little humid in the apartments, but I guess it was due to whether. We were in Boston in the middle of May, and it was rainy there. Anyways, great apartments for students and travelers who are in Boston to explore the city."
1912940,34431433,2015-06-08,10859372,Rachel,"Arthur, thanks again for letting us stay at your place! The apartment was exactly as described in your airbnb listing. Your instructions/recommendations were very helpful and well written."
1912940,35242477,2015-06-16,5343277,Sharon,"Flexible appointment scheduling; clean space, comfortable bed.  Close to T and lovely neighborhood.  Basement apartment, however, and can feel damp and musty.  Spotty internet connectivity.  Parking problematic; once you find a space, I would not use the car until you are ready to leave."
1912940,35566358,2015-06-20,13113345,Craig,Arriving was easy as insructions for finding key easy to understand. Bed very comfy. Close to tram to city. Artur was easy to contact and responded quickly.
1912940,36327787,2015-06-27,36013127,Stephanie,"The listing was as described and looks like it does in the pictures. It was clean and had everything we needed (lots of outlets!). Other than the reservation confirmation email, I didn't get another email from Artur until pretty close to our check in date -a few hours before our flight into Boston- and I was getting a little nervous. However, after that, Artur was easy to get a hold of through text and email. I asked to check in early so we could drop off our bags and Artur was very flexible about it and turned the place over to us in the morning! On our last night, the next door neighbors came home late and were pretty loud for a very long time. The walls are thin I guess, and we could hear all the yelling, every conversation, and everything playing on the TV. Not Artur's fault though! The neighborhood felt very safe, even when we got back late one night and had to park farther away on the street and walk back to the apartment. We had a good stay, thanks Artur :)"

There was also a 7/11 nearby. Artur gave clear instructions for entering the apartment and connecting to the wifi. Even though he was not in town during our stay, he was very helpful and responded promptly to questions. I'd recommend his place for anyone looking for an affordable, no-frills place to stay in/near Boston."
1912940,42863092,2015-08-16,24051913,Waru,"It's a good experience for use Airbnb App. Artur is a good host, even we didn't met him, but he always keep contact with us and reply us immediately. This room is clean and we got everything we need, include some foods left from previous tourists, we can cook quickly in simple way. It's a good location connect to downtown, near subway and Boston college. There is a laundry room in the same floor, it costs $1.75 per load. The dryer is costs $0.25 per 8 min. We have a wonderful time here for 3 nights."

He was extremely prompt and clear with communication, and his apartment was exactly as described and pictured: clean, tidy, with fresh towels and linens. It was a pleasure working with and staying at Artur's."
1912940,70556472,2016-04-18,66760214,Mark,1st try at AirBnB and I loved it. My standards for hotel/motel typically start with the bathroom. I was shocked that it was extremely clean and that I had no worries about anything dirty at all. The place is perfect for this kind of stay. I plan to book his place every Boston visit.
1912940,98732294,2016-09-01,81008913,Fengxiang,Great location and also great apartment! Everything is organized! Artur is super awesome!

Place is well situated within close proximity to supermarkets.,,,,,
Kitchen does not have cooking utensils however which is quite bad if you are looking to cook,,,,,
Overall,"a very good and cozy place\"",,,,
11240774,66460306,2016-03-22,59205145,Patrick,"Key exchange was effortless.  Location was great, especially if you have plans in the Fenway / Kenmore area.  The apartment building and the apartment itself seemed new and were in great condition.  The room was very quiet.  Absolutely no complaints, I enjoyed my stay very much"
11240774,67016043,2016-03-26,60041058,E.J.,"The host check-in/out was different from my past experiences because they wanted to meet up to exchange the key to the apartment. I would have preferred that the key was placed somewhere for me to pick up/ drop off. I also had to wait from the scheduled time to check-in with the host because they were at work. Overall, I loved the apartment and how clean and organized the host left the place. Whenever I had a question, the host was quick to respond. Originally, the listing stated it was flexible with check-in/out but was not. I was told by the host that they no longer market the listing as such to avoid false advertisement."
11240774,68179315,2016-04-02,33662460,Chris,The apartment was in perfect condition in a brand new building.    Living conditions were very comfortable.
11240774,72122414,2016-05-01,31049210,Gary,Great apartment in a great location. Check-in and check-out was flexible and easy to follow and amenities were more than sufficient for the stay. Definitely recommend Jared's place.
11240774,76535040,2016-05-28,759599,Kaj,"Jared's apartment was very nice. Clean and comfortable. The gym was a nice extra for me, as I don't normally have an opportunity to exercise on the road. Jared was very communicative and the entry/exit was very simple. I recommend!"
11240774,81289461,2016-06-22,73407825,Dj,Jared was very accommodating to any of our needs over during our stay. His place was clean and close to Fenway Park -  everything we needed.
11240774,82726799,2016-06-29,17251598,Jordan,"Jared's place was beautiful, big, clean, and super convenient for my conference at Hynes as well as exploring the rest of Boston. I would definitely stay again!"
11240774,86966305,2016-07-18,23448082,Elizabeth,"Jared was a great host!  Check-in was very easy, he met us at the apartment with the key as soon as we arrived. He was very easy to contact and checked in with us throughout our stay. The place was just as described and pictured. Location was perfect. Plenty of restaurants, bars, shopping all within walking distant and the area felt very safe. No complaints, would definitely stay again!"
11240774,92704843,2016-08-09,67971865,Maria,"The location was fantastic for us.

Jared was very gracious and accommodating to our needs and responded promptly to all our messages."
57156,224759,2011-04-12,253409,Richard,"The little cottage in Dorchester was absolutely perfect.  The neighborhood was quiet and safe, and the park across the street is lovely.  The house itself is perfect for a couple.  The bed is comfortable, the shower is hot, and the tv works.  Cabs come fairly quick and it costs about $20 to get downtown.  The t stop is about a 5 minute walk away and takes you about 20-30 minutes to get downtown.  I would highly recommend this spot."

57156,14159306,2014-06-13,6461640,Reza,"We spent almost two weeks in this place and it was just a perfect option for a short-term accommodation. It was clean, well-equipped, and close to T-stop (5min walking distance), so just a perfect choice for whoever looks for a temporary place and works in Boston or Cambridge. Bill & Linda were great hosts; They helped us with precisely every question that we had with a lot of precious recommendation on places to visit in Boston. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a private place (for two persons) and needs to get to Boston/Cambridge by public transportation."
57156,15128533,2014-07-03,10922160,Danae,"Bill & Linda were wonderful hosts.  They were very welcoming when we arrived, and even offered to pick us up at the Savin Hill station.  Both offered a lot of great recommendations for places to eat or things to see.  Bill had a walk through Boston to see the main sights worked out, plus a lot of maps.  I really enjoyed the Boston history timeline they gave us too.  They let us know each of their cell numbers if we ever needed assistance or some recommendations!"
The cottage itself was perfect for what we needed.  From the airport,it only took us 15mins to arrive.  The location was quiet and scenic.  The park across the street has some really nice views.  The cabin was very clean,well stocked with basic essentials plus towels,soap,shampoo/conditioner,tea
"Thanks so much!\"",,,,,
57156,16008786,2014-07-20,11175324,Angela,"The cottage was amazing, nice and clean, and the surrounding area wery well kept."

Bill is a great host,"I would recommend him for sure!\"",,,,
57156,16862780,2014-08-03,18360598,Wei,The cottage was very cozy. It's at a convenient yet reclusive location. My favorite part was the dining booth that looks out to the back yard.
57156,17347921,2014-08-11,1976264,Patrick,We had a fantastic time at Bill's and in Boston in general.
Bill was great when we met him,"so interesting and welcoming and the house is so well situated to get into Boston. It had everything you need as a base to explore the great city and you can cook in the place too of you are there a bit longer like we were. Certainly recommend. \"",,,,
57156,34418569,2015-06-08,14063033,Sandra,"Our one week experience at Bills cottage was amazing. The place was just as described; very cozy, and comfy for two. It's also surrounded by other homes so you feel like it's your own neighborhood. Bill was VERY accommodating, available at all times, shared his favorite places to visit in Boston and other places we were traveling to. We would definitely recommend this place to friends and family."
57156,38592837,2015-07-17,27661759,Mini,"we stayed one week in the cottage. We saw Bill once, After 4 days! Linda we never met. they were on a weekendtrip. So we can not say that they were giving tips or were friendly. We could not say goodbye to them, there was no one at home. Not even give the key back by person."
The cottage is very small if you're tall. The bed was to short and to small for my husband and me. We are both tall 1.94 mtr and 1.78 mtr. and normal bodysize. North European lenght.,,,,,
"So the \"\"cosy\"\" kitchencorner was also too small for our legs .",,,,,
There was NO Wlan (as advertised) in the cottage,if I needed information from the internet I had to sit outside on the stairs of their house! I needed internet for online checkin for our flight back,it took me more than one hour because the internet turned off several times.,,,
We thought is was very noisy,The fan in the bathroom is very loud and the waterheater also. 3 big,1 small towel for 2people in 8 days is also to little.,,,
"We would defenitely NOT go back.\"",,,,,
57156,39595650,2015-07-25,16326394,Gwen And Denis,"Bill wasn't here when we arrived but we had no problem to get the keys of the cottage.  We met Bill after a few days and he is very nice, he gave us lots of ideas for things to do and see in the area."
The cottage is really close to the subway so it is very easy to get everywhere in the city. The cottage is exactly like in the pictures,there is everything you need in it.,,,,
"The only major problem we encountered was the size of the bed which is a double and my husband is very tall so it took a few nights to get comfortable but it is definitelty worth staying at Bill's!\"",,,,,
57156,76587623,2016-05-28,61845209,Haukur,"We stayed at Bill's for a week. The cottage was very nice, just as described, perfect for two persons. Bill was a great host, he drove us around the neighbourhood and gave us many tips on what to see, eat and do in Boston. Would definitely recommend."
57156,78697781,2016-06-08,63753102,Bailey,This place is PERFECT!
My wife and I reserved Bill's cottage in early June,and weren't sure what to expect. We really liked the location and the ability to cook in house and save some money while staying in Boston,but we never expected how great the place would be.,,,
When we arrived,Bill greeted us and was exceptionally helpful. He told us good places to visit,places to avoid,and left a bunch of materials on Boston for us to read through. During our stay,Bill never bothered us,but was available at ANY time we needed him. Bill even came out to tell us bye when we left for the airport at 5:45 AM!
The cottage is situated in a very nice,safe neighborhood that is a short walk from the red line,which is the main line in Boston and can get you anywhere. My wife and I spent an entire week in Boston and never needed any other type of transportation.,,,
The ONLY concern you may have staying here is if you don't have a vehicle and are in some way physically impaired,the walk up to Bill's place from the subway is steep and could be potentially difficult for someone with an injury or an elderly person. For us however,it was not difficult and we enjoyed the walk in the cool morning and evenings.,,,
We loved absolutely everything about the cottage and will DEFINITELY be coming back to visit. This is the best value in Boston,guaranteed. We were able to cancel our previous hotel,and stay in Bill's for an entire week for a third of the price as our 3 star hotel.,,,
"Thanks Bill!\"",,,,,

57156,85488618,2016-07-11,30890102,Emilie,"We stayed in the cottage for a week and we really enjoyed it. Bill is very nice, he gave us very helpful tips on Boston and on Cape Cod. The location is perfect, it's in a quiet neighborhood, close to a subway station. Also, if you have a rental car, this place is perfect: you can park your car just in front of the cottage,it is free and secure. We had a wonderful experience!"

12655758,79126102,2016-06-11,58268583,Christopher,The listing was accurate - this location is prime. The green line is less than a 5 minute walk from the apartment. Everything you could need is within walking distance. One thing you may want to check with Jarib about before staying is whether or not he's added any cookware to the apartment. I can't complain considering the price I paid but it would have been nice to know ahead of time to bring supplies of my own. Jarib was great with communication and even checked in to see if we needed anything else and make sure we were enjoying our stay. If you're looking for a cheap place near Boston I would definitely recommend Jarib's apartment in Allston.
12655758,80806740,2016-06-19,33298888,Alexandre,"The booking of this apartment was a good deal. It is very close to the subway, and the infrastructure around is pretty well developed. Jarib  provided me all necessary information to reach the apartment. I felt cold the first night, but he kindly provided me an extra blanket. Also, he was very flexible for the check out. In summary, Jarib is a great host, and I would definitely recommend this appartement!"
12655758,82474797,2016-06-27,38031940,Kevin,"I stayed at Jarib's place while on a weeklong academic business trip to MIT in June 2016. The spot is very well connected: from the Commonwealth / Harvard Ave intersection, the 66 bus goes to Harvard University (with Red Line connection to MIT) and Brookline, while the Green B train goes to BC, BU, and DT Boston. Within a half mile walk I found plenty of cafes, restaurants, bars (the Great Scott is just down the street), and grocery stores. The apartment is actually more spacious than the photos suggest. Jarib provided toiletries and responded in a timely manner to all questions that I asked. The rental is a great value, and overall I had a very pleasant stay."

12655758,89776653,2016-07-30,26662778,Sam,"I stayed here for three nights in the middle of summer. It was very hot, often hotter inside the house than out even with all the windows open. Jarib was helpful and provided a large fan which was helpful in making the place manageable, as there is no A/C. In fact he responded to all questions very promptly by text message and was very nice. The house is very empty and not the cleanest, but for the price it's a deal."

The location of the apartment is great with a supermarket and the T station just right next to it. The bed was not the most comfortable one, but okay for a few nights. It was hot in the apartment, but the fan that Jarib provided helped to cool it down a bit.

Felt like home with New England charm. By chance we were able to meet the lovely owner who greeted us with a warm and enchanting smile. We were in town for a Tufts University graduation and learned that the owner was a Tufts graduate herself. On a scale of 1-10, out experience would rate at 1,000!"

Qualche problema nell'accoglienza iniziale, poi risolto immediatamente. Consigliabile in tutta sincerità a chi cerca un alloggio per molte persone! Abbiamo soggiornato per 16 giorni e tutto è stato piacevole. Molto vicino ad una scuola di inglese (BSML)."
4922204,40303998,2015-07-30,8457372,Sandra,"The house was nice, very clean and orderly.  Note that there are no shades or curtains on the downstairs windows which allows people to see inside the house at  night."
There was construction going on in the basement space when we returned from the city around 5 p.m. On our last night there.  It was very loud and included sawing,hammering,and drilling. Juliet failed to let  us know that this was going to transpire during our stay.  The work continued until we were finally able to get in contact with her around 8:30 p.m.   At that time the work stopped,however,she was unapologetic.,

Er ligt allerlei informatie voor vervoer met de bus, de winkels en restaurants. Omdat het slot met een code werkt maakt het niet uit hoe laat we aankomen, dat kwam goed uit omdat we aardig wat vertraging hadden door de vele files onderweg. Het huis ziet er prima uit, alles is schoon, de keuken is goed uitgerust, de tuin ook erg fijn. Fijn ook dat er airco in het huis was."

4922204,50447963,2015-10-12,39977144,Cheryl,"We were thrilled with Juliet's house in Roslindale. I contacted Juliet in the summer to reserve the entire house for four nights for six members of my family. We were in town for our daughter's wedding. Because the house was so close to the wedding site, we were excited to make the reservation.  Juliet was very patient and encouraging while I worked my way through my first reservation. Thanks"
The house was neat,clean,comfortable,and a kitchen to die for. Every convenience.  There was even a gas fireplace in the sitting room. Cozy.,,
This location has a driveway with off-street parking,which in the Boston area is a premium.  But,if you do not want to drive,the bus stop is only a block up the street.,,

4922204,51128973,2015-10-18,17919821,Janice,We came into town for  weekend to visit family and the priorities for us was location and a decent kitchen because we wanted to shop the wonderful Roslindale Farmers Market and prepare dinner at home.  Juliet's lovely house has a great Roslindale location not far from the village and she provided a binder with useful recommendations for everything from restaurants to transportation.  The house was immaculate and the kitchen was well appointed for our needs.  I was a bit sorry it wasn't warm enough to sit on the back deck or enjoy supper al fresco but dropping temperatures remind me that I am not in Florida anymore and there was a fun gas fireplace to add a little ambiance and sneak in some college football later in the evening. We hope to return there in the future.  Juliet was very responsive to our needs and initially we exchanged emails regarding the reservation but also hd an opportunity to meet her briefly during our stay.

The home was very clean, organized and provided the basic essentials that were needed.  We hope to staying  again during our next visit."

I stayed here with a group of 7 people and everyone was very satisfied with the space. The only thing I wish was different is I didn't receive the front door code until half an hour before the 4pm check-in, which was pretty stressful since I wanted to get things set up before my friends arrived. Everything in the house is labeled and signs are very clear."

8310807,51203113,2015-10-18,45009486,Steve,This was my first experience with Airbnb and didn't quite know what to expect but things went very well.  Jay was very available and easy to connect with.  Room and house were very clean and quiet.  The separate lock on my room was nice.  No issue with bathroom availability in the morning to get ready and Jay provided towels.  Thanks!
8310807,51509402,2015-10-20,2326396,Billy,Very efficient room and space.  Perfect for a nights stay or two.
8310807,57412582,2015-12-25,31822781,Chang,It's a good place to stay. The room is clean and comfortable. Hosts are friendly. It's a happy choice.
8310807,58465873,2016-01-02,17937127,Carl,"Donovans room is exactly as in the pictures, check-in was super easy and nice and the atmosphere in the whole building is very good. I wasn't around very much but everyone there seemed really nice. I have to point out though that the sink in the bathroom next door is very loud but apart from that I had a very pleasant stay !"
8310807,59245276,2016-01-08,52091627,Matthias,Everything was perfectly prepared. There were little notes everywhere that helped you find your way. Everything was clean and  there were two little chocolates on the freshly washed towels that were provided; I felt very welcomed.
8310807,59598844,2016-01-12,52556497,Yifei,"The host is welcoming but this place is very small (but it's stated that it's small, so that's someone to expect)"
8310807,64030761,2016-02-28,57059530,Frantz,The place was pleasant. No problem
8310807,65911473,2016-03-17,18616245,Seokyoung,"It was very pleasing and comfortable staying. The room was organized and everything was prepared; the heater was on, there were 2 small towels and 1 big towel, and everything was very easy to access. I also really liked the distance from Roxbury T station. It was about 3 minutes away from it which is very important. Since Boston isn't that big, Donovan's place is at very good location and has decent price. I definitely recommend this spot!"
8310807,66940678,2016-03-25,30495086,Maxime,Donovan was very helpful and everything was easy and taken care of on my quick stay.
8310807,67249615,2016-03-27,62114302,Max,"I had an excellent time staying at this location. Donovan is very prompt at answering questions or if a problem comes, and all the staff I met were very helpful and friendly. The common areas were very clean and well put together, as well as the rooms. With a subway stop right next door, it was easy to travel all around boston. I would definitely recommend booking a room here!"
8310807,69313189,2016-04-10,41100382,Jay,"Had a nice stay with S.P. at their guest house. They were quick to respond when I had questions and was able to resolve a housekeeping issue quickly when contacted. Location of this home is in very close proximity to the Roxbury Crossing station on the orange line, making it easy to get into the city if needed."
8310807,70353014,2016-04-17,29284966,Zhao,"I booked for my friend. As he said, it is a very nice experience and in a very quiet neighborhood."

8310807,71357879,2016-04-24,68058099,Jonny,"The place was great and clean. I came late in the day and was able to check in without a problem. I was not able to meet anyone, but it was still a great experience. I feel as though the pictures doesn't do its justice, the room is slightly bigger than I expected. I was given fresh towels as well. Very pleasant . Had the option of using the bathroom which I believe was on the first floor while having another one right next to my room on the 2nd floor."
All in all,I would definitely come here again,"or at least another one of S.P. locations. Thanks for the wonderful place.\"",,,
8310807,71791645,2016-04-28,25825076,Alvina,The pictures make the room look small. It was bigger than it looks. Checking in was very easy. Checking out was also very easy.
I was very comfortable for my stay here. There was fresh towels on the desk when I arrivaled. There was two bathrooms so there was no waiting for another person. It is a very quiet neighborhood but it is pretty close to the headquarters for boston police. Sometimes,you can hear sirens but it was not bad at all. The supermarket recommended on the guidebook was very useful.,,,,
"The whole house was very clean. I think they clean it every other day so everything was very clean. \"",,,,,

8310807,75810304,2016-05-23,63618210,Billy,The house was pretty good. It definitely felt clean and safe. The vicinity to the orange line was was also nice -- only a one minute walk away.
I interacted with one person from S.P. Apparently the individual in charge of cleaning out the room I would be staying in had an emergency and couldn't do it,so they sent someone else to take care of it. This was right when I arrived at check-in. He was kind and made conversation,giving me advice about Boston.,,,

8310807,75906884,2016-05-23,73389675,Toni,"I was only there one night, but i walked around in the morning and found cute little parks and shops. I think its an awesome location overall."
8310807,76154807,2016-05-25,69331284,Charlie,"Tidy room it's really not as compacted as I first thought, huge closet and I loved how this room is kinda dis attached from the rest of the home."
8310807,76394000,2016-05-27,24558846,Caijie,Nice neighborhood. Room is just as picture shown. Very clean. Bed sheets and pillows smelt like home. Easy check-in and check-out process. Very easy to approach.

The hosts have gone out of their way to make the place easy to use, including details like the color-coded shower head, keyless entry and wifi. The other people i met who live in the house were helpful and friendly. Highly recommended."

My room was equipped with a window AC, Amazon Fire TV, fan, writing desk and chair, and a towel. Hosts made sure to make me feel welcome and use anything I needed. I forgot my toothbrush and upon asking for a good place to go and buy one, he actually dug through his stuff and gave me a brand new toothbrush. Very nice. I would def use here again and recommend it without reservation"

She had clean towels and even travel size toiletries laid out in the room. The neighborhood seemed safe with things to do, although I didn't spend much time there. Overall a great place to stay. Highly recommend and would stay there again."

4609785,27795959,2015-03-12,12463309,Yik Wei,When we first arrived Anna left the key for us in a lockbox which was convenient. She took time to answer all our questions and emails and is welcoming. The room was large and comfortable. House is clean. Laundry is $2 for washing n $2 drying in the basement. Anna was available on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) when we needed information and direction. Her place is just a short walk around the corner across the street to the bus stop so very near. It is pretty safe at night. We had 2 luggages (20 inch n 24 inch) each when we arrived so it was a little difficult hauling it up the narrow steps to her apartment.  Good place for ppl traveling light. Take a cab if you have many luggages like us. Cost us $27 from Logan Airport. Bus SL4 & SL5 brings us to downtown crossing (walk to Boston Commons) and Bus 1 to Harvard Square.
4609785,27941843,2015-03-15,27792138,Jingyi,"Anna's nice! The location of the apartment is very convenient. If you went outside by bus, there are many bus stops near the apartment.

Anyway, thanks Anna!"

4609785,28649474,2015-03-28,4957292,Irene,Anna was very accommodating with check in and check out. Contacting her was easy and she responded within a day. Getting into the apt was easy too and her directions were spot on. The room is very spacious and clean. My only qualm was the temperature of the room because Anna can't control the temp in her apt. It got really stuffy at night with the heat on but Anna provides a fan and I ended up sleeping with the window open. The neighborhood is quiet so you'll have no problems sleeping. I didn't hang out much nearby but there are some good places to eat like Flour Bakery and Mike's City Diner. There are several bus stops nearby so getting around was very easy. I'd definitely stay at Anna's again if I'm back in Boston.
4609785,28942712,2015-04-01,9397399,Matthias,"Das Bett war frisch bezogen und es gab einen Korb mit frischen Handtüchern. Die Räume sind wirklich grosszügig. Nicht erschrecken, die Strasse vorne ist busy, aber das Schlafzimmer geht zu einem wirklich ruhigen Hinterhof. Die Anbindung an Busse ist gut.Die Busse selber sind ein wenig unberechenbar. Das Viertel bietet eine Menge nette Lokale und Geschäfte und die Architektur ist Klasse. Es lohnt sich, viel zu Fuss zu machen."

Her home is in a fantastic location in the South End and is clean, spacious, and quiet. And the bed... soft and incredibly comfortable. This is an excellent option which I would certainly recommend. Thank you!"

She wasn't around the entire time I was staying at the place, but the interactions I had with her was very positive. The neighbourhood is very cute, and nice to walk around with lots of places to eat. The descriptions are accurate, and the room was very spacious as well."

The place itself is really nice,"lovely \"\"red-brick\"\" historic exterior in a great location; we were able to walk all over the city without using public transport once! This was my first airbnb experience and I can say it was a positive one. Thanks for having us.\"",,,,

The apartment looked just like the photos and was spacious and well-maintained. Her guest bed was also incredibly comfortable! Great location, easy to walk practically anywhere. Would definitely recommend for someone looking to stay close but just outside the hustle and bustle of downtown Boston. Thanks, Anna!"
4609785,66040509,2016-03-19,41508143,Rea,Our stay in Boston was amazing and it was so great returning to this charming South End apartment at the end of a busy day. Thanks Anna for your hospitality.
4609785,66748863,2016-03-24,59848957,Anna,"welcome, accurate, neighborhood"
Prior to our trip I had some trouble getting in touch with Anna. I booked 2 weeks in advance and sent two messages,but only got the check-in information on the day we arrived in Boston. However,that issue went away by the time we arrived. Anna let us drop off our luggage prior to our check-in time,and responded quickly and in a friendly and helpful way for the rest of our stay. We never got to meet her because she was out working. I wished we could have,but we weren't in Boston for too long :),
The outside of the apartment was very cute with red brick,something we never really see in Southern California. On the inside,the apartment was clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was in a convenient and affordable location,but I did feel a bit unsafe walking around after dark. Overall,"we were comfortable here and left very well rested. Thank you! \"",
4609785,67247504,2016-03-27,30741677,Vinie,Anna and her apartment was great! She provided a very detailed guide as to how to get into the apartment and texted us to make sure that we weren't confused. She was very nice and easy to talk to. For the most part she would let us do our own thing. The apartment was comfortable and the bed had the best mattress I've ever slept on.
4609785,68675614,2016-04-06,39049358,Bob And Amy,"Anna's apartment is in a great location with easy transport links to the heart of the city. We had a great stay, the bed was big and comfortable, the shower was hot and the apartment was large and very clean. Communication and check in was a breeze. Thanks!"
8310653,50145594,2015-10-09,12790157,Charlotte,Great location with a short ride on the T to central Boston. Shashank very kindly left his travel card which was very much appreciated
8310653,54741957,2015-11-23,42428493,Nicole,"I did not get the chance to meet Shashank, but his roommate Chenkai was kind enough to let me in as well as provide tips on quickest means of transportation to all the big attractions Boston had to offer. He was very helpful and accommodating with answering any questions I had. The apartment was very spacious, organized, and clean. It was located in a prime location; just a short ride to all the must sees in Boston, but also in a safe and quiet location. I would definitely stay here again!"
8310653,55212634,2015-11-29,5475128,Karen,The room is clean and with all the facilities we need. The location is also very convenient. There is an Asian food court around the corner which really tastes good.
8310653,57257438,2015-12-23,3519192,Oscar,I an going to begin from when I first sought out this place on the site. I had fast responses to all my questions and Shashank was able to work around with me for my arrival.
His roommate,Chenkai,was there to give me the keys to the apt and showed me my room with the guest guide in the room.,,,
Chenkai was very friendly and welcoming and was there to help me out if I needed anything.,,,,,
The room was clean and organized and the whole apt was great too. It really followed the posting to the T. The neighborhood is in a great area where it takes you away from the downtown life but is so close to get to if needed. It is near Boston University so there were plenty of delicious restaurants all in a walking distance. A block or two and you are instantly in an area with tons of restaurants.,,,,,
Transportation is also easy since you just have to walk a black to get to the station.,,,,,
This was my first Airbnb experience and I have to give Shashank and Chenkai an A+ for the effort they put into their home and providing all the necessities to help someone who is not from around Boston feel like home.,,,,,
One more thing,if you had to drive or had a car,they had a parking pass available if needed,"which becomes clutch when you just need to park somewhere and then take the car into the city.\"",,
8310653,58332743,2016-01-02,41968597,Joseph,Shashanks place was nice and as described. I stayed with my girlfriend and we enjoyed meeting his roommate Chenkai as well. He was a gracious and entertaining host.
8310653,64564349,2016-03-05,42063704,Matt,The apartment was great. I only needed it as a place to shower and sleep so I didn't get to use the other amenities like the TV and kitchen to cook. Excellent value for the price I paid. The roommate wasn't there when I was there at least so it was cool to have the place kind of to myself.
8310653,65395855,2016-03-13,60674119,Carly,"I had a great experience staying at this place. It was clean, welcoming, and close to public transportation. I recommend it to others!"
8310653,70119850,2016-04-16,63790254,Sara,"Shashank was a great host. He responded quickly to all my messages and even provided a guest guide with lots of useful information about the area a couple days prior to my visit. The apartment was clean, easy to get to and convenient for my trip to Cambridge. I would recommend Shashank's apartment to anyone visiting the Boston area!"
8310653,70633585,2016-04-19,45904508,Frank,"Shashank was amazing, texting to make sure all was well. The place is in a great location, a short walk from the T. The apartment quiet and spacious. We would go back in a heartbeat. Shashank, you are the greatest."
8310653,73633631,2016-05-09,48314082,Jesica,"Chenkai nos recibió con mucha cordialidad y simpatía. Nos ayudó en lo que necesitábamos. La habitación es muy grande y cómoda y la ubicación es muy conveniente ya que solo estás a 2 cuadras del T que te deja en el centro. La zona tiene movimiento también. Solo recuerden que el baño es compartido, la limpieza no es perfecta."
8310653,76231861,2016-05-25,61482519,Jose,"Se trata de un barrio accesible en tranvía y con comercios en la proximidad de la casa. Shashank dispuso para nosotros información de utilidad (wifi, etc). El apartamento es amplio y nos encontramos muy cómodos en él. Tuvimos la suerte de poder hacer uso de él en exclusiva."

The neighborhood is an absolute win,trendy,chic,but still warm enough to feel like home - bosts some of Boston's best eateries and night-life spots.,,
Brian himself is terrific,greeted us at the door and made sure we were completely set before departing. He left us a list of terrific brunch / dinner suggestions and made sure to check in with us throughout the weekend just to make sure we were enjoying our stay!,,,,
My friend also happened to leave his sunglasses behind after we checked out and Brian was absolutely super about getting them back in a timely fashion,"and took the time to mail them himself - 10/10.\"",,,,
13318173,85097532,2016-07-10,32769096,Jack,Fantastic experience. Great location and great apartment. Brian's mother checked us in and gave us restaurant recommendations. Would definitely visit again.
13318173,86520712,2016-07-16,78865967,Stan,Brian did a great job making us feel welcome.  The place is in a great location and perfect for a stay in Boston with easy access to great food.  Neighborhood is safe and quiet.
13318173,88670884,2016-07-25,66333979,Antonio,"Fantastic South End condo in a prime location, walkable to anything in the South End or Back Bay, and more than one T stop. Balcony / outdoor space is a great plus. The apartment is spacious and very comfortable. Brian was very responsive and available for our check-in time, giving us a brief tour and great advice for things to do around the neighborhood."
13318173,90193055,2016-07-31,3103705,Hannah,"Brian was super helpful and hospitable. His apartment was incredibly clean, and had everything you could possibly want available. Similarly, the location of his apartment is exactly where you want to be when staying in the city. Quiet, but close to downtown and a quick trip to Cambridge, Fenway, Back Bay, etc. there's an AC in the bedroom for hot summer nights and a lovely day bed that looks out onto their patio. All in all it was a really great place to rest our head for a few days."
13318173,95993293,2016-08-21,30940896,Hailey,"Brian's space was classy, private and updated. It's charm, like the antique ceiling light in the living room, was matched by its luxe; the granite countertop and large sliding shower. I also loved utilizing the private back deck with grill!  Brian was so easy to communicate with and to arrange to get the key from. I'm from Boston and highly recommend this gorgeous, spacious and perfectly located Airbnb!"
9107357,53863798,2015-11-13,48610658,Michael,This listing was very accurate--very clean when I arrived with towels and shower items laid out professionally on the bed.
This condo is located in one of the best neighborhoods in the world,literally one block from fine restaurants,coffee shops,pubs,shops,boutiques
Could not have been happier with my stay!,,,,,
"Tip for business travelers who may have a car: park in the Boston Commons garage after you have dropped off your stuff.  It's only 3-4 blocks from this location.\"",,,,,
9107357,54204993,2015-11-16,2465378,Jamie,"Cute, clean,  newly renovated apartment. Spacious for 2 guests. Laundry room right across the hall (literally like 3 steps door to door). Kevin was easy to communicate with and accommodated my check in and check out time  needs. He was also available to answer any questions I had. Great location in the middle of Beacon Hill, making it easy to access the Boston Common side or the other side. Easy walk to the red line T. Lots of cute and good restaurants, boutiques, coffee, market, etc within just a block or 2. Close to tourist attractions such as Cheers, Boston Common, the new state house, etc."
9107357,55464915,2015-12-01,14960914,Christine,"We had a great time. The condo is nice and clean and comfortable. Awesome location. Kevin was a great host, responsive and helpful in all matters."
9107357,56006084,2015-12-07,38392433,Nicholas,"Kevin's apartment was very cute and organized. It provided ample space for my girlfriend and I. Kevin was both responsive and very accommodating, our stay was seamless! The apartment is easily accessible by the red-line, near a bunch of great restaurants that we tried and a short walk (in the opposite direction of the red line) from the Common. We also discovered a Whole Foods within walking distance, since we wanted to cook one night. We felt very comfortable and loved our stay!"
9107357,56167824,2015-12-09,22408341,Raya,"Clean, comfortable, as pictured and easy communication.  Ideal location.  Would return!  Thank you!"

The key exchange and instructions were very simple. The condo was exactly as advertised, and it was a very pleasant stay. The neighborhood of Beacon Hill is also fantastic, with everything I needed within a few blocks of the condo. I would highly recommend it and I would go back myself if the opportunity arises!"
9107357,56888392,2015-12-19,4833932,Timothy,We very much enjoyed our stay at Kevin's apartment on Pinkney St./Beacon Hill.  Check-in was handled by his staff very nicely.
Love the street and neighborhood,and his apt was just as described. A very new and comfortable queen bed/pillows -- so important.  And an excellent large bathroom with very good shower (and excellent quality towels).  kitchen spacious,well laid out and very functional.  Living room nice,but could use some additional comfortable furniture,end tables,and a table/stand for the nice tv  (versus mounted high over the fireplace).
All in all,a wonderful and well located apartment in a beautiful little building and neighborhood,with excellent shops,markets and subway all very close by.  We would definitely stay there again on another trip to Boston.  thanks Kevin,"\"",
9107357,57394388,2015-12-25,50686899,Ryan,"Nice condo in a great location, and the caretakers were responsive and helpful. The wifi cut out a lot, which was frustrating because my phone couldn't get service inside the building."
9107357,58342369,2016-01-02,3720947,Terry,Kevin's place was wonderful. It's even more spacious than I had anticipated and in a fantastic location in the heart of one of the nicest neighborhoods in all of Boston. Very easy check-in process and very responsive host.
9107357,59077976,2016-01-06,21713466,Fiona,"Kevin's place was exactly as described and seen on his listing. The place was absolutely beautiful and very spacious! The location of the apartment seemed very safe and is walking distance to most things in Boston (cafes,restaurants,subway,Boston Common&the Freedom Trail). The check in service was run by airbnb caretakers. They were very responsive & punctual when handing over the keys. I would recommend staying at Kevin's in Boston, you will not be disappointed!"
9107357,61760741,2016-02-08,50696498,Ted,"This is a great way experience Boston. First time I strolled up the street, it felt like I was in a Dickens novel -- brick sidewalks, gaslamps, narrow winding streets, you name it. The apartment is comfy and had everything I needed for a full month-long stay -- coffee, plates, cutlery, paper towels, cable TV, wifi, big closets, etc. I can't imagine a better location, either. (I also found the apartment felt bigger than it looked in the photos online.) You're about 50 paces off Charles Street, where there are all manner of restaurants, cafes, shops, markets, hardware, you name it. It's less than 5 minutes stroll to the Commons, 10 minutes to the shopping district (Boylston & Newbury St), t a problem. Communication with Kevin was great and everything went smoothly for my stay. I would come back again."
9107357,62753567,2016-02-16,23253830,Kate,"Kevin's condo was very nice! It seemed new and felt clean. It also came with everything you might need, including towels, extra bedding/blankets, shampoo/conditioner/soap/lotion, candles, lighter, bottle opener, pots, dishes, dish soap, rice cooker, Kuerig coffee machine and K-cups, Splenda, French press for coffee, and some various cleaning products. Arranging the key exchange with the company that Kevin uses was very easy. The location was also PERFECT for us- right in Beacon Hill by Charles River. It is a short walk to the Charles River Esplanade/Park and a short walk to Charles Street, which has many shops and restaurants. You are also about a 10 minute walk from Boston Commons and Public Garden. It is walking distance to Back Bay as well. Short drive to downtown and Cambridge. The condo is very private and the neighborhood is quiet. Great for an individual or couple. My only complaint with the condo is that is was very cold and the heat didn't seem to be on the whole weekend. However, it should be noted that we visited on a VERY, and I believe (abnormally), cold weekend. The condo has a working fireplace which was very nice and essential to keeping warm during our visit. We bought a starter log at Whole Foods. If the condo had been warmer, I would give Kevin 5 stars and rate the experience as perfect. However, it was just too cold. Overall, the condo was very nice and I would definitely return for another visit."
9107357,63277928,2016-02-21,13389173,Lori,My husband and I went to Boston for the weekend. We absolutely loved the location of the apartment in the quaint town of Beacon Hill. The apartment was the perfect size for two people. It was tidy and comfortable. The pictures showcase the apartment perfectly.
Kevin was a great communicator and easy to work with. Kevin left a great list of instructions for the apartment and  suggestions for restaurants/shopping and attractions in Boston.,,,,,
Something that is out of Kevin's hands however I wanted to make guests aware of was the radiator. It was loud and at times made it difficult to sleep. This wouldn't be a problem in spring and summer.,,,,,
I would highly recommend this apartment for any guest.,,,,,

9107357,63956147,2016-02-28,27691119,Ashleigh,"I really enjoyed staying at Kevin's place in Beacon Hill. The apartment was very clean and Kevin provided plenty of towels, toiletries, and coffee for my week-long stay. The location was great - an easy walk to pretty much anywhere in Boston. And the check-in/check-out process with the management company he uses was super easy. Would love to stay there again!"
9107357,65041890,2016-03-10,57869513,Ren,I felt Kevin did everything he could to accommodate our stay and he responded to all questions and concerns almost immediately and details that proved most helpful

9107357,66179841,2016-03-20,32259636,Barry,Beautiful apartment in a really great location. The use of Airbnb caretakers makes things vary easy too. Spotless clean apartment with great wifi and everything you need for your stay. Would highly recommend and will definitely try stay here again when next in Boston.
9107357,67172832,2016-03-27,12882284,Jen,"As a former Bostonian back for a week, I wanted the full Beacon Hill experience, and this apartment 100% delivered on that wish. Gorgeous location (not on the hill!) near great food and shops, only a few blocks from Charles Street and the Commons. I walked nearly everywhere most days - South Station, Convention Center, Back Bay, etc. - and felt very safe throughout. Apartment was spacious and well furnished, including the bathroom and kitchen, and Mike from BnB Caretakers was right on time for my check in/key exchange."
Cell reception and wifi weren't very strong,but that was not surprising for a basement apartment. I did hear noise from the radiator (or something else) in the bedroom,as well as general noise from the basement door and hallway. This did not affect my sleep or stay,but might be tough for light sleepers.,,
Overall,this was a great home base for the week,"and I will look for this apartment again the next time I'm in Boston!\"",,,

9107357,68405845,2016-04-04,3904228,Carole,We truly enjoyed this location and its proximity to the high street and metro system. It's in the heart of Beacon Hill and the old world charm of the brownstone.
9107357,68884997,2016-04-07,47233236,Julia,"We were welcomed by a key pick up service. Everything worked out fine, but he was very brief. The apartement was clean. The kitchen is well furnished as is the rest of the apartement. However it was quite loud at night (no idea what those noises were) and due to the snow not very warm."

9107357,69445480,2016-04-11,29070226,Tracy,"Had an excellent experience at Kevin's place.  The location could not be better - in historic Beacon Hill, close to just about everything and only two blocks from the red line.  The apartment is clean, very spacious, comfortable and I really appreciated having a coffee maker and supplies.  The WiFi is a little slow, but other than that, I would not change anything."
9107357,70048723,2016-04-15,55908663,Jenni,"The apartment was fantastic - in excellent state of order and cleanliness, and in a really beautiful and convenient part of Boston for exploring.

This is a great location for any stay in Boston, as the metro stop is a 5-10 minute walk and the trains are frequent. We would definitely stay here again!"
9107357,71770426,2016-04-28,56823204,Clive,"The appt  description was totally accurate and as stated before its bigger than it looks in photos. It's very clean and all equipment of high standard, everything thought of. Unlike as stated before it was very hot in the appt.and no thermostat or means of controlling heating( I wouldn't want the fuel bills) It was so convenient for everything and only discovered the park by the river just at the end of Pinckney St on our last day. We enjoyed the Paramount on Charles St for breakfast/ brunch. The King and I Thai restaurant on Charles St was really good and portions large. ( don't need starters)"
A wonderful place to stay in Boston,so convenient for everything even a night out at Fenway Park to see the Redsox,a good experience.,,,
Key exchange was easy but the actual door is down steps on Brimmer Street which confused us a little.,,,,,
The only negative was the heating noise which could disrupt your sleep in the early mornings.,,,,,

The only negative would be the clanging at night from the radiator (but this is not the owners fault). Would be fine in warmer weather. Apart from that,was perfect!,,,,
"Highly recommend!!\"",,,,,

The noises from the heater were there at night but we felt were part of the \"\"city\"\" feel of the apartment. The recommendations Kevin had for local fare were great as well.

Kevin utilized a professional management service that provided us with all we needed for simple check-in.  It was a hassle-free experience,and has opened us up to participate in the sharing economy more and more.,,,,
One money saving tip: we arrived in Boston by car,and needed to find a place to park it.  The neighborhood is permitted for resident parking only,so we had to use a storage garage that is only a block away.  The cost was steep at $42 per day.  However,I was notified by the attendant that if you reserve parking beforehand,you will save 50%.,

It's almost embarrassing to post this publicly but I/we hadn't rented on Airbnb since early  2012 when things were a bit different on the site. I'll spare the detail but basically I *thought* I had booked another place for our stay a month prior until the day before flying to Boston when I didn't hear back from host. So literally the night before at midnight I was frantically searching. I was surprised his place wasn't booked on a holiday weekend (it had a last minute cancellation so it originally was) based on price and location alone) and he wrote me an hour, after midnight and we went back and forth till 2ish, the day of, about arrival details. And he even offered for us to check in early based on our flight without even asking. Amazing! He had an agent from his hosting service meet us there with the key, super easy. The place was exactly as described, probably better. Has all the character of Beacon hill but the modern amenities that make living easy. Awesome location- one block off of Charles Street, and a short walk to MGH T stop. We walked everywhere, even to Cambridge. Believe me, we have lived in Boston, this place has prime real estate. It was also very quiet at night and extremely clean- and my husband says I am picky. Kevin, you made a nice weekend getaway possible for my husband and I, literally hours before arriving. Thank you. Will book again, hopefully soon! :)"

9107357,80023400,2016-06-15,51186112,Christine,Apartment was great. Location was even better than we thought. Everything we needed was supplied - maybe an extra set of towels when staying for a week or more would be good. Getting keys was well co-ordinated with no issues
9107357,80960470,2016-06-20,23047531,David,There was someone to greet us with the keys in a very timely manner.
"Explained to us everything we needed to know about the unit as well\"",,,,,

For those who are very sensitive to noise, you may find the road noise at night to be a nuisance as well as the foot traffic in and out of the neighboring apartments, but overall this apartment was perfect for our needs."
9107357,83195020,2016-07-01,68917099,Meagan,"This apartment was fantastic!!! The location is amazing!!!! Easily can walk all around town and enjoy the beauty of Boston. The apartment was very clean, comfortable and spacious and check in was easy. Would highly recommend this place to anyone!!"
9107357,84287452,2016-07-06,29118801,Gerardo,"Getting into the apartment was a breeze, keys were delivered on time by a profesional company who welcomed me into the apartment. The apartment is in great shape as seen at the pictures. The neighborhood is beautiful and has a walking score of 100. I never got to meet with the owner/host, nor was necessary since everything worked perfectly. I would happily stay here again."
9107357,85716122,2016-07-12,66185194,Bill,Everything well very well on our FIRST experience with an Airbnb (URL HIDDEN) up and greeting went very well as predicted. Loved the welcome conciergce ... on time and helpful.
Location was perfect for us as we love the Beacon Hill location next to Charles St. Went two night to Italian restaurant a short block away,"Artu. Apartment was as advertised and all went perfect. Thanks Kevin. Would rent there again.\"",,,,
9107357,86848308,2016-07-17,72888897,Molly,"This was a great location! We loved how safe the area was, and it was easily walkable to so many sites."
Additionally,Kevin and the team were very responsive to our questions and needs!,,,,
The only issue we had was that when we checked in,the dishwasher had not been run and had some dirty dishes. Additionally,the wooden floors could have used a good scrub which we did so that our baby could crawl around without getting her knees dirty.,,,
Overall,"this met our needs and was a great value in Beacon Hill. I would stay again!\"",,,,
9107357,87672358,2016-07-21,3690392,Amie,"Kevin's condo was HUGE and in the best location! It had all the amenities and was in walking distance to so many bars and restaurants. Parking was easy in the nearby garage, and it was close to public transit. I loved staying in a neighborhood in the city, and the key exchange was easy. Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
9107357,88059552,2016-07-23,303090,Zach,"Great location and a comfortable, well-appointed place. The neighborhood is super quiet for relaxing but centrally located for anything you need in Boston. Lots to eat and do closeby. Whole Foods is a 5 min walk as is the T train station. This is definitely an apartment only used for AirBnB. It's comfortable but sparse."
9107357,89861005,2016-07-30,80804701,Abby,"The rental is in a great spot right in Beacon Hill, close to the T and the commons, a Starbucks, a CVS, and several restaurants. The unit itself is well accommodated and roomy for something in this area. There was a working AC unit provided but it did stay a little warm in the apartment - if you're renting in the hot parts of summer, keep in mind it's not going to get ice cold in this unit.  Also - there's a Keurig but you need to bring your own coffee (or walk to Starbucks)."
Kevin was very quick to respond to all requests and the keys were delivered exactly on time.,,,,,
"If you're looking for a reasonably priced place to stay and don't require the regular attentions of a hotel - this place is great!\"",,,,,
9107357,91405865,2016-08-05,84232017,Carlo,"The apartment is exactly as depicted and it's located in a fantastic neighbourhood.  It's spacious and well-outfitted with necessities. Boston and Cambridge are easily accessible (via walking or public transportation) from the apartment.  The key exchange and communication throughout the entire booking process was excellent. Helpful local information is also provided (city/tour books, pamphlets) inside the apartment."
9107357,92195491,2016-08-07,87347393,Lindsay,Nice neighborhood
9107357,92884423,2016-08-10,47338681,Trevor,"This is my first AirBnB experience. I have to say that it could not have been better. Kevin was professional and the space was clean and comfortable. Not only that, but it is in the perfect location for all the best parts of Boston. I cannot recommend this place enough. If you want a great, quiet, private space in a great neighborhood, with a phenomenal host...this is it."
